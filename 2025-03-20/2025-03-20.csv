'You can smell the stench': Why rubbish is piling up on Birmingham streets

Andy Giddings and Trystan Jones

It's been nine days since all-out strike action started in Birmingham, but some residents say their waste hasn't been collected for much longer.

There are fears for public health as piled-up rubbish bags attract rats, with West Midlands MP Wendy Morton telling the House of Commons the ""squeaky blinders"" are not welcome in her constituency.

Here's how it looks today.

Birmingham residents aren't the only ones who've had to put up with bin strikes in recent years.

The Unite union was also in dispute with Coventry City Council over pay and staged six months of strike action in 2022.

That ended with workers accepting a pay rise for the drivers worth up to 12.9%, but the row between union and council reignited in 2023 over a decision to fire and rehire bin workers.

Student Milan Karki, who lives in Balsall Heath, has told me he feels let down by the city.

Originally from Nepal, he came to study at Birmingham City University and thought living conditions would be more ""civilised"".

I caught up with him on Ladypool Road and he explained he's worried the piled-up rubbish could lead to health problems.

""Where people live, it
should be clean,"" he says.

He thinks the council should survey residents affected by the strike and fulfil their demands.

""I feel like I need to change this area. This area is not good to live,"" he says.

Concerns have been raised in Parliament that ""rats the
size of cats"" are spreading across the West Midlands as a consequence of Birmingham's bin strike.

Wendy Morton, Conservative MP for Alridge-Brownhills, highlighted her fears in the House of Commons and said the ""squeaky blinders"" were not welcome in her constituency.

""Particularly in the communities that border Birmingham,
alarmingly we're hearing of rats the size of cats in Britain's second city,"" she said.

""Let's be quite certain, the squeaky blinders are definitely
not welcome in Aldridge-Brownhills.""

Kath StancyzszynBBC Radio WM

Since the start of the strike action there has been a ""small increase"" in the number of rubbish fires, West Midlands Fire Service has said.

Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told BBC Radio WM: ""Our biggest concern at the minute is where we see a build-up of rubbish outside anybody's property.""

She said she was worried a big rubbish fire outside someone's home could have ""devastating"" consequences.

Ms McSweeney said it was not possible to conclusively link the increase in rubbish fires to the strike action and rubbish being left in the street.

But she urged people not to burn their rubbish and to safely dispose of items like lithium batteries in recycling banks if possible.

Matthew Howes is based in Balsall Heath and got in touch to tell us he saw rubbish
being ripped open by foxes earlier today. 

""It's difficult to enjoy the current warm weather because of
the stench of the rubbish hanging over the whole area,"" he says.

He worries children in a nearby playground will be bitten by rats, but says he does not blame the refuse collectors. 

""It is a tough dirty job and they work outside in all weathers,"" he says.

""I blame successive austerity measures, which have been in place since the financial crisis.""

Waste is piling up on the streets of Birmingham amid an ongoing bin collection strike. 

Refuse collectors had been striking on and off since January, but the dispute escalated into an all-out strike on 11 March. Here's a recap of what's been going on:

'Crisis point'

That's how the situation is being described by local MP Preet Gill. She fears a ""public health emergency"" and says residents report it's ""driving a plague of rats and cockroaches"". The owner of a pest control business told the BBC ""there are rats in front gardens, back, and gaining access"".See our picture round-up to get a sense of how it's looking on the ground.

'Like binmageddon' 

Yesterday, the rare sighting of a bin lorry led to so many people turning up desperate to offload their rubbish that a local councillor called the police. The BBC's Katie Thompson was at the scene, and said people were rushing down the streets or arriving in cars. She described it as ""like some sort of binmageddon"" - read her report here. 

Mixed picture 

Our reporters suggest the picture is mixed across the city, with some areas not seeing the large piles of rubbish that have been observed in the worst-affected areas. The BBC's Josh Sandiford reports another mobile collection today was much calmer, but there appeared to be private security present. 

No end in sight 

So far, there's no sign either the council or the Unite union are budging. Unite has said its members face large pay cuts and insists the council can afford to pay them. The council has said it needs to get a grip of its finances and can't afford the Unite demands. See our brief explainer of the dispute here.

Dan O'Brien, 27, lives in central Birmingham and says he saw
four dead rats on his morning walk earlier today.

""For hundreds of residents in our apartments, the rubbish is
overflowing,"" he says. ""As someone whose work takes them across
the city, the sights are absolutely shocking.

""Large rats, some dead from being
hit by cars, are now common on my walk to work. It's just everywhere.""

Dan has resorted to using a
private firm to dispose of his recycling, which hadn't been collected since
December. He says the effort involved is ""maddening"".

""It's such a terrible situation,"" he says. ""I empathise with
worker's rights, but day-to-day life is tremendously difficult. This is
something else we don't need.""

He wonders whether ""the public health
hazard in Birmingham"" is a sign of things to come?

Despite the widespread mess, scenes of bin bags piled high in many parts of Birmingham are ""unrecognisable"" to residents in other parts of the city.

Some people living in Cotteridge and Bournville say that while recycling has been ignored, waste has been collected on schedule every week.

If you're one of those lucky to have rubbish-free streets in Birmingham, we'd love to hear from you as well.

Josh SandifordBBC News, West Midlands

Javed Haider has been speaking to us in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham.

He says he's seen rats around the bin bags on the streets and believes they have become a ""health hazard"".

Haider says there is a problem with fly-tipping too and adds: ""There's spots where people just come of their cars, dump it and they go away.""

He urges both sides in the dispute to ""try to sort something out"".

Elizabeth GlinkaPolitical editor, BBC Midlands

The ongoing row between the Labour-run authority and the
Unite union is uncomfortable for all involved, not least the residents of
Birmingham, but for Labour it is also a political tightrope. 

A succession of MPs and councillors will tell you the
council has made a fair offer, and that both sides need to get around the table
and find a solution, but that's easier said than done.

In recent years, the all-out bin strike by Unite staff in
Labour-run Coventry became deeply acrimonious after talks repeatedly failed, and eventually the authority moved to a policy of ""fire and re-hire"".

I'm told Labour in Birmingham wants to avoid that - indeed it is something the Labour
government wants to restrict in its Employment Rights Bill, which was introduced
last autumn.

While some politicians outside the second city may seem to
want to keep a public distance from this dispute, make no mistake that behind
the scenes, senior Labour figures in government and elsewhere are reaching out
to Unite in an effort to end this action as soon as possible.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has weighed in, using the rubbish piling up on Birmingham's streets as an attack line ahead of the local elections in May.

""If you vote Labour, you get trash,"" she says, in a broadside at the Labour-run council. 

It's a repeat of a line she used at Prime Minister's Questions the week before - responding to that and other criticisms, Keir Starmer addressed wider national issues, saying his party was fixing the ""mess"" left by the Conservatives. 

Onay Kasab, Unite's national lead officer, has been asked how this strike can be resolved.

He says there first needs to be clarity over the numbers of people affected and the amount of money they stand to lose - something the two sides have so far failed to agree on.

He also says it's ""absolutely key"" to have clarity over the impact the union's pay claim would have on equal pay at the council.

The council leader, John Cotton, has said making pay concessions to the largely male bin collecting workforce could lead to further equal pay claims for women, which it cannot afford.

He said the need to restructure pay across the council was behind the changes to the bin workers' pay.

But Kasab says: ""The council are throwing out the argument about equal pay every two minutes implying that no resolution can be reached as a result. I don't accept that.""

He says he wants to see the legal arguments to back this claim up.

Even before this latest strike action began, Birmingham was struggling to keep up with its bin collections.

The city council had a target of no more than 90 missed collections per 100,000, but new figures show that in the third quarter of 2024-2025 it was missing 356 per 100,000.

That was 31% higher than the previous quarter and more than double the figure from the previous year.

The numbers appear in a council cabinet report which also reveals incidents of fly-tipping were up and the number of those cleared within a week was down.

Rachael LewisBBC Radio WM, reporting from Birmingham

Stephen Message from Hockley tells us he's ""angry and depressed"" by the bin strike.

There are bin bags in his street stacked six feet high, right up to the top of a hedge.

""It's just everywhere,"" he says.

He's worried about the smell that will be created now that we're getting some warmer weather. ""Why would you come to Birmingham now with this dispute on,"" he adds.

Message is also very unhappy with Birmingham City Council.

He asks: ""Why has the council left it to this point to not end the dispute?""

As we've been reporting, the bin strike has led to large piles of rubbish building up in some Birmingham streets. 

In one case, the rare sight of a collection lorry caused such a stir that the police were called. 

Here's a few images of the scene over the past few days: 

Birmingham MP Preet Gill said she feared a ""public health emergency""

As the rubbish continues to pile up, people are becoming increasingly worried about pests and vermin.

Labour MP for Edgbaston Preet Gill has written to Birmingham City Council with her concerns, saying she now fears a ""public health emergency"".

She says the bin bags are obstructing pavements, adding: ""Residents are reporting that the waste is driving a plague of rats and cockroaches.""

With the warmer weather approaching, she fears the situation could get worse.

The issue was also raised during Prime Minister's Questions last week, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch attacking Labour, saying rubbish was ""piling up"" on the city's streets.

As rubbish piles up in the streets, Birmingham City Council and the Unite union are insisting they won't budge in their positions. 

An indefinite all-out strike began on 11 March, but refuse collectors had been striking on and off since January. So what's it all about?

What the union says

How about the council?



Birmingham City Council has been operating what it calls Mobile Household Waste Centres for a couple of years now.

Normally, the bin lorries are a way for people to get rid of their extra household waste or bulky items and there are two of them, which get around 10 locations in the city every week.

Every day they arrive at 07:30 GMT and leave at 13:00, and there is no need to book, pay or bring ID.

People have also been told they can visit the pick-up points as many times as they want, but while the strike is on, the city council has said it can not accept waste from people in vans who want to get rid of large quantities of waste.

Residents can check on the council website, external to learn where the collection service is due to visit.

The council has also said it sends staff out with the lorries.

Josh SandifordBBC Radio WM, reporting from Birmingham

I've been speaking to some of the people dropping off their rubbish at a mobile collection service in Bordesley Green this morning.

Mushtaq Hussain tells me it suits him because he is on an afternoon shift today. He says it's fine for ""us youngsters"" who could drive, but he worried about more elderly people who could not.

He also says there's a problem with people dumping waste in the streets.

""When you see one bag left somewhere someone else comes along and dumps rubbish,"" he explains. 

Asim Iqbal says there was ""mess and smells everywhere"".

He says there were seven people living in his house so they were producing a lot of waste and would normally have to visit the recycling centres to take it away.

The meeting came after the European Union announced Wednesday a new drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying defense equipment in Europe rather than from suppliers across the Atlantic.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin's key peace demand that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine is quietly being ignored by the European Union.

As U.S.-led talks with Russia and Ukraine progress, without the Europeans at the table, the 27-nation bloc is pressing ahead with a steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at building the Ukrainian armed forces, and the country's defense industry, into an even more formidable opponent.

At an EU summit on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that it's “central” that Ukraine should remain an independent democratic nation that can continue its journey toward EU membership and “that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.”

“For us, it will be important to continue to support Ukraine significantly — as the European Union as a whole, as allies and friends and as individual countries,” Scholz told reporters in Brussels.

A few hours after he spoke, Scholz's EU counterparts — with the exception of Hungary, which opposes the bloc's “peace through strength” stance — called on member countries “to urgently step up efforts to address Ukraine's pressing military and defence needs.”

Mindful of Russian deception in the past — the “little green men ” who annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, or the troop buildup in 2021 that Moscow denied would lead to any invasion — the Europeans are deeply skeptical about Putin's intentions and whether he would accept any peace terms.




With the U.K. and other partners, some European countries are working on a deterrence force to police any future peace. At the same time, Ukraine's best security guarantee, apart from the NATO membership that the U.S. refuses, is that its own army is strong and well supplied.

In a defense blueprint unveiled on Wednesday, the European Commission set out how it plans to meet Ukraine's security needs, with EU money available to help bolster its defense industry, which produces arms and ammunition more cheaply and closer to the battlefield.

“Ukraine is currently the front line of European defense, resisting a war of aggression driven by the single greatest threat to our common security,” the document says. “The outcome of that war will be a determinative factor in our collective future for decades ahead.”

At the heart of the EU's strategy is a commitment to provide air defense systems and missiles — including long-range precision warheads. In groups, countries would jointly purchase the equipment and financially back Ukraine's own effort to obtain them.

Drones are a major advantage on the battlefield, and the EU intends to back Ukraine's procurement of them and help it build its own production capacity, including through joint ventures between European and Ukrainian industries.

Another aim is to provide at least 2 million rounds of large-caliber artillery shells each year, and to continue a training effort that has helped to prepare more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops so far. In return, European troops will learn from Ukraine's front-line experience.

Ukraine would also be able to take part in the EU's space program, with access to the services provided by national governments in the area of global positioning, navigation, surveillance and communications.

Financially, and beyond the estimated 138 billion euros ($150 billion) already provided to Ukraine, the government in Kyiv would be able to secure cheap loans for defense purposes — as can EU countries and Norway — from a new fund worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion).

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Senior military officers from countries across Europe and beyond will meet Thursday outside London to flesh out plans for an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine as details of a partial ceasefire are worked out.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the “coalition of the willing” plan, led by Britain and France, is moving into an “operational phase.” But it's unclear how many countries are willing to send troops, or whether there will be any ceasefire to protect.

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

The tentative deal to partially rein in the three-year war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump's push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war.

AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a limited ceasefire, but there's work ahead to put it in place.

Negotiators from Moscow and the U.S. will meet Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Sergei Ushakov told Russian news agencies. 




Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. 

Ukraine said Russia had launched 171 long-range drones and it shot down 75 while another 63 decoy drones disappeared from radar after likely being jammed. Russia said it destroyed 132 Ukrainian drones in six Russian regions and the annexed Crimea. 

Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, faced its biggest attack of the war as about four dozen drones injured 14 people, including a couple with serious burns, and damaged houses and apartments. 

“In a cruel twist, enemy drones hit Myru Street (‘Peace Street' in English),” Andrii Raikovych, head of the regional administration, said.

In this photo distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Thursday, March 20, 2025, a Russian “Grad” self-propelled multiple rocket launcher fires towards Ukrainian positions in Ukraine. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)



More than 50 drones were intercepted in Russia's Saratov region — the largest attack of its kind in the area — shattering windows in a hospital and damaging two kindergartens, a school and about 30 homes, Gov. Roman Busargin said. The attacks were focused on Engels, an industrial city near Russia's main base for nuclear-capable strategic bombers. 

The U.K. Defense Ministry estimated that 900,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. That's a jump of 200,000 from its estimate in the fall after it said Russian forces suffered heavy losses in October.

Defense intelligence said up to 250,000 Russian soldiers had been killed.

Western estimates of the parties' war losses have varied and couldn't be independently verified.

War losses have been a tightly guarded secret in Russia. The Defense Ministry's most recent figures were from 2023 when it reported 6,000 deaths, which was regarded as unreliable.

The U.K. did not release a similar estimate for Ukrainian casualties.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News last month that more than 46,000 soldiers had been killed, and more than 350,000 wounded. Those figures couldn't be independently confirmed and could be an undercount.

If peace comes to Ukraine, the number of troops that would help enforce it is vague. Officials have cited figures of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops. 

Only Britain and France have said they are willing to send troops, though countries including Australia, Canada, France and Finland say they are open to being involved in some way.

“This is more than just a focus on troops. We're talking about protection in air, at sea, and all the operational planning that is needed,” Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said. “What one country can contribute will be different to other countries.”

Around 30 leaders were involved in a video meeting on Saturday including Macron, Zelenskyy, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand and officials from NATO and the European Union.

Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil. And Trump has given no sign the U.S. will guarantee reserve firepower in case of any breaches of a truce. Starmer says the plan won't work without that U.S. “backstop.”

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, left and center, Pavel Bednyakov, right)



In addition to the meeting in England, EU leaders in Brussels planned to discuss Ukraine's security needs with Zelenskyy during a meeting about ramping up defense spending after the Trump administration signaled Europe must take care of its own security. 

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it's “central” that Ukraine must remain an independent democratic nation, that it can continue its journey toward EU membership and “that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.” 

The German parliament's budget committee is expected to decide Friday to clear up to 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in extra funding for German military aid to Ukraine this year. That comes after parliament voted to loosen Germany's debt rules for military and security spending.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal.

“Europe has engaged in militarization and has turned into a party of war,” Peskov said.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish authorities detained 37 people for sharing “provocative” content on social media, the interior minister said Thursday, pressing ahead with a crackdown on dissenting voices that escalated with the arrest of the mayor of Istanbul, a potential challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested after a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.

The detention of a popular opposition leader and key Erdogan rival deepened concerns over democracy and sparked protests in Istanbul and elsewhere, despite a four-day ban on demonstrations in the city and road closures. On Thursday, university students in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, held peaceful demonstrations to protest the detention. 

It also caused a shockwave in the financial market, triggering temporary halts in trading on Wednesday to prevent panic selling.




Critics see the crackdown as an effort by Erdogan to extend his more then two-decade rule following significant losses by the ruling party in local elections last year. Government officials reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that the courts operate independently.

Omer Celik, the spokesman of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, disputed allegations by the opposition that the detentions were government-orchestrated and urged respect for the judicial process.

“What a politician should do is to follow the judicial process,” Celik told journalists. “None of us have any information about the content of the (criminal) file.”

He also rejected accusation leveled by the CHP that the mayor's arrest amounted to a “coup” saying, “The name of our party, our president can only be associated with democracy — on the opposite side of a coup.”

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said authorities identified 261 social media accounts that shared provocative posts — related to the mayor's detention — that allegedly incited public hatred or crime, including 62 that are run by people based abroad. At least 37 of the suspected owners were detained and efforts to detain other suspects were continuing, he wrote on the X social media platform. 

Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary scheduled for Sunday. The party's leader has said the primary will go ahead as planned.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern over the mayor's detention, saying it was a “very, very bad sign” for Turkey's relations with the European Union.

Scholz said it was “depressing for democracy in Turkey, but certainly also depressing for the relationship between Europe and Turkey.”

“We can only call for this to end immediately and for opposition and government to stand in competition with each other, and not the opposition being brought to court,” he said.

Prosecutors accused Imamoglu of exploiting his position for financial gain, including the improper allocation of government contracts. 

In a separate investigation, prosecutors also accuse Imamoglu of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with Kurdish groups for the Istanbul municipal elections. The PKK, behind a decades-long insurgency in Turkey, is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.

It was not clear when authorities would begin questioning the mayor, who can be detained without charges for up to four days. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a “trustee mayor” if he is formally charged with links to the PKK.

Before his detention, Imamoglu already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He is also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.

This week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its business faculty, a decision Imamoglu said he would challenge. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to local health officials. Hours later, Hamas fired three rockets at Israel without causing casualties, in the first such attack since Israel ended their ceasefire with a surprise bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday.

The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate an area in central Gaza near Khan Younis, saying it would operate there in response to rocket fire from Hamas.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war. It warned residents against using the main highway to enter or leave the north and said only passage to the south would be allowed on the coastal road.

It also announced an additional ground operation in northern Gaza near the already largely destroyed town of Beit Lahiya, where strikes have killed dozens over the past 24 hours.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January. Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages.

Israel blamed the renewed fighting on Hamas because the militant group rejected a new proposal that departed from their signed agreement. The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has voiced full support for Israel. 




More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday alone, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The military said three rockets were fired out of Gaza on Thursday, with one intercepted and two falling in open areas. Hamas claimed the attack and said it had targeted Tel Aviv.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to three hospitals.

Earlier, the military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels overnight before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week.

One of the strikes on Gaza early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family's home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.

“Another tough night,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. “The house collapsed over the people's heads.”

The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of militant targets across Gaza.

On Wednesday, Israeli ground troops advanced in Gaza for the first time since the ceasefire took hold in January, seizing part of a corridor separating the northern third of the territory from the south. The announcement about passage to the south indicated troops will soon retake full control over what is known as the Netzarim corridor, stretching from the border to the Mediterranean Sea.

Israel, which has also cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 35 of whom are believed dead — and gives up control of the territory.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement they reached in January after more than a year of mediation by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. 

Hamas, which does not accept Israel's existence, says it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the overnight strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. Zaher al-Waheidi, the official in charge of records for the ministry, said a total of 592 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Tuesday.

The Indonesian Hospital said it received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near the border.

“It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,” said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble from homes that were hit. “The situation is catastrophic.”

Beit Lahiya was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated during the first phase of the war before January's ceasefire. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners killed 17 people there, according to health officials.

Hundreds of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security. Police used a water canon to disperse the crowd after protesters tried to break through police barricades.

A mass march and demonstration Wednesday outside the Israeli parliament continued into the late evening hours and ended with several arrests.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive, among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Afnan al-Ghanam of Gaza had her first child during war, 13 months ago, while the family was still living at home.

She was about to give birth again in the spring — this time, while living in a squalid tent camp. But at least a tenuous ceasefire had brought a relative calm.

Then, before dawn on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike smashed into the family's tent. Al-Ghanam, who was seven months pregnant, and Mohammed, her young son, were both killed.

They were among more than 400 Palestinians, most of them women and children, killed when Israel launched a surprise bombardment across the Gaza Strip, according to the territory's Health Ministry. Israel said it struck Hamas targets to force the militant group to free hostages and relinquish control of Gaza.

“This is their bank of targets,” said al-Ghanam's husband, Alaa Abu Helal, as he held Mohammed's little body, wrapped in cloth, at the morgue of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. “He was born during the war in difficult conditions and also martyred in the war.”

“Their targets are innocents, pure. They have barely seen life,” he said, fighting his tears. 

Israel's aerial assault shattered the ceasefire that began in mid-January and stunned Palestinians who had finally had a breather to start trying to rebuild their lives after 15 months of bombardment, ground offensives, dispersal and hunger.




Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel. It says it does not target civilians, and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying it operates among the population.

Abu Helal said he was visiting the family's home in Gaza's southernmost city Rafah when the strike hit the family's tent in Muwasi, a sprawling camp for displaced families outside Khan Younis. Their home in Rafah had been damaged during the war, and he had wanted to check in on it to ensure it had not been looted. 

The 20-year-old al-Ghanam and Mohammed had stayed behind in Muwasi. “They have gone and left me alone,” he said. “The unborn child is dead, too.”

Mohammed was born in Rafah. Soon after, the family was forced to flee the city in May, when Israeli troops ordered a mass evacuation and stormed the city. The offensive flattened much of the city as troops battled Hamas fighters.

“You flee during the war to keep your family and children safe. But then, here, he's dead,” Abu Helal said. “All of them are dead.”

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Pastor Nilka Marrero will slam her hand on the table, raise her voice and, if needed, shake her parishioners while playing the role of a federal agent.

Many of her parishioners are undocumented immigrants, and she believes that role-playing with them can help prepare them for the threat of arrest as authorities step up immigration raids to a scale never before seen in Puerto Rico.

“They appear and snatch people,” Marrero said.

For decades, undocumented immigrants have lived in the U.S. territory without fear of arrest. They're allowed to open bank accounts and obtain a special driver's license. Many have felt safe enough to open their own businesses.

Then, on Jan. 26, large-scale arrests began.

U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents raided a well-known Dominican community in a nod to a new policy of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to deport millions of people who have entered the United States illegally.

The arrests have angered Puerto Rican officials and civil leaders who have created programs to help the island's undocumented immigrants, many of whom are from the Dominican Republic.

An estimated 55,000 Dominicans live in Puerto Rico, although some experts believe the number could be even higher. It's unclear how many are undocumented, although some 20,000 have the special driver's license.

More than 200 people have been arrested since Jan. 26, nearly all men. Of those arrested, 149 are Dominican, according to data ICE provided The Associated Press.

Sandra Colón, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Puerto Rico, said the agency is focusing on those with a criminal record or who have received a final court ruling that they must leave the country. But she said she did not immediately have available how many of those arrested have criminal records.

Annette Martínez, Puerto Rico's ACLU director, said it's unknown where those arrested have been taken or if they have been deported. “We're concerned about the different methods ICE is using for detainment,” she said.

On a recent morning in Puerto Rico's capital, speakers at a barbershop played an English tutorial as a couple of Dominican migrants studying to become U.S. citizens listened closely.

The business faces a park where the Dominican community had long gathered. It's now mostly silent and empty. Gone is the lively merengue music, the excited chatter, the slap of dominoes.

An undocumented migrant who asked to be identified only by his nickname, “the fisherman,” because he feared jeopardizing his case in federal court, said he was arrested near the park.

He had illegally entered Puerto Rico in 2014 to seek more income because his wife back home had breast cancer and he could not afford her treatment working as a fisherman in the Dominican coastal town of Samaná.

“I needed to make a living,” he said.

His wife died, but the man decided to stay in Puerto Rico. His son also came to the island. The fisherman first worked in construction, but after falling off a second-story floor and shattering his pelvis, he resumed fishing once he healed.

He sold fish at the park until Jan. 26. That day, he was sitting in a van while his son bought them lunch.

“Three agents pulled me out,” he recalled.

They arrested seven people at that moment, including his son.

The man said they slept on the floor of several jails and were given only bread and water as they were transferred to the Puerto Rican town of Aguadilla, then Miami and finally Texas.

Authorities sent the man back to Puerto Rico for judicial proceedings, where he remains out on bond with an ankle monitor. His son is in a Miami jail.

“We're torn apart,” he said as his voice cracked.

Every day, Marrero keeps an eye out for white vans that might be circulating near her church.

Inside, more than a dozen volunteers fold donated clothes and prepare free meals for undocumented immigrants who are too scared to leave their homes.

“They're panicking,” said José Rodríguez, president of the Dominican Committee of Human Rights. “They're afraid to go out; they're afraid to take their children to school.”

In February, Puerto Rico's Education Department noted that schools with a high number of Dominican students saw absentee rates of up to 70%. Officials have since ordered school principals to keep their gates closed and not open them to federal agents unless they have a warrant.

The mayor of San Juan, Miguel Romero, has said municipal police are not working for or helping federal agents, and that the city is offering legal aid and other assistance.

Meanwhile, Julio Roldán Concepción, mayor of Aguadilla, a northwest coastal town where many undocumented migrants arrive by boat, called for empathy.

“Any undocumented migrant can come by city hall if they need help,” he said. “I am not going to ask to see papers to give it to them. … We are all brothers here.”

Officials in Puerto Rico's health sector also have offered to help undocumented migrants. Carlos Díaz Velez, president of the Association of Medical Surgeons, announced that undocumented migrants would receive online medical care “in light of the raids that have condemned thousands of immigrants to confinement.” 

Gov. Jenniffer González, a Republican who supports Trump, initially said the president's initiative would not affect immigrants in Puerto Rico. Since then, she has said the island “cannot afford to” ignore Trump's directives on migrant arrests, noting that federal funds are at risk.

Shortly after the January arrests, the Episcopalian Church in Puerto Rico announced a new program that offers migrants food as well as legal, psychological and spiritual help. More than 100 people have sought help, said Bishop Rafael Morales Maldonado.

“The church is never going to be against a law, but it will oppose its effects,” he said.

Federal agents initially targeted neighborhoods in San Juan, but they have since fanned out across the island and into work sites, Rodríguez said.

A man who declined to be identified because his court case is pending, said he was arrested on Feb. 26. He first arrived in Puerto Rico in 2003 but was arrested upon reaching shore. After being deported, he tried again in February 2007. He got a construction job and then opened his own company.

“I had never felt unsafe,” he said.

But one afternoon, a woman whose house he was working on complained about his work. The following day, federal agents arrested him and his employees as soon as they arrived at the work site. That's when he found out the woman had taken a picture of his van and reported him.

“How can people want to hurt someone so much?” he said.

His attorney said he has a court date on April 1. The man said he applied years ago for U.S. residency but never received a response. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his daughter lives legally in Orlando, Florida.

As the arrests continue, Marrero, the pastor, keeps educating undocumented migrants. If they have children born in Puerto Rico, she urges to make sure to have their children's passports and custody papers in order and on hand. 

She says she asks them to repeat the responses they should give agents depending on what they're told to do, noting that many don't know how to read or write or do so poorly.

“We have prepared them for an honorable, dignified return,” she said.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's government has given final approval for a Texas-based marine robotics company to renew the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.

Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometer (5,800-square-mile) site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a statement Wednesday. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million only if wreckage is discovered. 

The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed.

An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing.

The final approval for a new search came three months after Malaysia gave the nod in principle to plans for a fresh search. 

Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.




Loke said his ministry will ink a contract with Ocean Infinity soon but didn't provide details on the terms. The firm has reportedly sent a search vessel to the site and indicated that January-April is the best period for the search.

“The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the passengers of flight MH370,” he said in a statement.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Yemen's Houthi rebels on Wednesday that they'll be “completely annihilated” as American airstrikes pounded locations under their control, while further pressuring the group's main benefactor Iran. 

Strikes hit Sanaa, Yemen's rebel-held capital, as well as their stronghold of Saada in the country's northwest on Wednesday night, the Houthi's al-Maisrah satellite news channel reported. It aired footage showing firefighters battling a blaze in Sanaa and damaged at what it described as a sheep farm in al-Jawf. 

It also said strikes happened overnight Tuesday, though the U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of places targeted since the airstrikes campaign began. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others.

As the strikes hit, Trump wrote on his Truth Social website that “tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians.” 

“Watch how it will get progressively worse — It's not even a fair fight, and never will be,” Trump added. “They will be completely annihilated!”

Meanwhile, Trump again warned Iran not to arm the Houthis, claiming without offering evidence that Tehran “has lessened its intensity on Military Equipment and General Support to the Houthis.”

“Iran must stop the sending of these Supplies IMMEDIATELY,” he wrote. 




Iran has long armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam's minority Shiite Zaydi sect that ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons to Iran. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency acknowledged Trump's comments and cited remarks previously made by Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeed Iravani, that said Trump made “baseless accusations.”

The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.

Meanwhile Thursday, the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency acknowledged the rebels had been taking food aid out of a World Food Program warehouse without permission. It said it took about 20% of the aid on hand out. 

The U.N. in February suspended its operations in Saada over security concerns following the detentions of dozens of U.N. workers and others. One WFP staffer died while imprisoned by the Houthis.

CHERNIHIV REGION, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine said Wednesday they had each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges since the Russian full-scale invasion started three years ago.

“We are bringing back soldiers, sergeants, and officers — warriors who fought for our freedom in the ranks of the Armed Forces, the Navy, the National Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces, and the Border Guard Service,” said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The Ukrainian leader said Tuesday that releasing all prisoners of war as well as captured civilians would be an important step toward peace and could help build trust between the two countries. He has repeatedly called for an “all-for-all” prisoner exchange.

This comes as ongoing discussions about a temporary ceasefire that may pause the war continue. 

Shortly after the exchange took place near the northern border of the two warring countries, dozens of anxious families rushed to a hospital in Ukraine's Chernihiv region set to receive the released prisoners. 

Among them was 28-year-old Aliona Skuibida who has been campaigning for nearly three years for the return of her fiance, Andrii Orel, captured in April 2022 during the brutal battle for Mariupol, which eventually fell to Russian forces. 

Skuibida, a member of the Marine Corps Strength Association, said they were to marry as soon as he returned from the battlefield but he fell into Russian hands instead. 




“Captivity is not a way to survive,” she said, adding that many soldiers return from Russian captivity bearing signs of torture.

But on Wednesday, Skuibida was ready to celebrate Orel's return with blue and yellow balloons and a cake. “His birthday was the day before,” she said. 

Several buses then pulled into the hospital grounds. As frail and visibly exhausted soldiers poured out of the vehicles, their faces lit up. Some smiled, showing lost teeth. 

“Until I saw our flag, I couldn't believe I was home,” said 46-year-old Oleksandr Savov. “And then I kissed it.” Next to him stood his daughter, Anastasiia Savova, 25, who hadn't heard from her father in nearly three years. She faithfully wrote him letters while he was held captive that went unanswered. 

“All I want now is peace, a bowl of borshch, a chance to wash, and to lie down in a clean bed,” Oleksandr Savov said. He believes he lost about 20 kilograms (about 44 pounds) during his imprisonment since May, saying conditions were “cold and damp,” with poor nutrition and no medical care.

Savov, 46, showed an Associated Press reporter his hands covered in a red rash.

As families reunited, there were others still missing. Some moved through the crowd, carrying photos of their missing relatives, desperately asking released POWs if they had seen them.

Russia's Defense Ministry said earlier Wednesday it had released an additional 22 severely wounded Ukraine captives “as a goodwill gesture.” Zelenskyy said they were returned through a separate negotiation process. Originally, Russian President Vladimir Putin had promised to release 23 prisoners when he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about a potential partial ceasefire. There was no immediate comment on the reason the number changed.

Severely wounded soldiers and fighters whom Russia had prosecuted on fabricated charges were among those released, Zelenskyy said, promising that: “Ukraine remembers each of its heroes, and we will bring everyone home.”

Prisoner exchanges have happened throughout the war, and Wednesday's exchange had been planned before the call with the U.S. president.

Petro Yatsenko, head of the press office at Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs, emphasized that prisoner exchanges require extensive preparation.

“These exchanges are not spontaneous events. They take months of careful planning — not just days or weeks,” Yatsenko said, adding that the last exchange was on Feb. 5. “And we've been working continuously since then to prepare for this one.”

Since the start of the Russian invasion, more than 4,000 Ukrainian captives, including civilians and foreigners, have been released, according to the POW treatment headquarters. 

The released Ukrainian servicemen had been captured while defending multiple regions, including Mariupol, the Azovstal steel plant, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, and Kursk.

All those who returned will receive immediate medical and psychological assistance, Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. He also expressed gratitude to the Ukrainian team working on prisoner swaps and international partners, particularly the United Arab Emirates, for facilitating the exchange.

According to the United Nations, most Ukrainian POWs suffer medical neglect, severe and systematic mistreatment, and even torture while in detention. There have also been isolated reports of abuse by Russian soldiers, mostly during capture or transit to internment sites.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Wednesday its troops retook part of a corridor that bisects Gaza, and its defense minister warned that attacks would intensify until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. 



The military said it had retaken part of the Netzarim Corridor that divides northern Gaza from the south, and from where it had previously withdrawn as part of a ceasefire that began in January. That truce was shattered Tuesday by Israeli airstrikes that killed more than 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The advances on the ground by Israel on Wednesday — which included sending more troops to southern Gaza — threatened to drag the sides into all-out war again. The ceasefire had given war-weary Palestinians some respite, allowed a much-needed surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza — and led to the release of dozens of hostages who had been held for more than 15 months.



Early Thursday, a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, the military said. Air raid sirens and several explosions were heard in Jerusalem, apparently the sounds of the interceptors in use. No injuries were reported. Yemen's Houthi rebels did not immediately claim the attack Thursday morning.



Within Israel, the resumption of airstrikes and ground maneuvers in Gaza has raised concerns about the fate of roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. Thousands of Israelis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Jerusalem, with many calling for a deal to bring the captives home.



A Hamas spokesman, Abdel-Latif al-Qanou, said the moves by ground forces in Gaza was a clear sign that Israel had backed out of the truce and was reimposing a “blockade.” There have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Tuesday's bombardment.



Also Wednesday, the United Nations said one of its employees was killed in Gaza and five others were wounded in an apparent strike on a guesthouse. It was not immediately clear who was behind the strike, the U.N. said.














The military said its “limited ground operation” in Gaza would create a “partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.” 



It wasn't immediately clear whether the move would entirely block Palestinians from traveling north or south through the Netzarim Corridor. 



Israel used the roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) corridor as a military zone during the war. It ran from the Israeli border to the coast, just south of Gaza City, the territory's largest metropolitan area. 



Israel said airstrikes on Wednesday hit dozens of militants and militant sites, including the command center of a Hamas battalion. It denied Palestinian claims that it hit the U.N. guesthouse.



Fares Awad, an official in the Gaza Health Ministry, said an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners in the northern town of Beit Lahiya killed 17 and wounded 30. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. 











Until Israel withdrew from Netzarim in January, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza for the south were prevented from returning throughout the war. Many of them have since returned.



But Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.



Katz said Tuesday's aerial bombardment “was just the first step” in Israel's plan to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and give up control of Gaza. Until it does, Israel will attack “with an intensity that you have not known.” 







Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike in the central city of Deir al-Balah. He said the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.

He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded. 



Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike. “Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said.



Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said the explosion was not caused by Israeli fire.



After the strike Wednesday, the wounded were rushed to Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in central city of Deir al-Balah. One man was carried inside on a blanket held up by medical workers. Another lay on a hospital bed, his knee bandaged.

In southern Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeper was wounded after stepping on a mine. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the incident took place during “operational activity” by the peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL in the village of Zibqin, adding that the injuries are not life-threatening.







The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the strikes early Tuesday. It said another 678 people have been wounded.



The military says it only strikes militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. 



The war has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.



The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals; 59 hostages remain, and more than half are believed to be dead.







Before this week's attacks, Israel and Hamas were set to negotiate an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which lasted six weeks. 



But those talk never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war.



The breakdown of the ceasefire was met with anger in Israel, where many support the plight of the hostage families to free their loved ones.



Israel's return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests taking place over his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. Demonstrators massed around Israel's parliament on Wednesday and later marched near Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, where police sprayed water to try to clear them.

President Donald Trump has suggested to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. should take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure the critical facilities' security.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he plans to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday to hear more about his call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Ukrainian firefighters evacuated dozens of patients from a hospital in the Ukrainian city of Sumy overnight on Tuesday after a Russian airstrike damaged the facility.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that his troops were routing Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remains to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.



The tentative deal to partially rein in the grinding war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump's push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war.



After a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday that both leaders said went well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected under the agreement.



But it was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure,” and Zelenskyy saying he'd also like railways and ports to be protected.

“One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said on social media following his call with Trump, which came a day after the U.S. president held similar talks with Putin. “I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.”



During their call, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.



Trump told Zelenskyy that the U.S could be “very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,” the statement said.



Trump suggested “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,” according to White House officials. The idea was floated even as the Trump administration looks to finalize an agreement to gain access to Ukraine's critical minerals as partial repayment for U.S. support for Ukraine during the war.



Zelenskyy, though, said the conversation focused on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — which is the largest of its kind in Europe and has been under Russian control since early in the war. He said Trump posed the idea of “an understanding” in which “the United States can recover” the plant. 



The call, which Zelenskyy described as “fruitful,” came just weeks after a disastrous Oval Office meeting between the two leaders that led to Trump temporarily pausing intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine. 



During the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot defense missile systems. Rubio and Waltz said Trump “agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.”



On Tuesday, Putin told Trump that he would agree not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to back a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump proposed. 






According to the Kremlin, Putin made clear to Trump that there must be a cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence sharing as part of any deal. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue.

Prior to his call with Trump, Zelenskyy said Putin's limited ceasefire pledge was “very much at odds with reality” after Russia launched an overnight barrage of drone strikes across Ukraine, including some that struck Ukrainian energy facilities.



Russia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking Russian equipment near one of its pipelines.



“Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.



The White House described Tuesday's call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a “movement to peace.” But there was no indication that Putin is ready to back away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.



Zelenskyy even while agreeing to work on the limited ceasefire said Putin is not seriously pursuing peace talks, and wants to prolong the war until he is in a stronger position.







The White House also confirmed that technical experts from the U.S., Ukraine and Russia would gather in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss implementing the partial ceasefire.



It was not immediately clear if the U.S. would meet together or separately with the Ukrainian and Russian officials. Waltz spoke with his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, on Wednesday to discuss the coming talks.







Shortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.



Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said. Russian drones were reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.



The Russian Defense Ministry said its military had launched seven drones at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv region, but that it shot them down after receiving Putin's order to not hit energy infrastructure.



Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.



“It is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,” the Russian Defense Ministry said.



Russia said its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions — the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.



Zelenskyy said that “words of a ceasefire” weren't enough.



“If the Russians don't hit our facilities, we definitely won't hit theirs,” Zelenskyy said.



Meanwhile, the two combatants said Wednesday that they had each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges of the war.

Zelenskyy rejected Putin's key condition that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. He said doing so would endanger lives if citizens were blind to incoming air raids and lead to the continuation of the war.



“I don't think anybody should make any concessions in terms of helping Ukraine, but rather, assistance to Ukraine should be increased,” Zelenskyy said. “This will be a signal that Ukraine is ready for any surprises from the Russians.”



Zelenskyy said one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions.



“For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian,” he said. “We will not go for it.”

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At a former American air base in southern Vietnam, work abruptly stopped last month on efforts to clean up tons of soil contaminated with deadly dioxin from the military's Agent Orange defoliant.

The Trump administration's broad cuts to USAID also halted efforts to clear unexploded American munitions and landmines, a rehabilitation program for war victims, and work on a museum exhibit detailing U.S. efforts to remediate the damage of the Vietnam War.

In addition to exposing thousands of people to health hazards, the cuts risk jeopardizing hard-won diplomatic gains with Vietnam, whose strategic importance is growing as the U.S. looks for support in its efforts to counter an increasingly aggressive China.

“It doesn't help at all,” said Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has dedicated his time to humanitarian programs in the country for the last three decades. “It is just another example of what a lot of critics want to remind us of: You can't depend on the Americans. It is not a good message.”

Funding for the Agent Orange cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base was unfrozen about a week after it was stopped, but it's unclear whether funds are fully flowing or how they'll be disbursed, with no USAID employees left to administer operations, said Tim Rieser, a senior adviser to Sen. Peter Welch, who drafted a letter to administration officials signed by Welch and more than a dozen other Democratic senators urging the continued funding of the programs.

Other programs remain cut.

“They have reversed a number of these arbitrary decisions, but we're far from out of the woods and we don't know how this is going to end,” Rieser said.

Cuts to USAID and foreign assistance have ground projects to a halt, like the cleanup of dangerous chemicals used during the Vietnam War. The AP's Jennifer King has more.

The interruptions to aid come as the U.S. and Vietnam prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War and the 30th anniversary of the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi.

It was a slow road back from the war, which lasted some 20 years and saw more than 58,000 Americans, and many times that number of Vietnamese, killed before it finally ended in 1975.

Starting in the 1990s, the U.S. began helping its former enemy address wartime legacies like Agent Orange, a herbicide dropped from planes during the war to clear jungle brush, and which was later found to cause a wide range of health problems, including cancer and birth defects.

The two countries have since been increasing defense and security cooperation as China has become more assertive in the region. In 2023, Vietnam elevated relations with the U.S. to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of cooperation and the same as Russia and China.

On Inauguration Day, Trump issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad, alleging that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Feb. 7 “underscored the department's support for ongoing efforts to collaborate on the legacy of war issues,” in his introductory call with his Vietnamese counterpart, according to the Defense Department.

Twenty days later, the administration ordered all but a fraction of U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, staffers off the job and terminated at least 83% of its contracts and cut programs globally, including in Vietnam.

Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy's foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects, said the idea that money was being wasted is “factually wrong.”

“Our foreign aid advances our own national interests, and if the Trump administration doesn't understand that, it's hard to know what to say,” he said.

A U.S. project to clean up the former Da Nang Air Base was successfully completed in 2018, giving rise to the Bien Hoa cleanup effort outside Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon.

The contamination at Bien Hoa, the busiest airport in the world during the war, was nearly four times greater than in Da Nang, with some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil and sediment.

As of 2024, the province in which Bien Hoa is located had more than 8,600 people still suffering from Agent Orange-related health issues, according to local authorities.

Work began in 2020 on a 10-year project funded by USAID and the Department of Defense, with an estimated cost of $430 million overall. Soil with low levels of dioxin contamination were to be unearthed and taken to secure landfills, while highly contaminated soil was to be taken to short-term storage for treatment.

Workers had already excavated more than 100,000 cubic meters of dioxin-contaminated soil and threated 13 hectares, by the time of the funding cut, details of which were reported by ProPublica on Monday. Ground was to be broken next month on the construction of a system to treat the most severely contaminated soil. 

“You have to wonder if the people who made the decision to freeze these funds know anything about the tragic history of the U.S. and Vietnam ... and they must not care about the many thousands of tons of severely contaminated soil that is exposing tens of thousands of people to a very serious health risk,” Rieser said.

The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and USAID referred all questions on the war legacy projects to the State Department in Washington.

In a one-line email, the State Department said that “USAID has three contracts conducting dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa in Vietnam that are active and running.”

Asked to elaborate on how long the Bien Hoa project was shut down and what operations had resumed, as well as the status of other war legacy programs, the State Department said “we have nothing to share on the details of these programs at this time.”

Vietnam's Defense Ministry referred questions to the Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment.

But in a Feb. 13 press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang expressed concern about what could happen if American funding for war legacy projects, which amounts to some $200 million per year, were to end.

“The suspension of USAID-supported projects, especially those on clearing bombs and explosives left over from the war, as well as the Bien Hoa airport detoxification project, will have a strong impact on human safety as well as the environment in the project areas,” she said.

On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge ruled that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the U.S. Constitution and blocked further cuts, but stopped short of reversing firings or fully resurrecting the agency.

Leahy, who retired in 2023, told The Associated Press that it had been a lengthy process over the last 35 years to build the relationship by working with the Vietnamese to address the problems left behind.

“It is through these efforts that two former enemies are now partners. If we pack up and leave without finishing what we started, it will send a message that the Americans can't be trusted,” he wrote in an email.

“People in the Trump administration who know nothing and care less about these programs are arbitrarily jeopardizing relations with a strategic partner in one of the most challenging regions of the world.”

It's too early to say exactly how the abrupt decision will affect relations, but it is likely to call into question whether Washington is still a reliable partner in other dealings, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a political scientist who is a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.

“The level of trust gradually increased and it is very easy to dismantle,” he said, adding that Vietnam may now think twice before deepening military cooperation ties or purchasing American weapons.

“There is good reason for Hanoi to be very cautious.”

One joint program not affected by the USAID cuts is ongoing efforts to find and identify missing American troops, the Hawaii-based Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in Hawaii told the AP. Funding for the effort falls under the U.S. defense budget rather than foreign aid.

But funding for the effort to find and identify hundreds of thousands of missing Vietnamese war victims was cut, then reinstated, and it's still unclear whether money is again flowing, Rieser said.

And, he said, funds remain frozen for a new U.S. exhibit at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's main museum on the war, which is currently focused on documenting American atrocities like the My Lai massacre and the devastating impact of Agent Orange.

The exhibit, which was to open this year to coincide with the two anniversaries, highlights U.S. efforts to address the worst legacies of the war, Rieser said.

“Right now it's a museum of American war crimes, and the whole point of this is to show that we didn't just walk away from what happened, we decided to do something about it,” he said.

“We want that to be part of the story for the hundreds of thousands of visitors to that museum, to show that the United States didn't just walk away.”

Live view from outside Istanbul's City Hall after Turkish police arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a popular opposition leader and a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor — a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  — and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. The detention of Ekrem Imamoglu was a dramatic escalation in a crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.

The state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued warrants for Imamoglu and some 100 other people. Police raided his residence near dawn and detained the mayor at around 7:30 a.m., his wife said. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun and two district mayors.

Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Turkish police have arrested Istanbul's mayor, part of a series of probes into alleged corruption and terror links.

“We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,” Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video post on social media.

Authorities closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.

Despite the ban, people gathered at Istanbul's police headquarters, carrying posters of the mayor and banners with his photo around their shoulders. Others chanted slogans and raised their fists in the air as riot police cordoned off the facility.




Thousands of people later joined a rally outside the city hall, where the leader of the mayor's party, the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, accused the government of carrying out a “coup.”

“Let's call it what it is: a coup attempt,” Ozgur Ozel told the crowd. “Today, the will of the people is being seized and usurped through a judicial coup targeting the people of Istanbul.”

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters the arrests had nothing to do with the government. “Linking investigations and cases initiated by the judiciary to our President is, at best, presumptuous and inappropriate,” he said.

Erdogan, a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies, has led Turkey as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. His current term runs until 2028 but he has indicated he'd like to serve longer — something he could achieve with a constitutional change or if early elections are called.

The Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index dropped by 7% over the news, triggering a temporary halt in trading to prevent panic selling and stabilize the market. Trading later resumed but was again halted in the afternoon. The Turkish lira lost some 3.5% of its value against the dollar.

Anadolu, the news agency, said that Imamoglu and several others are suspected of a multitude of financial irregularities. 

Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the agency said. The PKK, behind a decadeslong insurgency in Turkey, is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies. 

The Istanbul chief public prosecutor's office later obtained a court order for authorities to seize a construction company partly owned by Imamoglu, based on reports from the the country's Financial Crimes Investigation Board, HaberTurk and other media reports said.

A day earlier, Istanbul University invalidated Imamoglu's diploma, effectively disqualifying him from the next presidential race — a university degree is a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.

The mayor's party was to hold a primary on Sunday where he was expected to be chosen for its candidate in future presidential elections. With all the arrests Wednesday, that vote was in doubt but Ozel, the party's chairman, said it would go ahead as planned.

In a message conveyed through his lawyer, Imamoglu said his morale was high and encouraged his supporters to “keep their spirits high.”

“We will emerge stronger from this process,” his lawyer Mehmet Pehlivan quoted him as saying.

Earlier, hundreds also gathered outside CHP's headquarters in Ankara as the party's lawmakers protested inside the parliament, disrupting proceedings before marching out.

Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody. 

Imamoglu's arrest was a “disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,” Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.

Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock describing the arrests as a “blow to democracy in Turkey.”

“We are seeing clearly that the space for opposition politicians is getting smaller and smaller,” she said.

Turkey has been trying for decades to join the European Union, but its accession process is held up over concerns about its commitment to democracy and other values like respect for the rule of law.

“The arrest of the mayor is deeply concerning,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Brussels. “Turkey must uphold the democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials.”

Amnesty International said Imamoglu's detention marked an escalation in Turkey's crackdown on the opposition.

“While the weaponization of vague anti-terrorism allegations to detain and prosecute opponents is not new, these latest detentions and associated restrictions represent an alarming intensification of the targeting of real or perceived critics,” said Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty's deputy director for Europe.

Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X even as he himself was being arrested, though at the time he apparently didn't know that Imamoglu was also being taken into custody.

“I entrust Ekrem Imamoglu to the Turkish nation. Protect, watch over and support him. They cannot be defeat the nation,” Ongun said.

Separately, police also detained a prominent investigative journalist, Ismail Saymaz, for questioning, the opposition-aligned Halk TV reported.

Meanwhile, internet-access advocacy group netblocks.org reported Wednesday that access has been restricted in Turkey to popular social media platforms.

In nullifying Imamoglu's diploma, the university cited alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its business faculty, a decision Imamoglu said he would challenge.

Imamoglu faces multiple lawsuits, including allegations of trying to influence a judicial expert investigating opposition-led municipalities. The cases could result in prison sentences and a political ban.

He is also appealing a 2022 conviction of insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, a historic blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. The party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

Protesters gathered in Jerusalem Wednesday, marching towards the home of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to oppose the government's resumption of the war in Gaza.

Air raid sirens blared over Tel Aviv's night sky early on Thursday, as the Israeli military said a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace.

Mourners held Muslim funeral prayers on Wednesday for four people killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday that Israel will start urging Palestinians to evacuate from Gaza combat zones soon, as he warned that Israel was preparing to step up its new offensive.

An international United Nations staffer was killed and five others were wounded in a strike Wednesday on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip.

The Israeli military is retaking control of a key corridor that cuts off northern Gaza from the south, Israel's military said, deepening its renewed offensive in Gaza. Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas on Tuesday in a wave of heavy strikes that have continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.



More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, making it the deadliest day in Gaza after 17 months of war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry's records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 



Israel's defense minister warned Wednesday that attacks on Gaza would increase “with an intensity that you have not known” until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. Hamas has yet to respond militarily, but Israel's actions threaten to drag the sides back into all-out war.



Here's the latest:







The Israeli military says air raid sirens have sounded in several areas of the country following a missile attack from Yemen.



The sirens and several explosions were heard early Thursday in Jerusalem, apparently the sounds of Israel's interceptors in use. No injuries were reported. Police also reported sirens in central Israel. 



Yemen's Houthi rebels this week resumed missile attacks following the collapse of Israel's ceasefire with Hamas but they did not immediately claim the attack on Thursday morning.



The MADA rescue service said it received no reports of injuries.







United Nations peacekeepers have observed seven Israeli activities in southern Lebanon violating a U.N. resolution.



U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the activities took place north of the U.N.-drawn boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution requires Israeli forces to remain south of the boundary known as the Blue Line.



The peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, reiterated its call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon so the Lebanese army can deploy throughout the area, Haq said.



In another incident, Haq said, UNIFIL peacekeepers found rocket launchers, rocket-propelled grenade and other unauthorized weapons and ammunition caches in seven different locations in south Lebanon. The discoveries were all reported to the Lebanese Army for their action, he said.







U.N. peacekeeper in southern Lebanon has been wounded after stepping on a mine.



U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the incident took place during “operational activity” by the peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL in the village of Zibqin.



The wounded peacekeeper was initially treated at a nearby UNIFIL facility and transferred to a hospital in Beirut where his condition is stable, Haq said, adding that his injuries are not life-threatening.



He said the “terrible incident” highlights the dangers of unexploded ordnance and told reporters UNIFIL has increasing demining activities.







Palestinians in a war-ravaged town in northern Gaza are leaving by foot, in vehicles and on horse-drawn carts after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate.



Associated Press journalists saw people packing up Wednesday and carrying their belongings from Beit Hanoun to nearby Jabaliya.



Cars were piled high with people's clothes, mattresses, plastic barrels and whatever else they could carry. A Palestinian boy perched on top of one cart grinned and raised his hands in the v-for-victory sign with two fingers.



The fresh wave of evacuations were reminiscent of the displacement experienced by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled northern Gaza for the south earlier in the war. Many had returned to their hometown during the ceasefire but are being forced out now that Israel has resumed its military campaign.



Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the Wednesday that the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.







In a nod to his ally U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said their two administrations stand strong together against the “deep state.”



“In America and in Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will,” Netanyahu wrote Wednesday on the social platform X, using his English-language account. “They won't win in either place!”



Netanyahu faces fierce public criticism over his recent move to fire the head of the country's domestic security agency as well as attempts by his government to dismiss the attorney general. He often accuses state institutions like the police and the judiciary of being out to get him.



He's striking a similar chord to Trump, who rails against the “weaponization” of the Justice Department and others in the federal government against whom he has grievances. It's also rare for Netanyahu to use his English-language account on X to criticize domestic political opponents or the state institutions he says are against him.







Israel's Foreign Ministry has expressed sorrow over the death of a United Nations worker in Gaza, but said an initial probe found the Israeli military was not responsible.



The circumstances of the episode were being examined, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said in a statement.



The Israeli military earlier also denied involvement in the death, which occurred after ordnance hit a U.N. guesthouse in the city of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to the U.N.







Dr. Osama Hamed, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Gaza, said at least three U.N. staffers were brought to his hospital Wednesday morning, including one he spoke to directly.



A U.N. staffer arrived with a “massive destructive injury to his leg,” Hamed said, and the orthopedic surgeons ended up amputating it below the knee. The hospital was already juggling multiple other wounded Palestinians who had arrived before the U.N. staffers, he said.



Another U.N. staffer with a severe brain injury was taken to the Gaza European hospital, Hamed said. His condition was not immediately known.







An Israeli airstrike in far northern Gaza killed at least 17 people and wounded at least 30 others, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.



The strike Wednesday evening hit a condolence gathering in the Salateen area of Beit Lahiya, so most of the dead were from the same family, according to Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's emergency service in northern Gaza. 



The dead include at least two children aged 11 and 16, and a 65-year-old man was killed along with two of his sons, Awad told The Associated Press.



Another airstrike earlier Wednesday killed at least five people in the southernmost city of Rafah, Palestinian first responders said. 



The strike hit a vehicle in the Musbah area on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Civil Defense agency, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The casualties were taken to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis, which confirmed the deaths.



Israel's military said the strike in Rafah targeted two Hamas militants and that its forces were “continuing extensive strikes throughout the Gaza Strip.”







Strikes hit Sanaa, Yemen's rebel-held capital, as well as their stronghold of Saada in the country's northwest on Wednesday night, the Houthi's al-Maisrah satellite news channel reported. 



At least seven women and two children were injured Wednesday in a U.S. airstrike in the Thurah district in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, said Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesman for the Houthi-run Health Ministry. The strike hit an under-construction public event hall, setting fire in the facility, he said, adding that many neighboring houses were damaged.



The Houthi news channel also said strikes happened overnight Tuesday, though the U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of places targeted since the airstrike campaign began. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others.







U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday stepped up his rhetoric regarding Yemen's Houthi rebels as the American military launched more airstrikes against the group, warning they “will be completely be annihilated.”



Trump made the comment on his website Truth Social. He claimed, without offering evidence, Iranian military support to the rebels “has lessened” but said it needed to entirely stop.



“Let the Houthis fight it out themselves,” he wrote. “Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse — It's not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!”



The Houthis said strikes against them continued overnight. The U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of the strikes.



Despite more than a year of U.S. strikes and naval patrols, experts say commercial shipping will likely continue to stay out of the region because of the Houthi threat.







Without naming Israel, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the deadly strike on a U.N. guesthouse in Gaza and called for an investigation.



Israel denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. But there have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Israel broke the ceasefire on Tuesday.



“The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them,” Guterres said in a statement via U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq.



The U.N. has not yet said which country the international staff member working in Gaza was from.







The new Syrian government wants to bring Syria's breakaway Kurdish militias back under government control, but the details of their recent breakthrough agreement are still being worked out and negotiators will have overcome a decade of civil war.



Government officials met Wednesday in the northeastern province of Hassakeh with the commander of the main Kurdish-led group in the country, the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by the U.S.



The meeting comes a week after Syria's interim government signed a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the SDF into the Syrian army.



The deal should be implemented by the end of the year. It would bring northeast Syria's borders and lucrative oil fields under the central government's control.







Palestinians living close to a U.N. building in Gaza that was hit by a deadly strike on Wednesday say the facility had been struck multiple times by tank shelling in recent days.



Naief al-Lahham said the building was hit by tank shelling Tuesday evening, but it didn't result in casualties.



On Wednesday morning, he heard two explosions minutes apart, he told the AP, adding that the attack came from an Israeli position just east of the building. A U.N. staffer was killed and at least five others wounded.



The explosion shook al-Lahham's house, damaging its windows. He said he was lightly injured by pieces of glass.



The U.N. says it had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility's location. Israel denies targeting the U.N. compound.







A spokesman for Hamas said Israel's closure of the main north-south route in Gaza, the Salahuddin road, is part of Israel's “blockade on Gaza.” 



“The Zionist occupation, under American cover and international silence, is destroying life in Gaza and reneging on the signed agreement,” Abdel-Latif al-Qanou said in a statement Wednesday.



Israel has closed all Gaza's border crossings since the beginning of the month and banned the entry of food and other supplies. There had been a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the ceasefire.



Al-Qanoua said Hamas is willing to engage with any proposal leading to starting negotiations on implementing the ceasefire's second phase.



He said the only person who benefits from resuming the war is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while it “threatens the life of the hostages in Gaza.”



Both Israel and the United States blame the renewed hostilities on Hamas' refusal to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war proceed — which was not part of the ceasefire agreement.







As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which it had used as a military zone and which bisected northern Gaza from the south.



The move appeared to deepen the renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza, which shattered the two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas.







In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Israel was preparing to step up its new offensive.



Katz said that if the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are not freed, “Israel will act with an intensity that you have not seen.”



Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remained of their homes and Israeli forces had pulled back to a buffer zone during the ceasefire in Gaza, which began in late January.







The clashes along the Lebanon-Syria border, where smuggling is widespread, was the worst fighting there since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government in December.



The fighting happened after Syria's interim government accused militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting and killing three soldiers. Hezbollah denied involvement and some other reports pointed to local clans in the border region that are not directly affiliated with Hezbollah but have been involved in cross-border smuggling. The Lebanese government said the three Syrians killed were smugglers.



The Lebanese Health Ministry said seven people in Lebanon were killed in the fighting, and 52 others were wounded. Four Syrian journalists embedded with the Syrian army were lightly wounded after an artillery shell fired from the Lebanese side of the border hit their position.







An international United Nations staffer was killed and at least five others were wounded in a strike on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip, a U.N. official said Wednesday.



Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike but said the explosive ordnance was “dropped or fired” and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. UNOPS operates the mechanism tracking aid trucks into Gaza, does demining and helps bring fuel in.



He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded.



The Israeli military, which has carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes since early Tuesday, denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. There have been no reports of rocket fire or other Palestinian militant attacks.



Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the staffer was killed. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility's location.



“Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said.







The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 436 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel launched a wave of heavy airstrikes early Tuesday.



The ministry said another 678 people have been wounded in the strikes, which continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.



The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.



The ministry said at least 183 children and 94 women have been killed since the strikes began early Tuesday. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.







The Israeli military has denied striking a United Nations compound in central Gaza.



Gaza's Health Ministry said an Israeli strike on a U.N. building in Gaza on Wednesday wounded five international staffers.



There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials.



“Contrary to reports, the (Israeli military) did not strike a U.N. compound” in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the army said in a statement.







French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel's airstrikes are “tragic step backwards” for the Palestinian people and for Gaza, and for Israeli hostages and their families.



Macron, speaking alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II on a visit to France, called for an immediate end to hostilities and resumption of negotiations including with the U.S. administration toward a permanent ceasefire and the release of all hostages.



The two leaders were also expected to discuss the need to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and restoring access to water and electricity in the Palestinian territory, Macron's office said.







Malaysia said it will accept 15 Palestinians who were released from Israeli jails and exiled as part of the January ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.



Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said in remarks published Wednesday in The Star newspaper that the move was a small contribution from Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, to ensure peace in Gaza.



Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told local media that security agencies would strictly monitor the Palestinians' movement once they arrive.

Israeli airstrikes overnight into Thursday struck several homes in the Gaza Strip and killed at least 85 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Among those pulled alive from the ruble was a month-old baby girl, but her parents and brother were killed. 

Hamas fired three rockets at Israel on Thursday without causing casualties. It was the first such attack since Israel resumed heavy bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war. The Israeli military also restarted its blockade of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, which it maintained for most of the war. It said people would only be allowed to leave and head south on Gaza's coastal road.

And in Israel, hundreds of people demonstrated outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security.

Here's the latest:

Sharabi told the U.N. Security Council he was beaten, chained and starved in Gaza for 491 days: “If you stand for humanity – prove it” and bring back the hostages.

He said that while the council talked about humanitarian aid, he saw Hamas militants carrying and eating dozens of stolen boxes of humanitarian aid with U.N. emblems, while the hostages starved.

When Sharabi was released on Feb. 8, he said he weighed 44 kilograms (97 pounds) — less than the weight of his youngest daughter who was killed along with his wife and older daughter in Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.




He told the U.N.'s most powerful body that six weeks after his release he came to speak for 24-year-old Alon Ohel, a fellow hostage whom he left behind in the tunnel, and all others including his older brother Yossi who was killed but whose body remains in Gaza. “Bring them all home. Now!” he said.

Hamas is believed to hold around two dozen living hostages and the bodies of others.

Britain's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, told the House of Commons “it's difficult to see how denying humanitarian assistance to a civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law.”

Although he said it's for courts not governments to decide, Lammy said it was “appalling and unacceptable” for Israel to block aid and electricity to Gaza.

He said Israel's actions “reinforce” the U.K. decision last year to suspend some arms exports to the country.

Earlier this week Lammy said Israel had broken international law, but later reverted to the government's longstanding position that Israel's actions are “at clear risk” of breaching the law.

The evacuation order covers Bani Suheila near the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's military said it would operate there in response to rocket fire by Hamas.

Thursday's order expands on a new Israeli-imposed buffer zone along Gaza's northern and eastern borders.

Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said a day earlier that the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.

As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza's Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. A man sprinted away from the wreckage carrying a living infant swaddled in a blanket and handed her to a waiting ambulance crew. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. “She had been screaming and then falling silent from time to time until we were able to get her out a short while ago, and thank God she is safe.”

The girl was identified as Ella Osama Abu Dagga. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war.

The girl's parents and brother were killed in the overnight Israeli airstrike, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Only her grandparents survived. 

Hundreds of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the country's head of internal security.

Police used a water canon to disperse the crowd after protestors tried to break through police barricades, and scuffles erupted. Several demonstrators were thrown to the ground by police officers – including an opposition legislator, according to Israeli media reports.

On Wednesday, a mass march and demonstration outside the Israeli parliament continued into the late evening hours and ended with several arrests.

The protests come amid a renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza and ahead of a planned vote by the government to dismiss the head of internal security, a move that many view as undermining the balance of powers in Israel.

Three rockets launched at Israel from the Gaza Strip on Thursday set off sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Hamas claimed the attack, which appeared to be the first out of Gaza since Israel ended a ceasefire with a surprise bombardment of the territory on Tuesday.

The Israeli military said it intercepted one of the rockets, and two others fell in open areas. There were no reports of injuries.

Earlier on Thursday, a missile launched toward Israel by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi was intercepted before it reached Israeli airspace.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called the strikes on Yemen a “crime” that “should be prevented.”

In a message marking the Iranian New Year, he said Muslim nations must unite to resist the “Zionist Regime,” referring to Israel. He called the U.S. an accomplice in the resumption of Israel's strikes on Gaza and said the strikes by Israel have been carried out by “the U.S. permission, or support and green light.”

In a separate message, President Masoud Pezeshkian urged for domestic integrity, improving relation with neighbouring nations and other nations in the world.

The death toll from new Israeli strikes on Gaza has climbed to 58, according to hospitals in the territory.

Multiple homes were targeted in the middle of the night late Wednesday and early Thursday. The latest total of those killed was according to three hospitals in different parts of the territory. 

The strikes hit houses in the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza and the northern town of Beit Lahiya, they said.

The European Hospital in the southern city of Rafah said 26 people, mostly women and children, were killed in strikes on two family homes overnight. One of the strikes killed a father and his seven children, it said.

The Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies of seven people killed overnight in an attack on a home. In northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital said it had received the bodies of seven people killed in a strike on a home in Beit Lahiya, a town near the border.

The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels early Thursday before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. 

It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week.

Finns share their insights as Finland is again ranked the happiest country in the world

HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

People walk past a monument to poet and writer Johan Ludvig Runeberg in Helsinki, Finland, Saturday, March 15, 2025. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits)



Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

Aino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.

“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. “And I think it's because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It's clean and the air is fresh and what's there not to love?” 

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,” said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. “If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Alexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.

“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other,” Peth said. “So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”

Overall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom. 

In a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.

Jouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”

“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.

Kirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.

The number 200 is top of mind across wine country in France, Italy and Spain.

CHAMPAGNE, France (AP) — Across wine country in France, Italy and Spain one number is top of mind: 200%.

That's because last week U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of that amount on European wine, Champagne and other spirits if the European Union went ahead with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. products. The top wine producers in Europe could face crippling costs that would hit smaller wineries especially hard. 

Europe's wine industry is the latest to find itself in the crosshairs of a possible trade spat with the U.S. 

Among those concerned is David Levasseur, a third-generation wine grower and owner of a Champagne house in France's eponymous region.

“It means I'm in trouble, big trouble. We hope it's just, as we say, blah blah,” Levasseur said, standing in his Champagne house as he swilled a flute of his vineyard's bubbly. “When someone speaks so loudly,” he said of Trump's 200% threat, “it's about the media buzz. But in any case, we think there will be consequences.”

Like other wine sellers and exporters, Levasseur said that a 200% tariff on what he exports to the U.S. would essentially grind to a halt his business in that country. 

“It could be a real disaster,” Levasseur said.

Italy, France and Spain are among the top five exporters of wine to the United States. Trump made his threat to Europe's alcohol industry after the European Union announced a 50% tax on American whiskey expected to take effect on April 1. That duty was unveiled in response to the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.

Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be “a hammer blow” for France's industry, whose wine and spirits exports to the U.S. are worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually. 

“With 200% duties, there is no more market,” Picard said. 

Still, he understood why European leaders responded to Trump's initial tariffs.

“There's no debate about that. We agree that Mr. Trump creates and likes to create contests of strength. We have to adapt to that,” he said.

In Italy, the wine industry has called for calm, hoping that negotiators in Brussels and Washington can back down from the growing trade spat.

The U.S. is Italy's largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. Last year, exports grew by nearly 7% to over 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) according to Italy's main farming lobby Coldiretti. 

Strong sales at high-end restaurants, in particular, make the U.S. market difficult to replace, said Piero Mastroberardino, vice president of the national winemakers' association Federvini.

Mastroberardino's “Taurasi Radici” red wine, for example, was rated the fifth-best wine in the world in 2023 by Wine Spectator, an American wine and lifestyle magazine. It sells for around $80 a bottle retail in the U.S., roughly twice how much it costs in Italy, so any tariffs would push it to an “unthinkable price point,” he said.

In January, Mastroberardino's U.S. import partners increased orders by about 20% in January anticipating possible Trump tariffs. But the increase in orders would not offset the impact of tariffs, particularly that high, he said, for long. 

“It is in everyone's interest to maintain a united front at the negotiating table,” Mastroberardino said, “especially those who are being targeted.”

Wine producers and industry experts in Spain, whose smooth reds are savored by tens of millions of American tourists who visit the southern European country every year, shared similar concerns about prospective tariffs.

“We don't think they have much logic and we hope it never comes to fruition,” said Begoña Olavarría, an economic analyst at the Interprofessional Wine Organization of Spain.

Spain was the fourth-largest exporter of wine to the U.S. last year in sales, and the seventh-largest by volume, according to the trade group. Spanish wine exports to the U.S. grew by 7% last year. And the wine industry represents about 2% of the country's overall economic output, the trade group said. 

For Spain's producers of Cava, the threat of U.S. tariffs hit especially hard. The U.S. is the number two market for the Spanish bubbly wine, which like Champagne has a designation of origin meaning it can only be made in Spain.

Mireia Pujol-Busquets is owner of the Alta Alella Bodega located in Cava country just south of Barcelona. Founded by her family in 1991, she said her business and its 40 employees immediately risk losing sales of some 25,000 bottles if the American market slams shut.

“We spent 10 years of effort opening the American market, finding distributors and building a brand,” she told the AP.

While the Catalan bodega and its distributors in the U.S. were able to absorb the price increase induced by Trump's 25% tariff on wines during his first term, Pujol-Busquets said that it is “completely irrational” to consider eating a 200% hike. 

“The situation is pretty desperate,” she said.

This story has been revised to reflect that the U.S. is the number two destination for Spanish bubbly wine, rather than the number one destination.

        Authorities closed off roads and implemented a four-day demonstration ban in an effort to prevent protests following Ekrem İmamoğlu's arrest.
    

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Istanbul on Thursday following the arrest of the city's mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu. The opposition figure is seen as a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Several roads had been closed, some social media platforms were restricted, and a four-day demonstration ban was put into place in an attempt to thwart protests. 

However, despite the ban, many gathered outside the Istanbul's police headquarters, the City Hall, and outside the headquarters of İmamoğlu's Republican People's Party (CHP).

One protester called the arrest ""unlawful"" and ""baseless"". 

""This is not democracy. It's a sham of democracy. The people do not deserve this. We are upset of course. As humans, we are upset,"" he said. 

Riot policed blocked off roads leading to the Vatan Security Department, where the mayor was taken following his arrest. 

İmamoğlu is a popular oppositon leader and the main rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A total of 100 people, including the mayor and several other prominent figures, were arrested. 

İmamoğlu and his aides are suspected of alleged corruption, including extortion and fraud, as well as aiding the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), an outlawed party classified as a terrorist organisation by Ankara, Washington and other Turkish allies. 

İmamoğlu's arrest comes amid a wider crackdown on opposition figures, which has been criticised as a politically motivated in an attempt to silence dissent. 

A day earlier, Istanbul University revoked the mayor's bachelor degree, a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, the leader Republican People's Party (CHP) Özgür Özel mirrored the criticism. He claimed Erdogan, who has experienced significant losses in local elections last year, targeted İmamoğlu as he feared losing to him in the ballots.

Özel also accused authorities of a ""coup attempt"".

""They can do any evil. We are ready for any evil they can do. Because it is clear that the issue is not a political struggle, but a matter of existence or non-existence for the country,"" he added.

Turkey's Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc countered the allegations, and reminded that the courts operate independently.

""Characterizing investigations carried out by an impartial and independent judiciary as something like a coup, or using similar terms is extremely dangerous and incorrect,"" Tunc said.

The justice minister emphasised that the judiciary ""does not take instructions from anyone.""

""Linking investigations and cases initiated by the judiciary to our president is, at best, presumptuous and inappropriate. The separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary is essential in our country,"" he concluded.

On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed deep concern over İmamoğlu's arrest, and reminded Turkey of its obligation to uphold democratic values. 

""Turkey is and an EU candidate country, Turkey must uphold the democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials,"" von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels.

""We want Turkey to remain anchored to Europe, but this requires a clear commitment to democratic norms and practices, and it is key that Turkey respects these fundamental principles,"" she added.

Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony drew protests as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups clashed amid ongoing violence in the Israel-Hamas war.

Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to disrupt Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony on Tuesday, sparking a heated confrontation with pro-Israel counterprotesters. 

The event, held outside the El Capitan Theatre, was shielded from view by a tent as tensions flared on Hollywood Boulevard.

""Gal Gadot represents Zionism and Hollywood and the industry that is riddled and dominated by Zionism,"" said one protester. 

The demonstration came as renewed Israeli airstrikes on Gaza killed over 400 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

In 1897, when the First World Zionist Congress was held in Basel, Switzerland, in attendance, as a non-voting representative, was Rev. William Hechler, a Christian clergyman and close friend of Theodor Herzl.Hechler wrote extensively on the topic of the biblical importance of the modern Zionist enterprise. He was instrumental in the early days of the Zionist movement, introducing Herzl first to the Grand Duke of Baden and ultimately to Kaiser Wilhelm II, both of whom became important supporters of the Zionist cause.  While Hechler grounded his Zionism in his faith in the biblical prophecies of the restoration of Israel, the secular Herzl referred in his diary to Hechler as “a naive visionary,” writing that “Hechler declares my movement to be a biblical one, even though I proceed rationally in all points.”That a non-Jew recognized the biblically prophetic significance of Zionism while the Jewish founder of the movement did not should not surprise anyone who reads the Bible. Consider the words of Psalm 126: Advertisement“When the Lord restores the returnees of Zion, we were like dreamers. Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with joyous song. Then they said among the nations, ‘The Lord has done great things for them.' The Lord has done great things for us. And we are glad.”Members of Christians United for Israel march to show solidarity with Israel, in Jerusalem, in 2008. (credit: REUTERS)In this passage, the people of Israel's own recognition of God's hand in our redemption is preceded by that of the nations. And this verse is not an outlier. Throughout the biblical prophecies of the restoration of the Jews to our land, there are multitudes from the nations who play an active and supportive role in the process. Isaiah foretold that the nations will “bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders” (Isaiah 49:22) – non-Jews actively facilitating the aliyah of Jews to the Land of Israel.Simply put, the active participation of Bible-believing gentiles in the Zionist project is not only politically expedient, it is part and parcel of the way the redemption of Israel is meant to play out.

“When the Lord restores the returnees of Zion, we were like dreamers. Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with joyous song. Then they said among the nations, ‘The Lord has done great things for them.' The Lord has done great things for us. And we are glad.”Members of Christians United for Israel march to show solidarity with Israel, in Jerusalem, in 2008. (credit: REUTERS)In this passage, the people of Israel's own recognition of God's hand in our redemption is preceded by that of the nations. And this verse is not an outlier. Throughout the biblical prophecies of the restoration of the Jews to our land, there are multitudes from the nations who play an active and supportive role in the process. Isaiah foretold that the nations will “bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders” (Isaiah 49:22) – non-Jews actively facilitating the aliyah of Jews to the Land of Israel.Simply put, the active participation of Bible-believing gentiles in the Zionist project is not only politically expedient, it is part and parcel of the way the redemption of Israel is meant to play out.

A rare indirect exchange between an Iranian official and an Israeli scholar took place last week. Mohammad Javad Zarif, a high-ranking diplomat and former foreign minister and vice president, responded to Thamar E. Gindin, an expert on Iran, following a video she published in Persian.Gindin's video was a response to claims made by Zarif during a speech to Iranian students in February. He had accused Israel of forging an enmity with Iran to “make up for the peace signed with Arabs” as part of the Oslo Accords.  “During the 1990s, when the Zionist regime began negotiating with the Arab world, they needed to change the narrative of enmity,” Zarif said in his speech. “They had made up a narrative in which Arabs were the enemies, and suddenly Iran became the enemy.”“Since Israel needed an enemy, they had to invent an enemy somewhere else,” he said, adding that prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as saying Iran was the substitute to the Arabs. AdvertisementZarif also said Israel was harnessing a “false biblical narrative” from the Book of Esther to propagate the narrative of Iranians who were trying to kill the Jews, while “it was in fact the other way around.”Following the speech, Gindin recorded a video addressing Zarif directly. She responded to his claims and challenged him to present proof for his quotes of Rabin.

(credit: DALATI NOHRA/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)To the surprise of many, Zarif directly referred to Gindin's video in an interview with Iranian host Mohammad Fazali – a rare instance of acknowledgment, referring to the Israeli scholar as “a Persian-speaking Israeli lady.”In his new interview, Zarif doubled down on his claims. He quoted an entry from Columbia University's Encyclopaedia Iranica in 1993, which claimed the same about Rabin's intentions.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Zarif also maintained that Israel's enmity toward Iran in the 1990s was the first time when Iran was “free to breathe” after a decade of war. He accused Gindin of continuing the line of bashing Iran's image, “even with a lovely tone.” Advertisement‘A regime lobbyist writing up an encyclopedia entry'The entry “Israeli Relations With Iran” in Encyclopaedia Iranica reads: “Israel's vision of the new Middle East order came at the expense of Iran since Yitzhak Rabin believed that the Israeli population would be unlikely to accept peace with the Arabs unless a greater and more ominous threat, namely Iran and Islamic fundamentalism, was looming in the horizon.Moreover, the Arab states would be more inclined to make peace with Israel if they felt more threatened by Iran's fundamentalist ideology than by Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and its nuclear arsenal.”In an interview with The Jerusalem Post, Gindin said she was surprised by Zarif's direct acknowledgment of her video. “I went on to read the said article Zarif was referring to,” she said.  “When you ask yourself who this mind-reading writer is, that wrote up this article, you find that this section was authored by none other than Trita Parsi, the founder of the National American Iranian Council, perceived as the pro-Islamic Republic lobby in the US,” Gindin said.“It strikes me as ironic that a lobbyist for the most anti-Israel regime was chosen to write up an entry regarding Iranian-Israeli relations,” she said. “Besides, the entry itself has no real references to Rabin ever mentioning such a goal.”The encyclopedia entry cites an accusation made by Israeli scholar Ephraim Inbar, who claimed that former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was “playing [the Iranian threat] more than it was deserved in order to sell the peace process,” Gindin said.Otherwise, no tangible source was brought to attribute such a quote to Rabin, she said, adding that contrary evidence from Dr. Haim Assa, a close adviser to Rabin, quoted him as dismissing the Iranian threat and deeming it “an American issue.”“In any case, I am very excited to have had this exchange with Zarif, whom I see as an intelligent persona, as opposed to the regime's loud mouthpieces,” Gindin said. “I just wish he would stop telling lies about Israel, and remember that it was [former supreme leader Ruhollah] Khomeini who first called for the destruction of the Jewish State, and Israel was the one who mirrored this call, as the entry correctly states.”

He quoted an entry from Columbia University's Encyclopaedia Iranica in 1993, which claimed the same about Rabin's intentions.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Zarif also maintained that Israel's enmity toward Iran in the 1990s was the first time when Iran was “free to breathe” after a decade of war. He accused Gindin of continuing the line of bashing Iran's image, “even with a lovely tone.” Advertisement‘A regime lobbyist writing up an encyclopedia entry'The entry “Israeli Relations With Iran” in Encyclopaedia Iranica reads: “Israel's vision of the new Middle East order came at the expense of Iran since Yitzhak Rabin believed that the Israeli population would be unlikely to accept peace with the Arabs unless a greater and more ominous threat, namely Iran and Islamic fundamentalism, was looming in the horizon.Moreover, the Arab states would be more inclined to make peace with Israel if they felt more threatened by Iran's fundamentalist ideology than by Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and its nuclear arsenal.”In an interview with The Jerusalem Post, Gindin said she was surprised by Zarif's direct acknowledgment of her video. “I went on to read the said article Zarif was referring to,” she said.  “When you ask yourself who this mind-reading writer is, that wrote up this article, you find that this section was authored by none other than Trita Parsi, the founder of the National American Iranian Council, perceived as the pro-Islamic Republic lobby in the US,” Gindin said.“It strikes me as ironic that a lobbyist for the most anti-Israel regime was chosen to write up an entry regarding Iranian-Israeli relations,” she said. “Besides, the entry itself has no real references to Rabin ever mentioning such a goal.”The encyclopedia entry cites an accusation made by Israeli scholar Ephraim Inbar, who claimed that former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was “playing [the Iranian threat] more than it was deserved in order to sell the peace process,” Gindin said.Otherwise, no tangible source was brought to attribute such a quote to Rabin, she said, adding that contrary evidence from Dr. Haim Assa, a close adviser to Rabin, quoted him as dismissing the Iranian threat and deeming it “an American issue.”“In any case, I am very excited to have had this exchange with Zarif, whom I see as an intelligent persona, as opposed to the regime's loud mouthpieces,” Gindin said. “I just wish he would stop telling lies about Israel, and remember that it was [former supreme leader Ruhollah] Khomeini who first called for the destruction of the Jewish State, and Israel was the one who mirrored this call, as the entry correctly states.”
            



“During the 1990s, when the Zionist regime began negotiating with the Arab world, they needed to change the narrative of enmity,” Zarif said in his speech. “They had made up a narrative in which Arabs were the enemies, and suddenly Iran became the enemy.”“Since Israel needed an enemy, they had to invent an enemy somewhere else,” he said, adding that prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as saying Iran was the substitute to the Arabs. AdvertisementZarif also said Israel was harnessing a “false biblical narrative” from the Book of Esther to propagate the narrative of Iranians who were trying to kill the Jews, while “it was in fact the other way around.”Following the speech, Gindin recorded a video addressing Zarif directly. She responded to his claims and challenged him to present proof for his quotes of Rabin.

The Israel Police's Lahav 433 Unit of International Crime Investigations arrested two suspects in the ‘Qatargate' affair, in which close aides of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allegedly received funding from Qatar in order to promote its image while serving in the prime minister's office.The identity of the two suspects was not made public due to a gag order.  Israeli Businessman Gil Birger admitted in recordings published by KAN's Reshet Bet on Wednesday that he had transferred funds from a Qatari lobbyist to a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media team, Eli Feldstein.According to the recordings, the lobbyist, Jay Footlik, requested that Birger assist in transferring the funds to Feldstein for VAT purposes. The recordings confirm a report on Tuesday evening by Channel 13's Baruch Kara.

However, he continued working for the prime minister until October 2024, when he was arrested on charges of leaking a classified document to the German newspaper Bild on behalf of Netanyahu, in order to relieve public outcry over the Hamas killing of six hostages in Rafah due to IDF proximity.According to Kara, Feldstein's salary was effectively paid by the Qatari government during that period, while at the same time working alongside the prime minister, serving primarily as his liaison to military reporters. The recordings and report regarding Feldstein's salary could not be independently confirmed by The Jerusalem Post.

""The funds Feldstein received from the businessman whose recording was published were for strategy and communication services Feldstein provided to the Prime Minister's Office, and not for Qatar,"" Feldstein's attorneys explained.

Nestled in the hills of northern Israel, Maghar is home to a unique mix of Druze, Muslims, and Christians who have coexisted for generations. With a population of approximately 22,000, the town comprises 60% Druze, 20% Muslims, and 20% Christians. The Druze, a historically significant and close-knit community, number around 150,000 in Israel, while larger populations live in Syria and Lebanon. Though scattered across different nations, the Druze maintain a deep unity shaped by their religious beliefs and historical experiences. In Israel, the Druze have integrated into society, serving in the military, government, and various professional fields, balancing their cultural heritage with their national identity.For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org Since the establishment of Israel, the Druze have played an integral role in the state. Colonel (Res.) Hamada Ganim, a Druze former commander of the Northern Brigade in the Gaza Strip, emphasizes their longstanding service. “From the time of Israel's establishment, the Druze have been part of the country. We serve and contribute at every level of government, including the army. The Druze have served in the military since the state's founding, taking an active and central role in security and civil affairs. Overall, the Druze are well-integrated within Israel.”  Eyal Ganim, an entrepreneur and former Israeli security officer, sheds light on the community's sense of identity. “First of all, we are Druze. Despite differences tied to geography and personal perspective, our core remains unchanged. We are Druze by faith, Arab by culture, and Israeli by nationality. We are not interested in our own state; we are committed to our land and will protect it at any cost. That is why serving in the Israeli military is not just an obligation—it is a commitment.” He further highlights the Druze's role as bridge-builders. “Our community always builds bridges, not walls. While the Druze in the Galilee see themselves as Israeli Druze, those in the Golan and other regions feel differently. But we all share a core identity.”The recent conflicts in Gaza have brought new challenges for Israel's Druze community. Many serve in the military and have firsthand experience of the conflict. “As Druze, we feel the conflict from both sides,” says Eyal Ganim. “We speak Arabic and are connected to the Arab world, but we are also Israeli citizens and sympathize with the Jewish people. October 7th changed everything—it shattered illusions about security and stability. Despite the wars, people here want peace. I fight because I want to grant peace to this land one day.” AdvertisementInstability in the Middle EastWith Syria in turmoil, discussions about a potential Druze state have resurfaced. While some advocate for an independent Druze homeland, many community leaders remain skeptical. “I don't think there will be a Druze state,” says Col. (Res.) Hamada Ganim. “The Druze in Syria should stay loyal to their country if it protects them. If not, they must take control of their situation and defend themselves.” Eyal Ganim echoes this sentiment, explaining how the Druze identity is shaped by the country they live in. “We belong to our respective nations, but Druze unity transcends borders. In Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, we see ourselves as one people. However, politically and geographically, we differ, making it hard to speak for the entire community.”View of trucks transferring humanitarian aid to the Druze in Syria. March 13, 2025. (credit: SIVAN SHACHOR/GPO)The crisis in Syria has placed the Druze in a precarious position. Rikad Khiraldin, Deputy CEO for Logistics at the National Insurance Institute and former head of the Druze town of Hurfeish, highlights the community's historical ties to Syria. “The Druze in Syria are Syrians in every way. No one can deny it. Historically, the ones who liberated Syria were the Druze—Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, who led the fight against the French in 1925. But today, Syria is not the same. With the rise of fundamentalist forces, Druze, Alawites, and Christians must protect themselves.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The massacre of Alawites in Syria has raised fears of similar violence against the Druze. Reports suggest that Israel has offered assistance, but the response within the Druze community has been mixed. Some accept the aid, while others are wary of the political consequences. “I don't think a Druze state is the answer,” says Khiraldin. “The Druze should not separate from Syria. I hope for long-term stability, but in the meantime, Israel must support them when needed.” AdvertisementCol. (Res.) Hamada Ganim warns of the deteriorating situation. “Syria is in a dangerous place. The fall of Bashar Assad leaves uncertainty. We've seen the horrors in Latakia and Tartus. We hope the same fate does not befall the Druze. Minorities—Druze, Alawites, and Christians—must protect themselves.”Beyond the challenges of conflict, communities in northern Israel continue to coexist. In Migdal, near Maghar and Tiberias, Tannourine Restaurant is a testament to interfaith harmony. Its owner, Hani Hana, reflects on the restaurant's founding. “My brother and I started this place with our mother 24 years ago. We wanted a space where Jews, Muslims, Druze, and Christians could gather. Today, we see that vision come to life.”Hana highlights the difficulties Christians face in the region. “In Israel, we have stability, but we struggle for representation. Our numbers are shrinking, and across the Middle East, our existence is threatened.” He believes that political leadership has failed to foster unity. “The Middle East's struggles are not about people—they're about politics. Ordinary people want peace. If leaders focused on unity, everything would change. ”  In Migdal, architect Matti Avahalomov is working on a project that embodies the region's diversity—the transformation of the Migdal Beach Promenade. “The promenade will physically represent coexistence, incorporating Jewish, Christian, and Islamic architectural elements to create a shared cultural space,” he explains.Avahalomov believes in the power of architecture to unite communities. “People see a divide between Jews and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. But coexistence is real. We are building a future that embraces shared history and identity.” He emphasizes the role of public spaces in fostering dialogue. “Architecture is more than just buildings—it is about identity. When we design spaces that bring different communities together, we create opportunities for understanding.”From Maghar to Tiberias, the voices of Israel's Druze and Christian communities share a common theme: unity. Despite the conflicts that have defined the region, they have chosen coexistence. Their message is clear—peace is not just an aspiration but a choice.

The recent conflicts in Gaza have brought new challenges for Israel's Druze community. Many serve in the military and have firsthand experience of the conflict. “As Druze, we feel the conflict from both sides,” says Eyal Ganim. “We speak Arabic and are connected to the Arab world, but we are also Israeli citizens and sympathize with the Jewish people. October 7th changed everything—it shattered illusions about security and stability. Despite the wars, people here want peace. I fight because I want to grant peace to this land one day.” AdvertisementInstability in the Middle EastWith Syria in turmoil, discussions about a potential Druze state have resurfaced. While some advocate for an independent Druze homeland, many community leaders remain skeptical. “I don't think there will be a Druze state,” says Col. (Res.) Hamada Ganim. “The Druze in Syria should stay loyal to their country if it protects them. If not, they must take control of their situation and defend themselves.” Eyal Ganim echoes this sentiment, explaining how the Druze identity is shaped by the country they live in. “We belong to our respective nations, but Druze unity transcends borders. In Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, we see ourselves as one people. However, politically and geographically, we differ, making it hard to speak for the entire community.”View of trucks transferring humanitarian aid to the Druze in Syria. March 13, 2025.

Observant Jews can finally enjoy cannabis without breaking traditions as the first ever kosher-for-Passover THC gummies, the viral Jewish cannabis brand Tokin' Jew announced this week. Launching their cannabis gummy brand in recent months, Tokin' Chews has worked tirelessly to bring the cannabis experience to those who cannot light a flame on Shabbat and choose to not stray from tradition. The Tokin' Jew brand reaches 30 million people monthly and has officially launched the world's first officially certified kosher-for-Passover THC gummies.  These treats were certified under Mehadrin supervision, highly respected and opening the door the people from all levels of observance to take part in a relaxing cannabis experience — comparable to enjoying wine over the holiday.In the United States, nearly one in every four Jewish adults have reported using cannabis. States including New York and California have not only recreationally legalized cannabis, as many states have through the years, but have also gone as far as opening kosher dispensaries.

Due to the added dietary restrictions presented by the Passover holiday, many edibles are out of the question for holidays. Since lighting a flame would also be out of the question for many, Tokin' Chews presented a suitable alternative.

Launching their cannabis gummy brand in recent months, Tokin' Chews has worked tirelessly to bring the cannabis experience to those who cannot light a flame on Shabbat and choose to not stray from tradition. The Tokin' Jew brand reaches 30 million people monthly and has officially launched the world's first officially certified kosher-for-Passover THC gummies.  These treats were certified under Mehadrin supervision, highly respected and opening the door the people from all levels of observance to take part in a relaxing cannabis experience — comparable to enjoying wine over the holiday.In the United States, nearly one in every four Jewish adults have reported using cannabis. States including New York and California have not only recreationally legalized cannabis, as many states have through the years, but have also gone as far as opening kosher dispensaries.

Due to the added dietary restrictions presented by the Passover holiday, many edibles are out of the question for holidays. Since lighting a flame would also be out of the question for many, Tokin' Chews presented a suitable alternative.

Ninety years after Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, Republicans are still trying to kill Social Security. Leading the assault this time are the dreadful duo of billionaires, Elon Musk, the world's richest person, and his celebrity car salesman, President Donald Trump.FDR built the modern social safety net that has protected millions of older Americans, the unemployed, dependent mothers and children, and the disabled.Trump has repeatedly said he will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits, but given his stellar reputation for prevarication, you can't take that to the bank – or possibly your monthly benefits check. Musk and congressional Republicans have already begun chipping away at the entitlement programs.  The government-spending bill Trump signed over the weekend came with a mandate for cutting $880 billion in spending overseen by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with expectations the money will come from entitlement programs. They want the “savings” to help offset the cost of tax cuts for their wealthy supporters.Will Social Security be killed?Musk has denounced Social Security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and made it a top target of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), even though he “knew many of his claims about Social Security fraud were overstated, distorted or baseless,” according to The Washington Post. US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, February 2025.  (credit: Nathan Howard/Reuters)You have to read between the lines about what Trump means by no cuts. When he promises no cuts, he means for those already receiving benefits they paid for; for everyone else, all bets are off. For starters, look for raising the retirement age from 67 to 69. Meanwhile, he's already begun eliminating thousands of Social Security employees who deal with disbursing benefits, providing customer phone service, and filing claims.The House Republican Study Committee has released a budget plan calling for “modest adjustments” to Social Security, including raising the retirement age to 70, lowering benefits for highest-earning beneficiaries, and privatizing the program. NO DOUBT there is some waste, fraud, and abuse in the system, and it needs to be cleansed, but not by Musk and his chainsaw gang, who consider it a program not worth saving.Trump is not really interested in cleaning out waste and making government agencies more efficient and effective – all the proof you need is in his firing of inspectors general, the very officials charged with ferreting out fraud and ensuring efficiency and replacing them with political hacks whose only qualification is total devotion to the glorious leader.Neither is the answer found in privatization, something president George W. Bush, riding high on his reelection victory, floated 20 years ago only to have it quickly scuttled when even the House GOP leadership, faced with outrage from constituents, abandoned ship. The best thing to come out of that was it helped Democrats take back control of the House in 2006.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Acting Social Security commissioner Leland Dudek, the mid-level data analyst put in to replace administrators fired by Trump and Musk, has floated the idea of outsourcing “nonessential functions to industry experts.” That would be a dangerous first step toward privatization that would threaten the stability and safety of the program.Musk's assault on the Social Security Administration is part of the playbook he used in his takeover of Twitter: “wrecking institutions in order to dominate them,” said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, according to The Washington Post. Musk “has a history of claiming fraud by his opponents, whether in the political or business realms,” the paper added.In his recent speech to Congress, Trump knew it wasn't true when he said DOGE had found “hundreds of billions” of dollars in wasteful Social Security spending and that some 1.5 million Americans over 150 years old receiving benefit checks. That's the kind of sloppiness, lies, and indiscriminate slashing that has many people calling DOGE the Department of Government Evil. Donald Trump (L) and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas, November 19, 2024. (credit: Brandon Bell/Pool via Reuters)BEFORE MUSK and his crew rifle through any more sensitive government and taxpayer secrets, it's time for some disclosure. His companies collect billions in tax dollars every year on federal contracts and he even has the president doing an infomercial on the South Lawn of the White House for one of his businesses. With Trump putting him in charge of so much, the public has a right to know all the business Musk and his various companies do with the federal government and to see his tax returns (especially since he's looking at all of ours).Social Security is not a welfare program. It is insurance that people pay into from the first time they go to work until they retire, when they expect to collect on their investment. It is a social contract with the government. It faces financial strain because more people are living longer, and the fund is running low.The so-called reformers' favorite response is to quote the Congressional Budget Office projection that the trust fund will be broke in 10 years, forcing a reduction in benefits. That's not the answer nor is privatizing.The solution is much simpler. Close the billionaire loophole. That's the one that Musk, Trump, and their fellow billionaires – and millionaires – stopped paying into Social Security after making more than $176,100. In other words, their tax rate shrinks dramatically the richer they become. The answer is raising the ceiling and having everyone pay the same rate on all their income, especially those who can best afford it.Take that one step further and broaden the categories of taxable income to include partnerships, interest and dividends, investment and rental income, and capital gains. With a measure of equality and fairness, the trust funds will be solvent into the next century and beyond.But the billionaires running this government, and the millionaires who write the laws, and their wealthy friends and donors, don't want to pay their fair share of taxes. Instead, they'll once again try to kill Social Security – and other programs critical to so many Americans who are struggling to survive in a turbulent, uncertain economy – by a thousand cuts in funding and eligibility. The next election is less than 600 days away.The writer is a Washington-based journalist, consultant, lobbyist, and a former legislative director at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

A first wave of additional US troops will go into Iraq before the end of the month under President Bush's new war plan, a senior defense official said Tuesday.

US President Bush is shaking up the team responsible for carrying out his military and diplomatic strategies in Iraq as he prepares to outline a new direction for the war.

Congressional Democrats stepped hungrily to the brink of power on Wednesday, promising immediate action to limit the influence of lobbyists and pledging to constantly prod the Bush administration to bring US troops home from Iraq.

Some 12,000 Iraqi policemen have been killed since the ouster of Saddam Hussein, the country's interior minister said Sunday.

Beyond its prescriptions for fixing Iraq, the special commission that studied a new approach to the war also spotlighted less obvious military ills.

Prime Minister John Howard, responding to the Iraq Study Group report, said Friday he would like to see Australian troops out of Iraq but refused to set a deadline for their withdrawal.

US President Bush's war policies have failed in almost every regard, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group concluded Wednesday

An influential bipartisan panel is expected to recommend that US forces withdraw from combat in Iraq.

Robert Gates said Tuesday the US is not winning in Iraq and he's confident President Bush will listen to his ideas about forging a new war strategy.

While US President Bush acknowledges the need for major changes in Iraq, he will not use Iraq Study Group report as political cover for bringing troops home.

It was disclosed that Donald H. Rumsfeld called for major changes in tactics two days before he resigned as defense secretary.

Under intense pressure to change course, President Bush on Tuesday vowed not to pull US troops out ""until the mission is complete.""

US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington condemns violence against minorities in Bangladesh and welcomes any efforts by the interim government to reduce such instances.

The official was asked about director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's remark condemning alleged instances of violence against minorities in Bangladesh and explaining how extremist elements seeking to establish an “Islamic Caliphate” have influenced various countries.

Bruce said, “We condemn any instances of violence or intolerance directed toward members of minority communities in any country and have welcomed measures taken by Bangladesh's interim government to ensure safety and security for all in Bangladesh. That's what we're watching. That's what we expect. And that will be what continues.”

The Bangladesh interim government, headed by chief advisor Muhammad Yunus, had expressed deep concern over Gabbard's remarks on an “Islamist caliphate,” and said that her remark are both “misleading and damaging” to the country's image and reputation.

A statement released late on Monday said, ""We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged ‘persecution and killing' of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that ‘the threat of Islamic terrorists' in the country is “rooted' in the ‘ideology and objective' to rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate.”

“This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,” the statement added.

Dhaka said Gabbard's remark were not based on any evidence or addressed specific allegations. “They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts,” the interim government said.

The United States dropped to a record low in the 2025 World Happiness Report, continuing its downward path. The US fell out of the top 20 in 2024 for the first time in the report's history, and landed at No. 23. In 2025, it dropped another level down to No. 24. The 2025 report was published Thursday, March 20.

The annual report is conducted by several organisations, ranking countries from the most to least overall happiness. Continuing the trend, Nordic countries are leading the list this year too, occupying the top four spots.

1. Finland

2. Denmark

3. Iceland

4. Sweden

5. Netherlands

24. United States

25. Belize

The United States has unfortunately dropped to its lowest-ever position. Back in 2012, it peaked at 11th place. According to the new report, the number of people dining alone in the US has increased 53% over the last two decades.

European countries dominated the top 20 in the ranking. However, there were some exceptions. Israel is at the 8th spot even though the country suffered due to the conflict with Hamas. For the very first time, Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10, coming in at 6th and 10th respectively.

Country rankings were determined on the basis of answers people gave on being asked to rate their own lives. The study was conducted in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth—it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,” said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, as reported by TIME. “If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”

Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have killed at least 70 Palestinians, including a women and children, on Thursday morning, reported Al Jazeera, citing Gaza's civil defence agency.

Israeli troops have also advanced into Gaza and retaken a portion of the Netzarim corridor, which divides north and south Gaza, as a buffer for targeted ground operations.

The military had withdrawn from this region earlier in keeping with a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, however, they have now urged civilians to evacuate the “combat zone.”

Israel's defence minister Katz addressed the residents of Gaza and stated that this was their “last warning” to return all hostages from the October 7, 2023 attack and to remove Hamas from their territory.

""Take the advice of the president of the United States. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you -- including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to,"" he said, as quoted by Associated Press.

Katz also stated that the airstrikes on Tuesday were “just the first step” and threatened Hamas that they would continue bombardment with “ an intensity that you have not known"" to make them give up control of Gaza and return all hostages.

Gaza's health ministry stated that since the renewed aggression from Israeli started on Tuesday, at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed, while another 678 people have been wounded.

Abdel-Latif-al-Qanou, a Hamas spokesperson, told Ap, that Israel capturing the buffer between North and South Gaza was a clear sign of their intention to fully resume war and reimpose a “blockade” that would cut off Gaza from external aid.

Yemen also attempted to retaliate against Israel on Thursday, however their missile was intercepted before it crossed into Israeli territory.

While the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, had brought a pause to the 15 months of conflict in Gaza, talks for a second phase of the ceasefire broke down, with Israel seeking an extension to the first phase and Hamas calling for a total ceasefire.

Ukraine on Thursday targeted Russia's Engels strategic bomber base with drones. The attack triggered a major blast and fire about 700 km (435 miles) from the front lines of the war, Reuters quoted Russian officials.

Video circulating on Russian Telegram channels which Reuters verified, showed a massive explosion on the airfield that wrecked nearby cottages.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that air defenses shot down 132 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions.

A video verified by Reuters, based on the position and shape of the buildings, showed a plume of smoke rising above damaged cottages.

According to the Reuters report, the bomber base in Engels, dating back to early Soviet times, hosts Russia's Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers, known unofficially as White Swans.

Roman Busargin, the governor of Saratov, said there had been a Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Engels that had left an airfield on fire, and that nearby residents had been evacuated. He did not specifically mention the Engels base, but it is the main airfield in the area.

Engels district head Maxim Leonov told Reuters that a local state of emergency had been declared but gave few details. Reuters was unable to independently confirm what had taken place at the airfield.

Ukraine has conducted previous attacks on the Engels air base dating back to December 2022. In January it claimed to have struck an oil depot serving the base, causing a huge fire that took five days to put out.

A Ukrainian security source said at the time that a drone attack had struck a storage facility holding guided bombs and missiles at the Engels base.

""Emergency services are working on the territory of the enterprise. According to preliminary information, there are no casualties,"" Vyacheslav Fedorishchev wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He did not specify whether the refinery had been damaged. Baza and Mash Telegram channels reported that the attack caused a fire.

Russia's Defence Ministry said air defence systems had destroyed nine Ukrainian drones overnight - over Bryansk, Tatarstan and Tula regions and the Black Sea.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that he was “not under any pressure” from US President Donald Trump to make concessions to Russia during discussions on ending the Russian invasion.

""Today, I have not felt any pressure. That's a fact,"" Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists after speaking with Donald Trump, who shared details of his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week.

Before the call, Zelensky had cautioned against making ""any concessions"" to Russia, particularly after Putin demanded a halt to Western aid.

Trump described his conversation with Zelensky as “very good” and noted that it came a day after Putin agreed to temporarily stop attacks on Kyiv's power plants. However, he acknowledged that efforts to secure a full ceasefire in Russia's three-year-old invasion were still ""on track,"" despite his discussion with Putin not yielding a broader peace deal.

As Kyiv and Moscow continued to accuse each other of ongoing attacks, Zelensky, after what he called a ""frank"" conversation with Trump, stated that Ukraine was willing to pause strikes on both Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.

Trump said he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for about an hour, marking their first conversation since a heated televised argument in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago.

""Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

""We are very much on track.""

According to the White House, during the call, Trump proposed US ""ownership"" of Ukrainian power plants, suggesting it would be the ""best protection"" for them.

The former real estate mogul has previously negotiated a deal granting the United States preferential access to Ukraine's critical mineral resources. Additionally, Trump pledged to assist Ukraine in securing more air defense equipment from European nations, AFP reported, citing a statement from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

While Ukraine has agreed to a US-proposed unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Moscow has yet to accept the deal.

During his call with Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that a full ceasefire would only be possible if the West halts its multi-billion-dollar military aid to Kyiv— a long-standing demand from Moscow. He also insisted that Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm and should stop its mandatory mobilisation.

Although both Ukraine and Russia have expressed support for a temporary truce on power plants, each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.

Ukraine's defence ministry reported that an overnight barrage of Russian missiles and drones struck the country, killing one person and damaging two hospitals. ""Today Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire,"" Zelensky said. Ukraine's national railway service also reported that the strikes targeted railway energy infrastructure in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of launching a ""deliberate"" attack on an oil depot in southern Russia, claiming the move was intended to ""derail"" Trump's efforts to mediate an end to the war. ""These attacks are countering our common efforts,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to ongoing U.S.-Russian discussions.

Despite the tensions, Russia and Ukraine exchanged 372 prisoners on Wednesday, a prearranged goodwill gesture.

In Washington, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff announced that technical talks on a potential deal to end the war would begin in Saudi Arabia on Monday. He expressed optimism that a ceasefire agreement could be reached ""within a couple of weeks"" and told Bloomberg Television that a meeting between Trump and Putin in the kingdom was ""likely,"" though he did not specify a timeline.

The tennis world has been hit with fresh controversy after Novak Djokovic's Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) filed a lawsuit against the world's major tennis bodies; the ATP, WTA, ITF and ITIA.

The PTPA labelled the world bodies as a ‘cartel' and accused the organisations of mismanagement and inequality in tennis.

The PTPA is backed by American billionaire Bill Ackman, who has publicly endorsed Donald Trump in the US presidential race. He is a tennis fan and is reported to have financially supported the PTPA in its early days, after it was founded by Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. Trump has intervened in the ongoing tussle between PGA Tour and LIV Golf, and has tried helping him find a resolution.

After the PTPA lawsuit came to public attention, Ackman also tweeted, “These lawsuits and the resulting judicial outcomes will revolutionise tennis for the players and create much greater opportunities for the most talented - regardless of their socioeconomic background - to make a living from the game.”

“This will greatly improve the competitiveness of the sport, which will make for an even better fan experience.

“As an active market participant and investor in the rough and tumble corporate world, I have never seen such abusive and anticompetitive activities and behaviour.

“This corruption and abuse have been allowed to metastasise in tennis because of the power dynamics of the sport.”

Currently trying to help both golf bodies reach an agreement, Trump could also play a role in reaching a resolution between PTPA and tennis governing bodies.

In a statement, PTPA Executive Director Ahmad Nassar said, “Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the Defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety.”

“We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

The ATP and WTA have issued public responses to the lawsuit, denying all accusations. Even Carlos Alcaraz was asked about it in a press conference, and he publicly claimed that he doesn't support the lawsuit, although he has been cited in it.

Joshua Riibe, a 22-year-old St. Cloud University student in Minnesota and the last known person to have seen missing Indian-origin University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki in the Dominican Republic, left the Caribbean nation on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported, citing his lawyers.

After a trial lasting more than five hours, Judge Edwin Rijo ruled that Joshua Riibe, who is classified as a witness in the disappearance case, should have full rights under Dominican law and no restrictions on his movement. It remains unclear where Riibe travelled after departing the Dominican Republic.

Guzmán Ariza, Abogados Consultores, the law firm representing Riibe's family, said that the La Altagracia prosecutor's office had offered to return his passport. “While appreciating the offer, Joshua opted to obtain a new passport from the U.S. consulate for privacy reasons, which was expedited,” the firm said.

Konanki had travelled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break with five female friends. Police reported that she disappeared from a beach near her hotel before dawn on March 6.

Born in India, Konanki later became a US permanent resident.

Riibe was previously detained by Dominican police, but on Tuesday, Judge Edwin Rijo ordered his release, stating that he could cooperate with authorities without being held in custody. He has not been named a suspect in the case.

According to a transcript of his interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media, NBC, and Telemundo, Riibe recounted that he and Konanki had been drinking on the beach and kissing in the ocean when they were caught in a current. He said that, as a former lifeguard, he managed to help bring her back to shore.

Riibe told investigators that after reaching the beach, he vomited, and Konanki told him she was going to retrieve her belongings. When he looked up again, she was gone. He said he was later shocked to learn of her disappearance.

On Monday, Sudiksha Konanki's parents requested that Dominican authorities officially declare their daughter legally dead.

In a letter, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki stated that after an extensive search, local officials believe their 20-year-old daughter drowned.

“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”

Michael Chapman, sheriff of Loudoun County, Virginia—where the Konanki family resides—said in a statement Tuesday that officials have been coordinating with Dominican authorities and continue to examine evidence in the case.

“The disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki is tragic, and we cannot imagine the grief her family has been feeling,” he said. “Sudiksha's family has expressed their belief that she drowned. While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible.”

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore should be handed plastic cups to drink instead of normal cutlery as they recover their muscle strength, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said.

In an interview with NDTV, Tyson said that the two astronauts, who returned to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) after a nine-month delay, will need time to readjust to Earth's gravity.

""There is no reason to think their muscles will not be able to hold them up... on the ISS, they have many ways to exercise,"" Neil deGrasse Tyson told NDTV.

""The difference is... when you spend this much time being weightless, your ability to orient for what is 'up' and 'down' is compromised because you never had to use these tools of the inner ear to establish 'up' and 'down' in space. Now I haven't been in space... but I have spoken to astronauts, friends of mine, who have spent a lot of time there, and they say typically they will recover within a week..."" he added.

Tyson further warned against handing glass cutlery to the two astronauts.

""... if you hand them a glass, they just let go (because their muscles are weaker). So, make sure the first few beverages are in a plastic cup,"" Tyson told NDTV with a smile.

Speaking about the extended stay of Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore at the ISS, Tyson said that he was never worried about their safety or about them returning home.

“They are professional astronauts... they are selected not just because they are physically fit but also because they are emotionally fit,” the astrophysicist said.

""And when you are emotionally fit, things like, 'okay, instead of eight days it's nine months'... you don't see them freaking out or reacting in some way that would jeopardise the safety of the crew. So that's why I was never worried... even if everybody else was. At no time did I have sympathy for them."" he added.

An eight-day mission for Sunita Williams to the ISS was extended for months after her Boeing space flight developed technical issues.

Williams and Wilmore bid farewell to the ISS, their home since last June, departing aboard a SpaceX capsule alongside two other astronauts.

The capsule undocked from the space station on Tuesday and splashed down off the Florida coast on Wednesday morning after clocking 286 days in space. This was Williams' third space flight, and she clocked a cumulative 608 days in space.

An Indian researcher, studying at Georgetown University in the US, has been arrested by immigration officers and faces deportation, according to his lawyer. Badar Khan Suri, a post-doctoral fellow, was arrested by ""masked agents"" outside his home in Virginia, on Monday night, Politico reported.

The agents identified themselves as being with the Department of Homeland Security and told him the government had revoked his visa, the lawsuit says, reportedly.

Mr Suri has been accused of ""spreading Hamas propaganda"". He is said to have ""close connections to a known or suspected terrorist"".

""Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,"" Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary Department of Homeland Security, wrote on X.

""Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas. The Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i).""

Mr Suri's lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, argued in his petition that Mr Suri is being punished because of the Palestinian heritage of his wife, a US citizen, according to Politico. Mapheze Saleh from Gaza is a first-year student at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, Georgetown University. She earned her bachelor's degree in journalism and information at the Islamic University of Gaza, Palestine and a master's degree in conflict analysis and peacebuilding from the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi, India.

“Dr. Khan Suri is an Indian national who was duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan,” a Georgetown spokesperson said in a statement. “We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention. We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”

Who Is Badar Khan Suri

Dr Badar Khan Suri is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A.

He completed his PhD in Peace and Conflict Studies from Nelson Mandela Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi in 2020.

He is an interdisciplinary scholar whose areas of interest are religion, violence and peace; ethnic conflicts and peace processes in the Middle East and South Asia, according to the information available on Georgetown University's website.

Hundreds were killed in a series of airstrikes in Gaza over the past few days. The barrage of attacks accompanied ground operations in the restive strip under siege since the October 2023 attack that plunged the Middle East into crisis.

Half a dozen Hamas leaders were wiped out as Israel targeted key infrastructures, continuing their relentless campaign against the Hamas. In one instance, an air bombing claimed over a dozen lives among mourners who had gathered in the northern region. In another bombing, 14 members of a family died together, Gaza's civil defence agency said.

Ground operations alongside airstrikes indicate the Israeli intent to return to full-scale war despite attempts at striking a new ceasefire deal to bring back those still being held hostage by Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that this is ""only the beginning"", asserting that any such negotiations would ""only take place under fire"".

Israel appears to be emboldened by the US support in returning to war - with the White House declaring that the US was consulted before a barrage of airstrikes pounded Gaza on Tuesday. Israel was risking its hostages, hit back at Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007.

Ground Operation Details

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said it conducted ""extensive strikes"" across the Gaza Strip last evening, targeting a vehicle carrying two Hamas operatives and a surveillance post among other critical infrastructure.

""The IDF and ISA (Israel Security Agency) are striking terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip and will continue to operate against terrorist organizations and remove any threat to the citizens of the State of Israel,"" it said on its Telegram channel last night.

The Israeli troops began their ground activities in central and southern Gaza over the past day to expand the ""security zone"". The aim was also to create a partial buffer zone between northern and southern Gaza. As part of ground activities, the Israeli troops expanded their control further to the center of the Netzarim Corridor, an official said.

""Simultaneously, it was decided that the Golani Brigade would be stationed in the Southern Command area and remain ready for operations in Gaza,"" said the IDF.

Key Eliminations

In simultaneous airstrikes, Israeli forces targeted dozens of Hamas members, including its top commanders, aiming to fulfil its vow of damaging the Palestinian group's military and government capabilities.

One of their targets was the command centre of the Hamas' Daraj Tuffah battalion, the forces claimed, pointing out that this base was used to plan attacks on Israeli civilians.

One of these strikes claimed the life of Yasser Muhammad Harb Musa, who handled security affairs in Hamas' political bureau. He had previously headed their development office in the executive committee. The IDF accuses him of promoting anti-Israel activities and being closely affiliated with senior Hamas leaders like Yahya Sinwar.

The IDF also claims to have eliminated the head of the Hamas Emergency Committee Muhammad Al-Jamasi, who also held key positions in the political bureau and played an important role in its war against Israel.

Others killed in the strikes include Essam al-Da'alis, the head of Hamas government, and Mahmoud Marzouk Ahmad Abu-Wutfa, who was allegedly responsible for Hamas' international security apparatus. His minister for justice, Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata was also eliminated alongside Bahajat Hassan Mohammed Abu-Sultan, who headed the Palestinian outfit's internal security forces.

The death count since the resumption of large-scale airstrikes on Monday and Tuesday stood at around 470.

Israel's ""Last Warning""

Israel issued a ""last warning"" before launching its deadly airstrikes, urging residents to return their hostages held by the Hamas. ""This is the last warning,"" warned the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, demanding the return of the hostages.

""Take the advice of the president of the United States. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you -- including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to,"" he said, referring to a warning by US President Donald Trump earlier this month.

At least 58 Israeli citizens are believed to be in Hamas custody even after dozens were released as part of ceasefires. But Hamas claims 34 of them have died.

Attempts are on to strike a second ceasefire deal to bring back the hostages, but Israel has refused to stop bombings for negotiations. The two sides saw a brief halt in fire during the first ceasefire, mediated by the US, Qatar, and Egypt, which was enforced in January and ended in early March.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US Department of State Spokesperson Tammy Bruce on Wednesday condemned the violence against minorities in Bangladesh during her press briefing.

When asked about the recent remarks made by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard regarding Bangladesh, Bruce stated that the US welcomed efforts by the interim government to reduce instances of such violence.

""We condemn any instances of violence or intolerance directed toward members of minority communities in any country and have welcomed measures taken by Bangladesh's interim government to ensure safety and security for all in Bangladesh. That's what we're watching. That's what we expect. And that will be what continues,"" Bruce said.

The Bangladesh interim government has expressed deep concern over Tulsi Gabbard's remarks on an ""Islamist caliphate,"" stating that her comments are both ""misleading and damaging"" to the country's image and reputation.

""We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged ""persecution and killing"" of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that ""the threat of Islamic terrorists"" in the country is ""rooted"" in the ""ideology and objective"" to ""rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate.

""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism"", Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement late on Monday.

Gabbard remarked during an interview with NDTV, where she explained the ideology of the ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements have influenced various countries.

Condemning Gabbard's statement, the Bangladesh government said her comments were not based on any evidence and unfairly generalised an entire nation.



""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts"", the statement read.

Plastic cups and time to readjust to Earth's gravity - that is what Sunita Williams, the United States astronaut whose eight-day mission to the International Space Station extended to a nine-month stay, will need to recover, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told NDTV Thursday afternoon.

But recover she, and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore, will, Mr Tyson said, explaining he was never worried about their safety or about them returning home. ""They are professional astronauts... they are selected not just because they are physically fit but also because they are emotionally fit, okay?""

""And when you are emotionally fit, things like, 'okay, instead of eight days it's nine months'... you don't see them freaking out or reacting in some way that would jeopardise the safety of the crew. So that's why I was never worried... even if everybody else was. At no time did I have sympathy for them.""

""I don't think they needed sympathy, personally,"" he declared. 

On Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore's road to recovery, Neil deGrasse Tyson said, ""There is no reason to think their muscles will not be able to hold them up... on the ISS they have many ways to exercise.""

""The difference is... when you spend this much time being weightless, your ability to orient for what is 'up' and 'down' is compromised because you never had to use these tools of the inner ear to establish 'up' and 'down' in space. Now I haven't been in space... but I have spoken to astronauts, friends of mine, who have spent a lot of time there, and they say typically they will recover within a week...""

But don't hand them glass cutlery just yet.

""... if you hand them a glass they just let go (because their muscles are weaker) So, make sure the first few beverages are in a plastic cup,"" Mr Tyson said with a smile.

Mr Tyson also played down any talk of Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore's mental status being affected, pointing out NASA selects its astronauts based on both strength of body and mind.

""There was food and water (even if it was recycled urine, which is normal up there!) and they are professional astronauts. The only thing... maybe they didn't bring extra pairs of underwear.""

Ms Williams, and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore, were flown back from the ISS late Tuesday/early Wednesday. They returned home in SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and were greeted by a pod of chattering dolphins as they splashed down of Florida's eastern coast.

They had flown to the ISS on June 5 last year. But the Boeing Starliner capsule that carried them to the ISS then had propulsion issues, meaning Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore had to wait... for nine months, during which time the United States held a presidential election, to come home.

But now they are, and visuals of the astronauts (and the two sent to bring them back) waving and smiling from inside the capsule after it landed on Earth were beamed live worldwide.

The flight back home, though, is only half the challenge to Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore returning to normal lives. The other involves a months-long rehabilitation programme to rebuild muscle mass and bone density; this will include strength training and mobility exercises.

A thumbs-up from a smiling Sunita Williams as she returns to Earth.

At the crux of these issues is the different levels of gravity on Earth and in space; for example, muscles activated by our everyday tasks here weaker because they don't need to work as hard in space.

On the delay in bringing Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore home, Mr Tyson said he had rarely been worried for their safety. ""The fact is we had options...when Plan A failed, we brought in Plan B - another rocket, from a whole other private company. The fact we had options is a sign that the space frontier is becoming part of everyday understanding of where human beings can be...""

The famous astrophysicist did, however, also suggest, ""Maybe if this is going to become more common (i.e., frequent trips to space) we will always have a spare rocket in the garage!""

""If I were NASA, or any other space agency, given how many rockets are available to us today, I'd put a rocket on reserve just for this occasion,"" Mr Tyson said.

A team of South African scientists expected to work together for months in a remote Antarctic research station was left shaken after one of them beat, threatened and sexually harassed at least two of his colleagues. The researchers at South Africa's SANAE IV outpost were supposed to spend at least another ten months in Antarctica, but they are now pleading to be rescued.

The South African crew of three women and six men includes a doctor who has her own skincare brand, a deputy team leader who assisted in making a short horror movie during a previous stint at the station, several engineers and a meteorologist, reported The New York Post.



While the crew member who is accused of making death threats and assault attempts was not identified, the South African National Antarctic Programme's official website lists the researchers' roster of the 9-member team as follows: Mbulaheni Kelcey Maewashe serves as the team leader and a senior meteorological technician, while Nivek Ghazi is the deputy team leader and an electronics engineer. Dr Sihle Mpho Lawana is also part of the team, along with Nkululeko Welcome Khoza, a mechanical engineer, and Athenkosi Mabope, a communications engineer. Geomarr van Tonder contributes as an electronics engineer, while Allowed Tumelo Seepane specializes as an instrumentation technician. Alian Stuart Jacobs plays a key role as a diesel mechanic, and Lebogang James Tsime is an electro-mechanical engineer, making the team a well-rounded group of professionals with diverse technical expertise.

The said colleague assaulted and sexually harassed his team members, even threatening to kill one of them, creating “an environment of fear and intimidation,” reported The Guardian.

“His behaviour has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing. I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim,” according to an email the team wrote to authorities.

Currently, there are no plans to rescue the research team. They are stuck in the base without any means of communication until December when a supply ship is scheduled to moor up.

“There were no incidents that required any of the nine overwintering team members to be brought back to Cape Town. All on the base is calm and under control,” South Africa's Environment Minister Dion George told The New York Times.

The United States has reiterated its stance on the protection of minority communities in Bangladesh, following comments by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to NDTV. Ms Gabbard's remarks, which linked Bangladesh to aspirations of an ""Islamist caliphate,"" have sparked diplomatic tensions between the two nations.

In a recent press briefing, US Department of State Spokesperson Tammy Bruce addressed concerns regarding violence against minority groups in Bangladesh. Ms Bruce said the US condemns such acts and acknowledged efforts by Bangladesh's interim government to address these issues.

""We condemn any instances of violence or intolerance directed toward members of minority communities in any country and have welcomed measures taken by Bangladesh's interim government to ensure safety and security for all in Bangladesh. That's what we're watching. That's what we expect. And that will be what continues,"" Ms Bruce said. 

In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Ms Gabbard, while discussing the prosecution of minorities in Bangladesh, discussed the ideology of an ""Islamic caliphate"" and its influence on extremist elements globally. 

""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are rooted in the same ideology and objective-which is to rule or govern with an Islamist caliphate,"" Ms Gabbard stated. 

The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus, expressed deep concern over Ms Gabbard's statements, describing the comments as ""misleading"" and ""damaging"" to the country's reputation.

""We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged 'persecution and killing' of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that 'the threat of Islamic terrorists' in the country is 'rooted' in the 'ideology and objective' to 'rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate,'"" the interim government stated. 

""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" the statement added. 

Since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities. 

According to reports, the Hizb ut-Tahrir, an extremist Islamist group outlawed in Bangladesh since October 2009, conducted its first public rally in Dhaka earlier this month, disregarding a longstanding governmental prohibition.  The demonstration, dubbed the ""March for Khilafah,"" started at the northern entrance of the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque after Friday prayers, drawing thousands of participants.

In October 2024, the Home Ministry outlawed this group as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).  In a statement on social media at the time, the government said, ""The outfit is involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist."" ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The Trump Organization and its local real estate partners have announced a new commercial tower project in India as the US president's family business seeks to tap demand in the world's most populous country.

India is already home to four Trump-branded residential complexes, making it the largest market outside America for his family business, with more projects on the slate.

Indian partner Tribeca Developers announced on Wednesday that it would develop a new ""Trump World Center"" in the western Indian city of Pune in partnership with real estate firm Kundan Spaces.

The project, expected to generate sales exceeding $289.6 million, will span more than 1.6 million square feet and feature ""two iconic glass towers with over 27 floors of office space"", a statement said.

""This new development marks The Trump Organization's first foray into commercial real estate in India and will join the extensive portfolio of Trump residential properties in the region,"" it said.

Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and the US president's second son, said in the statement that India had ""embraced the Trump brand"" with ""remarkable enthusiasm"".

""After our successful collaboration on several iconic residential projects, we are proud to launch our first commercial development in India,"" he said.

The US president is not involved in managing the family company but the Trump Organization's foreign business dealings have prompted criticism of possible conflicts of interest.

Eldest son Donald Trump Junior visited India in 2018, when the Trump Organization's local partners promised dinner with him to anyone who bought into a luxury development outside the capital New Delhi.

India's office market saw robust growth in 2024, with leasing activity across the top seven cities seeing a nearly 23 percent year-on-year increase, according to estimates by real estate management firm JLL.

An Illinois soccer coach and special education teacher, accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old student, has denied the charges, claiming to police that she is being targeted because she is “good-looking” and “a good person.”

Christina Formella, 30, appeared in court on Monday to face multiple felony charges, including one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and one count of criminal sexual assault, according to DuPage County officials. 

Her comments about her appearance and character emerged during an interview with detectives after her arrest during a traffic stop on March 16.

Initially denying the allegations, Formella claimed that people targeted her because she was ""good-looking"" and ""a good person who cared too much about [the victim],"" according to court documents obtained by WGN9. Formella also alleged that the teen had accessed her phone and sent incriminating messages to himself as part of a blackmail scheme.



The accused came to police attention on March 15 when the victim, then 15, and his mother reported inappropriate sexual contact with the boy's soccer coach and tutor to the Downers Grove Police Department.

A joint investigation by law enforcement and the DuPage County Children's Advocacy Center led authorities to allege that in December 2023, Formella sexually assaulted the student during a tutoring session inside a classroom before the school day began.

The victim's mother reportedly discovered the alleged assault while reviewing her son's text messages.

Downers Grove South High School officials confirmed to The Independent that Formella was immediately placed on administrative leave. She had been working as a special education teacher at the school since August 2020 and began volunteering as a soccer coach for both the boys' and girls' teams in 2021.

During an internal meeting on Monday, Board of Education President Don Renner stated that Formella is no longer allowed on school grounds.

At her court appearance, a judge denied the prosecutor's request to detain Formella before trial. She was released with conditions, including a ban on entering Downers Grove South High School and having contact with anyone under 18.

DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin called the allegations ""extremely disturbing,"" emphasizing that Formella abused her position of trust and authority. ""The type of abuse and behaviour alleged in this case will not be tolerated,"" he said.

In a statement to the school board, Renner expressed heartbreak for the victim and the broader school community, which he said felt betrayed by the allegations.

""Our top focus now is to support the victim and their family and to ensure the well-being and safety of all of our students,"" Renner stated, adding that families whose children had direct contact with Formella would be notified.

He also urged students to report any concerning behaviour to police or school officials, stressing that all reports are taken seriously.

The school continues to cooperate with law enforcement as the investigation progresses.

Formella's next court appearance is scheduled for April 14, 2025.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that a halt on energy strikes in the war with Russia could be established quickly, and that Ukraine would respond in kind if Moscow violated the terms of the ceasefire.

After speaking to U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday for the first time since disastrous Oval Office talks last month, Zelenskiy said Kyiv would draw up a list of facilities that could be subject to a partial ceasefire brokered by Washington.

That list, he said, could include not only energy infrastructure but also rail and port facilities.

""But I understand that until we agree (with Russia), until there is a corresponding document on even a partial ceasefire, I think that everything will fly,"" Zelenskiy told reporters at an online briefing, meaning drones and missiles.

The Ukrainian leader described his phone call with Trump as ""probably his most substantive and positive"" talks yet, adding that he had not felt under pressure.

Zelenskiy met Trump for talks on February 28 to discuss a minerals deal and the path to ending the war in Ukraine, but the meeting rapidly spiralled into acrimony in front of the world's media.

Asked on Wednesday if he still wanted Trump to visit Ukraine, Zelenskiy said he did and that he believed it would be helpful for the U.S. president in his efforts to halt the war.

Zelenskiy said he and Trump discussed the vast Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine during the phone call.

He added that he told Trump that Kyiv would be ready to discuss U.S. involvement in modernising and investing in the nuclear plant if it is returned to Ukraine.

Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine had received new supplies of several F-16 fighter jets, but he declined to say exactly how many or when exactly the delivery had happened.

India's space programme is limited only by the ambition of its people, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told NDTV Friday, in a free-wheeling interview that began with American astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's return from a nine-month stay in space.

Mr Tyson - who also spoke about the government-to-private enterprise shift in the space sector - referred to India landing a spacecraft near the Moon's South Pole in 2023.

India then became only the fourth country to successfully land on the lunar surface.

This was achieved at a cost of $75 million - a fraction of what NASA's missions cost.

""India was able to land at the south pole (on the Moon) for a fraction of the money the US spent... more power to you,"" he said, praising the Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, for the level of streamlining and efficiency in R&D and in building the rocket itself.

On the costs of a space programme, Mr Tyson pointed out the money India allots to ISRO, as a percentage of overall government funding, is almost the same amount as NASA gets in the US.

The discussion on India's space ambitions came out of a question about Elon Musk and the SpaceX rocket that brought Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore home. Mr Tyson was asked about the what role the private sector - in the US or India - could have in space exploration.

There is a role, Mr Tyson said, explaining that the private sector's involvement is necessary and natural, and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to him about this.

READ | ""No Sympathy For Sunita Williams Because..."": Neil deGrasse Tyson

""... what SpaceX has done is more of what NASA has already done. NASA built the space station on the back of a space shuttle, literally. NASA took cargo and astronauts... and now SpaceX, and other possibly competing companies, can take cargo and astronauts too.""

""That is great. That is how it should be. The real value of private enterprises is that once they see what needs to be done... they have the latitude to go out there and do it for less or more efficiently,"" he said.

READ | ""Private Players Will Make Space More Accessible"": ISRO

There is more streamlining in private enterprise and this is expected because, ""if the government is doing it first, then you don't even know how to streamline it because nobody has ever done this before"".

""And I know this,"" he said, ""because I spent some time with your Prime Minister. We chatted briefly during his trip to New York about future of space exploration in India, and he expressed strong interest in bringing private enterprises into that sector. He sees that this will be a natural evolution.""

On India's space dreams, Mr Tyson would not be drawn beyond saying, ""I think what matters are your ambitions and then, depending on your resources, you can achieve it slowly or quickly.""

He did, however, offer China as an example.

""When China was not allowed to participate in the ISS (this was after the US objected to technology transfer), they said, 'okay, we will go into space on our own'.""

""They had a growing economy and money, so they said, 'we want to send our first astronauts'. And they did that. They said, 'we want to put a rover on the Moon'. And they did that. They said, 'we want to build our space station'. And they are doing that...""

State senator Justin Eichorn, 40, arrested after allegedly trying to meet with 17-year-old girl found through sex ad

A Minnesota state lawmaker was charged with a felony in federal court for attempted coercion and enticement of a minor after responding to online sex ads and trying to arrange a meetup with a 17-year-old.

The Republican senator Justin Eichorn, 40, was arrested on Tuesday. The charges were filed on Wednesday and include details about Eichorn's alleged conduct. A similar state charge filed on Wednesday was dropped in favor of the federal charge.

Police in Bloomington, Minnesota, carried out a sex sting operation, placing ads, including photos, posing as a young woman on two websites known for human trafficking, according to an affidavit from FBI special agent Matthew Vogel. The ad claimed the woman was 18 and said: “cum $pend time with me.”

Republicans are expected to push to expel Eichorn on Thursday, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. Fellow Republicans, including state senate Republicans and the state Republican party, have called for him to resign, given the seriousness of the charges and the distraction it will cause him.

According to the charging documents, a phone number later identified as belonging to Eichorn texted about the ad on 11 March, asking if the woman was available that night. “What's a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight,” he wrote, according to the affidavit. He again asked about her availability on 12 March, asking: “Awesome where ya at and what's your rates.”

He allegedly requested a “qv”, meaning quick visit, and “hhr”, a half-hour, and asked what she charged. He also allegedly asked her how old she was. “kinda nervous 2 say,” the detective responded, then later said: “im 17 sry don't want u 2 b mad.”

On 13 March, Eichorn allegedly again asked for the purported woman's age and asked her to send a “naught pic of you to show me your real”. When the officer sent a photo of a clothed woman's cleavage, he allegedly responded: “Got anything with lot less clothes?”

Eichorn allegedly contacted the number again on 17 March, asking about rates and if she could meet for an “outcall”, meaning she would travel to him. When the officer said “bare is extra”, referring to sex without a condom, Eichorn allegedly responded: “Ok how much extra?”

The undercover officer again said she was under 18. “I just wanna have fun and no drama babe,” the officer wrote. Eichorn allegedly responded: “as long as your legal age I am fine.”

“I am 17…like I said don't want any drama but wanna be upfront cause one guy got hella mad at me,” the officer wrote back.

“Why was he so mad? I think age of consent is 17 when do ya turn 18 ?” Eichborn allegedly replied. The officer responded that they were not 18 until December.

“It's says age of consent is 16 … over 18 is in a position of authority over you like a teacher or friends parent,” Eichorn allegedly said.

The officer sent an address for a meetup, and Eichorn again allegedly sought a photo of the woman, asking her to take a picture in her bra and underwear holding up two fingers. Vogel, the FBI agent, wrote that in his experience, people seeking to pay for sex often do this to verify the person matches their ad.

Eichorn arrived at the agreed-upon location, where law enforcement approached him to make an arrest.

Police found two iPhones, an unopened Trojan condom and $129 in cash in his car.

Eichorn is one of five authors of a bill introduced this week that would classify “Trump derangement syndrome” as a mental illness. The derogatory term is often used by Trump supporters to claim liberals are obsessed with Trump to the point of being mentally ill.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Senate and House committee chairs warn against plan for US to relinquish command of Nato forces in Europe

Republicans on Capitol Hill are threatening a revolt against a defence shake-up reportedly planned by the Trump administration that could see the US relinquish its command of Nato forces in Europe.

The two top Republicans on the Senate and House of Representatives armed services committees, Roger Wicker and Mike Rogers, signaled their opposition in an extraordinary joint statement warning that the change would “risk undermining American deterrence around the globe”.

The statement – a rare display of congressional Republicans rebelling since Donald Trump's return to the White House – followed an NBC report that the Pentagon is considering giving up the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur), a position held by an American general since the Nato alliance was formed in 1949.

The proposed shake-up could also include folding separate US Europe and Africa military commands into a joint command structure based in Germany and the scrapping of plans to expand American forces in Japan as part of a military buildup in the far east.

Wicker and Rogers said such changes would not be accepted without recourse to Congress, which holds the “power of the purse” under US constitutional norms.

“US combatant commands are the tip of the American warfighting spear,” they said. “Therefore, we are very concerned about reports that claim DoD is considering unilateral changes on major strategic issues, including significant reductions to US forces stationed abroad, absent coordination with the White House and Congress.

“We will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the joint staff, and collaboration with Congress. Such moves risk undermining American deterrence around the globe and detracting from our negotiating positions with America's adversaries.”

Trump has already floated the idea of refusing to defend any Nato member that is attacked – an obligation enshrined under Nato's article five – if it is deemed to have fallen short of its defence spending commitments.

The two congressional leaders said they supported Trump's calls for Nato alliance partners to raise defence spending “to strengthen our alliance partnership” and pointedly added: “We support continuing America's leadership abroad.”

The Punchbowl news website said the statement reflected Republican defence hawks' “longstanding frustrations” with the Trump administration. It represents a jarring departure from Republicans' meek acceptance of White House encroachment on congressional prerogatives over spending in the two months since Trump returned to office, which has seen Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” impose brutal cuts on government.

The plans stem from proposed 8% cuts in the Pentagon budget floated by Pete Hegseth, last month.

Defence experts and retired generals say giving up the Saceur role would signal a wider abandonment of the US leadership role in Nato, which Trump has frequently criticised.

“For the United States to give up the role of supreme allied commander of Nato would be seen in Europe as a significant signal of walking away from the alliance,” retired Adm James Stavridis, who served in the role and as head of European Command from 2009 to 2013, told NBC.

“It would be a political mistake of epic proportion, and once we give it up, they are not going to give it back … This would be seen, correctly, as probably the first step toward leaving the alliance altogether.”

The current Saceur commander, Gen Chris Cavoli, will end his three-year stint this summer. The position has been the preserve of four-star US generals since Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme commander of allied forces in the second world war and a later Republican president, first held it. Other holders have included Alexander Haig, who also served as a White House chief of staff and US secretary of state.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President plans to sign executive order closing DoE; order is challenged before it is signed as NAACP calls it a ‘dark day for millions of American children'

USA Today has details of the executive order Donald Trump will sign at 4pm ET to dismantle the Department of Education, including that the president envisions states taking a greater role in determining their own policies around schooling.

The order will direct education secretary Linda McMahon to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States”, while ensuring “uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely”.

However, Trump can't order the department dismantled unilaterally, as it was created by an act of Congress and requires their approval. It's unclear if the GOP has the votes for that.

Here's more on what we can expect from the president later today, from USA Today:

Although Trump has reduced the agency's workforce dramatically in recent weeks, the agency still exists and continues to oversee vital federal funding programs for schools.

Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a statement to USA TODAY the order “will empower parents, states, and communities to take control and improve outcomes for all students.” He said recent test scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam “reveal a national crisis ‒ our children are falling behind.”

A final copy of the order was not available Wednesday, but it is expected to closely resemble a draft that USA TODAY and other media outlets reported earlier this month was prepared for Trump.

The order takes aim at “regulations and paperwork” required by the Department of Education, arguing federal guidance in the form of “Dear Colleague” letters from the department “redirect resources toward complying with ideological initiatives, which diverts staff time and attention away from schools' primary role of teaching,” according to the White House summary.

Federal funding for students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Title I funding for low-income schools and federal student loan payments will remain unchanged under the order while McMahon works on a plan to “bring these funds closer to states, localities, and more importantly, students,” a White House official said.

Under the order, education programs or activities that receive “any remaining Department of Education funds” will not be allowed to advance diversity, equity and inclusion or gender ideology, according to the White House summary.

After underperforming in the November elections, leading Democrats are looking for ways to regain the support of crucial voting groups across the country, including Tim Walz, who ran alongside Kamala Harris and is now touring Republican-held House districts.

In an interview with CNN, the Minnesota governor shared some of his worries of what Donald Trump may do over the next four years:

“It's going to get very dark,” Walz said, running through speculation that ranged from Trump soon ordering the arrest of a political opponent to trying to anoint a son as his successor in the White House.

While the administration denies it defied a judge's order halting deportation flights to El Salvador over the weekend, the episode is proof to Walz that judges are set to be ignored and impeached going forward. Tuesday's statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts rebuking the president's rhetoric on impeaching judges, without naming Trump, tells Walz that Roberts is also “scared of where things are going.”

“I'm a pretty low-key, middle of the road guy on this stuff. And I'm telling you, this is real,” Walz said. “My one skill set is to see over the horizon a little bit of what's coming, and this is what's coming.”

He also recounted how he quickly realized on election night that he would not be the next vice-president:

Walz knew they lost early on election night. Sitting around a table in a suite at the Mayflower Hotel that he had walked into thinking he'd be leaving as the vice president-elect, he could feel the mood shift among his staff as soon as the Virginia results started coming in soft for Harris.

They wanted to fly back that night. Gwen Walz, the governor's wife, told CNN that one of the things that sticks with her is that the Harris-Walz logo was already off the charter plane by the time they got to the airport.

These days, Walz said that thinking they were going to win “feels like an unforgivable sin.”

“I'm a little bit jaded now, knowing how tough this is because of that,” he said, then hearing the noise of the crowd waiting inside, said, “We'll see how these folks are.”

But Walz sees opportunities for Democrats to regain some of their mojo, if they clinch victory in special elections in the months to come:

If Democrats win in Wisconsin and then in the Virginia governor's race in November, Walz claimed, Trump's power will begin to erode as Republicans distance themselves. How that will happen when Trump is barely into a four-year term and already exerting executive power in unprecedented ways, and how Democrats keep their spirits up when even their chance at getting more power in the midterms is 18 months away, Walz is not sure.

“I don't think there's any limit to where he goes. The limit will be what the American public will put up with and when they push back,” Walz said. “This has happened everywhere when these authoritarians have come in. One day it looks like they're absolutely infallible and in total power, and the next day they and their entire families are gone.”

Not much new from Donald Trump at the Digital Asset Summit, where he delivered what appeared to be a pre-recorded address touting his policies towards cryptocurrencies.

“It's an honor to speak with you about how the United States is going to dominate crypto and the next generation of financial technologies,” he began, before taking a swipe at the Joe Biden's cautious approach towards the assets:

I signed an order creating the brand new strategic bitcoin reserve and the US digital asset stockpile, which will allow the federal government to maximize the value of its holdings instead of foolishly selling them for a fraction of their long term value, which is exactly what Biden did. He got a fraction of their value.

We expect to hear more from Trump at 4pm, when he is scheduled to sign his executive order to close the Department of Education.

No sign yet of Donald Trump at the crypto conference. Meanwhile, the Guardian's Dan Milmo and Ashifa Kassam report that Tesla's investors are growing worried that Elon Musk is spending too much of his time gutting the US government and not enough time navigating the challenges facing the electric vehicle manufacturer:

Tesla and Elon Musk are embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” and the electric carmaker's chief executive needs to cut back on his work for Donald Trump to stem the damage, one of the company's biggest supporters has said.

The warning came as Tesla announced a recall of 46,000 Cybertrucks in the US on Thursday to fix an exterior panel that could detach while driving.

It came as protesters announced on Wednesday they were planning what they described as their biggest day of action yet against the EV maker, with 500 demonstrations expected at Tesla showrooms around the world on 29 March.

It also emerged that the Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla from its event hours, citing security concerns.

Tesla shares have lost a third of their value over the past month because of a number of investor concerns including the impact on sales from Musk's high-profile involvement with the Trump administration, including gutting the public sector through his “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

A White House spokesperson just announced that Donald Trump will speak at the cryptocurrency focused Digital Asset Summit, in just a few minutes.

Since taking office, Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry, which spent big to help his campaign. Here's more on that:

Under the order, education programs or activities that receive “any remaining Department of Education funds” will not be allowed to advance diversity, equity and inclusion or gender ideology, according to the White House summary.

Donald Trump says his campaign to cut down government will save money, but Department of Education staffers who spoke to the Guardian's Michael Sainato said dismantling the agency – as the president is set to order today – may instead cost taxpayers money:

The education secretary, Linda McMahon, presented sweeping reductions at the US Department of Education as an efficiency drive, hailing firings and funding cuts as a “significant step toward restoring the greatness” of the country's schools system.

Staff inside the department disagree.

The Trump administration has axed many research programs which have yet to be completed, according to workers, putting years of work – on which the federal government spent tens of millions of dollars – to waste.

Nearly 50% of staff at the US Department of Education was fired last week, with more than 1,300 employees given termination notices and nearly 600 workers taking voluntary resignation offers. Offices covering research, data and statistics were decimated.

A Department of Education employee who survived the cuts likened the experience to a funeral. “People were crying, breaking down at the human toll,” they told the Guardian. “These people are not bureaucratic bloat: they're vital to helping improve educational outcomes for our nation's children, and to ensuring states comply with the law. It's death by a thousand cuts.”

The Trump administration insists that the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador over the weekend are gang members, but a relative of one of the deportees told the Guardian's Tom Phillips and Clavel Rangel that is not the case:

Donald Trump's White House has described the Venezuelan migrants deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador as “heinous monsters” and terrorists who “rape, maim and murder for sport”.

But relatives of Francisco Javier García Casique, a 24-year-old from the city of Maracay, say he was a hairdresser, not a crook.

“He has never been in prison, he is innocent, and he has always supported us with his work as a barber,” his younger brother, Sebastián García Casique, said from their family home in Venezuela.

Less than a week ago, the García brothers were preparing to be reunited, with Francisco telling relatives he expected to be deported from a US immigration detention facility to his South American homeland after being arrested by immigration officials on 2 March.

The flight was scheduled for last Friday. A family gathering was planned in Maracay. On Sunday those plans were shattered when El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, published a cinematographic propaganda video on social media showing scores of Venezuelan prisoners being frog-marched off planes and into custody in his country's “terrorism confinement centre”.

“It's him,” a shell-shocked Sebastián told their mother after spotting his sibling among those shackled men.

Meanwhile, we expect further updates today in the case of the suspected Venezuelan gang members flown by US immigration authorities to El Salvador over the weekend, possibly in violation of a judge's order.

The judge overseeing the case, James Boasberg, has given the government until 12pm ET to either provide specific details of the planes' itineraries and passengers, or invoke a national security exception to sharing the information. Boasberg has come under personal attack by the White House as he weighs the case, with Donald Trump suggesting he be impeached, and his press secretary Karoline Leavitt yesterday calling him a “Democrat activist”.

Immigration agents earlier this week arrested Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national with a valid visa doing research at Georgetown University, and accused him of having ties to Hamas, Politico reports.

Suri now faces deportation, in a case similar to the arrest earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and leader of protests on Columbia University's campus. Khalil's arrest prompted fears that the Trump administration will attempt to illegally deport foreigners in the country simply for speech they disapprove of, which appear to have been realized with Suri's detention.

Here's more on Suri's case, from Politico:

Masked agents arrested Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and postdoctoral fellow, outside his home in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, on Monday night, his lawyer said in a lawsuit fighting for his immediate release. The agents identified themselves as being with the Department of Homeland Security and told him the government had revoked his visa, the lawsuit says.

According to Suri's petition for release, he was put in deportation proceedings under the same rarely used provision of immigration law that the government has invoked to try to deport Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student and green card holder who led pro-Palestinian protests on campus. That provision gives the secretary of State the power to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines that their continued presence in the U.S. would threaten foreign policy.

Suri has no criminal record and has not been charged with a crime, his petition says. His detention and petition have not been previously reported.

Suri's lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, argued in his petition that Suri is being punished because of the Palestinian heritage of his wife — who is a U.S. citizen — and because the government suspects that he and his wife oppose U.S. foreign policy toward Israel.

…

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on Saturday that Suri's visa should be canceled for foreign policy reasons.

“Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” McLaughlin wrote on X. “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”

Another, perhaps more worrying sign, of the Trump administration's approach to economic policy was revealed yesterday, when commerce secretary Howard Lutnick recommended in a Fox News interview that people buy Tesla stock.

That's the electric car company led by Elon Musk, who is busy right now cutting down the US government at the behest of Lutnick's boss, Donald Trump.

Talk about a conflict of interest. Here's what the secretary said:

I think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla. It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap. It'll never be this cheap again. When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building, people are going to be dreaming of today, and … thinking gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk's stock.

US presidents typically do not comment on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. But, of course, Donald Trump is no typical US president, and late last night, he weighed in on the central bank's decision yesterday to hold rates steady, saying they should have been cut:

The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!

That date next month is when Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs, in which the US will impose levies on goods equal to whatever other countries put on American imports, goes into effect. It threatens to be a major disruptor to international trade, and one of the reasons why, in addition to keeping rates steady, the Fed cut its growth forecast for the US economy yesterday. Here's more:

The White House says Donald Trump will participate in an “education event” and sign an executive order at 4pm ET.

While they did not provide more details, this may be the announcement of his plan to shut down the Department of Education.

Big tech giants Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon and Elon Musk's X have lodged a formal complaint urging the Trump administration to target “coercive and discriminatory” Australian media laws.

The members of the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) responded to a request by the Office of the United States Trade Representative for “comments to assist in reviewing and identifying unfair trade practices and initiating all necessary actions to investigate harm from non-reciprocal trade arrangements”.

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policy, as well as overseeing negotiations with other countries.

In comments written to the trade chief on 11 March, the trade policy manager of the CCIA Amir Nasr highlighted Australia's News Media Bargaining Incentive as one of the “key examples” of discriminatory taxation of digital products and services.

Following a French scientist being denied entry to the US after immigration officers searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, we're interested in finding out more about any issues that people have experienced at the US border.

Other reports at the US border include a German national, who is a permanent US resident and was detained by US border officials. A Canadian citizen was also detained by US border authorities for almost two weeks over an incomplete visa.

Whether you, or someone you know has, experienced delays or were detained we'd like to hear from you. Did it happen during the current or previous administrations? What was your experience and how was it resolved? We're also interested in hearing from anyone who is considering changing their plans to visit the US. If you are thinking of cancelling your trip, why?

On the latest episode of This Is Gavin Newsom, the California governor interviewed his Minnesota counterpart, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz. “Thanks for having me,” Walz said, flashing a cheeky smile. “I'm kinda wondering where I fall on this list of guests.”

Walz was not only the first Democrat to make an appearance on Newsom's splashy new podcast, but also the first participant who had not cast doubt on the 2020 presidential election results or expressed sympathy for the mob that stormed the capitol on January 6.

Newsom has billed his podcast, launched at the beginning of March, as a platform for “honest discussions” with those who “agree AND disagree with us”. Many Democrats share his desire to expand their reach and influence across platforms – but his critics recoil at the approach. Newsom doesn't seem to conduct the interviews as a blue-state leader raring to defend progressive values – or even as a governor whose response to one of the costliest and most destructive natural disasters in recent memory was undermined by a relentless rightwing campaign of rumors and lies. Instead, he seems to take on the role of an anthropologist conducting fieldwork on the forces fueling Maga fervor – and Democrats' descent into the political wilderness.

It's a potentially high-stakes gambit for the term-limited governor widely believed to have national ambitions.

“You're taking a risk, doing a podcast, doing something to try to fill a void that's out there and hopefully using it as a platform to try and articulate our values to a broader audience,” Walz told Newsom. “But we've not figured this out yet.”

Since launching the podcast earlier this month, Newsom has taped a trio of friendly chats with rightwing figures reviled by the left: Steve Bannon, an architect of Donald Trump's political rise; Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA and a Maga-world darling; and Michael Savage, a longtime conservative talk-radio host whose Trumpian rhetoric preceded the president's rise. (According to the Wall Street Journal, Newsom sought help from his ex-wife and Trumpworld insider Kimberly Guilfoyle to connect with Kirk and Bannon.)

The Trump administration is now using popular anti-hunger programs, including food assistance and school lunch, as part of its attack against immigrants in the US – a move many say will prevent large numbers of families, especially children, from getting the food benefits they're eligible for.

In a recent memo, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins told senior staff at the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS): “It is essential to use all available legal authority to end any incentives in FNS benefit programs that encourage illegal immigration.”

In the accompanying press release, Rollins said, “The days in which taxpayer dollars are used to subsidize illegal immigration are over.”

While Rollins's directive does not change people's access, researchers, advocates and service providers say it's spreading misinformation about undocumented immigrants and could create a chilling effect among immigrant and mixed-status families – a trend seen during the first Trump administration.

The Trump administration's unprecedented pressure campaign on American higher education – which is forcing major universities to bow to its demands or risk investigations and the loss of millions of dollars in federal money – is so far facing little pushback from the schools affected.

That campaign escalated earlier this month, when the US government cancelled $400m in federal contracts and grants to Columbia University. In a subsequent letter, representatives of three federal agencies said they would reconsider that freeze only if Columbia agreed to conditions including more aggressively disciplining students who engage in pro-Palestinian disruptions, planning “comprehensive” reform of the school's admissions policies, and placing one of school's area studies departments under “academic receivership” – meaning under the control of an outside chair.

Other colleges and universities across the US have been watching to see how Columbia reacts to the letter, which is widely viewed as a test case for academic freedom. In an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education, Lee Bollinger, Columbia's former president, described the situation as “an authoritarian takeover”. Yet ahead of a Thursday deadline for compliance, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Columbia appears to be poised to yield to the Trump administration's demands.

The government's confrontation with Columbia, which critics describe as ideological blackmail and possibly illegal, is only one of a number of shots that the administration has fired in recent days across the bow of American elite higher education – and so far, opposition has been surprisingly minimal, as colleges and universities weigh whether to surrender, negotiate or fight back.

The Trump administration is working on a plan to create what conservatives have long demanded: a militarized buffer zone along the southern border in New Mexico that would be occupied by active-duty US troops, empowered to detain migrants who cross into the United States unlawfully, the Washington Post reports.

According to the Post, recent internal discussions have centered on deploying troops to a section of the border in New Mexico that would be turned into a kind of military installation, which would give the soldiers a legal right to detain migrants who “trespass” on the elongated base. Unauthorized migrants would then be held until they can be turned over to immigration officers.

The planning appears to focus on creating a vast military installation as a way around the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that bars soldiers from participating in most civilian law enforcement missions.

Calls to militarize the southern border are not new, but so far they have existed more in the realm of political rhetoric than reality.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I'm Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news over the next couple of hours.

We start with news that president Donald Trump will sign a long-anticipated executive order on Thursday that aims to shut down the Department of Education, acting on a key campaign pledge, according to a White House summary seen by Reuters.

Even before it was signed, the order was being challenged by a group of Democratic state attorneys general, who filed a lawsuit seeking to block Trump from dismantling the department and halt the layoffs of nearly half of its staff announced last week.

The NAACP, a leading civil rights group, also blasted the expected order as unconstitutional.

“This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement.

Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have attempted to shut down government programs and institutions such as the US Agency for International Development without congressional approval, but abolishing the Department of Education would be Trump's first bid to shut down a cabinet-level agency.

Trump cannot shutter the agency without congressional legislation, which could prove difficult. Trump's Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, but major legislation, such as a bill eliminating a cabinet-level agency, would need 60 votes and thus the support of seven Democrats to pass.

Senate Democrats have given no sign they would support abolishing the education department.

In other news:

Speaking from the podium of the White House briefing room, Donald Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused federal judges of ruling against the president for partisan reasons.

The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is working on a plan to create a buffer zone along the southern border in New Mexico that would be occupied by active-duty US troops, empowered to detain migrants who cross into the United States unlawfully.

A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request for a restraining order to block Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” from taking over of the US Institute for Peace, after the institute accused Musk's team of occupying the building by force.

Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she was “disturbed” by the way federal workers have been treated but would not be “cowed” by the threat of a well-funded primary challenger backed by Musk's fortune.

A North Dakota jury found Greenpeace liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to an energy company over protests against a pipeline being constructed in the state. Greenpeace said they will appeal the order for them to pay more than $660m in damages.

Vivian Jenna Wilson tells Teen Vogue she feels obliged to take stand for trans rights as Trump attacks community

Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk's eldest child, has spoken out publicly about her father, saying that Musk “definitely [did] a Nazi salute” at two rallies in January and that he is part of a White House that's “cartoonishly evil”.

In a new interview with Teen Vogue, her second interview with the media since she publicly denounced her father last year, Wilson, 20, said that the things her father has been doing in the federal government were “fucking cringe”.

“The Nazi salute shit was insane. Honey, we're going to call a fig a fig, and we're going to call a Nazi salute what it was,” Wilson said. ‘That shit was definitely a Nazi salute.”

Wilson entered the public eye last year after Musk spoke about her in a podcast, saying that he had been “tricked” into signing documents so that Wilson, who was 16 at the time, could receive gender-affirming medical treatment.

“I lost my son, essentially. They call it ‘deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it ‘deadnaming' is because your son is dead.” he said. Musk added that the experience made him vow “to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we're making some progress”.

In an interview with NBC News last year, Wilson said that Musk had been largely absent in her life and that he was often cruel to her for showing feminine traits when she was growing up. She went to California court in 2022 to officially remove “Musk” from her name, saying in court filings she “no longer live[s] with or wish[es] to be related to my biological father in any way shape or form”.

“He was cold,” she told NBC News. “He's very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.”

By law, Wilson had to get her father, whom she had not spoken to for months at that point, to sign off on her receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, since she was a minor at the time.

“I was constantly having mental breakdowns in the middle of class. I could not get through days. I didn't want to wake up, I didn't want to do anything. I just wanted to rot, pretty much. It was like, I cannot do this,” she said. “If I stay in the closet anymore, this is going to take me down a very destructive path.”

Wilson, who is currently a student in Tokyo, said that she felt obligated to talk about trans issues as someone who transitioned as a minor.

“There's so much villainization of that, and I would really like to raise awareness of the fact that trans care for minors, especially puberty blockers, is really important,” she said. “Maybe stop demonizing these literal children or the people around these children who are just trying to help them feel comfortable in their own skin.”

Over the last several years, conservatives have targeted the transgender community through legislation. Since coming into office, Trump has signed executive orders banning transgender people from the military and from participating in women's sports. On Wednesday, a federal judge blocked Trump's ban on trans people serving in the military.

“As a trans woman, I am terrified of losing access to guaranteed medical care. If I didn't medically transition at the age I did, I don't know what would've happened,” Wilson said.

Wilson said that her mother, Justine Musk, Musk's first wife, had been supportive of her and that she “doesn't keep up with [Musk's] side of the family”. Musk, an outspoken pronatalist, has 14 children with four different women.

When asked whether she is on good terms with her siblings, Wilson responded: “I will say I do not actually know how many siblings I have, if you include half-siblings.”

Though her father is a billionaire who is playing a major role in the Trump administration, Wilson said Musk doesn't loom large in her life.

“People thrive off of fear. I'm not giving anyone that space in my mind,” she said. “The only thing that gets to live free in my mind are drag queens.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's efforts to promote the tech CEO on Fox News backfired amid national protests

Donald Trump's commerce secretary told Americans to buy stock in Elon Musk's electric car company, only for shares in Tesla to keep falling.

“I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,” Howard Lutnick told Fox News on Wednesday. “It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap. It'll never be this cheap again.”

He added: “I mean, who wouldn't invest in Elon Musk? You gotta be kidding me.”

Regarding Tesla at least, the answer appears to be: lots of people. In the last month, shares have lost a third of their value. After Lutnick spoke, Tesla was down again in pre-market trading on Thursday.

Musk donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's re-election campaign and is now slashing government staffing and budgets under the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – work proving increasingly unpopular and damaging to his businesses. Amid protests that have included vandalism of Teslas and dealerships, Musk has claimed to have done nothing wrong.

On Tuesday, he told Fox: “It turns out when you take away the money people get fraudulently, they get very upset. They basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we are stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government. I guess they are bad people. Bad people do bad things.”

Republicans have attacked Democrats for speaking out against Tesla. Observers have pointed out how the same Republicans have attacked companies for promoting values they do not share, celebrating financial reverses.

Tesla's problems continue to grow. Last week, JP Morgan said: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.”

This week, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush and a major Tesla backer, said brand damage caused by Musk's work for Trump “has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterize as a brand tornado crisis moment”.

Lutnick spoke to Jesse Watters, a Fox primetime host and Trump cheerleader.

“It's just so outrageous,” the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO said. “You have probably the best entrepreneur, the best technologist, the best leader of any set of companies in America working for America, and you have this sort of weird side of the Democratic party attacking him.”

Lutnick repeated the claim that Musk “rescued” astronauts from the International Space Station via his SpaceX company on Wednesday – yet in fact, Nasa chose to wait for SpaceX to be ready for the mission.

Lutnick urged viewers to “buy Tesla” and expressed disbelief about the shares' performance.

He continued: “When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building, people are going to be dreaming of today and Jesse Watters, thinking, ‘Gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk's stock' … Whether today's the bottom or not, I tell you what, Elon Musk is probably the best person to bet on I've ever met. And I think we all know that.”

Lutnick and Watters then engaged in cheerful promotion of $30,000 robots for domestic chores that the commerce secretary said Musk would soon bring to market.

Concern is growing about conflicts of interest involving Musk and whether he is profiting from his government work. This week, as Musk's Starlink internet service was installed at the White House, senior Democrats called for investigations.

Lutnick told Fox: “Elon Musk is the best entrepreneur and technologist in America, and I bet on him. I wish I was allowed [to buy Tesla stock]. I'm not allowed to buy any stock.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Experts warn new memo could deter families from accessing food assistance, despite no changes to eligibility rules

The Trump administration is now using popular anti-hunger programs, including food assistance and school lunch, as part of its attack against immigrants in the US – a move many say will prevent large numbers of families, especially children, from getting the food benefits they're eligible for.

In a recent memo, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins told senior staff at the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS): “It is essential to use all available legal authority to end any incentives in FNS benefit programs that encourage illegal immigration.”

In the accompanying press release, Rollins said, “The days in which taxpayer dollars are used to subsidize illegal immigration are over.”

While Rollins's directive does not change people's access, researchers, advocates and service providers say it's spreading misinformation about undocumented immigrants and could create a chilling effect among immigrant and mixed-status families – a trend seen during the first Trump administration.

“It's posturing to try to harm communities,” said Juan Carlos Gomez, an immigration and immigrant families senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy (Clasp), of the memo. Undocumented immigrants have been ineligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which is used by more than 42 million people, long before Trump's first term, and even immigrants who are authorized to be in the US have to wait five years before applying.

“That nugget of misinformation from the secretary”, he said, is like a seed that will continue to grow, so that people start “thinking undocumented immigrants are getting benefits they're not”.

Other FNS programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, which provides low-cost or free lunches to around 30 million schoolchildren, or the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which supplements the diets for low-income families with free USDA foods distributed by food banks, don't have citizenship requirements like Snap.

“It really feels like immigrant families are being targeted to have food taken away from their plates in their households,” said California State University, San Bernadino professor Emily Loveland, who researches social welfare programs like Snap.

Snap, which offers an average of about $6 per day per person, is already difficult to access and use. There are complicated eligibility rules and applicants must submit verification and complete an interview to receive food benefits. Both Democrats and Republicans have made cuts or changes to Snap in the past, and House Republicans have recently targeted the program in its budget reconciliation as a way to pay for an extension of the 2017 tax bill that benefits the very wealthy.

“[The directive] is part of a broader story to villainize people who receive benefits,” said Lily Roberts, the managing director for inclusive growth at the Center for American Progress. “It's ultimately part of a plan to get rid of benefits, whether through administrative action, illegal Doge work or the congressional reconciliation plan to cut Snap and Medicaid as a trade for tax cuts for the wealthy.”

If the Trump administration wants to change people's access to Snap, it can only be done by changing the law, not by executive order or directive. Still, even the perceived threat of policy change is enough to produce chilling effects that directly impact the health of immigrant households in the US.

Research has shown that in 2016, a proposed change to the public charge rule – which determines if people seeking immigration status would be likely to become dependent on government assistance – led to “significant and large decreases” in immigrant families' participation in food and nutrition assistance programs such as Snap, the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program.

“I think we learned in the first Trump administration that rhetoric matters a lot for people's actual behavior,” said Chloe East, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Denver who studies safety net and social insurance programs and immigration policy. “Even households with US citizen kids in them will be less likely to receive Snap because the parents are afraid it might impact their immigration status or it might lead to a deportation.”

One-quarter of all US children have at least one immigrant parent, and around 4.4 million of them live with an undocumented parent.

Based on Census Bureau data from 2016 through 2019, Migration Policy Institute researchers found that participation in Snap, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tanf) and Medicaid declined twice as fast among noncitizens as citizens during the first three years of the first Trump administration. During that time, Snap participation fell by 37%.

In 2020, the controversial public charge revisions went into effect, making it harder for immigrants to obtain green cards or temporary visas if they participated in federal means-tested public benefit programs like Snap. The entire process sowed confusion and fear, so that even refugees and children born in the US – groups who aren't required to have a public charge assessment – went without needed food assistance because they worried about themselves or a family member being denied a green card.

(The Trump administration's public charge rule was later struck down by multiple courts and withdrawn by the Biden administration.)

Based on what happened with public charge in the past, Clasp's Gomez and other immigrant advocates expect to see a similar pattern of disenrollment in Snap and other nutrition programs because of the agriculture secretary's memo, which was published 25 February, along with other anti-immigrant policies from the administration.

“These executive orders and directives are confusing service providers who already have to deal with this long laundry list of who is eligible for what,” he said. “That's the effect we're going to see across all immigrant communities, this confusion of what people are or aren't eligible for even though at the end of the day, an executive order or a secretary putting out a letter doesn't change the law.”

East expected the new administration to come after immigration eligibility or immigrants' access to Snap via changes around work requirements or some kind of public charge rule again. “What I did not expect was the current budget reconciliation proposals, which would really gut the program overall,” she said. “They're using all the non-legislative tools they can to reduce access to Snap, but what will happen legislatively is very hard to predict.”

Loveland thinks the USDA could try to adjust requirements for nutrition programs that don't require proof of citizenship, such as school food programs and TEFAP, which could ultimately mean that undocumented people may no longer be able to access them and would have to rely on already strained private charity food programs or risk food insecurity. If the National School Lunch Program was restricted, it could mean undocumented students would go without free or reduced price school meals.

“Though their plans to restrict any policy requirements are currently vague, my concern is that even an announcement of an intent to target these programs could have a chilling effect amongst immigrant families, like what happened with Snap and the 2019 public charge rule,” she said. “They're pivoting their concerns to an ideological attack on immigrants, which isn't even based in fact or reality.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Wendell Grissom, executed for fatally shooting a woman, will be one of four people put to death in US this week

Oklahoma executed a man on Thursday for fatally shooting a woman during a home invasion and robbery 20 years ago.

Wendell Grissom, 56, was declared dead by lethal injection at the Oklahoma state penitentiary in McAlester at 10.13am, a prison official told the Associated Press. It was Oklahoma's first execution of 2025.

Grissom and a co-defendant, Jessie Floyd Johns, were convicted of killing of Amber Matthews, 23, and wounding her friend, Dreu Kopf, at Kopf's Blaine county residence. Johns was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Three other executions were scheduled this week around the United States: Louisiana put a man to death on Tuesday using nitrogen gas for the first time as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus. A man who kidnapped and murdered his girlfriend's ex-husband was executed on Wednesday in Arizona by lethal injection. Another lethal injection is scheduled for Thursday in Florida.

Prosecutors said Grissom, who had a lengthy criminal record, picked up Johns, who was hitchhiking, and the two men were driving west on Interstate 40 when they decided to commit robberies. They randomly selected Kopf's home near Watonga, where Matthews was visiting Kopf and her two young children.

Matthews was shot twice in the head and left clinging to life on the floor as Kopf, also shot twice and seriously wounded, managed to flee in Grissom's truck to get help, prosecutors said. Grissom and Johns also fled, on a stolen four-wheeler, but quickly ran out of gas and were captured after hitching a ride to a cafe in a nearby county.

Authorities found Kopf's children still inside the home, physically unhurt. Matthews died after being flown by helicopter to an Oklahoma City hospital.

Grissom's attorneys did not dispute his guilt but argued at a clemency hearing that he suffered from brain damage that was never presented to a jury. The state's pardon and parole Board denied Grissom's request.

Grissom's attorneys told the board he always accepted responsibility and wrote an apology to Matthews's family during his first interview with police.

“He cannot change the past, but he is now and always has been deeply ashamed and remorseful,” said Kristi Christopher, an attorney with the federal public defender's office.

Kopf told the board that she still carries deep mental and physical scars from the attack, including bullet fragments that remain in her body. She said that in the years since the attack she has called 911 when the doorbell rings unexpectedly or a stranger appears in her neighborhood.

“I lived in a heightened state of fear at all times,” she said tearfully.

The Oklahoma attorney general, Gentner Drummond has called Matthews's killing a “textbook” death penalty case.

“The crimes committed by Grissom – random, brutal attacks on innocent strangers in the sanctity of their own home – are the very kind that keep people awake at night,” Drummond said during last month's hearing.

The lethal injection in December of Kevin Ray Underwood was the 127th execution by the state of Oklahoma since the US reinstated the death penalty in 1976, state prison records show.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Dan Ives warns company is in ‘brand tornado crisis moment' as it is removed from Vancouver auto show

Tesla and Elon Musk are embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” and the electric carmaker's chief executive needs to cut back on his work for Donald Trump to stem the damage, one of the company's biggest supporters has said.

The warning came as Tesla announced a recall of 46,000 Cybertrucks in the US on Thursday to fix an exterior panel that could detach while driving.

It came as protesters announced on Wednesday they were planning what they described as their biggest day of action yet against the EV maker, with 500 demonstrations expected at Tesla showrooms around the world on 29 March.

It also emerged that the Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla from its event hours, citing security concerns.

Tesla shares have lost a third of their value over the past month because of a number of investor concerns including the impact on sales from Musk's high-profile involvement with the Trump administration, including gutting some federal agencies through his “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

Dan Ives, the managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush and a self-described Tesla “core bull”, said Musk's role leading Doge was damaging the multibillionaire's personal reputation and the business he runs.

“The brand damage started off as limited in our view based on our initial survey work … but now has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterise as a brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.

Musk has axed jobs and spending in his role, although a US judge ruled on Tuesday that Musk and Doge were likely to have violated the US constitution by shutting down the US Agency for International Development.

Ives cited protests at Tesla showrooms, cars being vandalised and demonstrations sprouting around the world as evidence of a “massive overhang for Tesla's stock”. He said Musk faced a “moment of truth” and needed to act.

“Tesla and Musk are facing a defining chapter in their future and how Musk handles this next few months will be pivotal to the long term growth trajectory of Tesla in our view. Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla … they are synonymous and attached together and cannot be separated,” he wrote.

Ives said Musk had to do two things to stop the crisis snowballing into a “much more black swan event” – a reference to an unforeseen event with wide-ranging consequences.

Ives said Musk needed to formally announce he was going to balance running Doge with being Tesla's chief executive. Doing so would “dissipate” the heat around Tesla and ensure there wa not permanent brand damage, although there would still be a “scar”, he said.

“Investors need to see Musk take a step back and balance his Doge and Tesla CEO roles,” Ives said.

He also called on Musk to set out a roadmap and timing for the release of new, lower-cost vehicles along with the rollout of fully self-driving vehicles in Austin, Texas, in June. “There is one person Tesla investors need to hear from … Musk,” Ives said.

The Vancouver Auto Show announced it was removing Tesla hours before the show got under way on Wednesday in western Canada, with organisers telling reporters that the decision had not been made lightly.

“The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw,” said Eric Nicholl, the show's executive director, in a statement.

“The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors and staff. This decision will ensure all attendees can be solely focused on enjoying the many positive elements of the event.”

Last year, nearly 130,000 people attended the show. Organisers said they were expecting a similar turnout for this year's lineup of 200 or so vehicles.

For months Musk has faced a backlash in Canada over his backing of Trump, which has intensified in recent weeks after the president plunged Canada into a bitter trade war and repeatedly mused about the country becoming the 51st state of the US.

More than 375,000 people in Canada have signed a petition, launched in late February, to strip Musk of his Canadian citizenship.

Meanwhile Tesla Takedown, which organises protests against Tesla and Musk, announced a “day of action” including protests at every showroom in the US and at a total of 500 sites around the world. In a post on social media the group urged protesters to “turn out in numbers to fight Elon Musk's illegal coup”.

In an interview this week Musk called Tesla protesters “deranged” and blamed the protests on his involvement with Doge. “They basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we're stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government,” Musk told Fox News.

The Tesla recall issued on Thursday was related to a part called a cant rail – a stainless-steel exterior trim panel – delaminating and detaching from the vehicle, the company said. As a remedy, Tesla will replace the rail assembly free of charge.

A detached panel can become a road hazard and increase the risk of a crash, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's notice on the recalls.

Protesters accuse PM of continuing Gaza war for political reasons and ignoring plight of hostages still held by Hamas

Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for a new ceasefire in Gaza and to protest against what they say is an attack on the country's democracy by the rightwing governing coalition of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Key highways have been blocked and police have made at least 12 arrests amid heated scenes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. More protests were expected in the coming days as the campaign “gathers momentum and energy”, campaigners said.

The immediate trigger for the anger was Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, but the prime minister's decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has fuelled the demonstrations.

Protesters accuse the government of continuing the war for political reasons and ignoring the plight of the 59 hostages – about 24 of whom are believed to be alive – still held by Hamas in the devastated Palestinian territory.

“This government has now also started a war, once again, to protect itself, to divert the discourse from the things that bother the public in Israel. The government has lost all legitimacy on every possible level … They are failing,” said Eitan Herzel, chief executive of the Brothers in Arms protest movement.

On Wednesday thousands packed streets close to Netanyahu's official residence in central Jerusalem. Many carried Israeli flags and placards with slogans in support of hostages still held in Gaza. Others beat drums and chanted “hostages deal now” as they marched in from other parts of Israel.

Ora Nakash Peled, a former senior naval officer and an organiser of the protests, had come from her home on a kibbutz near the northern city of Haifa. She had spent the night with other protesters in a tented camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem before walking into the city along a major highway.

“I think we have made our point … We need to be organised, we need to be persistent, we need to be focused. [The protest] cannot be violent [but] it doesn't have to be polite.”

Protesters chanted: “Israel is not Turkey, Israel is not Iran,” and pointed to a series of recent moves by Netanyahu they call “red flags” for Israeli democracy.

One is the unprecedented effort to dismiss Bar. Another is a bid by the prime minister and his allies to oust the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has argued that removing Bar from his post might be unlawful.

“The government has the authority to fire Bar but still has to comply with administrative law,” said Dr Amir Fuchs, a legal expert at the Israel Democracy Institute. “So, for example, if there is seen to be a conflict of interests, it could be stopped by the supreme court.”

Experts point out that Shin Bet, which has wide-ranging powers, is investigating Netanyahu's close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and taking money from Qatar, which is know to have given significant financial aid to Hamas. New suspects in the “Qatargate” affair were interviewed by Israeli police on Wednesday, local media reported.

Netanyahu is also facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who took power in Israel for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.

Other concerns for protesters include reforms that would introduce more political appointees to committees that select judges.

A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for the mistakes and misjudgements that led to the Hamas attack in October 2023 have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel's worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.

Fuchs said: “Netanyahu is doing this because he has a problem he wants to solve by centralising as much power as possible and getting rid of all the gatekeepers and professionals … but this does not align with the interests of the state of Israel, only with those of the prime minister and his government.”

Netanyahu claimed there was a “leftist deep state” working against him in a social media post on Wednesday.

“In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist deep state weaponises the justice system to thwart the people's will. They won't win in either place!” the post said.

Observers pointed to a strong echo in the current movement of the huge protests that erupted in 2023 when Netanyahu attempted to sack the then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul.

Opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose an election if one were held now, but he is likely to defy the protests, which are smaller than those two years ago, and ignore calls for new polls. A crucial budget vote before the end of the month now looks likely to go in the government's favour.

The return of Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extreme rightwing politician, to the government after he walked out over the ceasefire deal signed in January has underlined the continuing and vital support for Netanyahu from the nationalist-religious camp in Israel.

Analysts said previously fragmented opposition groups had been brought together in recent days, though there are still no political leaders who look likely to threaten Netanyahu.

“It's a very strong homogeneous [governing] coalition. It has a solid base and it is hard to see it falling apart. There is still no alternative or vision to Netanyahu being put forward,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israeli society and politics at the International Crisis Group.

Though protesters say they back a ceasefire now to ensure the return of the hostages, most reflect broader Israeli public opinion and believe the war in Gaza is necessary to eliminate any threat from Hamas.

Zonszein said the demonstrations could not be described as “anti-war”.

“It is not about what is happening in Gaza at all. It is not about civilian casualties there … It is focused on the hostages and the lack of trust in the government.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

People gather at city hall and students march in anger at arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu, a likely opposition candidate for presidency

Outside Istanbul's city hall on Wednesday night a mass of protesters gathered in the freezing air to defy a city-wide ban on gatherings. A banner bearing a portrait of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, giving a speech alongside the words “sovereignty belongs unconditionally to the nation” covered part of the facade of his now vacant office.

In dawn raids that morning police had detained İmamoğlu, the only contender seen as capable of defeating Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in presidential elections. For many residents of Turkey's largest city, the arrest symbolised how far the state was willing to go to remove a perceived threat to the incumbent president.

Lines of armoured water cannon trucks were lined up and riot police massed beneath the arches of a nearby Roman aqueduct, some marching to the edge of the protest that filled the park around the city hall. Illuminated by the lights from a nearby minaret, a group of teenagers waved Turkish flags and smoked cigarettes as they sat atop a high wall to get a view of the assembled crowds.

“I'm not here for political reasons. This is about something more than politics; this is about injustice,” said Beril, an Istanbul university student who was protesting with her mother. She said she had been shocked at the number of armed police on campus to repress the protests, although it had done little to quell the anger.

Like most protesters gathered outside the city hall, Beril and her mother declined to give their full names, fearing the consequences of attending the demonstration as lines of riot police marched past. “We have laws on the books here that are not being obeyed. So there is no rule of law,” her mother said, breaking off to join in chants demanding the government resign.

While some of those who had gathered were faithful to the opposition Republican People's party (CHP), most said they felt compelled to defy the protest ban imposed by the Istanbul governor in order to defend what remained of Turkish democracy.

İmamoğlu and more than 100 others were ordered to be detained in two separate cases brought by the Istanbul prosecutor's office. The first accuses Istanbul's mayor and dozens of others of financial corruption and embezzlement. The second accuses him of “aiding a terrorist organisation” by working with a banned Kurdish militant group prior to local elections last year, when Erdoğan's party suffered significant losses.

Wednesday's arrests marked a dramatic escalation in a crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey which has been led by Erdoğan – a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies – as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. His term runs until 2028 but he has indicated he would like to serve longer – something he could achieve with a constitutional change or if early elections are called.

On Thursday the interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said a further 37 people had been detained on suspicion of making “provocative posts inciting crime and hatred” about İmamoğlu's detention.

The justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, rebuffed suggestions that İmamoğlu's arrest was politicised, and labelled calls for street protests as “disinformation”.

A group of lawyers gathered on the edge of Saraçhane park around the city hall scoffed at Tunç's statement, and said they were demonstrating because they felt the government no longer cared to follow the rules set out in Turkey's constitution. None were CHP supporters, they added. “This situation is a step closer towards one-man rule, and we have to do something about it,” said a lawyer who gave her name as Özlem. “The government isn't following the law.”

Another group of recent university graduates said they were protesting “because we could not be silent in the face of this injustice”.

“He is our hope,” one said emphatically of İmamoğlu, who was widely expected to be named as CHP's candidate for president in a primary vote in just a few days. The 53-year-old mayor, who swept into office on a wave of popular support in 2019, defying efforts to annul his first victory and later a political ban, is widely seen as Erdoğan's nemesis and his only true challenger.

“They can't put İmamoğlu in jail – if they try to do that, he'll only get more support,” said the protester. He said he struggled to believe the authorities would dare to keep the mayor behind bars, but believed that if they did, it would only spur more protests.

“We got too complacent about the situation here, so now this could really be the beginning of something,” his friend said. CHP officials called for further protests on Thursday, shortly after İmamoğlu was taken for questioning in custody.

Another young protester walked past carrying a sign that read: “Don't be afraid, we are the people”, a slogan of the Gezi park protests in 2013 that marked a major point of civil unrest and anti-government sentiment.

“Ekrem İmamoğlu's only crime is leading in the polls,” the CHP leader, Özgür Özel, told the assembled crowds, who responded with cheers. “This is nothing but an attempt to overthrow the national will.”

On Thursday, hundreds of university students held a peaceful march in Istanbul to protest against the detentions. Another demonstration was planned outside the city hall on Thursday evening.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Chipmaker's promise is a sign that Trump's ‘America First' policy is affecting investment

The boss of the world's biggest computer chipmaker, Nvidia, has promised that the company will shell out “several hundred billion” dollars to make semiconductors and other electronics in the US over the next four years.

The comments from Jensen Huang illustrate how the California-headquartered AI chipmaker is remodelling its supply chain away from Asia amid unpredictable tariff threats by Donald Trump.

The chief executive, who also co-founded Nvidia, told the Financial Times: “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total. And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.”

The remarks are the latest example of how Trump's “America First” policy is having an impact on business investment, even forcing groups such as Nvidia – which is among the world's most valuable companies – to rethink their global footprint.

The Silicon Valley company, founded in 1993, has been the engine of the AI market boom, with hype around the technology propelling its valuation to a stratospheric $2.9tn (£2.2tn). But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China's territorial designs on its neighbour.

Huang said he was confident that Nvidia was well-positioned to deal with any worsening situation in Taiwan, which is also vulnerable to earthquakes. “At this point, we know that we can manufacture in the US, we have a sufficiently diversified supply chain,” he added.

He added that the Trump administration could be in a position to bolster the US AI industry at a time of growing competition from China.

Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they've engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei's continued success.

For now, “having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the US”, Huang said, referring to the large amount of electricity needed to power its chips in datacentres.

Efforts to onshore manufacturing have been helped by a recent $100bn US investment by TSMC. The Taiwanese semiconductor firm's investment means that Nvidia's Blackwell chips – its top-of-the-line graphics processing unit – are being produced in the US, providing for “a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Homeland security said Marco Rubio had determined that Badar Khan Suri's alleged activities ‘rendered him deportable', without providing evidence

US President Donald Trump's administration has detained an Indian man studying at Washington's Georgetown University and is seeking to deport him after deeming him a harm to US foreign policy, the student's lawyer said on Wednesday.

The US Department of Homeland Security accused Badar Khan Suri of ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas and said he had spread Hamas propaganda and antisemitism on social media, according to a statement it shared with Fox News.

The DHS statement to Fox News, which was reposted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, did not cite evidence. It said secretary of state Marco Rubio determined that Suri's activities “rendered him deportable”.

Suri – who is living in the US on a student visa and is married to an American citizen – has been detained in Alexandria, Louisiana, and is awaiting a court date in immigration court, his lawyer said. Federal agents arrested him outside his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, on Monday night.

The case comes as Trump seeks to deport foreigners who took part in pro-Palestinian protests against US ally Israel's war in Gaza after an October 2023 Hamas attack, including Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia graduate.

Trump's measures have sparked outcry from civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups who accuse his administration of unfairly targeting political critics.

Suri is a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown's Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, which is part of the university's School of Foreign Service. His arrest was first reported by Politico.

“If an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar,” Suri's lawyer said in an email.

A Georgetown University spokesperson said the university had not received a reason for Suri's detention and it was not aware of Suri engaging in any illegal activity.

Suri's wife, Mapheze Saleh, is a US citizen, said his lawyer. Saleh is from Gaza, according to the Georgetown University website, which said she has written for Al Jazeera and Palestinian media outlets and worked with the ministry of foreign affairs in Gaza.

Suri himself has been teaching a class this semester on “Majoritarianism and Minority Rights in South Asia” and has a PhD in peace and conflict studies from a university in India, according to the Georgetown University website.

Earlier this month the Trump administration arrested and sought to deport Khalil over his participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is challenging his detention in court.

Trump, without evidence, has accused Khalil of supporting Hamas. Khalil's legal team says he has no links to the militant group that the US designates as a “foreign terrorist organization.“

Trump has alleged pro-Palestinian protesters are antisemitic. Pro-Palestinian advocates, including some Jewish groups, say that their criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza and their support for Palestinian rights is wrongly conflated with antisemitism by their critics.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Administration reportedly working to fulfill a conservative dream: create buffer zone to be occupied by US troops

The Trump administration is working on a plan to create what conservatives have long demanded: a militarized buffer zone along the southern border in New Mexico that would be occupied by active-duty US troops, empowered to detain people who cross into the United States unlawfully, the Washington Post reports.

According to the Post, recent internal discussions have centered on deploying troops to a section of the border in New Mexico that would be turned into a kind of military installation, which would give the soldiers a legal right to detain immigrants who “trespass” on the elongated base. Unauthorized immigrants would then be held until they can be turned over to immigration officers.

The planning appears to focus on creating a vast military installation as a way around the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that bars soldiers from participating in most civilian law enforcement missions.

Calls to militarize the southern border are not new, but so far they have existed more in the realm of political rhetoric than reality.

In 2022, Blake Masters, an Arizona Senate candidate enthusiastically backed by Peter Thiel, the same tech billionaire who bankrolled JD Vance's campaign that year, ran a campaign ad promising to do just that.

In 2018, Trump abruptly announced during a White House meeting with then defense secretary Jim Mattis: “We are going to be guarding our border with our military. That's a big step.”

Although the US president's announcement sparked a flurry of reports, in the Washington Post and elsewhere, that he was serious about the proposal, it was never enacted at scale.

Seven months later, as Trump focused on the supposed threat of a migrant “caravan” on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, Mattis defended the limited presence of troops at the southern border by saying: “We don't do stunts in this department”.

Mattis's successor, Mark Esper, revealed in his memoir that Trump had apparently asked him to violate the Posse Comitatus Act in 2020. According to Esper, Trump asked him, a week after the murder of George Floyd, to deploy 10,000 active-duty troops to the streets of the nation's capital and have them open fire on protesters. “Can't you just shoot them?” Trump asked, in an Oval Office meeting. “Just shoot them in the legs or something?” Esper declined to do so.

One big difference between 2018, 2020 and 2025, however, is that Trump will not have to convince a sober, former general like Mattis or a West Point graduate like Esper to carry out his plan to divert military resources to domestic law enforcement, since his current defense secretary is a former weekend TV host who is far less likely to object.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The US has sent hundreds of migrants to El Salvador to be held without trial in Cecot, a controversial prison known for its harsh conditions

The US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador to be held without trial in a controversial mega-prison known for its harsh conditions. The facility has drawn praise from hardline law-and-order politicians at home and abroad and ire from human rights organizations.

Here's what we know about the mega-prison called Cecot, an acronym for Terrorism Confinement Centre in Spanish.

In February 2023, El Salvador opened what it claims is Latin America's biggest prison with capacity for 40,000 inmates. The 23-hectare prison is isolated in a rural region 70 km east of capital San Salvador.

Bukele in November said the prison cost $115m to develop and equip.

This prison is part of Bukele's highly popular hardline security policy which has resulted in a sharp drop in homicides.

Calling himself the world's “coolest dictator,” Bukele, 43, declared a state of emergency in March 2022 that remains in effect and has entailed the arrest of more than 84,000 people.

This includes alleged members of El Salvador's Mara Salvatrucha gan, also known as MS-13, and its rival, Barrio 18.

Government reports put the prison population at 14,500 inmates in August 2024, but a government spokesperson said in March 2025 that the statistic was outdated. A current figure was not disclosed security reasons, the spokesperson said.

During a visit from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in February, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele offered to incarcerate criminals deported from the US in the mega-prison.

The Trump administration deported 261 people to El Salvador on 15 March. For 137 of them, the US government justified the move under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, saying the men were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua but providing few details about their cases.

A US official said in a court filing that “many” of those 137 has no US convictions but still posed a serious threat.

Those people along with 101 additional Venezuelans were sent to Cecot for a one-year term that can be renewed, Bukele said. The US government paid El Salvador about $6m to receive the deportees, the White House said.

The remaining 23 deportees were Salvadoran gang members, the White House said.

Images taken inside the facility often show prisoners packed tightly together with their heads shaved and wearing only shorts.

The prison has no outdoor recreational space and no family visits are allowed.

A report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in September 2024 expressed concerns about overcrowding in the Cecot, citing a study that found inmates had an average 0.60 square metres (6.45 square feet) of space, below international standards.

Civil society organisations and advocates have reported over 6,000alleged human rights violations in the country since the state of emergency was declared in 2022, including arbitrary detentions, torture and 366 deaths in state custody. The government denies the allegations.

Cecot has attracted global attention, both positive and negative. Argentine security minister Patricia Bullrich praised the facility in a June 2024 social media post that said: “This is the way. Tough on criminals.”

A US Republican party delegation from the House of Representatives, led by then-Representative Matt Gaetz, visited the prison a month later.

YouTube personalities have had millions of views for their prison visit videos that highlighted harsh conditions in the prison.

Many human rights organisations have criticised El Salvador's prisons and especially Cecot. Groups have reported alleged human rights violations like torture, inmate deaths and mass trials.

Bukele said in August that “gang members will spend their entire lives in prison.” Justice minister Gustavo Villatoro vowed in 2023 that officials “will make sure none of those who enter the Cecot ever leave on foot.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Town in North Kivu province is the farthest west the group has reached since the start of its advance in January

M23 rebels have captured a strategic mining hub in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, defying calls from the presidents of Rwanda and the DRC for an immediate ceasefire.

A Congolese army spokesperson said M23 was in control of the town of Walikale. An officer separately told Agence France-Presse its forces were about 20 miles (30km) away in the town of Mubi.

Walikale, in North Kivu province, is the farthest west that M23 has reached during its lightning advance that started in January.

The town has large deposits of tin and many significant goldmines. Tin is widely used as a protective coating for other metals and in industries including food packaging and electronics.

In taking control of Walikale, the rebels also seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country, cutting off the army's positions. It also puts them within 250 miles of Kisangani, the country's fourth-largest city.

Gunfire rang out from near Nyabangi neighbourhood on Wednesday, according to Janvier Kabutwa, who lives in Walikale. An army source said the rebels were battling soldiers and pro-government militias after overrunning an army position outside the town in a surprise attack.

“The information is confirmed. The rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office,” said Prince Kihangi, a former provincial official for Walikale, referring to locations in the town centre.

Heavy artillery fire was heard throughout Wednesday but stopped in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, said Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale. “Our Congolese army is no longer fighting,” he said. “It's as if we were being sacrificed.”

M23 captured Goma, the largest city in North Kivu, in late January. It then started moving south towards Bukavu, the second-largest city in the region.

More than 7,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands uprooted from their homes since January in the latest escalation in the conflict, which has lasted for decades and has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is the worst escalation in more than a decade.

M23, which is backed by Rwanda, is one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces to make territorial gains in the DRC's mineral-rich eastern provinces. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups that escaped to the DRC after taking part in the genocide. The DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the region's mineral resources.

The fall of Walikale came a day after DRC's president, Félix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, met in Qatar for their first direct talks since January and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.

The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola after Tshisekedi's government went back on its longstanding refusal to speak to the rebels, but M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, citing EU sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials.

‘All nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said at a press conference in Norway 

Zelenskyy also gets asked about the prospects of US ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station or any other energy assets.

He replies saying that “all nuclear power plans belong to the people of Ukraine,” owned by state, and get paid by Ukraine, even as it is “temporarily occupied” by Russia.

He then goes into details of problems with the plant and its cooling after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, which pose questions over “very severe technical conditions.”

He also pushes back on suggestion the plant could change ownership, repeatedly saying he discussed with Trump “how to find the solution from the situation and … take the station from the Russians,” with options for the US to be involved in modernising or developing it further, but “the issue of property, we did not discuss.”

He further says there was no discussion on other plants.

Media editor

Exiled Russian journalists are being left “high and dry” and at risk of being stranded overseas without any legal status after the Trump administration's decision to withdraw funding from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).

The Guardian understands that some Russian journalists working for RFE/RL, which was founded during the cold war and broadcasts to countries including Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, will face imminent problems over their legal status should the broadcaster shut down.

Many of RFE/RL's Russian journalists operate from Prague, Riga and Vilnius, with their work visas often tied to their employment. Terminating the broadcaster's funding would trigger visa expirations, leaving them without legal status within months.

In the meantime, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy also released a video and some comments from his speech to the European Council summit in Brussels earlier this morning.

The Ukrainian president urged leaders to not fall for the Russian “hoax,” pretending that he wants a ceasefire where the opposite is true, as he said “Putin must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war and must start fulfilling what he promises the world.”

She specifically told them to keep pressure and sanctions on Russia “until it starts withdrawing from our land and fully compensates for the damage caused by its aggression.”

“Keep fighting against sanction evasion schemes and Russia's attempts to finance its war effort,” he pleaded.

But he also asked for more pressure “within Europe itself,” calling out Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán for blocking Ukraine's prospects of joining the EU.

“It is simply anti-European when one person blocks decisions important for the entire continent or that have already been agreed upon. Ukraine fulfilled the requirements, but right now, there are serious difficulties in opening Ukraine's first and other negotiation clusters for EU accession,” he said.

He ended on thanks for continued support and his comments that Europe “must always be at the table” in discussions on security, reassuring leaders he raised it in talks with the US.

Separately, as Jennifer Rankin tells me, in a joint statement EU leaders – minus Hungary – welcomed the joint statement by Ukraine and US following their meeting in Saudi Arabia, including proposals for a ceasefire agreement, humanitarian efforts and resumption of US intelligence sharing and security assistance.

Here is the video and here are the comments as released, in full:

I addressed the European Council and emphasized that if we say Europe should be stronger in global competition, we must also discuss making European decision-making faster, more flexible, more effective – whether in politics, defense, economics, industry, or any other area.

Last night, Russia launched a massive drone attack on Ukraine—171 strike drones, mostly Shaheds. Their target was our infrastructure. And in the city of Kropyvnytskyi, in central Ukraine, residential buildings, a church, and a school were damaged. Among the wounded—four children.

Yesterday evening, another Russian strike hit our energy infrastructure. We in Ukraine face this every day and night. And despite Putin's words about being “ready to stop attacks”—nothing has changed.

It's crucial that our partners' support for Ukraine doesn't decrease but instead continues and grows. Air defense, military aid, our overall resilience—all are crucial. We need funds for artillery shells and would really appreciate Europe's support with at least five billion euros as soon as possible.

Investments in weapons production are needed both in Ukraine and in Europe. Europe must ensure its technological independence, including in weapons manufacturing. Everything necessary to defend the continent should be produced in Europe.

The ReArm Europe program should start operating as soon as possible. Ukraine has effective and modern tech, especially in drones and electronic warfare, which can benefit all of Europe and our global partners. Further development, and increased efficiency – along with European investments in Ukraine's production and co-production – are key to Europe's new security foundation.

Sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it starts withdrawing from our land and fully compensates for the damage caused by its aggression. Keep fighting against sanction evasion schemes and Russia's attempts to finance its war effort.

Ongoing diplomatic efforts do not mean Russia should face less pressure. That's crucial to reducing the chances of a Russian hoax. We all know how easily Moscow disregards its promises – one moment they give their word, and a few hours later it means absolutely nothing. That's why we must keep pushing Russia toward peace.

Yesterday, I had a productive conversation with President Trump. Ukraine has always advocated for an end to attacks on energy and infrastructure and a ceasefire at sea. Our teams will also work towards achieving an unconditional, full ceasefire on land.

Putin must stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war and must start fulfilling what he promises the world. By now, there could have been over a week without killings, without strikes, without fire – if Putin were not the only one keeping this war going. The proposals made in Jeddah on March 11 are still on the table. We must keep pressuring Russia to make them a reality.

Unfortunately, some pressure is also needed within Europe itself to ensure that anything promised – actually happens, particularly Ukraine's EU accession talks and resolving some fundamental issues for European unity.

It is simply anti-European when one person blocks decisions important for the entire continent or that have already been agreed upon. Ukraine fulfilled the requirements, but right now, there are serious difficulties in opening Ukraine's first and other negotiation clusters for EU accession.

European efforts that should be bringing more security and peace are also constantly being obstructed. This is wrong. Europe must have a way to prevent individual actors from blocking what's necessary for all.

Europe needs speed in making decisions and clear tools to protect itself from unnecessary blockages. Ukraine is part of Europe, and Europe is one of the players in global peace efforts. We did our best for Europe to be equal with others in these efforts and peace negotiations. Together we achieved it.

Europe must always be at the table in discussions about its own security. We must work in unity on all European matters. We talked about this in Jeddah, and we always discuss it with all our partners – Europe is a participant in diplomacy.

I am grateful to those working with us on future security guarantees for Ukraine—and, in turn, for the entire eastern flank of Europe and the continent as a whole. For those who haven't joined yet—I invite you to do so. All of us must be as efficient as possible in this work on security guarantees – and as quick as possible.

Earlier today, we also had some news on UK enforcement of sanctions after Herbert Smith Freehills, the elite global law firm based in London, has been fined by the British government after its former Moscow office made millions of pounds in payments to sanctioned Russian banks.

The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), said it had imposed a penalty of £465,000 on HSF Moscow, which was a subsidiary of HSF London until its closure in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The fine, which was upheld after Herbert Smith requested a ministerial review, relates to six payments worth a combined £3.9m, made by HSF Moscow to Alfa-Bank JSC, PJSC Sovcombank and PJSC Sberbank.

The trio of banks are all subject to an asset freeze under Britain's sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, the UK government said.

Herbert Smith Freehills, which has 2,400 lawyers in 24 offices around the world, blamed the payments on human error during the final week of its efforts to shut down its Moscow operations in response to the war.

OFSI, a division of the Treasury, said the payments, spread over a period of seven days as the company wound down its Russian offices, were caused by a “pattern of failings”.

It blamed inadequate due diligence and sanctions screening, amid the “hasty closure” of HSF Moscow.

Our attention will be now turning to Britain where UK prime minister Keir Starmer will lead a meeting of over 30 military chiefs and planners on what “the coalition of the willing” could do to support Ukraine in case a peace deal is secured for Ukraine.

Starmer said the talks would focus on “military planning, military operations” to support Ukraine.

“Today those plans are focusing on keeping the skies safe, the seas safe and the borders safe and secure in Ukraine,” Starmer told reporters.

“Now we're working at pace because we don't know if there'll be a deal, I certainly hope there will be, but if there's a deal, it's really important that we're able to react straight away.”

In the last few days, Starmer visited a nuclear submarine HMS Vanguard on its return from mission as he wanted to “thank submariners for their months of silent service deep under water,” Downing Street said.

He was the first prime minister to join a similar debrief since David Cameron in 2013.

Starmer also took part in the ceremonial keel laying of the next generation Dreadnought submarine, the next generation of the UK's nuclear deterrent.

Zelenskyy also gets asked whether he would be prepared to discuss neutrality of Ukraine.

He says it was a repeated request from Russia, but that is not an option.

Any suggestion of radically slimming down Ukrainian army or recognising the occupied territories as Russian “is an ultimatum, not an offer to end the war,” he says.

He also says once again that giving security guarantees to Ukraine would be simply easier if it was allowed to join Nato, as “we very much want it and believe it would solve” issues.

He also is asked about Crimea and if he talked to Trump about media reports that the US president was looking to recognise it as Russian territory.

He says Trump “did not” raise this issue, but they briefly talked about it last November, with Trump asking why Ukrainians love it so much.

But he says that since Russian invasion in 2014, there are no tourists there and the territory is struggling after losing water supply, logistics linking it with continental Ukraine. But he repeatedly says its a “Ukrainian peninsula.”

And the press conference ends here.

Zelenskyy also gets asked about the prospects of US ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station or any other energy assets.

He replies saying that “all nuclear power plans belong to the people of Ukraine,” owned by state, and get paid by Ukraine, even as it is “temporarily occupied” by Russia.

He then goes into details of problems with the plant and its cooling after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, which pose questions over “very severe technical conditions.”

He also pushes back on suggestion the plant could change ownership, repeatedly saying he discussed with Trump “how to find the solution from the situation and … take the station from the Russians,” with options for the US to be involved in modernising or developing it further, but “the issue of property, we did not discuss.”

He further says there was no discussion on other plants.

Zelenskyy talks about the prospects for a ceasefire, saying Ukraine initially floated the idea of a ceasefire at sea and in the air as it believed these were the easiest modes to police, but it was then expanded by the US as the Trump administration pushed for a full ceasefire.

“And I said immediately, we approve, we confirm [that] we want to move” ahead with this, he says.

But he says that after US-Russia talks, there was “a step backwards” with a limited ceasefire focused on energy and civilian infrastructure instead.

He says he discussed it with Trump yesterday, and offered a full list of objects to be covered by the agreement.

He says he is hopeful this will be agreed after further technical discussions in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

Responding in his opening statement, Zelenskyy thanks Norway for its support, and says it understands “what Russia brought to our home.”

He specifically thanks for Norwegian support for Ukraine's energy sector, which he says “helped us to get through winters of this war,” despite Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

He says:

“We need to continue pressure Russia's so that Putin stops manipulations and makes the concrete steps that all the world wants,” agreeing to first limited ceasefire and then expanding it further.”

“Everybody saw that Ukraine unconditionally agrees to [this process], and we wait until the aggressor accepts this,” he says.

Zelenskyy says the pair discussed ways of strengthening Ukrainian defence capabilities, and using diplomacy to put more pressure on Russia.

Støre says he welcomes “a friend” to Oslo as he praises Zelenskyy's “leadership, endurance and consistent fight for Ukraine's independence and sovereignty.”

He says Norway continues to support Ukraine and its efforts to “get a ceasefire and then negotiations for a fair, just and lasting peace.”

He also says that the recently agreed increase in Norwegian defence support for Ukraine “is now being immediately translated” into practical support, including in artillery, ammunition, and drones.

“This is a partnership that we take forward every day, and you can count on that support. It is the right of a sovereign country to resist aggression, and you have our full support in that fight,” he says.

Norway's Støre and Ukraine's Zelenskyy are now speaking in Oslo.

Nordic correspondent

Jens Stolenberg, the former Nato secretary-general who last month re-entered Norwegian government as finance minister, said uncertainty over US commitment to the transatlantic alliance is not a reason to “give up Nato”, but motivation for European and Canadian contributions to increase.
 Speaking shortly before Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy touched down in Norway on Thursday morning, Stoltenberg told the Guardian that whether or not the US decides to reduce its Nato contributions, it is crucial that other Nato members “stand together” and “step up”.
 “We need to all do what we can to ensure that Nato remains a strong alliance between North America and Europe that has helped to keep us safe for more than 75 years. There have been differences and disagreements before but we have been able to overcome them by realising we are all safer when we stand together,” he said.

He made the comments from Copenhagen where he on Wednesday met with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen and attended the screening of a documentary about his final year in Nato.

“If the US should decide to reduce their contributions to Nato, it is even more important that we stand together the rest of us in Nato and step up, as European allies now do. And not least the United Kingdom, being the second largest military power in Nato after the United States.”
 He added: “I cannot rule out that the US will reduce their contributions to the Nato command structures, to the Nato forces, but I expect the United States to remain a Nato ally. The answer to that is not to give up Nato but to strengthen the European and Canadian contributions to Nato.”
 It was, he said, “valid” and “fair” of the US president, Donald Trump, to ask other Nato members to do more.

“The issue of burden sharing is a real issue where European allies have done far too little, and it is valid, it is fair of different US administrations to ask the Europeans to do more,” he said. “The good news is that Europeans are doing more.”

Brussels correspondent

EU leaders agreed that “no real negotiations are taking place at the moment” after discussing Donald Trump's attempts to end Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.
  Europe's leaders have already voiced deep scepticism that the Russian president is serious about seeking an end to the three-year conflict that he started.

EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a summit had “a quick exchange” with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined via video link, according to a readout of the meeting from an EU official.

The statement said:

“They discussed the situation on the ground in Ukraine and the state of play of the US-led talks. There was a shared view that no real negotiations are taking place at the moment.”

EU leaders also discussed how to support Ukraine politically and militarily in talks that lasted around two hours.

The show of support was marred by Hungary's refusal to sign a joint text. “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war,” states the text that Viktor Orbán declined to support.

It also states that the EU remains “ready to step up further pressure on Russia,” including with new sanctions and tougher enforcement of existing restrictive measures.

Speaking of people on tour, Britain's Prince William is in Estonia today and tomorrow, where he is visting UK troops based in the Baltic country.

He has met with the country's president Alar Karis this morning, and tomorrow will go to Tapa camp, some 100 miles from the Estonian border with Russia, to meet the British troops stationed there to protect Nato's Eastern flank.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues his Nordic tour: after visiting Helsinki yesterday, he is now in Oslo, meeting with the country's leaders, including prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre and finance minister, and former Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.

In a short media statement, Støre said he was “very pleased” to welcome Zelenskyy to Norway, and said the country was fully behind Ukraine “in its fight to defend itself and is contributing to the effort to achieve a lasting, just peace in the country.”

The pair will appear at a press conference together later this afternoon, and I will bring you all the key lines from that presser.

The European Union has delayed its first countermeasures against the United States over US president Donald Trump's metals tariffs until mid-April, allowing it to re-think which U.S. goods to hit and offering extra weeks for negotiations, Reuters said.

The European Commission had proposed re-imposing 2018 tariffs on €4.5bn ($4.9 billion) of US products on April 1, followed by hitting a further €18 bn of US goods on 13 April.

“We are now considering to align the timing of the two sets of EU countermeasures so we can consult with member states on both lists simultaneously, and this would also give us extra time for negotiations with our American partners,” EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič told a hearing at the European Parliament on Thursday.

The commission subsequently confirmed all EU countermeasures would take effect in mid-April.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Recent Four Nations competition, which excluded Russia, clearly got beneath the skin of hockey-loving strongman

Amid the somewhat murky details emerging from Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's call on Tuesday – the two leaders discussed a halt on attacking energy infrastructure, then Russia immediately bombed Ukraine's energy infrastructure – one deal, at least, was clear: the US and Russia would resume playing ice hockey.

Although benign enough on the face of it, the idea of organised games in the US and Russia, between players of both countries, was yet another concession to Putin from Trump. Unlike the US president's previous gifts – pre-emptively allowing Russia to keep the territory it has illegally invaded, refusing to give any security guarantees to Ukraine, and strongly hinting US sanctions would soon be lifted – this was soft power, wrapped in a pair of skate laces.

Putin loves hockey. He plays it himself. (His clearly terrified opponents let him score at will.) Russia is a global powerhouse of the sport. But the best Russian players eventually leave Russia, to go play in the National Hockey League. The money is better, and the fame greater.

So when Russia was booted from international hockey competition after it invaded Ukraine, that hurt Putin even more: the latest insult from a west that would never truly respect it.

Russian hockey has always been geopolitical. The Soviet teams of the 20th century were explicitly military proxies. The players were soldiers in the Red Army. Their coach was a colonel. They bunked in barracks for 11 months of the year. When they began playing – and beating – North American teams for the first time, the matches were clashes of ideology. The communists, raised since kids to play together in a collective system on the ice, versus the individualist American and Canadian professionals trying to score goals on their own (and when that didn't work, trying to bash the Russians in the head). In the 1960s and 70s, the Soviet Union won five of six Olympic golds.

There were two big exceptions, both at the height of the cold war: the 1972 Summit Series, when a team of Canadian bruisers barely squeaked out a victory in eight games against the silky Red Army, and the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics when a plucky American team of minor-leaguers and misfits (of course) defeated the heavily favoured Soviets for gold on home turf in what became known as the “Miracle on Ice”. In case you missed the significance, it inspired a Hollywood film starring Kurt Russell.

To fully appreciate the geopolitical significance of these hockey proxies, look no further than the recent Four Nations competition, where Canada and the US worked out their animosity over Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state by kicking off their first game with three separate fistfights in nine seconds. Canada won the trophy and the nation practically imploded with emotion. The other two nations? Sweden and Finland. If you think Russia didn't feel left out, let Putin bringing this up in the context of a summit with the US president about the biggest war in Europe since 1945 be a clue.

Just as Saudi Arabia knows the soft power of sport, getting back on their blades on the global ice rink would be a huge triumph for Putin's Russia. Even better that it comes just as Alexander Ovechkin, the best Russian player of all time and the literal founder of a Putin fanclub, is about to eclipse Wayne Gretzky's NHL goal record – and to do so while playing for the Washington Capitals, no less. (Gretzky is Canadian, so it is not an American loss – although he has recently attracted Canadian ire by having dinner at Mar-a-Lago and not wearing enough patriotic red.)

As for Trump, who appears to see Putin not as a foe but as an equal – great men leading great powers and carving up the world between them – the idea of a Four Nations competition was silly anyway. For him it has only ever been the Two Nations, and you can imagine he and Putin watching it together from the Kremlin press box at Moscow's CSKA arena, not discussing Ukraine at all.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

White House has ‘moved beyond' minerals deal; Zelenskyy expects ceasefire deal to cover civilian as well as energy infrastructure. What we know on day 1,121

Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday that the US could own and run Ukrainian nuclear power plants as part of a ceasefire. The Ukrainian president said following their call that “we talked only about one power plant, which is under Russian occupation”, referring to Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power station. The White House said it had “moved beyond” the idea of taking possession of Ukraine's mineral wealth as part of negotiations. “We are now focused on a long-term peace agreement,” said White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.

Kyiv was “ready” to pause attacks on Russia's energy network and infrastructure, Zelenskyy said, write Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer. Zelenskyy indicated he did not yet consider a ceasefire to be in place, instead saying it could be established quickly, and his team would present the Americans with a list of the kind of facilities it should include. Zelenskyy also indicated he expects the ceasefire to apply to civilian infrastructure as well as energy facilities.

Zelenskyy's call with Trump came a day after Vladimir Putin agreed to halt similar strikes on Ukraine but Russia immediately went back on the attack with drones and missiles. The Ukrainian president remained sceptical of Vladimir Putin's goodwill and intentions after Ukraine's defence ministry said on Wednesday that an overnight barrage of Russian missiles and drones killed one person and damaged two hospitals. The national railway service said railway energy infrastructure in the central Dnipropetrovsk region was hit. Such actions put Putin's words about ceasing attacks “at odds with reality”, Zelenskyy said.

A major Russian oil pipeline station continued to burn at Kavkazskaya in Russia's Krasnodar region after a successful Ukrainian drone strike. Authorities in the region said a total of 406 firefighters and 157 pieces of equipment had been sent.

European leaders reacted sceptically to the Trump-Putin limited ceasefire idea, saying it showed the Russian president was not serious about seeking a peaceful end to the three-year-old conflict, Sam Jones writes. Putin's sweeping demands include leaving the Ukraine military weakened and vulnerable, with no western arms or intelligence, and a depleted army. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “It is clear that Russia does not really want to make any kind of concessions,” adding along with other leaders that Kremlin demands to stop arming Kyiv could not be accepted.

Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that Ukraine had received more F-16 fighter jets. “Several F-16s have flown to Ukraine. I'm not going to tell you how many,” Zelenskyy told reporters. Ukraine received its first F-16s in 2024.

Kallas said she would present a proposal to European leaders gathering in Brussels on Thursday to provide Ukraine with two million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The EU executive has meanwhile launched a push to buy more weapons in the bloc and from allied countries, rather than from the US, Jennifer Rankin writes. The UK, US and Turkey will be excluded from defence contracts funded by a €150bn (£125bn) EU loans programme unless they sign a security and defence partnership agreement with the EU. The €150bn loans scheme will be open to EU member states as part of a massive surge in defence spending, but 65% of the costs of equipment funded must come from suppliers in the EU, Norway or Ukraine. The rest could be spent in non-EU countries with a security agreement.

The EU should fund Ukraine's access to satellite services from EU-based commercial providers, the European Commission said in its white paper on the future of European defence published on Wednesday. Ukraine's military has been heavily dependent on Elon Musk's Starlink but there have been veiled threats it could be cut off unless Ukraine accepts Trump-dictated peace terms. European satellite operators are in talks with the EU as they have been asked if they can step in and replace Starlink. “This will help Ukraine to enhance its resilience by diversifying its sources of space-based services,” the paper said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

One version of Baby Three doll appears to bear a mark resembling the shape of the ocean border on which China bases its illegitimate claim to most of the South China Sea

Regional tensions over the South China Sea have tanked the sales of a popular children's doll in Vietnam after it was put under investigation and accused of being unpatriotic because a design marking appeared to resemble China's “nine-dash line”.

The Baby Three doll is Chinese-made and had reportedly been hugely popular among children and Gen Z in Vietnam earlier this year. Between September, when it first gained popularity, and December the dolls reportedly generated US$1.6m in sales.

However a suggestion that a heart-shaped design on one version of the doll looked like the controversial line that China's government inserts on world maps to make a territorial claim over most the South China Sea sparked online backlash. An international tribunal in The Hague has ruled China's territorial claim invalid and it is disputed by countries including Vietnam. Beijing has rejected the ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

In response to online outcry, Vietnam's industry and trade ministry ordered an inspection of toys supposedly displaying the line, warned they were “affecting national security and territorial sovereignty”.

Retailers have slowed or stopped sales. According to data cited by state media from YouNet ECI, an e-commerce data analysis platform, the average price of Baby Three on Shopee and TikTok Shop halved in the first 10 weeks of 2025.

“Almost all children started to boycott [the dolls] because they saw it as a nationalistic issue, thinking that buying Baby Three was unpatriotic,” one vendor told AFP.

Ngoc Hang, a retailer in Ho Chi Minh City, told VN Express that her revenues had dropped by half after the government announced the inspections and penalties.

“Consumers have called for boycotts, and I had to lower prices by 30-50% to liquidate my stocks.”

In early March the eyewear retailer Anna Eyewear announced it was terminating a branding collaboration with Baby Three over “controversial character drawings”. It said that as a Vietnamese company, it wanted to “bring our customers not only quality products but also good cultural and humanitarian values”.

At the same time, a popular e-commerce streamer, Đặng Tiến Hoàng, announced he would stop selling the dolls.

“Although the income is good for us, the land and country must be the top priority,” he said, sparking a storm of debate in the comments.

Vietnamese authorities take a particularly hard line on depictions of the nine-dash line on products or in pop culture. In 2023 the Barbie film was banned from cinemas over a scene in which a crudely drawn toy map appeared to include the line. The same year Netflix was ordered to remove a Chinese series that regularly featured the map. In 2022 the film Uncharted, starring Tom Holland, Mark Walhberg and Antonio Banderas, was banned for featuring the map.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Teachers will be banned from setting homework involving screens in effort to tackle ‘risks' of intensive use of IT at young age

The regional government of Madrid has unveiled plans to limit the use of computers and tablets in primary schools to a maximum of two hours a week in an effort to tackle “the risks associated with the early, intensive and inappropriate use of information technology”.

Under the proposals, to be enacted in September, teachers will also be banned from setting homework involving screen use.

The measures are being billed as the first of their kind in Spain and will apply to about 500,000 children in 2,000 state schools in and around the capital.

“It's about getting back to the essence of education but adapting it to today's times and making books, dictations and handwriting compatible with the development of digital skills,” said a spokesperson for the conservative regional government.

The new regulations stipulate that infant and primary students “will not be allowed to work individually with digital devices, and that their teachers will not be able to set homework or other academic tasks that involve the use of tablets, computers, mobile or similar devices outside the school timetable”.

The plans, however, allow some pupils a small amount of supervised screen time each week. Babies and toddlers from birth to three years old will be banned from using screens, while infant school students aged three to six will be allowed one supervised hour of computer time a week. Pupils in years three and four of Spanish primary school will be allowed a maximum of 90 minutes a week, rising to two hours for those in years five and six. Secondary schools will be able to set their own limits, and children with special educational needs will be exempted from the new rules.

In Spain, as elsewhere, concern is growing over screen use among children and young people.

The country's socialist-led coalition government is preparing legislation that would raise the age for opening a social media account from 14 to 16 and calls for tech companies to install age-verification systems.

It also proposes that parental controls be installed by default on smartphones and that a national education campaign be rolled out to help children and teenagers navigate social media.

Although some Spanish regions have already brought in rules on phone use in schools, the education ministry is proposing “zero use” of phones in infant and primary schools, and limiting phone use in secondary schools to teacher-led, educational activities.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

About 70 pages of director's handwritten notes for the New Wave classic were found after more than 60 years

The only known script for Jean-Luc Godard's seminal New Wave film Breathless (À Bout de Souffle) will be auctioned later this year after coming to light for the first time in more than 60 years.

About 70 pages of Godard's handwritten notes and synopses of some of the most famous scenes, including the movie's dramatic opening, were discovered in the estate of the celebrated producer Georges de Beauregard.

Breathless, which follows the doomed affair between an American student in Paris (Jean Seberg) and her hoodlum boyfriend who is wanted for gunning down a police officer (Jean-Paul Belmondo), is a keystone of France's Nouvelle Vague movement that shook the cinema world, including Hollywood.

Godard's innovative method of working means that scripts of his films are rare. He shunned formal scripts and liked to write dialogue the night before a shoot, to encourage actors to behave naturally. He also had a penchant for destroying written records.

Anne Heilbronn, the head of books and manuscripts at Sotheby's Paris, which is auctioning the manuscript along with photographs and other items from De Beauregard's estate, admitted she was overcome with emotion when she saw the documents.

“I wanted to cry. It was an incredible shock to actually have this manuscript that is a record of the history of French and world cinema in my hands,” she said.

“À Bout de Souffle is an iconic film for the whole world and here we see part of the dialogue, the scenes, the trailer, for the first time since 1960. As far as we know, it is the only script of its kind.”

The original outline for the story, based on a news event that enthralled France in 1952, had been written by Godard's friend and fellow New Wave director François Truffaut, who allowed him to develop the plot.

De Beauregard, another of the movement's key figures, had met Godard through Truffaut, and made a leap of faith in agreeing to produce Breathless, the then unknown director's first full-length film.

Godard approached the shoot over the summer of 1959 with a documentarist's method, filming in the streets with a handheld camera and mostly with natural light. Having started with a precise screenplay for the first 14 minutes of action, he ditched it and decided to write each day's script the night before. As the dialogue was to be synchronised in post-production, he did not mind if the actors forgot lines they had often been given on the morning of the shoot, as they frequently did.

Sotheby's says it is describing the manuscript as “partial”, not because anything is missing but because Godard did not submit a full synopsis and script to the ministry of culture's National Centre of Cinematography and Animated Pictures, as would have been normal at the time, and made much of it up as he went along.

Godard explained his thinking in Cahiers du Cinéma in 1968. “I had written the first scene [Jean Seberg on the Champs Elysées] and, for the rest, I had a huge number of notes corresponding to each scene. I said to myself, this is outrageous! I stopped everything. Then I thought about it … instead of finding something a long time before, I'll find it just before. When you know where you're going, it should be possible. It's not improvisation, it's last-minute fine-tuning.”

In 1967, Truffaut wrote: “The passing years confirm our certainty that À Bout de Souffle will have marked a decisive turning point in the history of cinema, as Citizen Kane did in 1940. Godard has shattered the system, he has made a mess of the cinema.”

The manuscript, with an estimate of £350,000-£500,000, will be sold as part of Sotheby's online auction of books and manuscripts, open for bidding on 14-18 June. The single lot will include four original photographs of Godard and Seberg, a vintage contact sheet, and letters from Godard and the actor and director Roger Hanin, who appeared in the film, all from De Beauregard's archive.

“As someone who adores the cinema and is passionate about it, I can say it is one of the best film scripts I have ever held,” Heilbronn said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Intelligence reports suggest Călin Georgescu benefited from suspected Russian interference, but the annulment of his first-round win has left many angry and confused

There have been four presidents of Romania since the 1989 revolution that terminated the brutal 20-year rule – and, indeed, the life – of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. Constantin listed them all.

“Iliescu, Constantinescu, Iliescu again,” the retired security guard said, counting on his fingers. “Băsescu, then Iohannis. And for what, exactly? Nothing has changed. Nothing, in 35 years. Pay and pensions are too low. Food and fuel cost too much. Something's got to give.”

Nursing a beer outside a hole-in-the-wall bar in rural Drăgănești, an hour's drive north of Bucharest, Constantin said one man might have been able to change things. “And now they've banned him,” he said. “So they can keep on robbing us.”

Constantin's view is not unusual in this village. In November's presidential elections, nearly 600 people here (37.2% of the electorate) voted for Călin Georgescu, an anti-EU, Moscow-friendly, Covid-denying ultranationalist who won the first round.

Since then, the election has been annulled over suspected Russian interference, and Georgescu has been placed under criminal investigation. Last week, Romania's top court upheld a decision barring him from standing in the re-run of the vote in May.

Now even those who did not back Georgescu are disgusted.

“Millions voted for him; he should have been allowed to stand,” said Elena Preda, 64, a retired legal officer, outside the minimarket. “Nothing's proven against him. The injustice makes me weep. Look at me, I'm buying candles. We're mourning democracy.”

Beside his roadside greengrocer's stand, Ionut, 55, was seething. “This isn't normal,” he said. “It's a corrupt, thieving dictatorship. A smart guy looked like winning, so they cancel the vote. Then they cancel him.”

Hours after the constitutional court confirmed Georgescu's disqualification, saying his violation of electoral rules was “conduct contrary to the Romanian constitution”, Romania's prime minister, the Social Democrat Marcel Ciolacu, posted on his Facebook page.

He said that he hoped the ruling would “restore social tranquility in Romania”. He added that the judges' decision closed “an extremely tense and dangerous episode” in the country, which could now return to “a normal social climate” and “civilised public debate”.

Listening to the voters of Drăgănești, that seems a tad optimistic. Legally, the decisions to annul the vote and pursue Georgescu may be sound. Politically – in a society feeling as fed up and as let down by its political class as Romania's – they could be explosive.

The first-round ballot was annulled after the far-right candidate surged from less than 5% in the polls days before the vote to a triumphant 23%, and declassified intelligence documents revealed a campaign with the hallmarks of a Russian influence operation.

The documents, from Romania's intelligence service and interior ministry, listed 85,000-odd cyber-attacks on the country's election computer system and identified 25,000 largely dormant TikTok accounts that had suddenly begun amplifying Georgescu's messages.

What has emerged so far strongly suggests a Russian campaign, but does not prove it. The files suggested social media influencers had been hired by intermediaries and paid to share videos promoting Georgescu's campaign, and that some of his campaign workers were linked to organised crime gangs and neo-fascist groups.

The former soil scientist – who declared zero campaign spending - is now under investigation on six counts, including misreporting campaign finances, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Prosecutors are also investigating 21 others linked to Georgescu. They include Horaţiu Potra, a military contractor, who has called for insurrection “with scythes, pitchforks and axes”. Police raids on their homes have uncovered weapons and millions in cash, according to prosecutors.

Adina Marincea is a researcher at the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania. In her office in Bucharest, she said clean-cut 62-year-old Georgescu may have “an aura of legitimacy”, but there was little doubt he was “a very dangerous figure”.

Georgescu has hailed Romania's 1930s fascist leaders as heroes. He recently gave an apparent Nazi-style salute. “We have enough evidence to place him in that tradition,” Marincea said. “Look at the ideology he promotes. The people he surrounds himself with.”

She added that Georgescu, who ran as an independent, “plays a game of calculated ambivalence”. Through his use of “dog whistles” he “signals to the radical right, which has this ideology, but he can also say: ‘I didn't mean that.' It's not enough to call him populist or opportunist.”

For his supporters – many of whom see him almost as a messiah, with his unrealisable populist promises of huge tax cuts and jobs for all – none of it justifies his ousting. “I don't believe a word of it,” said Alexandru Ioniță, 25. “They just made it all up.”

Watching one of his three children play in a park in Urziceni, half an hour east of Drăgănești, Ioniță said he had left home at 14 and, like millions of Romanians, worked abroad, on and off, ever since: France, Germany, Scotland; farms and factories.

“I don't want that for my kids,” he said. “Georgescu was interested in this country, not in himself. He promised he'd put Romania back on its feet, rebuild what all the others broke, bring home the diaspora. If there's got to be another revolution, so be it.”

Mihaela Măcelaru, 43, said Georgescu had “shown us how to fight for our our country, because we are all one people. He brought us all together. He was a good man for our country, a wise man. I believe he was sent by God. Now, who knows?”

Romania's democracy is fragile. The median household income is about a third of the EU average. Food is 50% more expensive than five years ago. Almost a third of the country's 19 million people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Over the past 10 or 15 years, nearly 20% of the workforce has sought better opportunities abroad.

Public services are poor, and the social safety-net lacking. There is a general perception, in the words of one centre-left politician, that: “The state isn't there to help. Just to punish people, to create difficulties – while enriching its own.”

Inequality, meanwhile, is high: at twice the national average, the per capita GDP of Bucharest exceeds that of Paris, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm. And a long history of corrupt and incompetent politicians has left public trust in MPs and ministers low.

Adding fuel to those flames is what many observers see as a calamitous lack of official or institutional transparency. “It's simple: if the state leaves a void, people are only too eager to fill it,” said Ana Dragomir, communications director of the Romanian civic engagement NGO Funky Citizens.

“Our authorities are famous for not communicating or explaining their decisions,” she said. “That leaves a big hole that instantly gets filled by deep-state conspiracy theories [and] allegations of a coup.”

Such claims are not confined to Romania. The Trump administration has presented the whole episode as an attack on free speech. The US vice-president, JD Vance, asked in a recent speech whether the country “shares America's values”. Elon Musk wondered how a judge can “end democracy in Romania”.

Dragomir cites the manner of Georgescu's detention for questioning by police last month as an example of the authorities needlessly fanning the flames of such discourse.

“They didn't make clear why,” she said. “No specifics, no proper explanation, bad updates. It's about trust ... If we don't trust our authorities, it's because they don't talk to us.”

Likewise, the electoral bureau's decision to cancel the first round of the presidential ballot. “It was unprecedented – yet still they failed to communicate or explain,” Dragomir said. “It just fuels suspicions.”

A similar absence of clear, complete and – most importantly – public evidence surrounds the exclusion from May's presidential re-run of both Georgescu and another far-right candidate, Diana Șoșoacă. Șoșoacă, of the ultranationalist SOS Romania party, had already been barred from standing in the first round.

The constitutional court pronounced Șoșoacă's anti-EU, pro-Moscow diatribes “contrary to democratic values”. She would not be able to keep the presidential oath to respect Romania's constitution and protect democracy if elected, it argued.

“Again, there's just nothing really specific there,” said Dragomir. “No clear criteria, written in law … This may have been the right decision. But in this context, if it's not completely clear, it just creates more tension and polarisation. That's dangerous.”

The barrings left Romania's populist far-right parties, which hold more than a third of parliamentary seats and had united behind Georgescu, scrambling to find a replacement candidate.

In the end, they fielded two – George Simion of Romania's second-largest party, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), and Anamaria Gavrilă, founder of the Party of Young People (POT) – before Gavrilă withdrew.

“We decided to support the one who has the most chance of winning,” she said on Wednesday. “We must go beyond parties and, as Mr Georgescu said, we must support this ultranationalist movement by giving it all the chances.”

Polls have suggested Simion would top the first round with about 30% of the national vote, but would likely be defeated in the second round runoff by the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicușor Dan, who is running as an independent.

Whatever the outcome, Georgescu's campaign has been “an absolute wake-up call”, said Victoria Stoiciu, a Social Democrat senator and former progressive activist. “No one saw it coming, and he's clearly a symptom of something deeper.”

With inequalities growing, the gap between voters and politicians widening and far-right populists stoking resentment, Stoiciu said, “It does remind me of the interwar rise of fascism. The same perceptions of a corrupt elite, the same disconnects.”

She added that there were external factors, too, including a “long-term, sustained investment by Russia in undermining trust”. But Romania's mainstream politicians, she acknowledged, had to “be much more open, listen more, talk more” to voters.

Above all, they had to actually make a difference to people's lives. That was a message that resonated back in Drăgănești. Ștefan, 78, a rare dissenting voice, said Georgescu “should just have been arrested, from the start … He's clearly a shady character.”

But even if Georgescu was not the man to do it, Ștefan said, Romania still “absolutely and desperately needs change”.

With this, Ștefan's wife, Jenica, 69, chipped in. “We just have to hope,” she said. “The only problem is, we don't know what to hope for.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Activists in world's third-largest democracy warn the legal changes signal a return to military dominance in civilian affairs that characterised Suharto years

Indonesia has ratified controversial changes to its military law allowing armed forces personnel to hold more civilian posts, a move that analysts fear could usher in a resurgence of the military in government affairs.

Activists in the world's third-largest democracy have criticised the revisions, warning they signal a return to Indonesia's “New Order” era, when the country was led by former authoritarian ruler Suharto, who stepped down in 1998.

The country is now led by President Prabowo Subianto, an ex-special forces general and former Suharto son-in-law, who was inaugurated in October.

Indonesia's law minister, Supratman Andi Agtas, has denied the law was a return to the military dominance that characterised the Suharto dictatorship, saying instead it was necessary due to domestic and geopolitical challenges.

Defending the revised law, defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament: “The geopolitical changes and global military technology require the military to transform … to face conventional and non conventional conflicts.”

Before the law was passed, active soldiers were able to hold posts in organisations such as the defence ministry and state intelligence agency. The changes broaden the scope of civilian posts that officers can hold, including the attorney general's office, the state secretariat, the counterterrorism agency and the narcotics agency. It also extends sitting officers' retirement age.

The parliament, which is dominated by Prabowo's ruling coalition, approved the revised changes in a plenary session on Thursday.

Speaker Puan Maharani led the unanimous vote and officially passed the law, saying that it was in accordance with the principle of democracy and human rights.

“President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,” said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government's rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.”

Kennedy Muslim, a political analyst from Indonesian pollster Indikator, said: “We've seen this creeping militarisation for quite some time, that's why civil society is right to be alarmed by this trend. But I think the concern that this is back to the New Order is quite overblown at the moment.”

Muslim said that polls show the military consistently ranks high in public trust surveys, but the new law had the potential to erode this.

The bill was approved less than two months after the president formally requested an amendment to the legislation. Activists have complained about the expedited lawmaking process, and the secretive nature of deliberations over the bill.

Students organisations have said they plan to protest outside the parliament in Jakarta on Thursday, with one student group, describing the law as “democracy killing”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Nearly half of female entrepreneurs surveyed by Cherie Blair Foundation for Women do not have regular internet access 





The cost of a mobile data package is all that is holding back many female entrepreneurs in developing countries, according to recent research.

While social media marketing is reported to be crucial by female business owners who have access to it, 45% of women in business in low- and middle-income countries said they did not have regular internet access because of the expense and connection issues.

Nearly 3,000 female entrepreneurs from 96 developing countries contributed to a report by the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women into the challenges women face in the digital economy.

The women surveyed ran businesses including food or fashion outlets and farms, using their phones to engage directly with customers, receive digital payments and promote their work.

“Internet connectivity is fundamental to digital inclusion and business success, as being online allows women to reach customers, streamline operations, increase sales and access financial services,” said Dhivya O'Connor, CEO of the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women.

“However, persistent challenges still prevent them from fully participating. Privacy concerns, security risks and online harassment remain major barriers … as the digital landscape evolves, those who are not supported to adapt risk being left behind.”

While 92% of those surveyed owned a smartphone, access to the internet was often restricted. The vast majority used platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook, applications often included in cheap mobile packages in many developing countries, but wider internet access is generally much more expensive.

Only about a quarter of the women used e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Alibaba.

According to research on global digital trends by the marketing agency We Are Social, 11 of the 20 countries where internet is least affordable are in sub-Saharan Africa.

Safety was also a concern for women selling online: 57% said they faced harassment while selling online, 36% did not use their names and 41% did not post photos on their business profiles to maintain their privacy.

Many said they feared aggressive negotiating by men, potential violence, unwanted advances and being sent unsolicited explicit pictures.

“One growing concern is the recent rollback of user protections by major social media platforms, many of which are critical for women-led businesses. As our report highlights, these platforms are already rife with online abuse, and weaker safeguards will only worsen the problem – further undermining women's ability to operate safely online,” said O'Connor.

According to research by GSMA, which works with mobile operators globally, women in low- and middle-income countries are 15% less likely to use mobile internet than men – rising to a third in South Asia and Africa. Closing that gap could earn developing countries $1.3tn (£1tn) in GDP by the end of the decade.

The report said developing countries should be investing in mobile data networks to improve connectivity and reduce cost, and technology companies should develop robust measures to protect women from harassment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Israeli military says it is conducting ground activities in northern Gaza Strip as health ministry reports 85 people killed by Israeli attacks overnight

At least 85 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Thursday after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the territory, Gaza's health ministry said, according to Reuters.

A day after launching a new ground campaign in central Gaza, the Israeli military said on Thursday it had begun conducting ground operations in the north of the territory, along the coastal route in the area of Beit Lahia.

Palestinian militant group Hamas, which had not yet retaliated during the first 48 hours of the renewed Israeli assault, said its armed wing had fired rockets into Israel. The Israeli military said sirens sounded in the centre of the country after projectiles were launched from Gaza.

Palestinian medics said Israeli strikes targeted several houses in northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip. Asked for comment by Reuters, the Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.

The military has resumed its air assaults on Gaza since Tuesday and launched ground operations on Wednesday, in effect abandoning a ceasefire with Hamas that had held since January.

It said on Thursday that its forces had been engaged for the past 24 hours in what it described as a targeted ground operation to expand a buffer zone separating the northern and southern halves of Gaza, known as the Netzarim corridor.

Israel ordered residents to stay away from the Salahuddin road, the main north-south route, and said they should travel along the coast instead, reports Reuters.

Hamas said the Israeli ground operation and the incursion into the Netzarim corridor were a “new and dangerous violation” of the two-month-old ceasefire agreement. In a statement, it reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire deal and called on mediators to “assume their responsibilities”.

A temporary first phase of the ceasefire ended at the start of this month. Hamas wants to move to an agreed second phase, under which Israel would be required to negotiate an end to the war and withdrawal of its troops, and Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.

Israel has offered only a temporary extension of the truce, cut off all supplies to Gaza and says it is restarting its military campaign to force Hamas to free remaining hostages.

Thousands of Israelis have been protesting against the decision by Benjamin Netanyahu's government to resume airstrikes on Gaza. The protesters fear the resumption of the war will endanger the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Fifty-nine hostages are yet to be released, of whom 24 are believed to be alive.

The decision to resume the war has added fresh momentum to anti-government rallies, with protesters accusing Netanyahu's administration of continuing the conflict for political reasons. The recent airstrikes have killed more than 400 Palestinians and shattered the ceasefire agreement.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock on Thursday called on the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) interim government of Syria to control extremist elements within its own ranks, reports Reuters.

Speaking in Damascus after the reopening of the German embassy (see 10.44am GMT), Baerbock said she had told the HTS leadership “that it is now up to them to turn words into action, that it is now up to them to bring extremist groups within their ranks under control and to hold those responsible for crimes to account”.

The US on Thursday issued new Iran-related sanctions, targeting one individual and several entities including a Chinese “teapot” oil refinery for purchasing and processing Iranian crude oil, the treasury department website showed, according to Reuters.

It was Washington's fourth round of sanctions on Iran's oil sales since president Donald Trump said in February he was re-imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign including efforts to drive down the exports to zero. Trump aims to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and funding militant groups.

China is the largest importer of Iranian oil. The refinery that the US treasury targeted for sanctions is China-based Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Co Ltd, reports Reuters.

Tehran says its nuclear energy programme is for peaceful purposes, while western powers say its enrichment of uranium to levels approaching weapons-grade has no logical civilian applications.

Israeli police deployed a water cannon and made several arrests on Thursday as protests against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's move to oust the head of the domestic intelligence service flared for a third consecutive day.

Thousands of Israelis have joined anti-Netanyahu demonstrations with opponents of the move to sack Shin Bet head Ronen Bar joining forces with protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza, breaking a two-month-old ceasefire, while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian territory.

“We're very, very worried that our country is becoming a dictatorship,” Rinat Hadashi, 59, said in Jerusalem, according to Reuters. “They're abandoning our hostages, they're neglecting all the important things for this country.”

On Thursday, police and demonstrators clashed as hundreds marched along the road leading to the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem, where police said dozens of protesters tried to break through security cordons.

Protests were planned later outside the Kirya military headquarters complex in Tel Aviv, reports Reuters.

A day earlier there were angry confrontations between protesters and counter-demonstrators, highlighting divisions that have deepened since Netanyahu returned to power at the head of a right-wing coalition at the end of 2022.

Israel's cabinet is expected to meet on Friday to formally approve the dismissal of Bar, who has clashed with Netanyahu over a corruption investigation against aides in his office that the prime minister has called a politically motivated attack.

A French citizen imprisoned in Iran for more than 880 days has been freed as France and the rest of Europe try to pursue negotiations with Tehran over the country's rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, gave no immediate details of what had led to Olivier Grondeau's release, though it came on Nowruz, the Persian new year, when Iran has released prisoners in the past.

Grondeau was met by his family and senior officials at Paris-Beauvais airport earlier this week.

Jean-Noël Barrot, France's minister for Europe and foreign affairs, posted a picture online of Grondeau smiling onboard what appeared to be a private jet. “We will tirelessly continue our efforts to ensure that all our compatriots still held hostage, including Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, are in turn released,” Barrot wrote.

Grondeau's parents, Thérèse and Alain, speaking about the moment they learned of his release, told the Guardian they felt “huge relief that finally it was happening after years of waiting.

“We are happy to be reunited with our son. This is a great moment of joy. However, our thoughts at the moment are also with Cécile and Jacques … and their families,” they added, mentioning the other French hostages in Iran.

The US president, Donald Trump, has sent a letter to Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to jump-start nuclear talks. Trump is also putting pressure on Tehran over its support for Yemen's Houthi rebels, after the US military launched an intense new campaign of airstrikes targeting the group.

In going public with his detention in January, Grondeau alluded to the politics at play in his imprisonment. “You become a human who has been stocked away indefinitely because one government is seeking to exert pressure on another,” he said.

The Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge Grondeau's release.

The Israeli army on Thursday warned residents of the southern Gaza town of Bani Suheila to evacuate their homes immediately ahead of a strike in their area, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“To all those present in the area marked as Bani Suheila, this is an early warning before a strike. Terrorist organisations are returning to and firing rockets from populated areas … For your safety, head west toward the known shelters immediately,” Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X.

UK foreign secretary David Lammy has said Hamas will “still be there” at the end of any military campaign by Israel and a political process is required.

Conservative MP Martin Vickers acknowledged Israel's “absolute right” to take action to recover the hostages before warning:

The continuing bombardment of Gaza of itself will not achieve that. Will he agree with me that the one thing it does achieve is it risks radicalising the younger generation to become the Hamas supporters of the future?”

Lammy replied in the House of Commons:

Well, that is the huge concern because we want to provide hope for these people and we want to provide an alternative to Hamas.

I just repeat that after 17 months of bombardment, if it was going to work it would have worked. It hasn't worked and to go back to that, as night follows day, at the end of any military exercise Hamas will still be there and it'll still come back to a political process.

So, let us continue with the political process and the ceasefire talks now. Let's extend phase one to the end of the Ramadan-Passover season and let us work hard to get to phase two.”

Rescuers have pulled a 25-day-old baby girl alive from the rubble of her home in Gaza's Khan Younis after an airstrike killed her parents and brother, reports the Associated Press (AP).
 “When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” Hazen Attar, a civil defence first responder told the AP. “She had been screaming and then falling silent from time to time until we were able to get her out a short while ago, and thank God she is safe.”
 The girl was identified as Ella Osama Abu Dagga. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the territory, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.
 Only the girl's grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children, reports the AP.

It was not immediately clear who would take the rescued infant girl in, reports the AP.
 Nearly 600 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza, including more than 400 on Tuesday alone, according to Gaza's health ministry. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.
 The strike that destroyed the infant girl's home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European hospital, which received the dead. It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.
 The Israel military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is deeply embedded in residential areas. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes, according to the AP.

At least 85 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Thursday after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the territory, Gaza's health ministry said, according to Reuters.

A day after launching a new ground campaign in central Gaza, the Israeli military said on Thursday it had begun conducting ground operations in the north of the territory, along the coastal route in the area of Beit Lahia.

Israel has offered only a temporary extension of the truce, cut off all supplies to Gaza and says it is restarting its military campaign to force Hamas to free remaining hostages.

David Lammy has confirmed that a British national was injured in an Israeli attack on a UN compound in Gaza on Wednesday, as he said recent attacks had been an “appalling loss of life”, reports the PA news agency.

The UK foreign secretary told MPs:

Yesterday morning a UN compound in Gaza was hit, I can confirm to the house that a British national was among the wounded.

Our priority is supporting them and their family at this time.”

Lammy added that the attacks on Gaza on Tuesday night had caused the largest Palestinian death toll on a single day since the war began.

He said:

A number of Hamas figures were reportedly killed, but it's been reported that over 400 Palestinians were killed in missile strikes and artillery barrages. The majority of them were women and children.

This appears to have been the deadliest single day for Palestinians since the war began. This is an appalling loss of life, and we mourn the loss of every civilian.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Confusion over recording sex and gender causing problems in areas such as healthcare and safeguarding, report says

Official UK data recording people's biological sex and their gender identity is often unclear or conflated, a government-commissioned report has found, causing confusion and potential risks, for example in healthcare and safeguarding.

The review, led by Alice Sullivan, a professor of sociology and research specialist at University College London, said guidance should be updated to make sure both sets of data were recorded in a clear and distinct way.

Sullivan said the use of “gender” as catch-all term had begun being used in the 1990s and had become increasingly common, leading to what she termed “a widespread loss of data on sex”.

A lack of clear guidance for how such matters should be recorded had led to individual organisations often developing their own systems, the report said, some of which mixed up sex and gender identity, making it impossible to trace the future outcomes of certain groups, including people with mixed gender identities.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sullivan said that some crime statistics recorded people's preferred gender, rather than their sex, and that people had been able to change their gender marker on NHS records.

“It's this confusion around the word gender, which I think everybody used to recognise as simply a synonym for sex, and it's become something else – it's become a way of recording gender diverse identities,” she said.

“What I've argued in this report is that sex is really important, we should be recording it by default – transgender and gender diverse identities can also be recorded where that's appropriate.

“There's no reason to see this as a trade-off between the two. They're two distinct variables.”

The report was commissioned just over a year ago by the Conservative government, with the expectation it would report by August last year. However, following the election, it has been released now.

The health department said it would urgently look into what it called “serious findings”.

Luke Pollard, the defence minister who was speaking for the government on Thursday morning, said it was “vital” that data collection on this improved.

The study, based on a review of evidence and practices, as well as interviews with organisations including government departments, regulators and other bodies, concluded that “the meaning of sex is no longer stable in administrative or major survey data”.

It went on: “This instability is evident across key policy areas including health and justice. This has led to a widespread loss of data on sex. In some cases, the loss of data on sex poses risks to individuals. This is particularly apparent within health and social care. These risks are especially high in the case of minors.”

Another issue the report highlighted was a lack of clarity over how particular reports or surveys gathered data on biological sex or gender. In some cases, conflated data had been embedded in IT systems, making the distinction even less clear.

Among a series of recommendations, it said the “default target” for any such question should be biological sex at birth, without any combining of gender identity, including for people who have a gender recognition certificate.

It also said the NHS should stop giving people new NHS numbers with changed markers for gender, saying this could put people at risk in areas like screening.

It called for organisations to take a dispassionate and robust approach to the subject, saying there was evidence of “a partisan climate” on some issues, including gender, within the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's official data-gathering body.

A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “This government is clear that the collection of accurate and relevant data is vital in research and the operation of effective public services, particularly when it comes to sex.

Organisations including energy and transport firms told to guard systems against powerful new computers

The UK's cybersecurity agency is urging organisations to guard their systems against quantum hackers by 2035, as the prospect of breakthroughs in powerful computing threaten digital encryption.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued new guidance recommending large entities including energy and transport providers introduce “post-quantum cryptography” in order to prevent quantum technology being deployed to break into their systems.

The NCSC warned that quantum computers, which remain a technology under development, will be able to solve the hard mathematical problems that underpin asymmetric public key cryptography – a common encryption method used in a range of everyday situations from mobile phone use to online banking. Quantum computing's ability to crunch numbers at incredible speed makes it a serious threat to encryption, said the NCSC.

“While today's encryption methods – used to protect everything from banking to secure communications – rely on mathematical problems that current-generation computers struggle to solve, quantum computers have the potential to solve them much faster, making current encryption methods insecure,” said the agency.

The NSCS is recommending that large organisations, operators of critical national infrastructure such as energy and transport and companies with bespoke IT systems introduce post-quantum cryptography to counter the threat.

Under the guidance, organisations should identify services that need an upgrade by a deadline of 2028, then carry out the most important overhauls by 2031 and complete the migration to a new encryption system by 2035.

“Our new guidance on post-quantum cryptography provides a clear roadmap for organisations to safeguard their data against these future threats, helping to ensure that today's confidential information remains secure in years to come,” said the NCSC chief technical officer, Ollie Whitehouse.

Traditional computers encode their information in bits – represented as a 0 or a 1 – but their quantum counterparts use qubits, which can encode various combinations of 1s and 0s at the same time. As a result, quantum computers can in theory compute their way through vast numbers of different outcomes and carry out far bigger calculations than previously thought possible.

However, qubits are extremely vulnerable to the slightest interference including minor temperature changes and cosmic rays, a key reason why a large-scale quantum computer has yet to be developed despite significant investment from tech firms. The NCSC is hoping its new advice will give organisations plenty of time to be ready for when quantum computers come onstream.

“Now that there are new methods for public key encryption, it makes sense to migrate now rather than wait for the threat to becoming real,” said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Investigation uncovered eight adverts that portrayed women in a harmful or degrading way, says ASA

An investigation by the UK advertising watchdog has found a number of shocking ads in mobile gaming apps that depict women as sexual objects, use pornographic tropes, and feature non-consensual sexual scenarios involving “violent and coercive control”.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) used avatars, which mimic the browsing behaviour of different gender and age groups, to monitor ads served when mobile games are open and identify breaches of the UK code.

While most of the thousands of promotions served to the avatars complied with UK rules, the watchdog identified and banned eight that featured “shocking” content that portrayed women in a harmful way.

Two ads promoting an artificial intelligence chatbot app, Linky: Chat With Characters AI, began with a woman dressed in a manga T-shirt, a short skirt and large bunny ears dancing in a bedroom with text reading: “Tell me which bf [boyfriend] I should break up with.”

The ad moved on to animated content featuring text conversations with three manga-style young men. They were variously described as “obsessively possessive”, “aggressively jealous”, “a kidnapper and a killer”. Further text described yanking the woman “into the car, swiftly knocking her out”, with the woman asking: “What if I enjoy this?”

The ASA said the ad was “suggestive and implied scenarios involving violent and coercive control and a lack of consent”.

An ad for an interactive romance story game called My Fantasy featured an animation of a woman being approached by another woman and being pushed on to a desk. Options appeared asking what she should do – “enjoy it”, “push her away”, “please continue” and “stop it”.

The ASA said the animations were “strongly suggestive and implied the sexual encounters were not consensual”.

The ASA also identified three ads for Love Sparks: Dating Sim, which were shown to its female child and adult male avatars. One ad showed an animated woman lying on her back with her legs spread, with the options “kiss her” and “take it slow”.

The second ad featured sexually suggestive depictions of “Kate your naughty step sister” wearing a bra, and an animated image of “Lally, 18”.

The third ad featured an animated clothed woman with her bottom pulsating with the options “next girl” and “slap”, as well as text reading “punish me … please”.

The ASA said that in the ads the women were shown as “stereotypical sexual objects using tropes from pornography”.

The watchdog banned the eight ads and issued a warning to those behind them. It said that although they were rare examples out of the 5,923 adverts served to its digital avatars, the “harmful or degrading portrayals of women in ads are completely unacceptable and we take a zero-tolerance approach to this kind of content”.

The ASA also published findings of a study that found that almost half of UK consumers were concerned about the depiction and objectification of women and girls in ads.

The survey of 6,500 people, conducted by YouGov, found that 45% of people were concerned about ads that include idealised body images of women. It found 44% were concerned about the objectification of women and girls.

Last month, the ASA banned an advert from the high street retailer Next for featuring an “unhealthily thin” model in digitally altered clothing.

The survey marks the latest initiative in this area by the ASA since it introduced tougher rules regarding the depiction of men and women in ads in 2019.

The new rules were developed after a consultation process partly prompted by the outcry over adverts in 2015 for the slimming product Protein World, which promised to make women “beach body ready”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Fire and Rescue NSW say 384 lithium-ion battery incidents since 2024 caused at least 33 injuries

The handling and disposal of lithium batteries used in electric scooters and bikes, which can cause fires, will be regulated in a nation-first initiative.

The New South Wales government has introduced a bill, the Product Lifecycle Responsibility Act, to parliament.

When passed, NSW will become the first state to implement such laws.

The act will create a framework for suppliers of batteries and other products to take part in mandatory stewardship schemes.

This means that those who make and sell the products will have to follow requirements on design and manufacturing, reuse and recycling, and safe disposal.

The first products to be regulated under the act will be batteries.

There are between 10,000 and 12,000 fires each year in trucks and at waste facilities caused by the improper disposal, use, and poor design of lithium batteries, according to waste and recycling industry estimates.

Fire and Rescue NSW have dealt with 384 lithium-ion battery incidents since 2024 alone.

Those incidents included at least 33 injuries and multiple fatalities.

“Batteries power our modern life and we will need them more as we decarbonise our economy,” the environment minister, Penny Sharpe, said on Thursday.

“But without adequate safety and care we will see further deaths, injuries and property damage.”

Under the planned laws, battery suppliers will have to register battery products and facilitate safe disposal or recycling through dedicated collection points.

They will be charged with running public education campaigns to improve awareness of battery risks and disposal.

They will also be obliged to enhance battery design, packaging, importation and storage to improve safety and recyclability.

The laws and regulations will also apply to smaller embedded batteries found in everyday devices, such as cordless vacuums, electric toothbrushes, children's toys, e-bikes and e-scooters.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

German defence minister says Putin ‘is playing a game here' and calls Russian president's demands ‘unacceptable0

European leaders have reacted sceptically to the limited ceasefire in Ukraine agreed by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, saying it has made it abundantly clear that the Russian president is not serious about seeking a peaceful end to the three-year-old conflict.

During a call with the US president, Putin agreed to a partial ceasefire that would stop his forces targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but declined to commit to the 30-day full ceasefire plan pitched by Trump last week and agreed to by Ukraine.

Further doubts about the deal arose after Russia launched a wave of attacks on targets across Ukraine hours after Trump and Putin spoke. Russia also reported a series of attacks by Ukrainian drones.

“Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated,” Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in an interview with the German broadcaster ZDF. “Putin is playing a game here and I'm sure that the American president won't be able to sit and watch for much longer.”

Pistorius said Putin's commitment to stop attacks on energy targets was “basically nothing” because such infrastructure in Ukraine was already the “best protected”.

The minister also described as “unacceptable” the Kremlin's insistence that a key condition for peace would be a total halt of western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.

“This is very transparent,” Pistorius said, adding that Putin aimed to prevent Kyiv's backers from “further supporting Ukraine and enabling it to really defend itself if there is another attack, during or after a ceasefire”.

The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said their countries would continue sending military aid to Ukraine. “Ukraine can count on us,” Scholz said.

The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, also dismissed Russian demands that help for Kyiv be halted. “Ukraine has an undeniable right to defend itself on its own and supported by its partners,” he said on Wednesday. “This right cannot be restricted in any way, not now, and not in the future.”

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, downplayed the US-Russian deal. She said: “It is clear that Russia does not really want to make any kind of concessions.” She added that Kremlin demands to stop arming Kyiv could not be accepted.

Spain's foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was equally cautious about the prospects for peace. In an interview with Radio Nacional de España on Wednesday morning, he described the conflict as “one man's war”, adding that there was “no real will from Putin to stop this war”.

He asaid: “It's positive that there's talk of a ceasefire and talk of peace with Russia, but we're still very far from the peace that Spain and the European people want.”

Others, however, were more optimistic. On Wednesday, China applauded the deal between Putin and Trump.

“The Chinese side has advocated resolving the crisis through dialogue and negotiation from the very beginning,” its foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We welcome all efforts toward a ceasefire and consider it a necessary step toward achieving peace.”

The rise of the Samurai Blue has gone hand-in-hand with increased integration of ‘haafu' into society, although things are still not perfect

Through Japan's previous seven World Cup appearances, the progress of its men's national team has reflected the country's ascent within the global soccer community, a result of three decades of professionalism and grassroots development producing a steady stream of Europe-ready players.

On Thursday, that streak of consecutive appearances in men's soccer's showpiece event was officially extended to eight, as Japan's 2-0 win over Bahrain made them the first non-host country to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

When the Samurai Blue arrive in North America next year, some names and faces will reflect another, more societal change: A populace that is slowly but steadily becoming more diverse.

“(Some players) may have different roots, but their circumstances are different, whether they naturalized or were born Japanese,” Japan head coach Hajime Moriyasu said after Thursday's win. “It's not necessarily about who they are, but that they're all playing for Japan, and that everyone has the goal of becoming No. 1 in the world.”

Athletes with diverse backgrounds are increasingly common across the Japanese sports landscape, from haafu (Japanese born to one non-Japanese parent) such as four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka and NBA star Rui Hachimura to the many naturalized imports who helped the Brave Blossoms reach the quarter-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

Yet while baseball remains Japan's most popular team sport, it's on soccer fields across the country, from school pitches to J.League stadia, where the story of the country's relationship with multiculturalism is most vividly being told.

“Baseball requires significant financial investment in equipment, making it less accessible to children from immigrant backgrounds,” transnational sociology expert Dr Lawrence Yoshitaka Shimoji tells the Guardian. “In contrast, soccer can be played with just a ball, making it a more accessible sport for haafu and immigrant children in Japan.”

There has been at least some level of multicultural influence on Japanese soccer for most of its history. Many of the country's early player imports hailed from Brazil, home to Japan's largest diaspora as a result of steady migration in the early 20th century. Nelson Yoshimura, a second-generation Japanese-Brazilian, joined the Japan Soccer League's Yanmar Diesel (now Cerezo Osaka) in 1967, earning 46 senior caps for Japan after naturalizing in 1970.

Other Brazilian players, including those without Japanese heritage, followed Yoshimura's path. In addition to a trophy-laden career with the JSL's Yomiuri SC and its J.League successor Verdy Kawasaki, midfielder Rui Ramos contributed to Japan's landmark 1992 Asian Cup triumph and nearly led the country to its first World Cup berth a year later.

Wagner Lopes became Japan's first naturalized World Cup player at France 1998, while Alessandro Santos, scouted as a 16-year-old by Kochi Prefecture's Meitoku Gijuku High School, wore Japan's trademark blue shirt for the 2002 and 2006 editions. Four years later, defender Marcus Tulio Tanaka, a third-generation Japanese-Brazilian, helped guide Japan to the last 16 in South Africa.

“The Japanese fans supported the naturalized players exactly like the Japanese-born players as far as I could see,” says veteran soccer writer Michael Plastow. “If there was something special, perhaps it was a sense of gratitude.”

Meanwhile, Japan's demographics gradually changed. A sustained wave of Brazilian and Peruvian workers in the 1980s and 90s gave way to more immigration from southeast Asia and Africa. Though the country's birth rate declined by nearly 42% between 1987 and 2022, births to at least one non-Japanese parent rose from 1.3% to 4.1% in that same period.

That figure is reflected by an increase in haafu call-ups over the last decade, with four such players in Japan's 2024 Olympic squad – three more than at any previous Games – and at least one in each World Cup list since 2014.

In particular, the last two World Cup cycles have seen haafu feature frequently between the goalposts, including Qatar 2022 backup Daniel Schmidt, current Samurai Blue starter Zion Suzuki, and Leo Brian Kokubo, Japan's keeper at the Paris Games.

These players have flourished in a physically demanding position that Japan has often struggled to develop: the 6ft 3in Suzuki, Kokubo or Taishi Brandon Nozawa, who are both 6ft 4in, could all potentially become the country's tallest-ever World Cup goalkeeper. But they and their outfield colleagues have grown up in a society that has not always accepted them openly.

Nearly all respondents in a Japanese nationwide survey of haafu conducted last year by Shimoji and University of Toronto researcher Viveka Ichikawa said they had experienced microaggressions, while 68% had encountered overt bullying and racial discrimination. Almost half said they'd suffered from mental health issues, a rate five times the Japanese national average.

“I've experienced the empty seat next to me on the [crowded] train, and when you're young you wonder, ‘Why?' But now I can understand,” Jamaican-Japanese forward and Rio 2016 selection Musashi Suzuki told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in 2021. “Japanese just aren't used to seeing people who don't look like them. As Japan becomes more global, Japanese will have more opportunities to interact with people of other races. I think society is slowly changing.”

Despite those changes, racial abuse aimed at haafu players – particularly those with Black heritage – has also increased on social media. Zion Suzuki, whose father is Ghanaian, publicly urged fans to stop writing discriminatory messages and comments during last year's Asian Cup in Qatar, where he failed to record a clean sheet in five starts as the Samurai Blue exited in the quarterfinals.

“I've received [discriminatory comments] since elementary school, but I won't give in to them,” Suzuki told Number Web after the tournament. “I could have pretended to ignore [the messages], but I wanted to share my story in the hope that it could help not only soccer players, but athletes and young children with all kinds of roots.”

Though soccer's status as a global game has increasingly been defined through the lens of immigration – 16.5% of Japanese players in the last World Cup were foreign-born, according to Vox – the increase of haafu in Japan's squad is instead a story of integration. Among mixed-race players born and raised in Japanese-speaking households, there is no question as to who they're playing for.

“It's not the idea that there are many different kinds of people representing [Japan], but rather that once you're in the national team, you're the same as everyone else,” says Colombian-Japanese attacker Kein Sato, an Olympic teammate of Kokubo's and one of three haafu at FC Tokyo who have represented Japan in international competition.

“I think when you wear the Hi no maru [Japanese flag], you're prepared to fight like hell for Japan whether you're haafu or pure Japanese, and I think we all feel the same way.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

            Turkish authorities detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu – a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – on Wednesday as part of corruption and terrorism investigations.
    


            Detention orders were also issued for around 100 others connected to the mayor, including his press adviser Murat Ongun, according to state-run news agency Anadolu Agency. Among those detained are elected Istanbul district mayors Resul Emrah Sahan and Murat Calik.
    


            The move came just days before the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was scheduled to hold a primary election where Imamoglu was expected to be chosen as its presidential candidate.
    


            CHP leader Ozgur Ozel called the detention “a coup attempt against our next president.”
    


            Video from CNN Turk showed police wearing riot gear and dozens of security vehicles outside Imamoglu's home.
    


            “I am saddened to say, a handful of people who are trying to steal the will of the people, have sent the dear police, the security forces implicating them in this wrongful doing,” Imamoglu said in a video posted to X on Wednesday as he got dressed in what appeared to be a closet.

            “Hundreds of police officers have been sent to the door of my house — the house of the 16 million people of Istanbul.”
    


            Critics denounced the detentions as politically motivated and part of an ongoing government crackdown on the opposition following Erdogan's major defeat in local and mayoral elections last year.
    


            “Making decisions on behalf of the people, using force to replace the will of the people or to obstruct it is a coup. There is currently a force in place to prevent the nation from determining the next president,” Ozel said in a post on X.
    


            Following Imamoglu's detention, Istanbul's governorship suspended the right to demonstrate in the city until March 23, “to maintain public order.” It also announced the closure of some metro stops and roads in downtown Istanbul.
    


            According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, access to X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok has been restricted in the country.
    


            Meanwhile, the mayor's detention sent shock waves through Turkey's financial markets, deepening investor fears and triggering sharp losses in the currency and stock market.
    


            The Turkish lira plunged more than 10%, trading above 40 against the dollar – its weakest level on record – as Imamoglu's detention spooked investors.
    


            Stock trading in Turkey got off to a rough start, as a sharp drop in the main BIST 100 index triggered a temporary trading halt. By 6:30 a.m. ET, the index had fallen 6.7% for the day.
    


            People took to the streets of Istanbul Wednesday night to protest Imamoglu's detention. Images shared by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality showed the streets flooded with demonstrators waving Turkish flags outside the municipality building.
    


            The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's office also said late Wednesday it seized a construction company co-owned by Imamoglu, Reuters reported. Control of Imamoglu Construction, Trade and Industry was taken over by a criminal court of peace, based on financial crime investigation reports, the office said in a statement.
    


            Imamoglu and around 100 others linked to him are accused of being members of a criminal organization, extortion, bribery and aggravated fraud, according to a statement from the Istanbul prosecutor's office, Andadolu reported.
    


            Imamoglu is also under investigation for allegedly aiding the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), which Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations, Anadolu said, citing the prosecutor's office.
    


            Dilek Imamoglu, wife of the detained mayor, said of the accusations against her husband: “One can only laugh at such a thing.”

            “Such a thing is of course impossible,” she said, according to Reuters. “It is completely a huge slander. Everything will come out in the open anyway.”
    


            The move to detain the mayor of Turkey's largest and most populous city, a key political battleground, comes after Istanbul University said on Tuesday it had annulled Imamoglu's degree over irregularities, dealing a blow to the opposition and dashing the mayor's presidential ambitions.
    


            Without a university degree, Imamoglu would be disqualified from running for president.
    


            Imamoglu said the university's decision was illegal and outside its jurisdiction, and that he would launch a legal challenge. “The decision of the Istanbul University Board of Directors is UNLAWFUL” he said. “The days when those who made this decision will be held accountable before history and justice are near.”
    


            Imamoglu was elected mayor in 2019 and again in 2024. The next presidential vote is scheduled for 2028, but some analysts say Erdogan could call for early elections which would allow him to bypass term limits.
    


            “We are up against a huge bullying. But I will not back down,” the mayor said in his video message.

The Nordic countries of Finland, Denmark, and Iceland once again topped the list of the happiest countries in the world, while the United States failed to recover from last year's historic drop out of the top 20, the World Happiness Report revealed.

The countries that rank in the upper echelons of joy are “not surprising,” to Julie Ray, Gallup's managing editor for world news.

“Finland, in particular, has a lack of inequality,” she told Quartz. “Strong safety nets and relatively strong economies are characteristic of the top of the list.”

A strong economy, however, is not enough to guarantee the happiness of a country's citizens. The United States, which ranked 24th in the world, was one of several wealthy, industrialized nations that has seen a decrease in overall happiness. Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Canada have all experienced noticeable declines – while less affluent countries like Mexico and Costa Rica rank among the happiest in the world.

“This year's report quantifies the human elements of life that are often hard to measure,” said Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, director of Oxford's Wellbeing Research Centre, in a statement. “These findings push us to look beyond traditional determinants like health and wealth and encourage people to get back around the table together.”

The World Happiness Report analysis suggests that people in Latin American countries are especially happy, relative to their countries' gross domestic products, because of the close social and familial ties which exist in their cultures.

Living with four to five people and sharing meals with others, for example, are both considered optimal for overall happiness. In less affluent countries, like Mexico, bigger households are more common than in Europe or the United States – which could counterbalance a relative lack of wealth.

“Although income does play a big role in people's life evaluations, it's not just money that explains why people are happy,” Ray said.

In fact, this year's report places special emphasis on themes of “sharing and caring” as significant factors in the overall happiness of individuals and entire countries. So-called “deaths of despair” – which are deaths linked to suicide or drug and alcohol use – are less common in countries where people frequently engage in benevolent acts.

“If you're giving to others by donating your time, donating your money, or even helping a stranger, that improves your wellbeing,” said Ray. “You're giving to somebody else, but you're getting happiness in return.”

Many federal district court judges are issuing imprudent and obviously politicized decisions to block early actions by President Trump and his team on many fronts, even though Trump ran on a very specific agenda and won an overwhelming victory. The judges, of course, will say they don't care about elections but about the law and the constitution, but it sure feels like ""the Resistance in Robes.""

Some rulings are so wrong that even their beneficiaries give up before higher courts return to their cases, e.g. ""Special Counsel"" Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed to the obscure post in the vast civil service bureaucracy during the late Biden Regency and was confirmed in the job in February of last year.

Trump fired Dellinger early on in Term 2 —and it is settled law that it is Trump's right to do just that— but Dellinger made a play for a district court order preventing the firing…and got one from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C.!

JUDGES BLOCKING TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE ACTING ‘ERRONEOUSLY,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

""The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing — by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,"" Jackson wrote in her decision.

That's just a bad decision, squarely contrary to long-standing precedent, and the ruling would have been reversed on appeal, but Dellinger must have figured just that: He and the judge would in fact get scorched on appeal, so he quit, mooting the case.

Too bad. Too many journalists think Trump ""lost"" that case when he didn't. He won that controversy despite the equivalent of an egregious call from the officials on the field of an NFL game, a call the plaintiff himself reversed by dropping the case.

There are other such bad court decisions and there will be more wins by Trump as the cases move through the ordinary appeals system. President Trump's lawyers are also pressing some novel theories that would upend decades of precedent, and there's nothing wrong with throwing the long legal ball, or even a few of them. The president is going to lose some of those, but if he wins some important ones, the Constitution will be better off.

Trump built part of the current Supreme Court during his first term. The highest court is always a sort of Constitutional trampoline where legal theories jump up and down over the decades, propelled by events and presidents. Now President Trump is jumping on that trampoline — just as FDR did early in his presidency — to see how high presidential power can go.

I hope the president's long-balls succeed at least as much as is necessary to curb the unelected, unresponsive federal bureaucracy and its core group of ""independent agencies.""

Our constitution did not envision a ""fourth branch"" of government made up of the kudzu of independent agencies, and this ""fourth branch"" needs to be checked and cut back, dramatically. This Supreme Court has set about doing that in the past two years with some major decisions paring back the power of the administrative state.

Trump will lose some cases, however, including, I think, his attempt to curtail ""birthright citizenship"" via executive order. It is the tradition in the United States, deeply etched in our history, that if you are born here, you are a citizen here. I believe the great migration of the 1880s to 1920s established that practice to so deep a level of American tradition that only an Amendment to the Constitution would change it, not even a statute and certainly not an executive order. But the very old Reagan-era judge who dismissed the argument about the executive order with intemperate language did not bring credit to the federal judiciary given that this is a high-profile case of first impression.

Another case of first impression is the president's deportation of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, who were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador on Saturday. The Venezuelan cartel is Tren de Aragua (TdA), and the president declared that organization was guilty of ""perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States."" Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in making his declaration and ordering the deportations. Combined with his inherent Article II authority under the Constitution, Trump is operating in what the late Justice Robert Jackson would have termed the zone of greatest presidential power. This is also a case of first impression —no court has ever dealt with such a situation before— so everyone is guessing what will happen in its aftermath.  

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, confronted with the deportations already underway on Saturday night, acted in a sloppy and frankly lazy and high-handed fashion, and in the absence of a specific, written order, Trump officials did not turn the planes around which the judge appears to have wanted them to do and which he assumed they would do. ""Assumptions"" are a bad strategy even for the most self-assured federal judges who think when they get to Heaven they will share the highest bench with God. 

Boasberg is now obviously embarrassed and angry that the Executive Branch didn't read his mind or his unwritten order and would dare blow him off, and so he has been busy digging his judicial hole deeper. What he should do is cut his losses, dismiss the case as the non-justiciable political question it is, and let the deportees decide if they want to appeal to the D.C. Circuit. Boasberg isn't likely to get the final word here whether he stomps his feet or not.

But he's flailing around this week and saying things that suggest he believes he runs the Executive Branch and not the president. That's when Republican House members started calling for his impeachment, echoing President Trump's own frustration with federal judges popping up like whack-a-mole to obstruct the president. (Meanwhile, the commander-in-chief is ordering military strikes on the Houthis. Perhaps Judge Boasberg has an opinion on that too?)

So the judges have clearly pushed themselves collectively to the forefront of many political disputes. That's not new. Maybe the number and pace of the disputes is new, but collisions between the branches of government are not new.  This is not a ""crisis."" It is the ordinary working of the Constitution. 

The effort to mainstream ""impeachment"" of left-wing, highly ideological judges is, however, unusual – and it is terrible governance and worse politics. Chief Justice Roberts spoke out against it this week as a threat against the independence of the third branch of government  — just as the chief justice did when Senator Schumer appeared in front of the Supreme Court to threaten it a few years back — and urged the ""impeachment"" chatter cease. The chief justice is right. Everything is fine, this is ordinary stuff and will work its way through the courts. But courts are slow. Some key reminders.

First, people who believe in the Constitution and the rule of law should have been disgusted by the politicization of the impeachment process against President Trump and even more repulsed by the weaponization of the DOJ, FBI, NARA and state prosecutors against a former president.

They ought also to have defended Judge Aileen Cannon against attacks on her judicial independence (and careful jurisprudence) as well as defended the SCOTUS and its individual members from outrageous threats made by Senator Schumer and smears by Senator Whitehouse and many others. 

The left wants to destroy the rule of law by breaking the Senate filibuster and ""packing the Supreme Court."" Our foreign adversaries advance these arguments via bots and trolls, but there are some populist actors on the left and on the right that care very little for the orderly rule of law. The foreign adversaries want to divide our country from its Constitution, and some conservatives have grown weary of being the party of the ""rule of law"" while the left just goes wild in the streets, but that's what the GOP has been and must remain.

People who believe in the Constitution have to fight back against the effort to use extra-judicial remedies every day. We can be clever about that. It might, for example, be a good idea for Senate Leader Thune to bring the ""Court packing"" bill from the Democrat wish list of 2021 up right now to see if Senate Democrats still support it. They won't, of course, because if it passed now it would not support their extreme ideological end. I hope every GOP senator would vote against it after bringing it through the cloture process just to get Democrats on record as being about power, not law.

Generally, however, we who believe in liberty, the rule of law and the Constitution should not embrace the revolutionary tactics of the hard left and use weapons of extraordinary power for ordinary arguments between the branches. It might be cathartic to demand ""impeachment"" of judges making lousy decisions, especially right now as we are swamped with many awful district court decisions, but the correct ""rule of law"" response is to defend the Constitution for the system to work has it has since 1789.

Students of history will recall the ill-conceived partisan attempt to impeach Justice Chase by Jefferson's hyper-supporters in 1804-5. Chase was impeached by the House, but cooler heads prevailed in the Senate and he was not convicted and removed, and we are blessed that it turned out that way and impeachment did not become part of the political process.

Justices and judges are always going to make mistakes (e.g. the great Justice Scalia got the decision in Employment Division v Smith on the Free Exercise Clause wrong, wrong, wrong in 1990) but the answer is in the appeals system and eventual reconsideration of bad precedents, not impeachment resolutions that waste time and won't succeed because they shouldn't succeed.

The answer comes in two forms: More great nominees for federal judgeships followed by quick confirmations and more terrific lawyering by Attorney General Pam Bondi of which we have already seen much and of which we should see much more.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Police have arrested a civil servant suspected of posting comments insulting Prophet Muhammad SAW on Facebook recently.

According to national news agency Bernama, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said the arrest was made after a 35-year-old man lodged a report last Tuesday.

He said the suspect, along with two other individuals, allegedly posted derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad on a news post regarding Malaysia's strong condemnation of the deadly airstrike in Gaza that killed eight humanitarian workers from the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organization (Mapim) last Saturday.

The suspect, a 29-year-old pharmacy officer, is currently under a two-day remand until tomorrow to assist in the investigation.

“The case is being investigated under Section 298A of the Penal Code and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998,” Razarudin was quoted as saying.

He said the police viewed religious insults seriously, as such acts can threaten national harmony and public order.

Yesterday, Minister of National Unity Datuk Aaron Ago Dagang urged the police and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to investigate and take stern action against a Facebook account owner accused of insulting Prophet Muhammad.

Aaron stated that insulting any religion not only violates the principles of national harmony and unity but could also have severe consequences for peace and public security.","{'href': 'https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News Malaysia'}"

London has edged closer to becoming the world's top financial centre, fresh research shows, but concerns have been raised over the City's future competitiveness.

The 37th edition of Z/Yen Group's Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 37) showed London maintained its second-place ranking amongst the world's top financial centres, whilst climbing 12 points from its last rating in September.

New York topped the table yet again, but its lead over London has narrowed.

London dominates the European rankings, with a 19 point lead over Frankfurt which missed out on a spot in the top ten, ranking eleventh globally.

The capital was in the top three centres for all eight major industries and scored first for banking.

Elsewhere, in fintech London was chomping at the heels of the Big Apple, reducing the gap between first and second place to a singular point.

The survey also questioned respondents on their home centre prospects, with London ranking as one of the top centres anticipated to become more competitive.

However, concerns exist over risks to London's future status, given that business confidence has taken a hit since the Chancellor's Autumn Budget.

The latest release from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy shrunk 0.1 per cent in January, in another blow to growth prospects.

Reeves had pledged to unlock growth across the country, which has included the launch of a National Wealth Fund and slashing regulation.

London market's woes have continued into 2025, after 2024 saw the largest outflow of listed companies since the global financial crisis, according to data from auditing giant EY. In total, 88 companies moved out of the market last year, compared to just 18 new listings.

London ranked 12th on a sub survey focusing on future prospects, with only 17 respondents mentioning the City as a centre they consider likely to grow in significance over the next two to three years.

The Middle East and Asia dominated the top 15, with seven of the centres in the Asia/Pacific region and six in the Middle East and Africa.

Dubai scored first with 63 mentions and Seoul second at 48. 

Professor Michael Mainelli, chairman of Z/Yen and former Lord Mayor of London, said: “Confidence in leading international financial centres remains strong, with a high degree of stability in rankings.

However, Mainelli noted the index period of the report falls outside of the new US administration, which has triggered a period of economic uncertainty.

“A slowdown in US centres may indicate some projected decoupling from global markets,” Mainelli added.

The GFCI generates ratings through a combination of survey respondents and a statistical model.

GFCI 37 used 140 instrumental factors combined with 31,314 survey assessments of financial centres and 4,946 respondents to an online questionnaire for the research.

							Editor-in-Chief						


The Prime Minister, in his own words, in City AM, vowing to unleash the animal spirits of the private sector. It was intoxicating stuff, but does it stack up?

In his article Starmer heaps praise on “entrepreneurs who work day and night to build a business from scratch” and the “family companies that have passed know-how across the generations.”

Those entrepreneurs are currently braced for a spike in the cost of employing people in their fledgling businesses while the family firms that Starmer celebrates have been knocked for six by potentially ruinous changes to the inheritance tax system.

The PM writes that economic growth is “the number one mission of this government” but the evidence suggests this zeal is more a panicked afterthought than a foundational purpose.  

On the day that the PM's article ran in City AM, the Resolution Foundation – a think tank with close links to Downing Street – warned that the UK was entering recession territory as firms adapt to a wave of cost and tax increases coming into effect next month, alongside the imposition of new employment legislation that makes a mockery of Starmer's claim to be slashing regulations that hold businesses back.

The government's deregulation agenda is welcome but it only feels radical because it's a Labour government doing it. It isn't actually that radical at all, it should have happened years ago and we can slam the Tories for not lifting a finger in this area but we shouldn't confuse this government's regulatory housekeeping with a Bing Bang style revolution, because it isn't. 

And the areas where Labour has been bold – or reckless, depending on your view – on business taxes, on wage costs, on employment law, are without a doubt holding back economic growth, fuelling inflation and undermining confidence. 

And it will take more than a punchy op-ed in our newspaper to make up for all that.

Marc Filippino, Tabby Kinder and Josh Noble

PublishedMarch 20 2025

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Does the Olympic business model still work?'

Marc Filippino Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, March 20th, and this is your FT News Briefing. 

The Federal Reserve is still in wait-and-see mode. And tech companies are going public despite a tough market. Plus, the International Olympic Committee is voting for a new president today, and that might mean big changes for the games.

Josh Noble There are a lot of questions about whether or not the Olympics business model has really been keeping up with the times.

Marc Filippino I'm Marc Filippino, and here's the news you need to start your day. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The Fed chose to leave interest rates untouched yesterday, and chair Jay Powell said the central bank, quote, need not be in a hurry to shift rates because of elevated uncertainty. You see, the Fed also cut its economic growth forecast for the year, and it says that its progress on lowering inflation has stalled for now. Powell said that US President Donald Trump's policies have affected the central bank's outlook, but it's unclear how much of the inflation pressures are because of tariffs. Even with higher inflation expectations, Fed officials broadly think the central bank will implement one or two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the end of the year. But a few members think there will actually be no cuts in 2025. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Despite all the market turmoil in the US, a handful of tech start-ups are still expected to publicly list next month. It's creating some cautious optimism for what some see as a window of opportunity to get the IPO market out of its slump. Here to explain is the FT's Tabby Kinder. Hi, Tabby.

Tabby Kinder Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino All right, Tabby. So, which companies are in the middle of an initial public offering push?

Tabby Kinder Yeah, so there's two companies that we are expecting to see IPO in the next few weeks, and they are CoreWeave, which is an AI data centre operator based in New Jersey, and Klarna, which is a Swedish fintech company that does payments processing.

Marc Filippino And can you give us just some context about what the IPO market has looked like over the past several years?

Tabby Kinder Yeah, so tech IPOs have had a really kind of rocky ride since the pandemic hit in 2020. There was a big IPO boom in 2021, but then since then, it's been kind of a largely frozen period for big tech deals, for tech IPOs. And that was largely a response to inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine. All of this created a sort of uncertain and unstable market environment that just didn't make it a, kind of, a good place to be if you were a start-up coming to market.

Marc Filippino And what are the concerns now for companies thinking about going public?

Tabby Kinder So a lot of investors and bankers were optimistic that, as we came into the end of last year, that there would be a kind of new stability in markets. We had the US election, interest rates started coming down, and so people thought 2025 would be a good time for companies that have been looking for a good window to list. Instead, what's happened is we've had a continuation of uncertainty. Donald Trump's trade tariffs have really rocked markets in the last month, and so there just hasn't been the kind of stable market environment that bankers had hoped to see this year.

Marc Filippino Yeah, and just for context, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down like 12 per cent over the past month. Given these conditions, what are these companies that are looking to IPO thinking?

Tabby Kinder Yeah, I mean, a lot of them have reached a point where, if we aren't going to have a kind of prolonged period of stability, then they may as well list now. Private companies have stayed private for much longer. They've raised huge amounts of capital on the private markets. They have capital needs. In some cases, their employees need liquidity. Their management have been unable to kind of realise the valuation of their shares for years now. And so, I think that some tech companies are coming to a point where they think, if not now, then when? And that's certainly being fuelled by advisers like Wall Street banks, who have been really suffering from a lack of tech IPOs in the last few years and are really keen for some of their clients to kind of get out to market, list their shares. And hopefully some of these companies will give confidence to smaller companies to follow suit.

Marc Filippino Yeah, and this window of opportunity that Wall Street has been talking about, why does the timing of these IPOs matter to the broader market?

Tabby Kinder Yeah, so there's a lot of psychology when it comes to timing an IPO, and people tend to like to get these things done at like the start of the year when budgets are being set, when companies' new financial years are being decided and audits are being done. And so April's kind of traditionally a good window. But people I spoke to, I mean, they really kind of cautioned that if we don't see the flurry of IPOs that we're expecting to see in April and May, that really the year will be a bit of a dud.

Marc Filippino Tabby Kinder is the FT's West Coast financial editor. Thanks, Tabby.

Tabby Kinder Thanks so much.

Marc Filippino Turkish police detained President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's main political rival yesterday. Ekrem İmamoğlu is Istanbul's popular mayor. His arrest is part of an intensifying crackdown against Erdoğan's opponents. İmamoğlu is seen as Erdoğan's most serious challenger in elections that Turkey will hold before 2028. He was already facing a bunch of probes, mostly for political speeches. The arrest sent the Turkish currency and markets tumbling. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The International Olympic Committee will vote today for a new president, and whoever wins will need to make some big decisions on what some consider an outdated business model. The two big moneymakers for the games are changing. Sponsors want more bang for their buck, and the media landscape is looking very different. I've got with me the FT sports editor, Josh Noble, who's watching the IOC vote today. Hey, Josh.

Josh Noble Hey. How are you doing, Marc?

Marc Filippino I'm doing well. So first off, tell me a little bit about this Olympic vote today. What's it about, and who are some of the people who are up for the job?

Josh Noble So we've got seven people in the running. Most IOC watchers think there are realistically three who might win. You've got Zimbabwe's sports minister Kirsty Coventry. She's a former gold medallist swimmer. You've got Sebastian Coe. He was chair of the London 2012 Games, and he's also a former gold medallist. And then the other one that people think might win is Juan Antonio Samaranch. For IOC watchers, that name will be very familiar because Juan Antonio Samaranch Sr was president of the IOC for 20 years up until 2001. This process will whittle that group from seven, ultimately down to one, who will then take on one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, job in global sport.

Marc Filippino Let's back up for a second and talk about the challenges the incoming president will have to face.

Josh Noble Well, I mean, there are a few things that are unavoidable. On the business side, there's been a lot of debate over the Olympics business model, and whether it's still fit for purpose, because a lot of the things the Olympics does to raise money hasn't really changed a huge amount in probably 20, 30 years. About 60 per cent of the revenue comes from TV. 

The IOC owns the broadcast rights to the Olympic Games, winter and summer, everywhere in the world. And it sells those rights to broadcasters and increasingly, streamers in each different media market, in each different jurisdiction. Then you have another 30 per cent, which comes from sponsorship, and that has been one of the most successful sports marketing programs in history. Those two things, the TV and sponsorship, have really been 90-odd per cent of the Olympics revenue line now.

Marc Filippino All right. So, what might change under a new president?

Josh Noble We're already seeing some signs of change. Even just last week, NBC extended its deal to air the Olympics. But for the first time, we saw the deal broadening significantly beyond just handing over rights in exchange for cash. Some of these things had to do with advertising. Some of those have to do with media production about distribution, helping the Olympics' video streaming player. It's not simply a rights deal. These are now strategic partnerships, partners, sort of, corporate phrase, but it's a much more kind of give and take on both sides. 

The IOC can't simply sign over rights and expect money in return. And I think a similar thing is gonna happen with sponsorship. We're gonna see a loosening up of the way that the IOC allows brands to interact with athletes, to interact with the games. What we did see in Paris was the beginning of sponsorship activity on the podium. So medallists were handed the medals in boxes provided by LVMH, a sponsor. And I think the next president is gonna have to decide sort of how far to push things, because it's quite controversial in IOC circles, even what's happened so far.

Marc Filippino OK, so the IOC needs to basically loosen their grip so that these broadcasters and sponsors can get more bang for their buck. Josh, what does this election tell you about the state of the Olympics and the IOC more broadly?

Josh Noble Well, I think a lot of it depends on who you ask. If you talk to the outgoing administration, the answer is that there's really nothing wrong with the IOC in its current state, and that a lot of the sort of so-called issues that have come up during the campaign are simply sort of smart politics. But then you talk to the candidates and they talk about, yes, things have been fine in the past, but a real sense that unless things do change quite quickly and quite significantly, these conversations that may now just be sort of quite light-hearted campaign conversations actually become real crunch issues down the line when sponsorship revenue dries up, broadcasters aren't as interested any more, and suddenly the whole thing looks on very shaky ground.

Dan Ives is prone to using sports metaphors and quips like it's a “white-knuckle moment” for investors. It seems the Tesla (TSLA) uber-bull is having a white-knuckle moment of his own.

The Wedbush tech analyst said CEO Elon Musk needs to refocus on Tesla after a brutal three-month stretch for Tesla stock.

“Musk needs to change course here ... Tesla's future depends on it,” Ives said, adding that Tesla is going through a “crisis” and that Musk is the only one who can fix it.

Ives said two things need to happen — and soon — to stem the negative tide on Tesla and get the stock back on track. Shares are down nearly 50% since hitting a closing high of $462.28 in late December, though the stock is up in premarket trading on Thursday.

First, Musk must formally announce he is going to balance his role as leader of the White House Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force and CEO of Tesla. With the perception that he is spending “110% of his time with DOGE,” Musk needs to recommit his attention to the struggling automaker.

“Musk needs to make a statement and his actions speak louder than words. We would expect this to happen either before or during the 1Q earnings conference call in early May,” Ives wrote.

If Musk recommits himself to Tesla and balances his DOGE commitments, this will start to “take the heat off Musk” regarding DOGE, Ives said, and likely alleviate brand damage.

Second, and more important for Tesla's business, Musk must finally give a “roadmap” for the lower-priced EVs Tesla has been promising since last year and that are slated for production in 2025. Reports suggest these cheaper vehicles may be de-contented or stripped-down Model Y EVs that would first go on sale in China.

Ives also wants to hear more about the unsupervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) Robotaxi rollout coming to Austin, Texas, in June, as autonomous is a major factor in most analysts' bull cases for the stock. Yesterday, California regulators said Tesla has received an initial permit to begin ride-hail testing with Tesla employees in piloted cars, a first step on the road to eventual Robotaxi testing, though this news did not come from Tesla's official communications channels.

“With a Model Y refresh, inventory issues, and a host of demand issues with Musk brand damage a worry ... there is one person Tesla investors need to hear from ... Musk,” Ives said, maintaining his Outperform rating and $550 price target.

Hearing from Musk soon, most likely next month during Tesla's earnings call, can't come soon enough. The company is facing another crisis with the Cybertruck's recall of 46,000 of the EV pickups due to exterior panels flying off when driven.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street banks are starting to cut what could be thousands of workers as new economic uncertainties mount.

In recent weeks, Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Bank of America (BAC) all began workforce reductions that affect various parts of their operations.

The layoffs come at a time of the year when it is common for Wall Street to cull some underperformers and trim staff as part of annual reviews.

The cuts also come at a time when hopes for an IPO bonanza and dealmaking boom in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies.

Morgan Stanley is planning to cut around 2,000 workers by the end of the first quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The reductions will affect front-office and back-office employees across all units. They won't include Morgan Stanley's army of 15,000 financial advisers, but the layoffs will affect some people working for the advisers in support functions.

The person familiar with the moves said they are part of the bank's ongoing process to assess its resource needs based on its business priorities, location strategy and employee performance globally.

""It's really about operational efficiency,"" the person said, adding that ""it doesn't relate to market conditions.""

Goldman Sachs is planning cuts amounting to 3%-5% of its workforce. Its headcount at the end of 2024 was 46,500.

The reductions are part of its annual trimming of underperformers.

""Like other banks, this is part of our normal, annual talent management process,"" a Goldman spokeswoman told Yahoo Finance, declining to discuss specifics.

The Wall Street Journal reported the culling will focus on vice presidents and that CEO David Solomon has told senior executives that in recent years the bank hired too many vice presidents relative to overall hiring.

At Bank of America, the company cut 150 junior investment bankers, The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday.

The move comes weeks after a larger reduction as part of BofA's annual review process, first reported by Reuters.

That reduction amounted to cutting 1% of staff across Bank of America's global banking and markets divisions and included managing directors, directors, and vice presidents, according to a person familiar with the matter.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country's largest bank, hasn't disclosed outright reductions but has indicated it is backing off hiring after adding roughly 50,000 more workers over the last four years.

Barron's reported the bank laid off “fewer than 1,000 employees” in February with plans for more cuts in the coming months.

“We have grown a lot,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts in January. “You have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced.”

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia's (NVDA) annual GTC event wouldn't be complete without co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang trying to wow influential names on Wall Street.

That's often done at a meeting with sell-side analysts after his keynote.

This time, Huang had a lot to discuss as he sought to stabilize a wildly popular stock that has dropped 12% in 2025.

He provided more details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, which could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity. At the same time, he moved to alter the narrative that DeepSeek's advances in AI equaled bad news for demand for Nvidia's chips.

Huang even waded into macroeconomics.

""Jensen noted that in the event of a recession, companies are likely to accelerate their capital allocation towards AI initiatives. He emphasized that AI remains the fastest-growing sector, making it a strategic priority in an economic downturn,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said. ""He indicated that, in the short term, tariffs will have little impact, and in the long term, manufacturing will be moved onshore.""

Here are some of the takeaways from Wall Street after their face time with Huang on Wednesday morning. The analysts' notes began trickling in on Thursday.

Rating: Buy

Price Target: $180

""NVDA reiterated that its Blackwell/Hopper compare (3.6 million ordered so far vs. 1.3 million peak Hopper in 2024) references orders from the top four U.S. hyperscalers, which underrepresents overall demand. Internet services, AI startups, robotics, etc. are not included. The compare was meant to illustrate the extent of continued hyperscaler demand within the backdrop of concerns related to the potential for lower compute demand post-DeepSeek.

""NVDA also believes that the impact of DeepSeek is misunderstood, i.e. distillation of large models into multiple configurations is more about running specific workloads in the most compute-efficient manner possible. In NVDA's view, distillation does not change the broader dynamic related to building the smartest/fastest AI across a wide range of workloads.""

Rating: Neutral

Price Target: $125

""From the keynote to the investor day, Mr. Huang made it clear that the market has been wrong on the impact of DeepSeek-R1 to Nvidia, stating that reasoning models use exponentially more compute than a vanilla transformer model.

""At face value, we don't see any problem with this statement as reasoning models use considerably more tokens and KV cache. However, as we pointed out from DeepSeek's OpenSourceWeek, they are serving roughly 1/3 of OpenAI's volume on a fraction of the infrastructure, at just 2224 H800s. While very few labs are extracting that kind of efficiency out of their systems, we'd note that DeepSeek open-sourcing their algorithms and repositories leaves the door open for considerable efficiency gains from other frontier labs that would be capable of serving larger inference demand within their current infrastructure.""

Listen: Why Nvidia is in a leadership position

Rating: Overweight

Price Target: $190

""Jensen noted that in the event of a recession, companies are likely to accelerate their capital allocation towards AI initiatives. He emphasized that AI remains the fastest-growing sector, making it a strategic priority in an economic downturn. Jensen affirmed NVDA's commitment to onshore manufacturing, highlighting TSMC's $100 billion investment in Arizona. He noted that NVDA is already producing silicon there and is prepared to manufacture onshore. He also underscored the agility of NVDA's global supply chain, which allows for flexible production adjustment across different regions. He indicated that, in the short term, tariffs will have little impact, and in the long term, manufacturing will be moved onshore.""

Rating: Overweight

Price Target: $170

""The team believes that spending from AI factories represents upside optionality, as it is currently not included in the data center infrastructure forecast. They expect AI factory projects to be valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The team asserts a strong competitive advantage over ASIC solutions due to its comprehensive system solutions, software stack, ecosystem, and ease of adoption. They believe that competitors are still trying to catch up to the last-generation Hopper GPU architecture, while NVIDIA is already ahead with its Blackwell architecture, which offers 40x better performance.""

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump once again turned up the pressure on the Federal Reserve, saying Wednesday evening on social media that the central bank would ""be much better off"" lowering interest rates as tariffs go into effect.

The comments on Truth Social came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

The president has promised to unveil ""reciprocal"" tariffs on many countries on April 2, which he has taken to calling ""liberation day.""

""The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,"" Trump said in his post on Truth Social. ""Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!""

Powell did not shy away from the impact of Trump's tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.

The Fed chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much — and whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

In just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now ""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed.""

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially ""transitory"" — reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices ""kind of the base case but we really can't know that"" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

It was a term that many — especially Trump allies — criticized for years after it was used only to see rising prices last longer than expected.

Trump's team has begun to use similar language to say any price effects from tariffs will be temporary and that the economy is in a ""transition.""

""Tariffs are a one-time price adjustment,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in another recent example.

Trump's pointed comments on rates follow a period when Trump has softened his criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy decisions and even made it clear he doesn't intend to fire Powell, someone he criticized repeatedly during his first term.

Bessent and other Trump aides have repeatedly said that the president is not focused on the Fed and is instead trying to bring down 10-year Treasury yields.

""Notice that he has stopped calling for the Fed to cut rates,"" Bessent said during a speech earlier this month, referring to the president.

Read more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?

But it's clear the White House does want a closer relationship with the central bank — and other independent agencies — after issuing a new executive order last week that gives Trump's appointees more power over such agencies.

The new order makes clear that monetary policy — the direction of interest rates — will remain under the Fed's full control, but that the Fed's oversight of the country's biggest banks will now have a closer connection to the policies and priorities of the White House.

Powell was asked at his press conference Wednesday if Trump's recent firings of board members at the FTC, another independent agency, loomed as a threat to the Fed's independence as well.

“I did answer that question” he said, referring to comments made last November that any removal of Powell is “not permitted by law.”

“I have no desire to change that answer and have nothing new on that for you today.”

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he doesn't know anyone who is confident in their forecast these days.

But what he did say with assurance was that the central bank will be ready to respond once the tariff uncertainty becomes enacted policy.

""It's appropriate to wait for further clarity,"" he said at the end of the March policy meeting. ""And the costs of doing that, given that the economy is still solid, are very low.""

In a message that reassured the market, and to a certain extent the White House, Powell appeared to take lessons from the Fed's pandemic response. Where the central bank was previously mistaken to believe that COVID's inflationary pressures would be ""transitory,"" Powell has now advanced the argument that the impact of tariffs could be a one-time event.

""We are well aware with what happened with the pandemic inflation. But we have to look at this as a different situation,"" he said. ""We'll be adapting as we go.""

Powell's continued wait-and-see approach makes sense when uncertainty reigns over Washington and Wall Street. But to investors who have been waiting for the next rate cut, April's widening tariff rollout may delay the Fed's next intervention, though Fed officials predict two cuts by the end of 2025. Some analysts have argued that if Powell hasn't already attempted to front-run the tariffs, it's possible the year won't see a single cut.

If the cuts do arrive, they may not feel the same. Easing rates because inflation is slowing and the economy is humming along, as the Fed did last year, isn't the same as a reactive cut to diminished growth and a weakening labor market — a potentially bumpier landing indeed. But as Powell said in so many words, who's to say what's coming?

And with decent economic hard data, despite the poor morale, the Fed's pause doesn't have to be a meaningful judgment but rather a delay, continuing to bide time even as Wall Street and other observers have started to jitter.

That time could be useful, as the impact of Trump's tariffs could squeeze the Fed in two directions at once, besetting business owners with higher costs and slower growth. That places the Fed's goals, as Powell put it, in ""tension,"" with the difficult mandate of balancing the two. When asked about this, the chair pointed to the Fed's consensus statement, which noted that the FOMC sees long-term inflation expectations as solidly enough at 2% to ""enhance"" its ability to react ""in the face of significant economic disturbances.""

Whether tariffs create one of those is anybody's guess.

Oops, something went wrong

Tesla (TSLA) clearly still has one very enthusiastic supporter left on Wall Street.

Emphasis on very enthusiastic.

Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker fell nearly 2% to $231.71 on Thursday after Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter reiterated his Overweight rating. Potter set a new $450 price target, down from his previous $500 projection, still implying nearly 90% upside from current levels.

""Yes, TSLA is still Overweight rated. The drama is nothing new (and neither is the volatility) — it's just that the stakes are higher,"" Potter wrote, as if sensitive to the inquisitive looks on clients' faces with the uber-bullish call. ""TSLA's now back to its pre-election valuation. Remember: this isn't the first time TSLA has doubled and subsequently gotten cut in half, and it likely won't be the last. In our view, nothing has changed re: Tesla's ability to remake the world's transportation and energy markets.""

He did follow several other peers on the Street, however, by cutting his delivery forecast on Tesla for 2025. ""Politics aren't to blame"" for Tesla's weak sales trends right now, Potter said.

Watch: How Elon Musk delivers on his big goals

To be sure, the bears have been in control of the wheel as it pertains to Tesla's stock price for most of 2025.

Shares are down 35% in the past month and 41% year to date. It's the worst-performing member of the closely watched ""Magnificent Seven"" complex.

There continue to be a lot of explanations for the unwinding of the Tesla bull trade.

The demand outlook remains weak, as Potter and other analysts have noted while cutting their delivery estimates. The latest sign of this comes from China, where Tesla is reportedly offering 0% APR on the Model Y to boost sales.

In February, Tesla sold just 26,677 vehicles in China, an 11.16% drop year over year and a 20% decline from January, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Meanwhile, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported a 72% year-over-year drop in Tesla's overall sales for the month

At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 72% year over year in February.

In the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop. Tesla is facing increased EV competition from General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), while some consumers are opting for hybrids.

Wall Street, more broadly, continues to sour on the stock.

Mizuho cut its delivery numbers on Tesla this week, citing changing geopolitics — a nod to Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. That involvement has thrust Tesla into a different type of limelight with Musk detractors allegedly vandalizing Tesla dealerships and charging stations across the country.

Listen: Is Tesla stock oversold on the charts?

And lastly, Tesla insiders are selling a ton of stock — more than $100 million in more than a month, according to insider selling activity data on Yahoo Finance.

""While the long-term story at Tesla has shifted to AI (robo-taxis and humanoid robots) and progress there continues, we believe these are longer dated opportunities that the premium multiple already (more than) considers,"" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote. ""Stock is currently trading at 90x P/E [price-earnings] on consensus [EPS] estimates for 2025, but again we believe that is too high.""

Spak reiterated a Sell rating on Tesla with a $225 price target last week.

Oops, something went wrong

In the span of just a few short years, Nvidia (NVDA) has become one of the most important chip companies in the world. Revenues have skyrocketed from $27 billion in the company's fiscal 2023 to $130.5 billion in its fiscal 2025. Share prices are also soaring more than 680% since January 2023.

Not quite a household name like other Big Tech firms, Nvidia is at the center of the global AI push thanks to its powerful chips, including the Blackwell Ultra, which the company showed off during its annual GTC event on Monday.

A number of technologies behind those processors, the ones that power gaming PCs around the world, and the software that runs both all originated in Nvidia's relatively small research and development department: The appropriately named Nvidia Research.

Established in 2006, the group is responsible for everything from Nvidia's ray-tracing technology, which creates realistic lighting for gamers and professional designers, to NVLink and NVSwitch, which allow graphics chips and central processing units (CPUs) to communicate at the kind of speeds needed for AI systems.

Currently, the organization is working on new chip architectures, quantum computing, and software simulators that teach robots and self-driving cars how to navigate the real world.

It's all meant to keep pushing Nvidia forward at a time when it's already riding high. And to do that the research team has adopted a willingness to fail more often than not while also giving promising projects the time they need to succeed, no matter how long it takes.

“We have to realize that most things we start in Research fail, and that's actually a good thing,” explained Bill Dally, senior vice president of research and chief scientist at Nvidia. “I tell people, you know, if everything you do succeeds, you're not swinging for the fences. You're bunting.”

Nvidia's stock price rose over 1% in pre-market trading on Thursday.

While Nvidia has developed a number of impressive technologies over the years, the company's research team isn't nearly as large as some of those at other Silicon Valley companies.

“We're a tiny fraction of the size of competitive research labs,” Dally said. “We're 300 [people] and yet, I think in things that matter, we punch well above our weight. And I think the real measure of that, for me, is our impact over the years on getting things to [a marketable] product.”

According to Dally, the best researchers are those who come up with an idea, test it, and, if it doesn't work out, abandon it without wasting resources on it.

But if a concept looks like it could pan out, the company will continue to chip away at it until it's a worthwhile product or technology.

Nvidia's ray tracing is a perfect example. The product took 10 years to develop but is now used across hundreds of major games and in design software.

“I think it's quite extraordinary that the company was able to follow through on a vision that took more than 10 years to implement,” said Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at Nvidia.

“AI is the most important example of that,” Catanzaro, who joined Nvidia as an intern in 2008, explained.

“AI in 2011 was considered old and dumb and dead. It's like, people have been trying this since the 1950s and it's never worked, so why would it work now? But there were a few of us that believed this was really an opportunity and so the company gave us the space to continue trying things out and then to produce kind of incrementally better results, which then led to more investment incrementally,” added Catanzaro.

Nvidia's DLSS, or deep learning super sampling, is another example of a product the company continued to pursue despite early struggles. Introduced in 2019, the first iteration of DLSS improves a game's image quality and performance using AI. But the software didn't hit the mark out of the gate. I remember trying it out on my own computer and not seeing much improvement while playing games.

Fast-forward to today, and the company now offers DLSS 4, which dramatically improves game visuals for even the most resource-intensive titles, including “Cyberpunk 2077.”

“DLSS 1.0 was not great, and a lot of people thought that it was a bad idea, this was a bad technology. We believed in it,” Catanzaro said. “I think Nvidia just has this unshakable belief when it knows something is true about the future, it just keeps banging away at it.”

Not every successful research project ends up as a product that directly generates revenue. However, they can help power sales indirectly by driving GPU sales.

“I'm perfectly happy with people developing … applications for GPUs that broaden the market,” Dally explained.

""Recently, our folks did this thing called Sana, which is this text-to-[image] generative network. And so it doesn't go into a product, but it's still a great success because people outside use it, and therefore it fuels demand for GPUs.""

That's ultimately the goal. But the company's newly unveiled Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin superchip also come at a time when Nvidia is facing increased competition. AMD is offering up its own AI chips designed to rival Nvidia and the company's customers are developing or deploying specialized AI processors of their own.

There are also market-shaking moves like the release of DeepSeek's R1 AI model, which sent Nvidia's market cap plunging nearly $600 billion in January, and the unpredictability of governmental intervention, including tariffs and export controls, which continue to weigh on the company's stock price.

And with tech companies like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) set to spend billions on AI infrastructure in the years ahead, Nvidia's research efforts become all the more important as it works to ensure its share of that bounty.

It just needs to keep failing quickly and moving forward.

It was just one of numerous comments from the central banker that contrasted with past meetings where he often declined to weigh in on the topic in detail.

The remarks from Powell came after the Fed on Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady and maintained a prediction of two rate cuts later this year.

What the central bank did change was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower). And those upward inflation adjustments, Powell said, are ""really due to the tariffs coming in.""

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

Trump has already levied new duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum in his first months in office, with a key deadline on April 2 threatening reciprocal tariffs that could be historic in their breadth and scope.

Trump has dubbed April 2 “Liberation Day”, signaling what he calls the big one in terms of tariffs. The move has already rattled markets, with analysts warning of further volatility as businesses and investors brace for the full scope of the policy.

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also repeatedly said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially ""transitory"" — reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices ""kind of the base case but we really can't know that"" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

But the use of the loaded word also led to some immediate critiques.

Mohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, quickly posted, ""I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility.""

The centrality of tariffs also led to critiques from Democrats.

Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said in a statement that the changed projections are ""all about tariffs and policy uncertainty,"" adding that ""these are the major factors standing in the way of interest rates coming down.""

Powell's acknowledgments Wednesday contrasted past Fed meetings, where Powell often made clear that Trump's incoming policies were on his mind without going into much detail on whether a new round of tariffs would cause inflation.

In one moment last December, Powell held up a September 2018 ""Tealbook"" simulation on tariffs and prices and called them ""a good starting point"" but declined to weigh in much further on then-President-elect Trump's policies.

At the Fed's last meeting in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, the committee noticeably removed language about inflation making progress toward its 2% inflation goal.

This time around, Powell was clear he viewed the tariffs as a headwind against his efforts to get inflation to its 2% target but maintained confidence that the central bank could handle it.

""We think our policy is in a good place to react to what comes,"" he said.

The foul stench of penguin poop sets Antarctic krill on edge.

In lab experiments, the mere scent of penguin droppings — or guano — sent krill scrambling for escape, researchers report March 20 in Frontiers in Marine Science. The stink also seemed to suppress krill's appetites.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) form a cornerstone of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. “They're the main food source for all of the big, charismatic fauna,” says Nicole Hellessey, an Antarctic marine scientist at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. Whales, penguins and seals all eat — or eat things that eat — krill. Understanding the critters' movements could help identify key areas for marine conservation.

Krill use their antennae to sniff out food, mates and even pollution. But scientists weren't sure if they could detect predators by scent. To find out, Hellessey and her colleagues netted krill off the Antarctic Peninsula and transported them to nearby Palmer Station.

In the lab, the team let krill loose in a flume filled with flowing seawater, adding either algae for the krill to eat, a bit of Adélie penguin poop or both. Cameras tracked the krill's 3-D movement.

Working with the krill was fun, says oceanographer David Fields of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. “They truly are these cute, charismatic animals.”

Working with penguin poop was another story. “Penguin crap is the most vile thing you can imagine,” Fields says. Just opening guano storage bags “would clear the entire lab space.” 

Krill showed a similar reaction to the smell. In algae-only water, they quickly swam toward the food then lingered near the buffet. But in water with algae and guano, the krill zigzagged, Hellessey says. “They'd sort of dart in, eat and dart out.” Krill swam in frantic zigzags in water containing only penguin poop, too.

A second set of experiments placed krill in seawater buckets with either algae or algae plus guano. Over 22 hours, krill in the algae-only buckets ate about 67 percent of the food. Krill in buckets with penguin poop ate only about 25 percent.

The scientists aren't sure what aromas in penguin feces the krill are reacting to. But since Adélie penguins' diets are over 99 percent krill, “a lot of that guano would have crushed-up krill sort of scents,” Hellessey suspects. Some chemical cue might make the krill go, “‘Oh my god, my buddy's hurt, I shouldn't go over there.'”

	Those sources now rival cars and factories in emitting the chemicals that help create ozone

Wildfire smoke, seen here blanketing Los Angeles in 2020, can drive up ground-level ozone pollution.

Images of California's wildfires this winter speak for themselves about the fires' devastating effects. But those pictures don't tell the whole story. Together with soil emissions, the fires are driving an increase in ground-level ozone pollution — causing a fundamental shift in our atmosphere's chemistry, researchers say, and potentially rendering air pollution standards unmeetable. 

“We're entering a new air pollution regime,” says Ian Faloona, an atmospheric chemist at University of California, Davis.

Analyzing satellite data and ground-level observations, Faloona and his colleagues have teased apart the sources that contribute to ozone in major air basins in the southwestern United States. Soil and wildfire emissions of nitrogen-containing ozone precursors, collectively referred to as “NOx,” are increasingly raising ozone levels, the team found. These NOx emissions levels are now comparable with those from such human-made sources as cars and factories throughout the southwestern United States, Faloona says. He reported his initial findings January at the American Meteorology Society's annual meeting in New Orleans.

Ground-level ozone typically comes from other primary pollutants that react with sunlight and stagnant air. It has been linked to adverse health effects, including increased respiratory illness, reproductive problems, premature death and some cancers. That's why it is among six main air pollutants that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has regulated since the 1970s.

Over time, the standard for ozone has been ratcheted down, most recently in 2015; it's now 70 parts per billion over an eight-hour average. But “estimates of future emissions are overlooking an immense source from agricultural emissions, and wishing away wildfires,” Faloona says.

While regulations have limited NOx production by human-made sources, particularly in urban areas, satellite data since 2015 began to show rising NOx levels in remote areas of California. Faloona found patterns linked with an alarming rise in recent wildfire activity and increasing soil emissions due to a warming climate and rising fertilizer use.

The findings come as wildfires have ravaged areas coast-to-coast in the United States, from January's devastating fires in Los Angeles to more recent conflagrations in South Carolina and Long Island, N.Y.

While ozone levels in different California air basins have dropped over the past few decades, they remain persistently above the EPA standard (red dashed line) for ambient air quality. That includes in both urban (San Diego) and more agricultural areas (like the Sacramento Valley). A new study teases out how wildfires and agricultural practices may be contributing to the problem.

Ozone levels in select California locations, 2000–2023

Previous research has shown how wildfire smoke wafting over cities can jump-start ozone production. And Dan Jaffe, a climatologist at the University of Washington in Bothell, Wash., recently showed that the number of days that exceed national air quality ozone thresholds doubles during high wildfire years.

But how much wildfire smoke, along with fertilizer emissions, contributed to the problem was unknown.

Sponsor Message

Faloona developed a method to derive how much of the ozone came from various sources, and found a fundamental shift. A steady decrease over the past z several decades has now stalled. The vast majority of ozone — 64 to 70 ppb — still wafts in from the Pacific Ocean from sources beyond U.S. borders, as it has since the 1990s. Meanwhile, now-regulated automobile and industrial sources, which once accounted for as much as 15 to 20 ppb in mid-sized cities, now contribute under 6 ppb in most urban areas (excluding megapolises like Los Angeles).

Wildfire and soil impacts boost ozone by another 1 to 7 ppb, he found, or up to 50 percent of the excess ozone. In a follow-up study focused on one air basin free of wildfire impacts, he found that some 2 ppb of NOx in the air came from agricultural fertilizers.

Those numbers might not sound like much. But when it comes to trying to stay below 70 ppb, every bit counts. What emerges is that unregulated sources of ozone precursors from wildfires and agricultural soils are presently contributing as much to most urban areas in the U.S. Southwest as are traditional anthropogenic sources. 

Yet some of that data aren't always figured into efforts to combat ozone. For instance, for states calculating ozone compliance, the EPA offers a mechanism to exclude data that came from exceptional events — like wildfires. Demonstrating that a day was influenced by smoke is so complicated that states rarely invoke the rule. “If you're holding the wrong person accountable for pollution they didn't cause, our system breaks down,” Jaffe says.

PAMELA RAITH

Weather Girl, at London's Soho Theatre until 5 April, is a frantic and funny one-woman show about the looming climate apocalypse.

Written by Brian Watkins, it stars Julia McDermott as Stacey, a local weather forecaster in Fresno, California. Sandwiched between segments on dog shows and testicular tanning, her reports on the droughts and wildfires in her state are always delivered with a winning smile – until, one day, she snaps.

Weather Girl is an attack on wilful ignorance – of climate change, naturally, but also of the plight of women like Stacey,…

Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an Egyptian army where an Israelite king was killed. The discoveries at Megiddo, which inspired ""Armageddon,"" reinforce biblical stories about King Josiah of Judah.

New archaeological evidence from the ancient city of Megiddo — the location of the final battle ""Armageddon"" in the Book of Revelation — supports the biblical story of an Israelite king and Egyptian pharaoh clashing there more than 2,600 years ago.

According to the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament (which are slightly different collections of ancient Hebrew writings), the Kingdom of Judah's King Josiah confronted the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II at Megiddo in 609 B.C. Now, an analysis of ancient pottery fragments indicates that Megiddo was indeed occupied by the Egyptians at that time, Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University, told Live Science.

Finkelstein is the lead author of a study describing the finds, which was published Jan. 28 in The Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament. He said in an email that large numbers of Egyptian pottery fragments had been discovered alongside Greek pottery fragments in a layer dating to the late seventh century — a time when Egypt often employed Greek mercenaries alongside Egyptian troops. The researchers determined the origins of the fragments by examining the type of clay and their style.

The fragments support the biblical accounts that Egyptian forces were at Megiddo during Josiah's reign. However, the findings aren't direct evidence that Josiah was at the battle. If he was there, as the Bible says, it's unclear if Josiah died from wounds he'd suffered during a battle against the Egyptians at Megiddo, or if he was executed there as a vassal of the pharaoh. Josiah's death was later said to foretell the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. to the Neo-Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II, whose forces destroyed the First Temple, also known as Solomon's Temple.

Archaeologist Assaf Kleiman of Ben-Gurion University, a study co-author, told Live Science in an email that the confrontation between the two rulers was described differently in two different places in the Bible. ""The Josiah-Necho event at Megiddo in 609 BCE is described in the Bible twice: as an execution in a short chronistic verse in Kings and as a decisive battle in Chronicles,"" he said. The Book of Kings was written close to the time of the reported events, but the Book of Chronicles was composed centuries later, so the account in the Book of Kings was more reliable, he said.

The finds indicate that Egyptian troops were stationed there with a contingent of Greek mercenaries when the biblical King Josiah of Judea was killed in 609 B.C.

Experts say it is not clear whether King Josiah went to Megiddo to do battle as an enemy or as the leader of a vassal state who was executed by Pharaoh Necho. 

The ruins of Megiddo are now in a national park about 18 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Haifa. Megiddo was a strategically important city at a crossroads on trade and military routes, and it was occupied at different times by Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians. Many great battles occurred at Megiddo, and its name inspired the word ""Armageddon""—the location of a final battle prophesied in the New Testament's Book of Revelation, which now refers generally to the idea of the end of the world.

Excavations at Megiddo have unearthed more than 20 archaeological layers since the 1920s. The layer with Egyptian and Greek pottery fragments described in the latest study is among several layers that date from after 732 B.C., when records indicate Megiddo was conquered by the Neo-Assyrians under their king Tiglath-Pileser III. According to the Bible, the northern kingdom of Israel fell to the Neo-Assyrians about 10 years later, followed by the expulsion of the ""10 tribes"" or ""lost tribes"" of Israel.

The many fragments of Greek pottery found at Megiddo suggest a contingent of Greek mercenaries were stationed there alongside Egyptian troops.

The many Egyptian pottery fragments found in the same place indicate Megiddo was then under the military control of a force of Egyptian troops. 

There is debate among academics whether the encounter between Josiah and Necho at Megiddo in 609 B.C. was actually a battle, or if Necho had merely executed his vassal Josiah there—in other words, whether the southern Israelite kingdom of Judah was subordinate to Egypt at that time. The Bible does not record this, but history and archaeology indicate Egypt took over the region after 630 B.C. as Neo-Assyrian power declined.

Historian Jacob Wright, a professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science that Josiah had probably traveled from Jerusalem to Megiddo to pay homage to Necho but was executed there for an unknown reason.

—2,800-year-old structure unearthed in Israel was likely used for cultic practices and sacrifice, archaeologists say

—2,700-year-old archaeological site in Jordan may be a biblical place visited by King David

Wright and Reinhard Kratz, a historian at the University of Göttingen in Germany who was also not involved in the study, both noted that the relevant verse in the Book of Kings says only that Josiah traveled to Megiddo and was ""put to death"" there — and that nothing was written about a battle until more than 100 years later in the Book of Chronicles.

The authors of the new study, too, are cautious about the circumstances of Josiah's death.

Finkelstein noted that Josiah was considered an exceptionally pious king, and that the idea of ""Armageddon"" had only begun after his death. This suggests Josiah's death had led to prophecies that the final battle between the forces of God and the forces of evil would take place where he died, Finkelstein said.

Editor's note: This article was updated at 9:28 a.m. ET to correctly attribute a quote explaining that the Josiah-Necho event at Megiddo is described twice in the Bible. That quote was said by archaeologist Assaf Kleiman of Ben-Gurion University, not by Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University.

Most people exposed to the parasites behind babesiosis don't get sick, but for others, the infection can be deadly.

Disease name: Babesiosis

Affected populations: Babesiosis is a rare and potentially fatal parasitic disease that destroys red blood cells, the cells that supply tissues with oxygen from the lungs. The disease, which is spread by ticks, occurs worldwide, including in the United States and Europe.

Fewer than 3,000 cases of babesiosis are reported annually in the U.S., and they most commonly occur between May and September in the upper Midwest and Northeast, including in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Connecticut and New York. Cases tend to rise in the spring and summer as this is when people are most likely to be in contact with the ticks that spread the disease.

Causes: Babesiosis is caused by microscopic parasites that belong to the genus Babesia. These parasites usually infect cattle and are spread between animals by ticks that eat the blood of different hosts.

Related: Tick-borne parasite is spreading in the Northeast, CDC says

Once inside the body, Babesia parasites invade and destroy red blood cells. This severely limits the ability of these cells to supply tissues with oxygen.

While more than 100 species of Babesia parasites have been identified, overall, only a few species are known to infect humans.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

In the U.S., most babesiosis infections are caused by a parasite species called Babesia microti and are spread by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also known as deer ticks. These ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy or grassy areas.

In rarer instances, Babesia parasites can be spread from one person to another via contaminated blood transfusions, and they can also spread from mother to fetus across the placenta.

Symptoms: Most people exposed to Babesia parasites don't have any symptoms of babesiosis; this is especially true for young, healthy people.

However, in individuals who have weakened immune systems or who are over the age of 50, the parasites can trigger severe disease. People who have had their spleen removed are also more vulnerable to serious infections than the average person, because the spleen normally helps remove infected red blood cells from the body.



Typical symptoms of babesiosis include fever, chills, sweating, muscle aches and pains, as well as swelling of the liver and spleen and having a low level of red blood cells in the body. Symptoms usually emerge within one to four weeks of a person being infected with Babesia parasites, and they can last for several days after onset.

Serious cases of babesiosis can cause multiorgan failure and death, as tissues are starved of oxygen.

Estimates for death rates from babesiosis vary considerably between studies. However, surveillance data gathered in 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found a 0.57% death rate among patients in the U.S.

Death rates may be closer to 20% in patients who belong to high-risk groups, even when they receive treatment.

Treatments: Patients who don't have symptoms of babesiosis usually don't require treatment, as the immune system will typically clear the parasites away within one to two weeks.

In symptomatic patients, the main treatment for babesiosis is a combination of antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics. The latter drugs are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, rather than parasitic infections, but certain kinds of antibiotics, such as clindamycin, can also be effective against parasites.

Patients who are very sick may also require a blood transfusion to replace their damaged and infected red blood cells.

The best way to prevent babesiosis is to avoid areas where ticks live, according to the CDC. If you are in those areas, there are precautions you can take to avoid tick bites.

Breakthrough could pave the way for next-generation GPS in drones, smartphones and self-driving cars, scientists say.

A new comb-like computer chip could be the key to equipping drones, smartphones and autonomous vehicles with military-grade positioning technology that was previously confined to space agencies and research labs.

Scientists have developed a ""microcomb chip"" — a 5 millimeter (0.2 inches) wide computer chip equipped with tiny teeth like those on a comb — that could make optical atomic clocks, the most precise timekeeping pieces on the planet, small and practical enough for real-world use.

This could mean GPS-equipped systems a thousand times more accurate than the best we have today, improving everything from smartphone and drone navigation to seismic monitoring and geological surveys, the researchers said in a statement. They published their findings Feb. 19 in the journal Nature Photonics.

""Today's atomic clocks enable GPS systems with a positional accuracy of a few meters [where 1 meter is 3.3 feet]. With an optical atomic clock, you may achieve a precision of just a few centimeters [where 1 centimeter is 0.4 inches],"" study co-author Minghao Qi, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, said in the statement.

""This improves the autonomy of vehicles, and all electronic systems based on positioning. An optical atomic clock can also detect minimal changes in latitude on the Earth's surface and can be used for monitoring, for example, volcanic activity.""

There are approximately 400 high-precision atomic clocks worldwide, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to keep time.

This typically involves using microwaves to stimulate atoms to shift between energy states. These shifts, called oscillations, happen naturally at an extremely high rate, acting like an ultra-precise ticking clock that keeps timekeeping accurate to within a billionth of a second.

That is why atomic clocks form the backbone of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — which is used to set global time zones — and GPS (global positioning system) satellites, which rely on atomic timekeeping to provide positioning data to cars, smartphones and other devices.

Despite this incredible accuracy, traditional atomic clocks are far less accurate than optical atomic clocks. Where standard atomic clocks use microwave frequencies to excite atoms, optical atomic clocks use laser light, enabling them to measure atomic vibrations at a much finer scale — making them thousands of times more precise.

Until now, optical atomic clocks have been confined to extremely limited scientific and research environments, such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is because they are extremely complex, putting them well out of reach of your standard Casio fan.

Microcomb chips could change this by bridging the gap between high-frequency optical signals (which optical atomic clocks use) and the radio frequencies used in the navigation and communication systems that modern electronics rely on.

""Like the teeth of a comb, a microcomb consists of a spectrum of evenly distributed light frequencies. Optical atomic clocks can be built by locking a microcomb tooth to a ultra-narrow-linewidth laser, which in turn locks to an atomic transition with extremely high frequency stability,"" the researchers explained in the statement.

—New navigation system uses cellphone signals to fly a plane in case GPS fails

—Cosmic-ray 'GPS' system that tracks underground movement could change the way we respond to disasters

—Lost in space? Here's a new method to find your way back home

They likened the new system to a set of gears, where a tiny, fast-spinning gear (the optical frequency) drives a larger, slower one (the radio frequency). Just as gears transfer motion while reducing speed, the microcomb acts as a converter that changes the ultra-fast oscillations of atoms into a stable time signal that electronics can process.

""Moreover, the minimal size of the microcomb makes it possible to shrink the atomic clock system significantly while maintaining its extraordinary precision,"" study co-author Victor Torres Company, professor of photonics at Chalmers, said in the statement. ""We hope that future advances in materials and manufacturing techniques can further streamline the technology, bringing us closer to a world where ultra-precise timekeeping is a standard feature in our mobile phones and computers.""

""What will be new about heat deaths is the extent to which the lived environment will become physically uninhabitable for everyone, old and young, middle-aged, healthy and ill.""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In this extract from ""The Pocket Guide to Planetary Peril"" (WH Allen, 2025), author Jakob Thomä, a professor at the University of London's SOAS Centre for Sustainable Finance, examines an existential threat facing us all: heat. As the impacts of climate change take hold, Thomä argues that heat will become the risk no one can avoid.

We live in places that will be flooded by rising sea levels. We have food production systems dependent on specific climates. And we have built economic structures, trade relationships and social dynamics contingent on certain temperatures.

What's more, we are not alone in this world, and the rapidly changing climate is a threat to the flora and fauna with whom we share this planet. Some of us think this is a problem — although admittedly not all of us.

The key questions then are: How fragile are systems to a changing climate? What are the costs of the impacts or shocks to the system (such as relocating people from places underwater, or victims of extreme weather events that are made more likely by climate change)? What are the costs of adapting to these impacts? How do we negotiate the equity and distributional impacts of these effects? And crucially, what are the costs of preventing these impacts to begin with?

That is the climate discourse in a nutshell. Except for heat. Heat is a different story because we cannot live above a certain heat level.

Of course, the heat story is driven by climate change, so at first glance it may seem I am making an artificial distinction here. Global warming is heat and heat is global warming. But the reason is that it creates an almost unmanageable risk, one incapable of being mitigated by adaptation, at least within the current technological paradigm.

This is different to almost any other effect from climate change. We can maintain habitats below sea level, the Netherlands being a perfect example, through dams and adaptation. Perhaps we would not be able to do this everywhere, and perhaps we would decide that we couldn't be bothered — economically speaking — to do this, but we at least have the means.

We can change food production patterns, our economic activity cycles, we can irrigate, we can create water, we can do all these things. Some have prohibitive price tags and come with dramatic non-financial costs to health, cultural capital and societal welfare. But they can be done.

Heat is the final boss. Heat is a different beast. Heat deaths in and of themselves may not appear as a particularly new or novel phenomenon. They happen everywhere, as the frail, the ill and the old are unable to regulate their body temperatures during hot summers.

And heat deaths can also happen to the young. One of the first ""proven"" victims of climate change is a 6-year-old boy from Toyota, Japan, who collapsed in a park on a morning field trip, and was dead by the afternoon.

When I think of the heartbreak of our indifference, I think of him. These kinds of deaths will increase in frequency through climate change but, of course, as any self-respecting climate sceptic or denialist will tell you, we can also expect fewer deaths from cold temperatures.

Indeed, there is some reason to believe that from a pure temperature perspective, temperature-related mortality has in fact decreased in the past decades, not just because of improved adaptation, but also because of warmer winters.

—'An existential threat affecting billions': Three-quarters of Earth's land became permanently drier in last 3 decades

—'Dengue is coming': Climate-fueled rise in cases will affect the US, scientists warn

Over time, that pendulum — as we near 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming above pre-industrial levels — will swing in the other direction, with up to 10 million annual climate deaths by the end of the century, according to some estimates (not counting the indirect deaths from climate poverty, conflict and so on).

What will be new about heat deaths is the extent to which the lived environment will become physically uninhabitable for everyone, old and young, middle-aged, healthy and ill.

If there was an early NFL offseason loser, it may be the San Francisco 49ers. Following the first season in which they missed the playoffs in four years, the 49ers lost left tackle Jaylon Moore, guard Aaron Banks, safety Talanoa Hufanga, linebacker Dre Greenlaw, cornerback Charvarius Ward and other contributors in free agency, and also traded wide receiver Deebo Samuel to the Washington Commanders. The 49ers' defensive line will also look very different, as Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins and Leonard Floyd are no longer on roster. 

What is San Francisco doing? General manager John Lynch says the team has a plan, and ""some big things coming our way.""

""We've got this thing called the draft, and we've got a lot of picks,"" Lynch said, per The Athletic. ""And I think the thing the fans should know is we have a plan. And we're gonna execute that plan. And we're excited about the opportunity.""

It's true that real teams are built through the draft compared to free agency, and the 49ers are poised to make a splash next month in Green Bay with four picks in the top 100 selections. Ultimately, this 49ers roster was due for a reset after ""doubling down"" last year following San Francisco's overtime Super Bowl loss. 

""Last year, we had such a good roster,"" Lynch said. ""I think we doubled down and said, 'Let's go for this thing.' And we kinda pushed all the chips in knowing that at some point you're gonna have to have that reset. And this was the year. So guys like Leonard Floyd and Maliek — believe me, their impact was felt. They were great. It was nothing they did wrong. We just felt like it was the time to do it, and we're excited about what we can add and replenish.""

Lynch said you have to clear room to be able to make these ""big things"" come to fruition. One of those ""big things"" could be the extension of quarterback Brock Purdy -- although that's something Lynch declined to discuss this week. Team owner Jed York has said they want the former Mr. Irrelevant in San Francisco for years to come, and that they will ""do everything we can to make that work."" It's fair to assume some of this cleaning house has to do with that looming, massive contract.

The biggest waves of 2025 NFL free agency have subsided, with most of this offseason's top available veterans now handsomely paid, either by new teams or their own. Blockbuster trades have also come and gone, with former Pro Bowlers like Deebo Samuel and DK Metcalf settling in with new clubs.

That doesn't mean player movement is completely over. A handful of teams are still in dire need of help at quarterback, the game's most important position. Dozens of accomplished free agents are still waiting for the right opportunity to surface, either before, during or after April's NFL Draft. And that's not accounting for surprise trades or cuts, which could trickle in even after all 32 teams kick off their offseason programs.

Which unsigned vets offer the best value? Which teams are still searching for starting-caliber talent, and/or bargain-bin insurance? And where might some of the top remaining free agents wind up? We decided to play matchmaker for 10 of the most notable names still available, including at least one future Hall of Famer at quarterback, plus a couple of Pro Bowl wide receivers:

The Minnesota Vikings would be a dream destination for Rodgers, considering their elite staff, fortified front and splashy playmakers. The Vikings seem more intent on riding with J.J. McCarthy, though, so the best match for Rodgers (besides retirement or waiting for a desperate injury-induced phone call) is probably Pittsburgh. The Steelers are often old-school to a fault, hence their recent wild-card ceiling, but they at least offer legitimate weapons in DK Metcalf and George Pickens, plus a Mike Tomlin-led defense.

The Steelers make sense on paper, not only because of the familiarity but because of DK Metcalf's arrival as another deep threat; Wilson once chucked the rock to Metcalf during their days with the Seattle Seahawks. The quarterback's 2024 finish was painfully sluggish, however, all but necessitating a fresh start. And New York, which badly needs a starter, could conceivably pair him with a first-round prospect.

Carson Wentz is another big-armed journeyman who makes sense here, especially given his Midwestern roots. Winston is a touch younger with a touch more recent starting experience, though, and Kevin O'Connell might like his fiery leadership in the same room as the still-growing J.J. McCarthy.

Dallas reportedly tried to land Cooper Kupp before the ex-Los Angeles Rams star joined the Seahawks, so they'd clearly like to install a route-running savant opposite CeeDee Lamb. Diggs is aging, but he's been just that for much of his career. His brother, Trevon Diggs, also plays for the Cowboys.

The former Pro Bowler has had a curiously quiet market for a guy just traded for a third-round pick during the 2024 season, signaling league-wide concern over how much he's got left in the tank. Yet Denver could use additional safety valves for young quarterback Bo Nix, and Cooper's long been a solid technician.

Released in a cost-cutting move by the Seahawks, Lockett is no spring chicken going on 33, and his numbers have dipped for three straight seasons. His downfield savviness could still be valuable in a reserve role, though, and Las Vegas offers strong Seattle connections in Pete Carroll and Geno Smith.

Seattle got younger at quarterback by adding Sam Darnold, but now the Seahawks need to bolster the trenches to keep their man upright. Jenkins' best attribute might be versatility, as he improved by going from tackle to guard during his time with the Chicago Bears. He could line up at multiple spots.

Buffalo still has a vacancy at cornerback after letting Rasul Douglas hit the market, and Samuel is one of the few veterans available with the ball skills to replicate Douglas' own turnover magnetism. Bills coach Sean McDermott once coached Samuel's father while coordinating the Philadelphia Eagles' defense.

Green Bay paid big bucks to secure Nate Hobbs from the Las Vegas Raiders, but he's done most of his best work out of the slot. And Jaire Alexander could still be on the move after a slew of injury-riddled seasons. Douglas, meanwhile, made a name for himself as a Packers ballhawk from 2021-2023.

Philadelphia created a hole at safety by dealing C.J. Gardner-Johnson to the Houston Texans. Simmons isn't as dynamic as he once was, now 31, but he's got valuable experience in Vic Fangio's defense from their time together with the Denver Broncos. He's already expressed interest in going to Philly.

Pretty much all season long, the Oklahoma City Thunder have been the top team in the league -- that is, if you consider net rating to be the ultimate judge. Even when the Cleveland Cavaliers had a better record, the numbers consistently said that the Thunder outscored opponents by more points per 100 possessions than any other team in the league.

Finally, as of Thursday morning, the record matches the analytics, as OKC takes over the No. 1 spot in this week's NBA Power Rankings after eclipsing the Cavs for the league's best mark at 57-12. That's due to a rare three-game losing streak by Cleveland, while the Thunder keep powering along despite the absence of key players virtually every night. It really is a well-oiled machine Mark Daigneault is running out there.

Speaking of machines, the Houston Rockets are surging toward the top of the rankings thanks to an eight-game winning streak that has them all the way back in the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference. Another deep team in the mold of the Thunder, the Rockets survived without Fred VanVleet for a month and now have been making do without Amen Thompson, thanks in large part to Tari Eason, who's been excellent as a fill-in starter.

While the Thunder and Rockets are thriving without their stars, the New York Knicks are counting the days until Jalen Brunson returns from his ankle injury. He's expected to be out at least through March, and the Knicks have gone 3-3 without him so far, including a bad loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday. It's no secret that the Knicks rely heavily on Bruson and the rest of their starters, so it will be interesting to see how they fare over the next couple of weeks.

As the postseason inches closer and closer, here are this week's NBA Power Rankings.

Four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Stefon Diggs is making his first team visit in free agency, meeting with the New England Patriots in Foxboro, according to The Athletic. This is Diggs' first visit of the offseason, per NFL Media, as the veteran wideout recovers from a torn ACL.

Diggs was one of the NFL's best wide receivers in the 2020s, but he's now 31 years old and coming off an ACL tear he suffered in Week 8 of the 2024 season with the Houston Texans. Another piece of sour news for Diggs is that his receiving yards per game and yards per catch have steadily declined lately. Plus, he is currently in the middle of a 19-game drought without 100 yards receiving, the longest stretch of his career. 

However, none of that may matter for a Patriots squad desperate to surround quarterback Drake Maye, the third overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft, with pass-catching talent. New England's 2024 wide receiving core combined to total 1,723 yards receiving, the fewest of any team's wide receiver position group last season. Tight end Hunter Henry and wide receiver Demario Douglas co-led the Patriots in catches (66) while Hunter led the team in yards receiving (674).

Diggs' 492 receptions and 5,858 yards receiving since 2020 both rank as the sixth-most in the NFL. He helped 2024 NFL MVP and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen take a leap in his development after coming over in a trade from the Minnesota Vikings in 2020, and if the Patriots decide to sign him, that would indicate New England feels Diggs can perhaps do something similar for Maye.

The Houston Texans have extended the life on their Pro Bowl defensive end duo of 2023 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. and five-time Pro Bowler Danielle Hunter.

Houston is extending Hunter on a one-year, $35.6 million contract for 2026, per NFL Media. Hunter was set to enter 2025 on the final year of a two-year, $49 million contract he signed with the Texans in free agency last offseason. The 30-year-old will now make $55.1 million ($54.1 million guaranteed) across the next two seasons. In his first season with his hometown Texans, Hunters racked up 12.0 sacks, which were tied for the fifth-most in the NFL, and 66 quarterback pressures, which were tied for the ninth-most in the league.

He and Anderson (11.0 sacks, tied for 10th in the NFL) combined for 23.0 sacks last season, which ranked as the third-most in the league by a teammate duo behind only the Denver Broncos' duo of Nik Bonitto and Jonathan Cooper (24.0) and the Minnesota Vikings' tandem of Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel (23.5). Hunter's $35.6 million salary in 2026 will rank as the second-highest among all edge rushers behind only 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett's $40 million-per-year salary on his four-year, $160 million extension with the Cleveland Browns.

DAYTON, Ohio (AP)  Marcus Foster scored 22 points and Zach Freemantle added 15 while overcoming foul trouble as Xavier rallied past Texas 86-80 in the First Four on Wednesday night.

The Musketeers (22-11) erased a 13-point deficit in their biggest comeback win this season and advanced into the main bracket of the NCAA Tournament to play No. 6 seed Illinois on Friday night in a Midwest Region game at Milwaukee.

“That's one of the greatest games I've ever been a part of,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “I thought we beat an excellent Texas team. They are disciplined. They have depth and talent. We knew it was going to be a great challenge to beat a really good team from the SEC. I'm really proud of our team.”

Tre Johnson led the Longhorns (19-16) with 23 points in a matchup of No. 11 seeds. Tramon Mark scored 16.

Freemantle hit a turnaround jumper to break a 78-all tie with 1:48 remaining and his two free throws extended Xavier's lead to 82-79 with 1:09 left. Johnson missed a fadeaway jumper, and Dailyn Swain's putback of Freemantle's missed 3-pointer upped the margin to five with 20 seconds to play.

Chendall Weaver made one of two free throws for Texas before Freemantle's dunk sealed it. Xavier closed the game on a 16-6 run over the final six minutes.

Freemantle arrived at Xavier in 2019. He sat out last season because of injury and returned for a fifth season of competition with the hope of playing in his first NCAA Tournament.

“Storybook, maybe not,” he said. “Obviously, we would have liked to maybe win by a little more. But any win we can get is a great thing. It was a very hard-fought game. That's a very good team we just played, and I'm just thankful to be a part of it.”

Foster shot 8 for 9 from the field, including 4 of 5 on 3s, and finished with eight rebounds.

Freemantle, who averaged 19.8 points during the Musketeers' seven-game winning streak to close the regular season, had two points and two fouls in the first half. He picked up his fourth foul with 7:10 left.

Texas led 47-39 at halftime. It was the first time Xavier trailed at the break since a Jan. 29 loss at Creighton.

“I thought we had one of our better first halves of the year,” Texas coach Rodney Terry said. “Give them credit. They made big plays, big shots, and finished the game down the stretch.”

The Musketeers were down by 13 in the first half and still trailed by 10 with 16 minutes remaining. Jerome Hunter's 3-pointer tied the score at 65 with eight minutes left.

A 3-pointer by Oklahoma transfer John Hugley put the Musketeers ahead 75-74 with 5:07 to go.

It was the fourth time since 1990 the teams met in the NCAA Tournament, with each school winning twice.

The Longhorns took advantage of early foul trouble for Xavier and got to the rim at will in the first half, scoring 26 of 47 points in the paint. The Musketeers adjusted defensively and allowed only 10 points in the paint after halftime.

What changed?

“I would just say our defensive intensity, getting more deflections,” Foster said. “When we get deflections, it's hard to beat us. So we really just locked in on that. We understood that we really didn't have much of a problem on offense, but a problem on defense. Once we addressed that, things started to go our way.”

University of Dayton Arena is located about an hour's drive from Xavier's campus, resulting in a partisan Musketeers crowd. Dayton playing in the NIT on Wednesday night gave Xavier fans an opportunity to scoop up more seats.

“Our fans certainly took advantage of the proximity to Cincinnati,” Miller said. “And that emotion when we needed them, it was certainly a factor in the game.”

The Longhorns kept them quiet for much of the game, until the Musketeers rallied.

“I wish we would have had more Dayton fans than Xavier fans,” Terry said.

The 2025 Valspar Championship is set to get underway on Thursday, March 20, and several players will enter this week's event confident they can secure the victory. Justin Thomas has 15 career victories on the PGA Tour and has finished T-9 or better in three of his last six starts, which includes a runner-up showing at The American Express in January. Thomas tied the course record (62) at TPC Sawgrass last week and will enter the 2025 Valspar Championship as one of the best putters on tour, ranking second in putting average (1.649) and ninth in one-putt percentage (44.05%). Thomas will play alongside Jordan Spieth and Karl Vilips through the first two rounds with the trio teeing off on Thursday at 1:23 p.m. ET. 

Meanwhile, Xander Schauffele has an impressive streak of 59 consecutive made cuts, the most on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods from 1998-2005. Schauffele, Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood are the 14-1 co-favorites, according to the latest 2025 Valspar Championship odds. Schauffele is -500 (risk $500 to win $100) to make the cut. Some of the other 2025 Valspar Championship contenders include Sam Burns (22-1), Corey Conners (25-1), Sepp Straka (25-1), Shane Lowry (25-1) and Will Zalatoris (25-1). Before locking in your 2025 Valspar Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

Now that the 2025 Valspar Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.

One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Valspar Championship: Sam Burns, a five-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and doesn't even crack the top 10. Burns has had tremendous success at this event in recent years. He finished on top of the Valspar Championship leaderboard in 2021 and 2022 before finishing sixth in 2023. 

However, Burns has battled with inconsistency in 2025 after securing a T-8 finish at The Sentry in January. He's coming off a missed cut at the Players Championship and has finished T-48 or worse in three of his past four starts on the PGA Tour. The 28-year-old has struggled with accuracy off the tee this season, ranking 113th in driving accuracy (57.35%). Burns also ranks 117th in one-putt percentage ((38.89%) and 154th in strokes gained: approach to green (-0.514). He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values in the 2025 Valspar Championship field. See who else to fade here. 

Another surprise: Alex Smalley, a 45-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.

Smalley is still searching for his first win on the PGA Tour, but he has all the tools needed to be in the mix at Innisbrook this week. He's been competitive this season, finishing T-18 or better in five of his first seven starts on the PGA Tour. He's coming off a T-14 showing at the Players Championship and is ranked second in scoring average (68.36), third in strokes gained: total (1.805) and 11th in strokes gained: off the tee (0.572). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2025 Valspar Championship bets. See who else to pick here. 

The model is also targeting two other golfers with odds of 40-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.

Who will win the 2025 Valspar Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the 2025 Valspar Championship odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

Cade Cunningham is likely on his way to an All-NBA selection and has a case as a top-five MVP finisher, and he further strengthened his case for both on Wednesday by banking in the game-winning 3 with less than a second to play to give the Pistons a 116-113 over the Heat. 

First, Cunningham had to hit a 3 to put the Pistons up two with less than a minute to play, then, after a couple of Tyler Herro free throws, he worked his magic from the top of the key to seal the deal.

Cunningham finished with 25 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, two blocks and a steal for his ninth triple-double of the season. The win was a big one for the Pistons, who have now won two straight against two tanking teams -- whether by design or not -- in New Orleans and Miami to get back on track after losing four of six. 

Combined with Milwaukee's loss at Golden State on Tuesday, the Pistons (39-31), who have all but locked up a top-six seed, are just one game behind the Bucks (38-30) in the loss column for the No. 5 seed in the East with 12 games to play. 

Oh and by the way, Detroit closes its season with consecutive games against Milwaukee. Even though Cleveland has been incredible this season and might very well be the best team in the league, you have to think the Bucks and Pistons would both prefer to be at least the No. 5 seed to steer clear of Boston through the first two rounds -- or at least to face Indiana rather than New York in the first round. 

Of course, both teams are still aiming higher for a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round. As that goes, the Pistons trail the Pacers by two games in the loss column, but that deficit is effectively three as the Pacers have sealed the tiebreaker via a 3-1 head-to-head advantage. 

On the other side, the Heat continue to fade fast as Wednesday night's result was their ninth consecutive loss. When that losing streak reached eight on Monday, it marked the longest losing streak of the Erik Spoelstra era, which dates back to 2008. Now 29-40, Miami is 4-16 since the Jimmy Butler trade. Only the openly tanking 76ers and Jazz have been worse in that stretch. 

At 10th in the East, the Heat are still five games ahead of the Raptors for the final spot in the Play-In Tournament. Their 2025 first-round pick belongs to the Thunder, but is protected 1-14 this year before becoming unprotected in 2026.

The Trump administration's crackdown on DEI programs could exacerbate an unexpectedly steep drop in diversity among medical school students, even in states like California, where public universities have been navigating bans on affirmative action for decades. Education and health experts warn that, ultimately, this could harm patient care.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued a handful of executive orders aimed at terminating all diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in federally funded programs. And in his March 4 address to Congress, he described the Supreme Court's 2023 decision banning the consideration of race in college and university admissions as ""brave and very powerful.""

Last month, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights — which lost about 50% of its staff in mid-March — directed schools, including postsecondary institutions, to end race-based programs or risk losing federal funding. The ""Dear Colleague"" letter cited the Supreme Court's decision.

Paulette Granberry Russell, president and CEO of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, said that ""every utterance of 'diversity' is now being viewed as a violation or considered unlawful or illegal."" Her organization filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.

While California and eight other states — Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Washington — had already implemented bans of varying degrees on race-based admissions policies well before the Supreme Court decision, schools bolstered diversity in their ranks with equity initiatives such as targeted scholarships, trainings, and recruitment programs.

But the court's decision and the subsequent state-level backlash — 29 states have since introduced bills to curb diversity initiatives, according to data published by the Chronicle of Higher Education — have tamped down these efforts and led to the recent declines in diversity numbers, education experts said.

After the Supreme Court's ruling, the numbers of Black and Hispanic medical school enrollees fell by double-digit percentages in the 2024-25 school year compared with the previous year, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Black enrollees declined 11.6%, while the number of new students of Hispanic origin fell 10.8%. The decline in enrollment of American Indian or Alaska Native students was even more dramatic, at 22.1%. New Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander enrollment declined 4.3%.

""We knew this would happen,"" said Norma Poll-Hunter, AAMC's senior director of workforce diversity. ""But it was double digits — much larger than what we anticipated.""

The fear among educators is the numbers will decline even more under the new administration.

At the end of February, the Education Department launched an online portal encouraging people to ""report illegal discriminatory practices at institutions of learning,"" stating that students should have ""learning free of divisive ideologies and indoctrination."" The agency later issued a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" document about its new policies, clarifying that it was acceptable to observe events like Black History Month but warning schools that they ""must consider whether any school programming discourages members of all races from attending.""

""It definitely has a chilling effect,"" Poll-Hunter said. ""There is a lot of fear that could cause institutions to limit their efforts.""

Numerous requests for comment from medical schools about the impact of the anti-DEI actions went unreturned. University presidents are staying mum on the issue to protect their institutions, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Utibe Essien, a physician and UCLA assistant professor, said he has heard from some students who fear they won't be considered for admission under the new policies. Essien, who co-authored a study on the effect of affirmative action bans on medical schools, also said students are worried medical schools will not be as supportive toward students of color as in the past.

""Both of these fears have the risk of limiting the options of schools folks apply to and potentially those who consider medicine as an option at all,"" Essien said, adding that the ""lawsuits around equity policies and just the climate of anti-diversity have brought institutions to this place where they feel uncomfortable.""

In early February, the Pacific Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit against the University of California-San Francisco's Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland over an internship program designed to introduce ""underrepresented minority high school students to health professions.""

Attorney Andrew Quinio filed the suit, which argues that its plaintiff, a white teenager, was not accepted to the program after disclosing in an interview that she identified as white.

""From a legal standpoint, the issue that comes about from all this is: How do you choose diversity without running afoul of the Constitution?"" Quinio said. ""For those who want diversity as a goal, it cannot be a goal that is achieved with discrimination.""

UC Health spokesperson Heather Harper declined to comment on the suit on behalf of the hospital system.

Another lawsuit filed in February accuses the University of California of favoring Black and Latino students over Asian American and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions. Specifically, the complaint states that UC officials pushed campuses to use a ""holistic"" approach to admissions and ""move away from objective criteria towards more subjective assessments of the overall appeal of individual candidates.""

The scrutiny of that approach to admissions could threaten diversity at the UC-Davis School of Medicine, which for years has employed a ""race-neutral, holistic admissions model"" that reportedly tripled enrollment of Black, Latino, and Native American students.

""How do you define diversity? Does it now include the way we consider how someone's lived experience may be influenced by how they grew up? The type of school, the income of their family? All of those are diversity,"" said Granberry Russell, of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. ""What might they view as an unlawful proxy for diversity equity and inclusion? That's what we're confronted with.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, recently joined other state attorneys general to issue guidance urging that schools continue their DEI programs despite the federal messaging, saying that legal precedent allows for the activities. California is also among several states suing the administration over its deep cuts to the Education Department.

If the recent decline in diversity among newly enrolled students holds or gets worse, it could have long-term consequences for patient care, academic experts said, pointing toward the vast racial disparities in health outcomes in the U.S., particularly for Black people.

A higher proportion of Black primary care doctors is associated with longer life expectancy and lower mortality rates among Black people, according to a 2023 study published by the JAMA Network.

Physicians of color are also more likely to build their careers in medically underserved communities, studies have shown, which is increasingly important as the AAMC projects a shortage of up to 40,400 primary care doctors by 2036.

""The physician shortage persists, and it's dire in rural communities,"" Poll-Hunter said. ""We know that diversity efforts are really about improving access for everyone. More diversity leads to greater access to care — everyone is benefiting from it.""

On a normal day in March last year, Grant Williams from Newport went out on a run with a group of friends as part of their marathon training. After passing mile 11 the last thing Grant remembers is crossing the road and then waking up in an ambulance to paramedics telling him: ""You were dead for just over eight minutes.""

The 53-year-old fitness instructor had suffered two cardiac arrests, his heart stopped twice and he had to be resuscitated. Grant owes his life to off-duty doctors, Dr Mel Hamilton who performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, and Dr Joe Clarkson who was in the barbers nearby and came to help.

Grant said: ""They gave me the chance to be a father, a son and a brother again, so that's invaluable."" Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here

Grant has always been a fit and healthy man, he was once a Royal Navy physical training instructor and now owns his own fitness company in Liverpool. Other than feeling more tired when running, Grant saw no symptoms of heart failure although heart disease does run in his family, but the doctors told him that his heart was only functioning at around 10%.

It was a massive shock to Grant. He said: ""I think only one in 10 people survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. And to be dead for like eight minutes, really, I shouldn't be here.""

On March 9, Grant was taken into hospital at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital where he was stabilised and examined. Surgeons performed a quadruple bypass on Grant on March 24 and later discharged him on April 2, after almost a month in hospital.

Grant explained the mental struggle he had faced since that day last March. He said: ""It's a bit of a minefield, but the first thing you concentrate on is getting physically fit, getting back out of bed and being able to walk. It's only been about the last three months that the mental side comes in thinking how lucky you are and what's gone on and every day has like a mixed emotion.

""I think you go through life thinking, 'I don't like that', it could be food, could be some type of training, could be anything, but I think I just have a different outlook on things now.""

Grant was training for the Manchester marathon when he suffered two cardiac arrests last year and now, in a full-circle moment, he will be coming back to his home city of Newport to run the Newport Marathon. Despite being given the go-ahead by his doctors, Grant was at first apprehensive whether he would be able to complete a marathon.

He said: ""I think going through the first maybe six weeks of being discharged from hospital I'd never thought that would be on the horizon, ever. I've just had to trust the surgeons when they've said I'm good to go.""

Grant is running the Newport Marathon on Sunday, April 13, raising money for Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital as well as awareness of the importance of defibrillators and CPR as he believes he wouldn't be here today without them. He said: ""I will forever be in awe at the incredible surgeons who performed my open heart surgery and I am so grateful to every single member of staff that helped me process an event that quite literally spun my entire life on its head.

My time at their hospital opened my eyes up to just how important this place is, and how many people in similar situations to myself they help every single hour of every single day. I struggle to express my gratitude in words but would love to give back to the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital for giving me a second chance.""

Grant is aiming to raise £10,000 and has currently raised over £7,000 on his Just Giving page. To donate to Grant's fundraiser you can visit here. ","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Stephen Collins is the latest subject of an Investigation Discovery special — but which of his former 7th Heaven costars were willing to address his child sexual abuse?

The actor became a household name after booking the role of Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven, which ran from 1996 to 2007. The ensemble cast also included Jessica Biel, Barry Watson, Beverley Mitchell, David Gallagher, Mackenzie Rosman and Catherine Hicks.

Seven years after the show ended, Collins made headlines when TMZ published an audio recording from a marriage counseling session with his then-wife, Faye Grant, where he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls.

“I'm a flawed person,” Collins said in an interview with Katie Couric at the time. “In the church, it's actually one of the things I love about the church … It's really one of the main things about the Christian faith. Christ said in so many ways, ‘Bring me that … which about you is broken, bring it,' and most people are broken in some way.”



He continued: “Most people get to, or have to, or choose to hide it. This came out. I didn't choose this to come out. I didn't want to have to deal with these things publicly. … I had dealt with them very, very strongly, and committedly, in my private life, but I think I'm a human being with flaws and I've done everything I can to address it.”

Investigation Discovery's six-part Hollywood Demons special, which airs on Monday, March 24, reached out to “more than 100 contacts” of Collins' and “nearly everyone declined to participate or did not respond.” (A producer in a voiceover stated that only men agreed to speak with them about their experience with Collins.)

In the doc, the Founding President of Programming at the WB Network Garth Ancier was asked whether any allegations were brought up against Collins by his 7th Heaven costars, to which he replied, “No. There was nothing and it just didn't happen. I would see it.”

Ancier noted that the show prioritized keeping the children on set safe.”There are lots of safety rails when you have kids on a show,” he added. “For minors there are always people on set who are teachers, I got the sense this was a really protected set.”

Collins didn't participate in the doc. “Stephen Collins now lives with a woman who is 40 years younger than him. She was a super fan,” Dr. Drew Pinsky claimed in the special. “The age difference — given what we know about his history — certainly raises an eyebrow. Let's hope he can commit to this woman and not perpetrate on others.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of which 7th Heaven stars addressed their history with Collins before Hollywood Demons premieres on Monday, March 24, on ID at 9 p.m. EST:

London, who played Chandler for 37 episodes, described Collins as “not only one of the finest actors but one of the finest human beings in Hollywood.” In addition to addressing his own legal problems, London and his fellow costar Kyle Searles watched Collins' interview with Couric after they both admitted to not having seen it at the time.

“What I noticed about Stephen Collins working with young girls and extra is I didn't notice a damn thing,” London told the cameras after being asked about his experience with Collins on set. “It never crossed any lines of any kind.”

For 27 episodes of 7th Heaven, Searles played the role of Mac. He admitted in the ID special that he originally admired Collins as a mentor, saying, “He showed me what I wanted to be as a professional actor and how you treat people and how you present yourself. That is why it was even more of a shock to hear what ended up happening.”

Searles noted that he potentially put Collins “on a professional pedestal a bit too much” after seeing the disgraced actor's comments about his child abuse scandal.

“This is the first time that I've ever thought that he is full of s—t. No, I am not satisfied with this,” Searles explained to producers. “I have like a knot in my stomach. My whole world changed when I had kids of my own — my whole world view changed and certainly my tolerance for this.”

Hollywood Demons featured some insight into Mitchell's alleged perspective on the scandal through her “personal friend” Dr. Drew.

“She never reported any issues to me,” he shared. “He was a nice guy. He is a smart dude. He is engaging and interesting and charming. He is all of those things and he was engaged in some monstrous behavior.”

Six months before the ID special, Mitchell, Gallagher and Rosman addressed Collins' legal drama ahead of a new episode of their “Catching Up with the Camdens” podcast.

“Before we get into this episode, we want you to know that we see all of your comments and we know how excited you all are for the rewatch, so that's exactly what we're going to do,” said Mitchell, who played Lucy Camden, said at the start of the September 2024 episode. “But before we get into that, we do think it's important that we say something about Stephen Collins.”

Gallagher, who played Simon Camden, added: “All forms of abuse, sexual abuse of any kind, it's inexcusable. And victims of abuse need to be shown compassion and they should be given support.”

Mitchell assured fans that Collins “will not be joining us on this podcast” before Rosman added, “As we rewatch these episodes, it would be impossible not to talk about Stephen because he was such a big part of the show and our lives. But we want to be clear, we did not have any inappropriate experiences with Stephen.”

New Jersey Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald is making changes on the rink after his son's neck was sliced by an ice skate during a hockey game.

“They rushed him right into the locker room. All we got was, ‘The bleeding is under control and he's on his way to the hospital,'” Fitzgerald, 56, said in an interview with ESPN published on Tuesday, March 18. “And they had a team of 12 or 14 people waiting for him when he got there. My wife was a mess. But I was cautiously optimistic because he had stayed on the ice. I don't wish that on any parent.”

Tom's son Casey Fitzgerald is the captain of the Hartford Wolf Pack which is an NHL developmental team for the New York Rangers. During a December 2024 game, Casey got tied up in a play. While the injury wasn't apparent at first, when Casey was getting off the ice an opposing player pointed out his neck was bleeding.

“They were showing [the play] and there was another angle I was told. I didn't want to see that angle,” Tom recalled. “The only angle I saw was the one I [previously] watched and you couldn't really see [the cutting]. The more I talked, the more I started getting choked up a bit just thinking how lucky we are. I'm getting choked up now. It's tough. I don't want any parent to go through it. You just don't understand. You can't understand.”



Casey ended up getting 25 stitches and made a full recovery. He returned to the rink three days later. While Casey is fine now, Tom has a new perspective. The hockey executive doesn't want any other parent to go through what his family did.

“We're very lucky,” Tom shared. “But why the players don't think big picture versus just, it's about [their] career today? If they ever thought of their parents watching what we watched, they'd think differently.”

Since the incident, Tom has taken action to help prevent the safety issue. Tom is the sole hockey GM on the NHL's cut resistant committee. In addition to Tom, the group includes NHL's Senior VP of Hockey Operations Kris King, VP of Hockey Operations Rod Pasma, members of the NHL Players' Association and team equipment managers.

As a member of the committee, Tom has helped come up with ideas on how to protect players.

“The first thing I thought about was the chin guard,” Tom explained. “If you can mandate players to at least have the two-finger rule [of coverage below their chins], would a Kevlar chin guard have stopped [the worst of it for Casey]? I don't know if it would have prevented all of it, but just ideas like that. And there's a prototype being made as we speak.”

While a lot of the protective equipment is optional for athletes at the moment, Tom has offered the men a perspective from a worried parent's mindset.

“My message was just, ‘Tell the players you don't want your parents potentially going through something like this,'” he told the outlet. “[It's] scary. Put as much protection on as you possibly can because you're going to stop playing at some point, and you're going to have to live the rest of your life. So live it.”

The Shifting Gears season finale was teasing a romantic moment between Kat Dennings and Seann William Scott — so imagine our surprise when it was Tim Allen and Jenna Elfman who ended up sharing a kiss.

During the Wednesday, March 19, episode titled “Kiss,” Gabriel (Scott) prepared for Riley (Dennings) to potentially reconcile with her ex. Riley didn't, but she wasn't ready for something new either so Gabriel didn't make a move. Instead, in the final moments of the finale, Eve (Elfman) surprised Matt (Allen) after an entire episode of banter by kissing him.

“I thought it was a really fun twist because it seems like of course it's going to be Riley and Gabriel,” Dennings, 38, exclusively told Us Weekly. “But it was a real surprise.”

Dennings and Scott, 48, agreed that the romantic finale moment made more sense for Eve and Matt‘s relationship, with her adding, “It's a surprise kiss for Tim Allen's character. But I feel like Eve got a little liquid courage in that moment to do that — maybe she wasn't planning on it. I think it's a great moment.”



Earlier this season, Elfman, 53, joined the cast in a recurring role as a potential love interest for Allen, 71. The actress told Us that she was excited to see how the hit ABC sitcom would approach a show where Allen wasn't married on screen after his past projects, including Home Improvement and Last Man Standing, paired the actor with a wife.

“You're going to see more of the dynamic between Matt and Eve,” Elfman teased in February. “Just more forthright communication, opinions and exchange. You get to see people being their full selves in each other's face. It's really fun.”

Elfman went on to praise Allen for being a perfect scene partner. “He's so confident as a comedic actor. He's just confident and I'm confident and we don't care if something [doesn't land],” she noted to Us at the time. “When you've been doing it long enough, you're not paranoid about a joke not working and you don't care. There's no preciousness and there's enough confidence to support the exploration of the scene of humor.”

While viewers got an idea of what is to come for Eve and Matt, Riley and Gabriel's future is a bit more unclear for now.

“Riley is literally hours out of her marriage. She should really pull it back a little bit,” Dennings joked to Us about how long it could take for Riley and Gabriel to get together. “She's been separated for a long time and she hasn't been emotionally in this relationship. But still, she just got out of a very long relationship.”

She continued: “She also really loves Gabriel as a friend. So I think there's lots of reasons for the slow burn.”

Riley and Gabriel might not be a couple anytime soon — but Dennings and Scott have been having a blast as scene partners.

“We get along. We instantly really hit it off and got along and we have a lot of things in common and I really help you with your phone a lot,” she quipped, to which Scott added, “When we were shooting, it's one thing. When we're not shooting, we became friends right away and I immediately was like, ‘Oh wow, this is a huge gift.' Not only do I get to do this show but it came with just a really important dear friend for life. I don't think I've ever experienced it before where I was like, ‘Oh wow, we do have chemistry.'”

Shifting Gears is currently streaming on Hulu.

Nashville came out in full force to honor Dolly Parton at the Opry 100 celebration.

NBC aired the live special on Wednesday, March 19. It featured a rousing performance of the Parton hit “I Will Always Love You” by Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Lady A and around 50 members of the Opry's choir. 

Earlier this month, Parton's husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean, died at the age of 82.

“Everybody here at the Opry and around the world wants to send you our thoughts and prayers,” McEntire, 69, said from the stage. “And you gotta know, we will always love you.”



In addition to the star-studded group tribute, Carly Pearce performed “Jolene” in homage to Parton, telling the crowd, “Dolly Parton is my hero, and it means so much to me that she invited me to join the Opry. Dolly, I just want you to know that my heart goes out to you and your family, and it is my great honor to sing my favorite Dolly song tonight.”

Meanwhile, Parton appeared in a taped message.

“Well hello, I am Dolly Parton and I am a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry,” she said. “And I am so sorry that I can't be there with everybody in person, but of course you know my heart is with you and my spirit is with you.”

Us Weekly caught up with Pearce, 34, ahead of the event, where she exclusively recalled the day that Parton invited her to become an Opry member.

“That was probably the most surprised I've ever been in my life,” the country singer told Us. “When you think of the Opry and you think of invitations to be a member, they usually happen on stage at the Opry.”

On June 17, 2021, Pearce thought she was participating in a commercial for Dollywood after previously working at the theme park. When Parton walked around the corner and introduced herself, everything changed for Pearce.

“I was, of course, shocked, but I thought that we were doing this Dollywood commercial together,” she joked. “And I heard her say the word ‘Opry' several times in 30 seconds. I can only equate it to how a girl feels when she thinks she's getting engaged — of just like, ‘Can you just say it? Is this what's happening?'”

“I had this moment of just, ‘Oh, my goodness,'” Pearce continued. “And when she said it, I just fell to the floor, literally.”

Gina Gershon had no hesitation reuniting with John Travolta for their new film High Rollers — especially after the pair had such an incredible time working together on the cult classic Face/Off.

“[John] was just as easy and professional and kind and fun to work with as he was when I was doing Face/Off,” Gershon, 62, exclusively told Us Weekly. “[But] I think in Face/Off we sang a little bit more. We had more time during setup, so I really liked it when we'd sing whatever musicals …There was a lot of time to kill.”

Gershon portrayed Sasha in John Woo's 1997 sci-fi flick, the ex-girlfriend of terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). While Gershon told Us much of her screen time was spent with Cage, 61, she still got to know Travolta behind the scenes — and their mutual love of music brought them closer together.

“I just remember singing [with him],” Gershon recalled. “We were just goofing around and then we started riffing on something and I thought, ‘Oh my God, I'm singing with John Travolta. This is heaven.' You know what I mean? It was really fun.”



Her role on screen, of course, was just as fulfilling. Gershon noted that she “loved” working with Woo because he was open to hearing her ideas, making the experience ultimately feel more “collaborative.”

“My part wasn't really completely what it turned out to be, and I kept adding stuff here and there with the writer's permission,” she explained. “I said, ‘Guys, can I just throw some stuff out?' And I would go [and] work on [it] a little bit, and I would show it to John and he would like it, or he didn't like a couple ideas, but at least I felt comfortable enough to throw it out there, and he would say yes or no. So it felt very collaborative.”

With all the fond memories of the cast and crew, would she return for a Face/Off sequel? Paramount did, after all, previously tap Adam Wingard to direct a follow up film in 2022. The answer is a resounding “yes” from Gershon, despite her character seemingly being killed off in the OG film's final moments.

“I mean, we see her kind of dead, [but if] she miraculously didn't die, I would love to. I would join, are you kidding?” she told Us. “John Woo, one of my favorite directors to work with, Nic and John and Joan [Allen] and everyone again? In two seconds.”

Outside the Face/Off universe, Gershon has yet to reunite with Woo — but she and Cage teamed up again for 2017's Inconceivable. Now, she and Travolta are back together for High Rollers, a sequel to 2024's Cash Out.

“My manager, who actually happens to be John's manager as well, she told me … ‘I talked to John about you and John loves you,” Gershon recalled about how the project came about. “He would love you to do this [movie with him]. … We hadn't seen each other in a long time, and it felt like we were old pals.”

Gershon portrays Travolta's wife, Ameila, in the film, a former FBI informant who is kidnapped and used as leverage in a high stakes casino heist. Travolta, meanwhile, reprises his role as Mason Goddard, a master thief on a mission to save the love of his life. Although separated from Mason and the rest of his crew for the majority of the film, Amelia is a key figure in the story — and a character that allowed Gershon to dive into her love for stunt work.

“I love doing as many stunts myself as I can, just because I enjoy the physicality of it,” Gershon told Us. “I always probably want to do way more stunts than they actually let me, and I'm always like, ‘No, no, really, I'm really good at this. Let me.' I have to convince them to be in the middle of all the mayhem.”

Gershon's love for living on the edge certainly translates to the characters she plays on screen, as the actress is known for her portrayal of “strong women.”  While Gershon is proud of that fact, she would be interested in exploring a new facet of her typical archetype.

“I would love to play a completely fragile, meek person trying to survive,” she told Us. “I think I enjoy playing survivors more than victims just because I don't like to watch that. I mean, [my High Rollers] character, [Amelia], she was strong to begin with. She's been training and that's been her job, but … It would be fun to play someone who's really not strong in that same way, but yet they have to survive and they do.”

High Rollers is now playing in theaters, on demand and digital.

Stassi Schroeder‘s return to reality TV is one of the highlights in the Vanderpump Villa trailer — but we also have questions about Marciano Brunette‘s flirty moments with a MomToker.

Hulu released the first look at season 2 on Thursday, March 20, where Stassi, 36, was seen reuniting with Lisa Vanderpump nearly five years after Stassi's time on Vanderpump Rules.

“Remember when I used to tell you don't get involved in other people's business? Well now, I want you to do the exact opposite,” Lisa, 64, tells Stassi about being her “eyes and ears” at the castle, to which she replied, “I'm excited to stick my nose in business where it doesn't belong.”

Luckily there is plenty for Stassi to keep track of — including a flirtationship between Marciano Brunette and Demi Engemann. The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star makes an appearance in Italy alongside Jen Affleck, Jessi Ngatikaura, Layla Taylor and Mikayla Matthews.



The teaser shows Demi asking Marciano if he was allowed to make a move on the guests. In one scene, Marciano acknowledges the “an instant connection” between them — despite her being married to Bret Engemann.

Demi and Marciano later share an intimate hug. “There's still so much unresolved. It's been up and down, up and down,” Demi tells Marciano, who replies, “Are you living with regret?”

Outside of keeping track of the cast of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,. Stassi is seen arguing with husband Beau Clark. “You feel safe with me, I can make you feel unsafe,” Stassi tells Beau after one of the staff members at the château found himself stuck in the middle.

Stassi joined Vanderpump Villa as part of a larger deal with Hulu that includes her own show, Stassi Says. The half-hour docu-comedy is currently in development.

“Endlessly relatable, utterly hysterical and questionably sane, Stassi is the anchor of a fresh ensemble of comedic and chaotic characters who are dealing with identity crises and major life crossroads of their own — and Stassi's the one who has to keep them all afloat,” read the synopsis for the series, which was announced in August 2024.

Vanderpump Villa, meanwhile, is a Hulu reality series set in Lisa's luxury French villa, Château Rosabelle. The show, which originally debuted in 2024, highlights the staff as they live and work together while catering to their high-profile guests.

Despite their similarities, Lisa previously told Us Weekly that the series was not a copy of Vanderpump Rules.

“It is not Vanderpump Rules because it's more immersive and it's got guests and it's kind of more decadent in a way,” she explained in March 2024. “It is a little bit of Below Deck [with] that upstairs, downstairs feel. But it doesn't feel as tight as Below Deck.”

The restaurateur also discussed the challenges that came with filming, telling Us, “When you are in the middle of the French countryside, you've got people that have filled positions. If they get it wrong, you can't say, ‘OK, go home. You are out, you're suspended.' Because there are 12 jobs and I need 12 people to do them. So there was a lot of push and pull. It is a lot of fun. There's definitely a real feel-good factor to [the show], but it is complicated.”

Vanderpump Villa returns to Hulu on Thursday, April 24.

The Handmaid's Tale cast and fans alike are preparing to say goodbye to the show during its sixth and final season.

Based on Margaret Atwood's novel of the same name, The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a dystopian future where low fertility rates have led women to be assigned to men for bearing children. Elisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski, Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd, O-T Fagbenle, Max Minghella, Samira Wiley and Amanda Brugel have led the cast since the show premiered in 2017.

The series also became a critical success with multiple award nominations over the years. The Handmaid's Tale notably was the first show produced by Hulu to win a major award and the first series on a streaming network to win an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.

Despite The Handmaid's Tale coming to an end, the universe is expanding with Atwood's 2019 novel The Testaments. It was previously announced that Hulu and MGM were developing the sequel series but there hasn't been any more news yet.



Keep scrolling for everything we know so far about season 6 of The Handmaid's Tale:

The Handmaid's Tale was renewed in 2022 shortly before season 5 premiered. Filming, however, got delayed due to the dual SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and Moss' real-life pregnancy.

Disney TV boss Craig Erwich told Deadline in 2024 that production would start over the summer, and the final season will premiere one year later. Hulu confirmed that the show would return with three episodes on April 8th and continue to release new episodes leading up to the May 27th finale.

The main cast mentioned above are expected to return alongside recurring actors Bradley Whitford, Sam Jaeger and Ever Carradine. Ahead of season 6, Josh Charles was cast as a series regular while Timothy Simons andD'Arcy Carden joined as a guest star but details about their characters was not immediately released.

Alexis Bledel is not expected to return after she left ahead of season 5.

The fifth season ended with June (Moss) and Serena Joy (Strahovski) both fleeing Toronto for Vancouver.

Amid the growing anti-refugee movement in Toronto, June was targeted by a hit-and-run driver and her husband, Luke (Fagbenle), brutally attacked the assailant. The Gilead supporter, a native Canadian, didn't survive his injuries, and June and Luke knew that the attention and threats to their safety would only get worse. They decide to leave for Vancouver, but authorities at the train station were already looking for Luke. He convinced June to get on the train without him, taking baby Nichole with her. June is surprised to find Serena (with baby Noah) asking her for a diaper.

It isn't clear what happens next — and the book that served as inspiration hasn't been a big help with predicting the show's ending. Atwood's novel wrapped up with the protagonist Offred — whose real name was never revealed — being taken away in a van.

After the first season adapted the entire book, Hulu's version went beyond what was on the page. Where Serena and June go from here is anyone's guess.

“June is going to figure out who she is and who she's going to be for the rest of her life,” Moss told Elle in November 2022 about her character's potential story lines for the final season.

Moss teased that the final season centers on a fight that “is not just about one individual.” According to Moss, fans shouldn't expect a happy ending, adding, “I don't think we feel an obligation to tie up the entire story of Gilead.”

Showrunner Bruce Miller has been with The Handmaid's Tale since it debuted in 2017. Before season 6, Miller offered a glimpse at his vision for the show's ending.

“We are ending our show on our own creative terms,” he told Entertainment Weekly in 2022. “Do I know what happens in season 6? Yes, I did think about the stuff that happens in season 6 for a while.”

However, Miller stepped down as showrunner in 2023. He is expected to remain a writer and executive producer but passed on his duties to executive producers Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang.

Hulu released the first look at the sixth and final season of the beloved series in March 2025 where June was seen returning to Gilead.”For years, we have been afraid of them,” June said. “Now it is time for them to be afraid of us.”

Elsewhere in the trailer, Serena seemed to play a big role as she switched from the signature dark blue to a light periwinkle ensemble — and it seems like she's walking down the aisle in a wedding dress. The other surprising moments included Luke Bankole going into Gilead, June and Nick kissing and Aunt Lydia trying to save Janine (Madeline Brewer), who seems to be working as a Jezebel.

Cherodeep Goswami will begin his new role as Providence's chief information and digital officer effective May 12.

Name: Cherodeep Goswami

Previous title: Chief information and digital officer, University of Wisconsin Health System

New title: Chief information and digital officer, Providence

Goswami will assume his role as chief information and digital officer at the Renton, Washington-based health system on May 12, according to a news release.

His appointment comes roughly two months after Providence announced it was streamlining its leadership team, cutting a few positions and rolling out a new Office of Transformation focusing on leveraging artifical intelligence and other technology initiatives across the system.

At the time, Providence named Ivette de Rubens, the system's SVP of strategy, informatics and clinical experience, as interim chief information officer while it hunted for a permanent appointment.

The system has landed on Goswami, who has held healthcare leadership roles at the University of Wisconsin Health System and BJC Healthcare in St. Louis. The executive has also worked in other industries, including finance, telecommunications and transportation. 

Goswami will be responsible for overseeing Providence's information strategy and operations, including cybersecurity and AI deployment.

He will also collaborate closely with Sara Vaezy, who runs Providence's Office of Transformation, a spokesperson for Providence told Healthcare Dive. Vaezy will focus on consumer use cases for AI, while Goswami will head up internal use cases.

“The chief information and digital officer role is critical for helping Providence support our transformation efforts, drive technological advancements and investments, safeguard sensitive health information, and ultimately improve patient outcomes,” Providence CEO Erik Wexler said in a statement about Goswami's appointment. 

The nonprofit giant has increasingly been championing AI and technology as part of its overall strategy.

Providence has developed its own tools to address clinician burnout, partnered with an external vendor to incorporate AI into its revenue cycle functions and worked with Microsoft to build their own AI agents.

In January, Wexler signaled further harnessing AI was a priority in a LinkedIn post about his vision for the system's path forward.

“It's time for us to acknowledge that much of the technology we use in health care has not removed the crushing demands on our medical staff and caregivers,” the executive said. “We will immediately leverage solutions that make the biggest difference for physicians and caregivers at Providence.”

The deal, which removes Cigna from the volatile Medicare Advantage market, closed a little over a year after being announced.

Cigna entered a definitive agreement to sell its Medicare businesses to HCSC in January 2024 for $3.3 billion in cash and $400 million in capital Cigna expected to be freed. The deal received some criticism for undervaluing Cigna's Medicare lives.

The collective $3.7 billion price tag is a decade-plus low water mark for a Medicare book of its size, even if it is currently losing money, TD Cowen analyst Gary Taylor wrote in a note on the deal when it was announced.

Though the Connecticut-based insurer said in a recent securities filing that the initial $3.3 billion purchase price might increase at closing, given the Medicare businesses' assets had grown over their liabilities, that doesn't appear to have been the case. Cigna's announcement on the deal close shared no new terms, and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

However, Cigna executives have said they're creating a leaner and more focused organization by offloading Medicare, a division that was failing to reach long-term target margins.

Through the divestiture, Cigna is also removing itself from a notably turbulent market, with MA experiencing shifting regulations, lowering payment rates and rising medical costs that have pressured earnings for major carriers.

Cigna was also a relatively minor player in MA, holding about 2% market share with 697,000 members as of February.

And though Cigna will no longer offer Medicare coverage, the insurer has stressed that it's not getting out of the market entirely. Cigna's health services division Evernorth will continue to provide services like pharmacy benefits to other Medicare organizations, according to executives.

The deal is a significant step up for Chicago-based HCSC, a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee that sells coverage in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Onboarding Cigna's assets quadruples HCSC's MA membership and gives it access to plans in 25 additional states and Washington, D.C. — not to mention the Medicare Part D market nationwide, and the Medigap market in all but two states.

Cigna reportedly began shopping around for a buyer for its Medicare business late 2023, with HCSC emerging as the frontrunner in early 2024 after Cigna's plans for a potential merger with rival insurer Humana fell through.

Cigna expects the deal to be accretive to its earnings this year.

Questions raised about whether Jitesh Gadhia's attendance at discussion between Accord Healthcare and government was within Lords rules

A peer attended a meeting where a healthcare company of which he is a director lobbied a government minister, raising questions about whether this was within the rules of the House of Lords.

Jitesh Gadhia, an investment banker and City financier, is a non-executive director of Accord Healthcare. He attended the online meeting along with two Accord executives, according to official records, in 2021, when he was already on the board of the company.

An email shows Accord Healthcare, which sells a substantial amount of medicines to the NHS, wanted to use the meeting to get an update on a change in official policy. It also wanted to discuss potentially securing millions of pounds in taxpayer grants for a manufacturing facility, assisting with the design of services and procurement contracts, and to ask if it could “contribute” to official working groups.

While there are grey areas in the rules of the House of Lords, they stated at the time that peers must not seek to profit from being a member of the chamber by accepting money in return for providing parliamentary advice or services. The rules also stated that peers who had paid roles were not permitted to “assist outside organisations or persons in influencing members of either house, ministers or officials”, and that they were banned from “making use of their position to lobby, or to help others to lobby” the government.

Those who did have paid roles had a “responsibility to maintain a clear distinction between their outside interests and their parliamentary work”, the code of conduct stated. Later versions of the code reinforce these principles.

Tom Brake, the director of the campaign group Unlock Democracy and a former deputy leader of the House of Commons, said an investigation was needed to determine whether Lord Gadhia's attendance at the meeting was within the rules.

He added: “If the code is ambiguous as to whether peers with commercial interests can attend these kind of meetings, then that should be resolved.”

Lawyers for Gadhia said he was not paid to provide parliamentary advice or services. They said his involvement with the group predated his appointment to parliament and that he “believes that he has acted at all times in accordance with the rules and associated guidance”. They said the suggestion he had engaged in lobbying was “misconceived”.

Accord said the meeting was not lobbying and should be seen as a “vital engagement that serves the public interest”.

Details of Gadhia's activities are being published as part of a project by the Guardian, the Lords debate, which is examining the role of the House of Lords and the conduct of its members at a time when the government is proposing to overhaul the upper chamber.

An investment banker for more than two decades, Gadhia is currently a non-executive director of the Bank of England's governing body, helping to oversee its strategy and budget. He has held a series of directorships in big companies such as Rolls-Royce and Barclays.

He received his peerage from David Cameron as part of the former prime minister's resignation honours in 2016. The Cambridge graduate had by that time donated £214,000 to the Conservative party as well as £25,000 to the Liberal Democrats.

He has been an unaffiliated peer since 2017 after sitting on the Conservative benches during his first year in parliament.

Gadhia has been a non-executive director of Accord Healthcare for seven years. Since 2010, he has been an adviser on strategic matters to Intas Pharmaceuticals, the Indian multinational that owns Accord.

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in January 2021 a senior Accord executive initiated the meeting with James Bethell, then a junior health minister. The executive requested the meeting in an email copied to Gadhia at his House of Lords account.

The day before the meeting in February, an Accord executive emailed the government summarising the issues the company wanted to raise.

One was to “explore UK government appetite to explore building with us a resilient national supply chain for plasma fractionation on a toll basis”. The process of fractionation separates blood plasma into its different components, which can be used to produce medicines. The company was seeking an update on a change to policy restricting the use of blood plasma from UK donors.

Another concerned its request for £15m of taxpayers' money in grants and tax credits to help its manufacturing plant in Newcastle.

In its email, Accord said it “would be happy to assist with the government's thoughts on tendering, procurement or designing services. Are there any working groups being set up that we can contribute to?” Bethell later offered to “connect” Accord with two official taskforces.

In response to questions from the Guardian, Accord said the meeting “should not be seen as lobbying; rather, it is a vital engagement that serves the public interest”. It said that at the time of the meeting, it “did not receive research and development grants or tax credits”, adding that “Accord does not have any representatives on government taskforces”.

Gadhia's lawyers said the meeting “was part of the dialogue between government and industry, the purpose of which was to discuss how to respond to government healthcare objectives and NHS needs. This dialogue followed standard department procedures for engagement with the life sciences industry.” They said it was the only ministerial meeting he had attended as a non-executive director of Accord, adding that his attendance was declared in official transparency registers.

Accord said it had sought to engage with the Department of Health and Social Care to discuss the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for greater resilience in the medical supply chain.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

At a roundtable on Wednesday at Mott's Children's Hospital executives and medical professionals explained what this would mean for the people they serve and their hospital systems. There's disagreement among Senate Republicans over how far cuts should go.

(FOX 2) - A political fight is brewing in Washington over Medicaid and millions of Americans rely on it, but Republicans in Congress say cuts are needed. Democrats warn everyone will feel the pain.

Big picture view:

Senate Republicans are locked in closed-door discussions about potentially deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance lifeline relied on by millions of low-income Americans.

At stake: 

""He's just closed a thousand social security offices, he's firing 7,000 people working social security, making it harder for a senior who has no transportation, to get to a social security office. Now we are talking Medicaid. We're gonna fight like hell in the Congress,"" said Representative Debbie Dingell.

What they're saying:

At a roundtable on Wednesday at Mott's Children's Hospital, executives and medical professionals explained what this would mean for the people they serve and their hospital systems.

There's disagreement among Senate Republicans over how far cuts should go. 

The budget passed by House Republicans in February sets ambitious targets more than $800 billion in spending cuts. The Congressional Budget Office warns that protecting Medicare means Medicaid would face severe reductions.

By the numbers:

Medicare and Medicaid account for over 97% of the spending overseen by Congress's Energy and Commerce Committee. Nonpartisan budget analysis confirms that deep, damaging cuts to Medicaid are inevitable, unless Medicare is put on the chopping block. 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer says she is fighting hard for Medicaid.

""If cuts of this magnitude come out of the Republican controlled Congress, everyone of us will suffer. Everyone of us will pay a price for that,"" said Whitmer.

Considering the lack of high quality data, companies that excel in compiling and managing data effectively are attracting interest from industry partners and distinguishing themselves from their rivals. Here are some of the ways emerging AI applications are fueling and redefining the need for RWD across HCLS.

Share Options

Share a link too this article

The last half decade has brought about change, innovation and overall disruption across healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) that normally transpires over the course of decades. At the forefront of this rapid change has been the ascendency of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). If one takes a step back it is remarkable to reflect on how the discourse surrounding emerging technologies has evolved in just the past two to three years. Conversations that once focused on the ‘what' now center exclusively on the ‘how'. How can we harness this technology effectively and responsibly? How do we go about upskilling and training medical professionals to use the technology responsibly? How can we ensure we're maximizing the full capabilities of these tools? Against this backdrop, the rise of these technologies has concurrently shed light to another central need in HCLS: the need for high quality, comprehensive real world data (RWD).

Considering the lack of high quality data, companies that excel in compiling and managing data effectively are attracting interest from industry partners and distinguishing themselves from their rivals. 

While there a myriad of factors at play, here are just some of the ways emerging AI applications are fueling and redefining the need for RWD across HCLS,


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

Elevating healthcare delivery

In many ways, the growth of AI applications and the need for high quality RWD is similar to a relay race. The chain of information clinicians use to diagnose, treat and monitor patients is dependent on the baton of historical data. That data not only needs to be passed effectively but also in a manner that doesn't overlook critical details. AI presents that critical link in the chain but ultimately the quality of the RWD and the value it can provide is foundational to the success of AI applications.  

Reshaping life sciences    

Similar to healthcare, AI in life sciences continues to emerge and with it pharmaceutical manufacturers and biotech companies have their own independent initiatives to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutic assets leveraging the technology. Whether seeking out and identifying new therapeutic targets or stratifying patients that are more or less likely to respond to a drug, RWD serves as an anchoring factor. Simply put, biopharma and biotech companies require high quality RWD to power their AI driven innovations.

It begins with data 

We've heard the old adage that knowledge is power and when it comes to AI applications for healthcare, biopharma and medical device applications, data is that power. In particular authentic, well curated patient data. Yet such  data often presents challenges. For example, data might be in silos or exist in different systems. But in order to arrive at clinical grade conclusions, the foundation of such models needs to be patient data. For this reason, the rise of GenAI applications in HCLS makes the need for RWD even greater than existed previously. Gen AI models often produce hallucinations or outcomes that do not exist in the actual data. Such inaccuracies render AI applications unusable, further emphasizing the indispensable role of quality RWD in developing functional and reliable healthcare AI applications.

The path ahead

As applications across HCLS accelerate and in turn the need for RWD to continue to fuel that advancement, the focus will increasingly shift to maximizing value of the data for HCLS organizations. We are already beginning to see healthcare organizations for example that manage patient interactions, ranging from hospitals to home health providers, implementing steps to better organize and prepare their data for downstream uses. This is the case both within their care centers and externally. Investing in data infrastructure, governance processes and strategies to effectively handle RWD is going to be critical for HCLS organizations as they continue on their AI journeys. Those that do so well will be best positioned to derive value from their data while enhancing patient outcomes.

KSHB 41 reporter Ryan Gamboa covers Miami County in Kansas and Cass County in Missouri. He also covers agricultural topics. Share your story idea with Ryan.

Farmers just want to farm.

""We very much believe in that we feed the soil, to feed the plants, to feed the animal, to feed people,"" Sean Cornelius, a Caldwell County, Missouri, dairy farmer, said.

He's a third-generation dairy farmer, running a barn and parlor located at the site where his grandfather was born.

""We have a good family history here of being dairy farmers,"" Cornelius said.

Farming operations across the country are threatened each day by fluctuating markets, high input costs, and diminishing farm income.

The USDA's September farm income forecast, a key projection of farm profitability, projects $140 billion for 2024, which is a $6.5 billion decline from 2023.

""Feed costs are about 60% of our cost of production for making milk,"" Cornelius said. ""Anything that it goes to changing the cost to grow that crop, be it land prices, be it fertilizer prices, fuel costs, labor costs, same problems all other small businesses have, we see right here on the dairy farm as well.”

Those factors play into the operation's profitability.

Cornelius Farms sells its cows' milk directly to Hiland Dairy in Kansas City.

Another lesser thought of cost is health insurance.

""if you're self-employed or work a part-time job, or you're doing something that you don't have work available health insurance, then you gotta go to the marketplace,"" he added.

Each year, Cornelius searches for medical insurance plans for him and his wife. 

The two navigate limited options that are available to their needs in Caldwell County, Missouri.

""When I sat down to look at my options, I found plans ranging from $1,700 a month, up to $3,400 a month. That's entirely my contribution,"" Cornelius told KSHB 41. ""...that's almost $20,000 a year... That plan had almost a $10,000 per person deductible. Maximum out-of-pocket of $18,000.”

According to Cornelius, the options available to him must coordinate with St. Luke's Health System or not at all. 

He said his plans are not always competitive on the market because his options are limited.

Each year, Cornelius submits his taxable income to his accountant to project the next year's profit. If his operation's projected profit hits below a certain mark he can qualify for a subsidized plan that helps lower his healthcare costs.

""As I put my taxes in for 2024, I've got a higher level of income than I had for 2023,"" he said. ""Milk prices were really good in 2024, so that kind of helped the income out. It was a pleasant surprise until the tax person looked at those numbers and was like, ouch.""

Cornelius is advocating for Missouri House Bill 366, a piece of legislation that would allow the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health care plans to its members.

“7.5% of Missourians are without health coverage. That is the issue that affects many of Missouri's farm and ranch families who are self-employed,"" Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins said. ""Those who don't qualify for subsidized plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, that go to the marketplace that find the coverage to be unaffordable.”

In 2019, KSHB 41 reported on the Kansas Legislature passing similar legislation to permit organizations like the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health care.

""Kansas has seen great success,"" Hawkins told KSHB 41. ""Our Farm Bureau members are asking their organization to be able to offer this product, that they not only want but are demanding from us... it won't cost the state government a dime. Because we will use our own money as a Farm Bureau to stand up and be able to offer these plans to our members, which our own members will use their own money to cover the premiums on a monthly basis.""

Cornelius told KSHB 41 that a persistent medical emergency with his current plans and their price could put their farm in peril.

“Early in my career I had no idea that I needed to be an expert on health care,"" he added. “We're limited, we're stuck with what we have. All we're asking for is another option.”

Missouri HB 366 is awaiting referral to the House floor for debate.

Hallmark, a leading healthcare workforce management technology company, today unveiled a groundbreaking brand campaign that creatively addresses one of healthcare's most pressing challenges—clinical staffing shortages and the downstream impacts of clinician engagement, patient safety, and unsustainable costs.


This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320628495/en/

“Hair on Fire"" is one of Hallmark's AI-generated ads that humorously capture the stress and pressures nursing executives experience when struggling to fill shifts.


Leveraging humor and cutting-edge generative AI technology, Hallmark's innovative campaign vividly illustrates the dilemmas nursing executives face and demonstrates how hospitals can build stronger, more sustainable staffing strategies. The centerpiece is a series of AI-generated commercials featuring memorable visual metaphors—such as “In a Pickle,” “Hair on Fire,” and “Between a Rock and a Hard Place.” The ads humorously capture the stress and pressures nursing executives experience when struggling to fill shifts.



The campaign's tagline, “Don't just outsource—insource,” highlights Hallmark's unique internal-first staffing methodology, emphasizing the importance of empowering hospitals to build their own flexible internal workforce pools instead of relying on costly external contract labor.



“These lighthearted, yet impactful, ads make a powerful statement: hospitals are stuck in a frustrating, unsustainable cycle of clinical staffing, and it's time for a smarter solution that provides the flexibility clinicians want and the internal-first prioritization healthcare leaders desperately need,” said Matt Resteghini, Chief Marketing Officer at Hallmark.



Hallmark's Einstein II contingent labor platform seamlessly combines an Internal Resource Pool (IRP) with a Vendor Management Solution (VMS), enabling hospitals to staff internally as a priority, deploying their own flexible clinicians before turning to external agencies. By reducing reliance on expensive contract labor, hospitals achieve better cost optimization while offering their staff greater autonomy and satisfaction.



Hallmark's 2025 Workforce Trends Survey underscores the critical need for flexible staffing solutions. The results show of 1,200 senior healthcare executives, flexibility ranked equal to, or higher than, pay in importance for attracting and retaining nurses. Additionally, 98% of executives plan to expand contingent labor options, and 92% intend to invest further in flexible staffing technologies.



Hallmark's innovative campaign will be showcased at the AONL Conference in Boston later this month. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage through interactive experiences, such as a “Pickle Booth” photo station and CNO confession booths for nursing executives to share their most challenging staffing dilemmas.



The campaign creative was developed in conjunction with Boston-based shops Ideasicle X and Strategy by Sheehan. Explore more at: https://info.hallmarkhcs.com/insource.

							Washington Correspondent						

WASHINGTON — A small government agency responsible for putting medical products and services to practical use and making health care safe is feared to be the latest target for mass layoffs by the Trump administration. 

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has about 300 employees and a budget of $369 million, which is about 0.02% of what the government spends on health care. But AHRQ hasn't escaped the notice of the U.S. DOGE Service, which has been slashing agency payrolls and budgets across the government. Insiders say that DOGE aims to reduce AHRQ staff by 80% to 90%. That's based on what agency leaders were told by DOGE representatives at an in-person meeting on March 11, one current employee and one former employee said.

AHRQ does the kind of research that fits well with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to fight chronic disease, often by improving Americans' diets. During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he would be “working with AHRQ to hear their proposals on how they will make Americans healthy again.”

Artificial intelligence is permeating healthcare in a number of different ways, even affecting the food we choose. Grocery technology company Instacart has announced new AI-powered features for users to make healthy food choices.

The Smart Shop technology personalizes grocery shopping through generative AI and machine learning and analyzes customer habits and dietary preferences to more quickly hone in on the most relevant products.

In addition to Smart Shop, Instacart has unveiled new AI-powered Health Tags, which provide detailed nutritional information across the catalog, and Inspiration Pages, curated destinations featuring expert-backed health recommendations and shoppable recipes.

The first Inspiration Page was developed in collaboration with the American Diabetes Association and features evidence-based nutrition guidance and diabetes-friendly grocery and recipe recommendations, said Instacart.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

According to the company, the Smart Shop technology applies behavior analysis and affinity modeling to analyze real-world shopping habits, identifying patterns in user preferences. To further refine this understanding, large language models (LLMs) improve personalization by identifying the most valuable signals for predicting peoples' preferences.

Customers can modify their shopping preferences, selecting from 14 unique dietary preferences, including gluten free, high protein, high fiber, lactose free, low calorie, low carb, low sodium, low sugar, low fat, organic, pescatarian, preservative free, vegan and vegetarian. Customers can explicitly share household details, like whether they're also shopping for a baby, toddler or pet.

At the same time, the Health Tag system scans product data at scale to extract key nutrition characteristics. This multimodal AI platform leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to extract product attributes from text and images to enable rapid tagging of nutrition claims, ingredients and dietary labels.

Using this model, Instacart said it has tagged more than 1.3 billion data points across food and beverage products in its catalog.

Inspiration Pages are intended to help customers find foods that align with their health goals. Instacart plans to continue expanding Inspiration Pages, launching new shoppable experiences based on Smart Shop preferences like high fiber and high protein, and partnering with additional organizations to bring more expert-backed guidance onto the platform.

THE LARGER TREND

A 2019 study by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, in collaboration with investigators at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, found that suboptimal diet costs approximately $300 per person, or $50 billion nationally, accounting for 18% of all heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes costs in the country.

A prescription for healthy food could not only improve patients' health but also save more than $100 billion in healthcare costs, according to a study published in the Public Library of Science.
Such prescriptions can improve health outcomes for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and the findings showed that the predicted economic benefits would be realized if 20% of the cost of supermarket fruits and vegetables were covered through Medicare and Medicaid -- dubbed the ""F&V incentive.""

Under an alternate scenario, the ""healthy food incentive,"" 30% of the cost of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts/seeds, plant-based oils and seafood would be covered.

That's not the first time food has been viewed as a means of achieving potential cost savings. Prior research has shown that meal delivery programs, such as Meals on Wheels, reduce the cost of healthcare in dually eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Food has also been proposed as a possible means of cutting treatment costs for diabetes patients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","Texas House considering allowing employers to provide less health insurance","https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/03/20/employer-health-insurance-texas-house-bill-139-reduce-coverage-mandates-requirements/82516916007/","Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:04:22 GMT","

In most cases, your health insurance must cover a list of certain services such as cancer screenings even if you get it from your employer. The proposed Texas House Bill 139 could remove that requirement and let a company provide an ""Employer Choice of Benefits Plan"" that does not provide all those state-mandated services.

The bill was filed by Rep. Jay Dean, R-Longview, who is the chair of the House Committee on Insurance. Dean's office did not respond to questions from the American-Statesman on the bill.

State-mandated services include:

The health benefit plan would have to share with employees this disclaimer: ""This Employer Choice of Benefits Plan, either wholly or partly, does not provide state-mandated health benefits normally required in health benefit plans in Texas. This employer health benefit plan may provide a more affordable health benefit plan for you, although, at the same time, it may provide you with fewer health benefits than those normally included as state-mandated health benefits in health benefit plans in Texas. Please consult with your insurance agent to discover which state-mandated health benefits are excluded from this health benefit plan.""

The plan then has to give a list of mandated health benefits it is not providing.

If this bill becomes law on Sept. 1, ""it would allow insurers to offer plans that fail to meet basic expectations that most Texas patients have,"" said Katherine McLane, spokesperson of Texas Coalition for Patients. She said the coalition believes this legislation would ""throw away"" 35 bills of protection from the past five legislative sessions.

The employer choice of benefits plan still would have to follow federal rules set by the Affordable Care Act, which does include preventative cancer screenings, newborn screenings and vaccines, for example.

The coalition worries that as the ACA continues to be attacked at the federal level, Texans can't rely on federal law to continue to uphold health care insurance protections, said the coalition's Talan Tyminski. ""Mental health, children's health care, those would all be gone,"" she said.

Dean has another bill that also has the coalition frustrated. HB 138 would create the Health Impact, Cost and Coverage Analysis Program that would create a report of any added cost that mandated health legislation would have on insurance providers or the state, as well as individuals. That report also would analyze if the legislation would increase or decrease the use of health services.

The Center for Health Care Data at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston would create the report, but McLane worries patients and providers would be left out of the decision-making.

""This has the stink of big insurance all over it,"" she said. ""We can't exclude patients and Texans from it and (from) taking a wholistic view of health care.""","{'href': 'https://www.statesman.com', 'title': 'Austin American-Statesman'}"

Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) has completed its acquisition of Cigna's Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplemental Benefits, Medicare Part D and CareAllies businesses, in a deal that was originally announced over a year ago.

At the time the sale was announced, the transaction was estimated to be worth about $3.7 billion.

HCSC CEO, President and Vice Chair Maurice Smith said the transaction would enable the company to expand its geographic presence across the United States.

""We recognize that the health and wellness needs for older Americans are growing, and we plan to have an important role in helping seniors live healthier, fuller lives,"" said Smith by statement. ""We are excited to welcome our new Medicare members and the employees who will continue to help them achieve their best health.""

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

The Cigna Group will continue to provide pharmacy benefit services and other solutions to Medicare members through Evernorth Health Services as part of services agreements for an agreed period post-closing, HCSC said.

With the closing of the deal, HCSC now serves 26.5 million people, including 4.3 million Medicare members across the U.S.

HCSC said the transaction is not expected to disrupt service for customers, clients, providers, and brokers of the Medicare or CareAllies businesses. Coverage continues and remains unchanged. Medicare members with questions about their coverage should contact the number on their member ID card.

The transaction is expected to be accretive to the Cigna Group's adjusted earnings per share in 2025. With the sale completed, the Cigna Group will strategically use proceeds from the transaction in alignment with its capital deployment priorities, with the majority of the proceeds allocated to share repurchases.

THE LARGER TREND

Exploring the sale of its Medicare Advantage business is one of the reasons Cigna had sought to merge with Humana – a merger that was called off in December 2023.

A combination would have created a company with a value exceeding $140 billion, based on their market values.

ON THE RECORD

""We are proud of the positive impact we have made in people's lives and the unique value provided through our Medicare businesses and are confident that HCSC will continue the meaningful work that we have done for these customers,"" said David Cordani, chairman and CEO of The Cigna Group. ""We remain committed to serving Medicare populations through the portfolio of products and services we offer through Evernorth Health Services.""

COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Paradigm Health, which is rebuilding the clinical research ecosystem, today announced the appointment of Karen E. Knudsen, MBA, PhD, to its Board of Directors, alongside the upcoming launch of its eSource clinical trial data application.


Dr. Knudsen is a globally recognized cancer scientist and executive leader who joins Paradigm Health's board following a successful term as Chief Executive Officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS) and its advocacy affiliate, ACS Cancer Action Network. She brings extensive expertise around the challenges and opportunities in clinical research to this Board appointment.


Dr. Knudsen is a globally recognized cancer scientist and executive leader who joins Paradigm Health's board following a successful term as Chief Executive Officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS) and its advocacy affiliate, ACS Cancer Action Network. She brings extensive expertise around the challenges and opportunities in clinical research to this Board appointment.

""Having led a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center and oncology team across a 16-hospital, two-state system, I've witnessed firsthand how administrative burden limits clinical trial capacity,"" said Dr. Knudsen. ""Paradigm Health's technology-driven approach addresses one of healthcare's most persistent challenges: bringing trials to where patients live. Doing so will help expand who has access to trials and improve data so we know that new treatments will work for the populations they're designed to treat. Supporting Paradigm Health aligns with my career-long focus on expanding access to innovative care options.""

Dr. Knudsen previously served as EVP of Oncology Services for Jefferson Health and Enterprise Director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated center of excellence. She has served on the NCI Board of Scientific Advisors and as President of the Association of American Cancer Institutes. She has been a professor at Thomas Jefferson University for over seventeen years, now serving as Professor Emerita.

""Karen is one of the most respected voices in oncology research and patient advocacy and a leader in the movement to make clinical trials more economic and efficient,"" said Kent Thoelke, founder and CEO of Paradigm Health. ""Her experience guiding organizations through transformative growth will complement our mission to expand clinical trial access to every patient, everywhere.""

Robert Nelsen, co-founder and managing director of ARCH Venture Partners and Paradigm Health Board of Directors chair, commented, ""With Karen's exceptional career and focus on accelerating cancer care and access for patients, she is a great addition to the Paradigm Health Board of Directors. She will help us drive accessibility to clinical trials at scale using the Paradigm Health platform to achieve the mission of making clinical trials a care option for all patients, while lowering costs and maximizing drug development efficiency.""

New Solution from Paradigm Health Promises to End Redundant Manual Clinical Trial Data Entry

Paradigm Health is also announcing the upcoming launch of eSource Casebook, the first application in the Study Conduct solution suite, which automates the end-to-end process of capturing and auditing clinical trial data. Today this process requires thousands of hours of manual labor for each trial, from physician, nurses, and research coordinators. With eSource Casebook, clinical teams enter data once in the patient's electronic medical record (EMR) and Paradigm Health uses an LLM-based approach to automatically populate and transmit data to the sponsor, reducing both data entry and data auditing burden.

""Seeing eSource Casebook in action was a lightning bolt moment,"" said Knudsen. ""Today's infrastructure forces provider research teams into an exhausting cycle of finding and documenting patient information in their EMR, only to re-enter nearly identical details into trial-specific electronic data capture systems. This redundant, manual process is not only time-consuming but also incredibly resource-draining. It's followed by costly, labor-intensive audits to ensure data accuracy. From my experience, these inefficiencies place an overwhelming burden on providers, stretching their resources thin, creating friction between stakeholders, and ultimately preventing them from considering new research opportunities. In past roles, I would have loved access to a tool that alleviates this pressure, bringing interoperability and data accuracy while saving time and reducing costs. eSource Casebook does just that.""

Today there is an eight-day average delay from patient clinical visit to study data entry, a gap driven by overburdened healthcare provider staff and overwhelming levels of manual data entry. Paradigm Health's eSource Casebook solution is an EMR-integrated application that extracts trial-specific data from the EMR (including structured and unstructured data), autopopulates electronic clinical report forms (eCRFs), and seamlessly pushes the information in the appropriate format to the trial sponsor's electronic data capture (EDC) systems.

Paradigm Health CEO Kent Thoelke commented, ""Historically, clinical trials have been constrained by an organization's capacity for data entry, with medical progress held back due to a lack of people at keyboards transferring critical information from one system to another. Paradigm Health's eSource Casebook makes this transfer automatic and seamless. It's another way we're attacking the inefficiencies in clinical trials. By incorporating the most current LLMs to read, structure, derive knowledge, and quality check trial data we'll save thousands of hours and help make it possible to run clinical trials in far more locations, even where support resources are limited.""

Organizations interested in the April release of eSource Casebook can learn more by contacting the Paradigm Health team at https://www.paradigm.inc/contact.

GE HealthCare launches AI-driven, patient-friendly Invenia ABUS Premium to accelerate scanning and drive early cancer detection in dense breasts

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC) announced the launch of Invenia™ Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) Premium, the latest 3D ultrasound offering advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative features to drive faster*, reproducible supplemental screening and streamline exam readings on patients with dense breasts.


Approximately 71% of cancers occur in dense breasts.1 According to studies across the U.S. and Europe, 40% of women2 and 70% of Asian women3 have dense breast tissue, making them four to six times more likely to receive a breast cancer diagnosis.4 Early detection of breast cancer is critical, yet about one-third5 of cancers in dense breasts may go undetected by a mammogram, as the cancer can be masked within the dense tissue. There is rapidly growing evidence supporting ABUS as a valuable tool for detecting cancer in dense breasts because it provides clearer and more detailed images and has been shown to improve the sensitivity of detecting invasive cancer in dense breasts when added to mammography.6,7,8,9



“Women with dense breasts often face poorer outcomes due to malignancies detected at later, more advanced stages. Invenia ABUS Premium equipped with AI has the potential to optimize clinicians' screening capabilities, enabling them to detect even small, early-stage cancers with a high degree of confidence in women with dense breasts,” said Karley Yoder, CEO of Comprehensive Care Ultrasound, GE HealthCare. “Invenia ABUS Premium is designed to help deliver the best possible outcomes for patients while also prioritizing the patient experience with features to improve scan speed and enhance comfort during an exam.”




Invenia ABUS Premium is designed to manage high patient volumes along the breast care pathway, while delivering extraordinary image quality and boosting clinical confidence. The new Verisound™ AI tools can help clinicians work smarter and more efficiently, featuring Scan Quality Assessment for immediate qualitative evaluation during the exam for proper breast coverage and positioning, and Auto Nipple Detection for consistent nipple marker positions. The new Fast Scan tool increases scan speed by up to 40%*, while cSound™ Imageformer capabilities automatically create focus at every pixel, ensuring consistent, high-resolution image quality and reproducibility.




For fast, streamlined reading, physicians can use Invenia ABUS Viewer with AI Assistant** to quickly review and interpret patient exams either from their practice or remotely. The integration of AI tools** for enhanced review of ABUS 3D datasets harness intelligent algorithms to assist in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. These tools can help improve clinical confidence and reading efficiency, addressing staff shortages.




The ABUS Premium's non-invasive design significantly enhances the patient experience, with a patient experience study showing that 100% of women would recommend an ABUS exam to their best friend.10 This advanced ABUS technology also has the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies by providing specific image features to distinguish and detect malignant tumors, enabling clinicians to escalate care sooner.9 Additionally, it reduces patient exposure to radiation or contrast injection as it doesn't use any iodinated contrast agent or ionizing radiation. The new Reverse Curve™ transducer follows the contour of a woman's breast anatomy, while selectable compression levels provide personalized comfort during the exam.




""As an early adopter of ABUS, I've experienced the entire evolution of this technology. The Invenia ABUS Premium is superior* with its special AI features, which ensure the breast volume is captured and offer automatic nipple annotation, reducing scanning time and streamlining clinical workflow,"" said Athina Vourtsis, MD, PhD, Chief Director and Founder of Athena Medical, Athens, Greece; Founding President of the Hellenic Breast Imaging Society; European Liaison and Member of the Medical Advisory Board of DenseBreast-Info. ""The new Reverse Curve transducer makes the examination more patient friendly, and it is much more comfortable. There has been great improvement in image quality with less shadowing, and the structures behind the area of the nipple are seen more clearly, providing radiologists with greater diagnostic confidence.""




Invenia ABUS Premium will be launching in key countries throughout 2025 and received Premarket Approval (PMA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Invenia ABUS Premium was featured at the 2025 European Congress of Radiology (ECR) and will also be showcased at the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCoBC) 2025 and 2025 Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) Symposium.

Renton, Wash.-based Providence, which serves seven Western states with 51 hospitals, has hired Cherodeep (Chero) Goswami as chief information and digital officer.   Goswami currently serves as a system vice president and chief information and digital officer for the University of Wisconsin Health System (UW Health). He replaces BJ Moore, who recently left Providence after five years in the CIO role. As Healthcare Innovation reported in February, under new President and CEO Erik Wexler, Providence has announced a series of leadership changes, including a new physician leader for the Providence Clinical Network and changing Sara Vaezy's title from chief digital officer to chief transformation officer.

Moore summarized his experience at Providence in a post on LinkedIn: “So proud of the work we jointly accomplished in IT and Real Estate Strategy and Operations. While navigating COVID, transforming from legacy systems and architecture, to a single ERP in Oracle Fusion Cloud, a single EMR with Epic, moved our data centers and applications to the Microsoft Azure Cloud, modernized our network, moved our data from isolated on prem databases to the cloud and the largest healthcare instance of Snowflake, matured our Cyber capabilities, the incredible capabilities we built with Providence India, at the forefront of AI and the digital transformation of healthcare, selling off underperforming real estate assets, while investing in the future with building of two new hospitals, the list goes on and on.” Prior to his role at UW Health, Goswami worked at BJC Healthcare in St. Louis, where he served in a variety of leadership roles, including vice president for business relationship management. He has also worked in other industries, including finance, telecom and transportation.   

Goswami will be responsible for IT  strategy and operations, including cybersecurity, deployment of artificial intelligence, and internally focused areas of the digital platform. He'll also help lead and advance strategic priorities, including easing the administrative burden for physicians and clinicians.  

 “The chief information and digital officer role is critical for helping Providence support our transformation efforts, drive technological advancements and investments, safeguard sensitive health information, and ultimately improve patient outcomes,” said Wexler in a statement.

Das Circular-Protokoll hat eine bahnbrechende Partnerschaft mit Arculus by CompoSecure (CMPO) und IT Lab angekündigt, um das erste blockchain-konforme Ökosystem für Gesundheitsdienstleister zu schaffen. Die Initiative konzentriert sich darauf, die digitale Transparenz und den Schutz im globalen Gesundheitswesen durch Blockchain-Technologie zu verbessern.

Das System integriert die Arculus-Authentifizierung in das MedTech-Gerät von Circular und bietet Gesundheitseinrichtungen physische Karten mit privaten Schlüsseln. Diese Karten ermöglichen es autorisiertem Personal, Verfahren und Transaktionen auf der Circular-Blockchain über eine einfache Tap-to-Computer-Oberfläche digital zu signieren.

Durch die Partnerschaft mit IT Lab werden über 8.000 italienische Apotheken medizinische Untersuchungen über die White-Label-Plattform 'Smart Share' on-chain aufzeichnen. Das System soll im Q2 2025 sowohl in Italien als auch auf dem US-Markt eingeführt werden, ohne dass eine Kryptowährung oder der Besitz einer Wallet erforderlich ist. Die Initiative zielt darauf ab, ein dezentrales, sicheres Gesundheitssystem zu schaffen und gleichzeitig die Standardkosten für klinische Untersuchungen beizubehalten.

CompoSecure's strategic partnership with Circular Protocol and IT Lab represents a significant expansion of the company's Arculus Authentication technology into the healthcare vertical. This integration creates a blockchain-based security solution that addresses critical healthcare needs while opening a substantial new market for CMPO.

What's technically innovative here is the implementation approach. By using CompoSecure's physical security card as the interface for blockchain interaction, they've created a solution that's both highly secure and user-friendly - eliminating the need for healthcare providers to understand cryptocurrency or maintain digital wallets. This addresses one of the primary adoption barriers that has historically  blockchain's penetration in traditional sectors.

The partnership's commercial scope is substantial, with the initial deployment targeting 8,000 Italian pharmacies through IT Lab's established platform. The promised Q2 2025 rollout for both Italian pharmacies and the US market provides a clear timeline for potential revenue growth.

While the article doesn't disclose financial terms, this partnership represents exactly the type of commercial application that could drive meaningful revenue growth for CMPO beyond its core financial services market. The healthcare industry's strict requirements around data security, privacy, and fraud prevention align perfectly with the capabilities of CompoSecure's technology.

This partnership positions CompoSecure to capitalize on an underserved aspect of healthcare digitization: the authentication and verification of clinical procedures. By integrating their Arculus technology into Circular's MedTech devices, CMPO is addressing a genuine pain point in the industry - creating immutable, secure records without disrupting existing workflows.

The implementation in 8,000 Italian pharmacies is particularly strategic. European pharmacies are increasingly serving as frontline healthcare providers, performing basic exams and procedures. This partnership enables these transactions to be recorded securely on-chain while maintaining the same cost structure as standard exams - creating adoption incentives through added security rather than price increases.

What's most compelling is how this solution distributes the healthcare burden to appropriate access points while maintaining security. Pharmacies can offer proximity and convenience while hospitals handle more complex cases - all using the same secure authentication system. For CompoSecure, this represents not just a new market but a potential industry-wide ecosystem where their technology becomes the standard verification mechanism.

The Q2 2025 US market entry timing is ideal as American healthcare continues to seek solutions that improve security without adding complexity. By establishing their system in European pharmacies first, CompoSecure and partners can refine the implementation before tackling the more fragmented US healthcare market.

The Circular blockchain delivers infrastructure to build the first digital network for on-chain verification and authentication of medical records and transactions

BOSTON, Mass, and SOMERSET, N.J., March  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Circular Protocol today announced a new commercial initiative with two leaders in the security and software space, Arculus by CompoSecure, and IT Lab to step up digital transparency and protection in the global healthcare industry.

As healthcare becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, verification and authentication of patient records and healthcare data are essential for ensuring data accuracy, protecting patient privacy, and preventing fraud.

Today's announcement delivers an advanced solution that will integrate into clinical networks and serve as the secure passkey for recording, managing, and safeguarding critical healthcare data within facilities using the MedTech device.

The Circular blockchain is building the first digital network for on-chain verification and authentication of medical records and transactions. Integrating Arculus Authentication, by CompoSecure, into the company's MedTech device, healthcare providers will create a physical card (which holds a private key) for hospitals and healthcare centers, to allow authorized administrators, operators, and patients to digitally sign off procedures, exams and other transactions, directly on the Circular blockchain, simply by tapping the card to their computer. The card can be used in clinical networks, as the key to record, own and protect all data regarding programs and activities of the facilities utilizing the MedTech device.

“Tech needs to be invisible and easy to use while delivering the benefits of secure and immutable records on a public registry, so the rights of medical institutions and patients are protected, and their data safely stored,” said Dr. Gianluca De Novi, Founder and CEO at Circular Protocol.

“We are excited about this partnership and where blockchain and healthcare converge to set a new standard for data protection,” said Dr. Adam Lowe, Chief Product Officer at CompoSecure. “This is an exciting future where patients have true ownership and seamless and secure access to their medical information.”

Circular is also partnering with IT Lab, an Italian software powerhouse specialized in the healthcare sector. More than 8,000 pharmacies in Italy will record on-chain the exams they are allowed to perform on-premises, becoming safe and transparent providers of medical procedures. The recording takes place via their ‘Smart Share' white label platform, already available in all pharmacies running the proof-of-concept (POC) for the first few months, with no need to own cryptocurrencies or a wallet. The rollout is expected in Q2 2025. The launch is designed to be the first truly decentralized, secure and transparent healthcare system of its kind. Costs are the same as a standard clinical exam, but with the added value of proximity, and all the blockchain-generated benefits.

“We are evolving healthcare towards a future where each touchpoint is monitored and where the burden of exams and treatments will be redistributed and performed where it makes the most sense, from a cost, proximity and competence perspective, empowering pharmacies, as well as hospitals, in full transparency and security for operators and patients”, said Anthony D'Angelo, CEO of ITLab “This will all be accessible via the current interfaces, but certifying patient data becomes, for the first time, the key for tremendous value for the whole healthcare and medical network, and Circular is leading this transformation.”

This ecosystem is expected to launch in the U.S. market in Q2 2025, providing healthcare institutions with seamless blockchain integration. To learn more, visit:  https://www.circularprotocol.org

Personal health and wellness is one of the many secular tailwinds for healthcare companies. But financial performance has lagged recently as players offloaded surplus COVID inventories in 2023 and 2024, a headwind for overall demand. The result? Over the past six months, the industry has tumbled by 8.4%. This drop was disappointing since the S&P 500 stood firm.

The elite companies can churn out earnings growth under any circumstance, however, and our mission at StockStory is to help you find them. Keeping that in mind, here is one resilient healthcare stock at the top of our wish list and two that may face trouble.

Market Cap: $5.71 billion

Pioneering the field of ""liquid biopsy"" with technology that can identify cancer-specific genetic mutations from a simple blood draw, Guardant Health (NASDAQ:GH) develops blood tests that detect and monitor cancer by analyzing tumor DNA in the bloodstream, helping doctors make treatment decisions without invasive biopsies.

Why Is GH Not Exciting?

Revenue growth over the past five years was nullified by the company's new share issuances as its earnings per share fell by 19% annually

Negative free cash flow raises questions about the return timeline for its investments

Limited cash reserves may force the company to seek unfavorable financing terms that could dilute shareholders

Guardant Health's stock price of $46.23 implies a valuation ratio of 6.7x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why GH doesn't pass our bar.

Market Cap: $1.16 billion

Founded in 2011 to transform how healthcare is delivered to patients with complex needs, Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH) provides specialty care management services and technology solutions that help health plans and providers deliver better care for patients with complex conditions.

Why Does EVH Worry Us?

Sales are projected to tank by 18.9% over the next 12 months as demand evaporates

Poor free cash flow margin of 0.3% for the last five years limits its freedom to invest in growth initiatives, execute share buybacks, or pay dividends

Negative returns on capital show that some of its growth strategies have backfired

At $10.08 per share, Evolent Health trades at 15.4x forward price-to-earnings. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including EVH in your portfolio, it's free.

Market Cap: $8.49 billion

With a mission to detect cancer earlier when it's more treatable, Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) develops and markets cancer screening and diagnostic tests, including its flagship Cologuard stool-based colorectal cancer screening test.

Why Is EXAS Interesting?

Average constant currency growth of 15.3% over the past two years demonstrates its ability to grow internationally despite currency fluctuations

Adjusted operating margin expanded by 21.5 percentage points over the last two years as it scaled and became more efficient

Earnings per share grew by 12.6% annually over the last five years, comfortably beating the peer group average

Exact Sciences is trading at $45.75 per share, or 230.3x forward price-to-earnings. Is now the right time to buy? Find out in our full research report, it's free.

GE Healthcare, Synchron and robotics companies were among the medtech firms that used Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference to share updates on their work with the AI computing leader.

Medtech companies used GTC 2025 this week to share updates on their work with AI computing leader Nvidia. The event is Nvidia's annual artificial intelligence developer conference.

Here, we look at AI projects device and diagnostic developers have started with Nvidia and one of the computing company's partners, Google Cloud. 

Quest Diagnostics is working with Google Cloud to streamline its data systems and personalize customer experiences using generative AI, the companies said Tuesday.

The partnership positions Quest to deploy platforms such as Google Agentspace, which uses generative AI to help employees and customers find information and create agents to automate tasks. Quest said AI could help patients “glean personalized health insights from their laboratory data” and give physicians insights to inform their care of individuals.

Quest, which competes with Labcorp, said the collaboration is “one of the first by a national laboratory provider to use these technologies across a range of operations and administrative areas like R&D, customer experience and operations.”

Other goals include streamlining Quest's systems to improve data quality, management and security. The company fulfilled more than 200 million orders for tests and managed over 80 billion data points in 2024.

GE Healthcare has expanded its relationship with Nvidia to cover autonomous X-ray and ultrasound systems, the companies said Tuesday. 

The partners plan to use AI-enabled software to capture and analyze medical images. GE Healthcare framed the autonomous systems as a way to alleviate the radiology staff shortages that have emerged as demand for imaging has increased in aging societies. AI-enabled systems “could minimize the burden on technicians and radiologists,” GE Healthcare said.

GE Healthcare plans to use the Nvidia Cosmos platform to train, test and tune autonomous ultrasound and X-ray devices in a virtual environment. By using synthetic data generation to simulate various scenarios, the company plans to automate repetitive tasks performed by X-ray technologists. The partners will also look at machine-to-patient interactions to more fully automate the scanning process. 

The ultrasound part of the project is focused on streamlining workflows and reducing the physical strains sonographers experience as they perform repetitive motions. GE Healthcare also sees opportunities to use AI in image understanding and robotic navigation.

Synchron has shown how its AI-enabled brain-computer interface could be displayed on the Apple Vision Pro to allow people to control digital and physical environments with their thoughts.

The company, which shared the news Wednesday, used Nvidia's Holoscan AI sensor processing platform to power the technology. Synchron said Holoscan enables faster, more precise motor inference in its BCI technology to empower users to control digital environments using their thoughts. 

Synchron's use of Holoscan for real-time neural decoding is the first step on its roadmap. The company plans to use other Nvidia technologies to create simulations of domestic environments. By interpreting neural signals in real-world simulations, the company aims to make interactions more intuitive.

Cognitive AI is the final part of Synchron's three-step roadmap. The company called cognitive AI the next step beyond generative and agentic AI. Synchron aims to create a “self-learning model of cognition.” The project will train the AI “directly on human neural activity” that the company has collected through the development and use of its BCI device.

Moon Surgical and Virtual Incision also shared details of their work with Nvidia this week. Moon Surgical is using the Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare platform to try to develop a robot that can “actively interpret, adapt and enhance surgical workflows in real time.” The company's Maestro System already uses the Nvidia Holoscan platform for real-time sensor processing.

Virtual Incision is exploring the use of the Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare platform in its next-generation robots, leveraging its ability to create virtual environments to simulate surgical details and physiologic processes.

Correction: The story was updated to reflect which company announcements were made as part of Nvidia's conference. Quest Diagnostics' announcement was not part of the conference.

Il soutiendra divers produits de santé, y compris la robotique chirurgicale, les dispositifs médicaux, les systèmes de technologie médicale, les équipements d'imagerie et les équipements de diagnostic de laboratoire.

L'installation dispose du système de gestion de la qualité de Flex pour le secteur de la santé et devrait obtenir la certification ISO13485 d'ici le deuxième trimestre 2025. Ce nouveau centre rejoint le réseau de Flex d'environ 100 sites dans le monde, permettant une intégration fluide entre les installations de conception et de fabrication à travers les régions.

Flex (NASDAQ: FLEX) hat die Eröffnung eines neuen Produkt-Einführungszentrums (NPI) in der Nähe von Boston, Massachusetts, bekannt gegeben, das sich der Bedienung von Kunden im Gesundheitswesen widmet. Die Einrichtung fungiert als Fertigungsgateway und bietet umfassende Unterstützung bei der Produktentwicklung, vom Prototyp bis zur Produktion.

Das Zentrum umfasst ein 8.000 Quadratfuß großes NPI-Labor, das mehrere Produktionslinien gleichzeitig betreiben kann, sowie ein 2.000 Quadratfuß großes Labor für Qualitäts- und Designvalidierungstests. Es wird verschiedene Gesundheitsprodukte unterstützen, darunter chirurgische Robotik, medizinische Geräte, Medizintechnologiesysteme, Bildgebungsgeräte und Labor-Diagnosetechnik.

Die Einrichtung verfügt über das Qualitätsmanagementsystem von Flex für das Gesundheitswesen und wird voraussichtlich bis zum 2. Quartal 2025 die ISO13485-Zertifizierung erhalten. Dieses neue Zentrum reiht sich in das Netzwerk von Flex mit etwa 100 globalen Standorten ein und ermöglicht eine nahtlose Integration zwischen Design- und Fertigungseinrichtungen in verschiedenen Regionen.

Flex's new Boston-area NPI center represents a strategic capability expansion in the high-value healthcare manufacturing sector. The 8,000 sq. ft. NPI lab and 2,000 sq. ft. quality testing facility are specifically designed to support complex medical product development across surgical robotics, medical devices, and diagnostic equipment categories.

The facility's location near Boston's medical technology hub is particularly significant, positioning Flex to capture business from innovative healthcare startups and established medical technology companies concentrated in this innovation ecosystem. This proximity advantage could accelerate customer acquisition in a sector known for high margins and long-term relationships.

From an operational perspective, this center bridges a critical gap between prototype development and full-scale production - often a pain point for medical device manufacturers. By offering end-to-end services from design through manufacturing transfer, Flex is targeting the higher-margin early development phases while creating a seamless pathway to volume production across its global network.

The pending ISO13485 certification (targeted for Q2 2025) is essential for handling regulated medical products and signals Flex's commitment to the stringent quality standards required in this sector. The capability to run several development lines simultaneously indicates meaningful capacity for concurrent customer projects.

While the announcement lacks financial projections or investment figures, this expansion should be viewed as a capability enhancement that strengthens Flex's competitive position in medical manufacturing services, potentially yielding benefits over the medium to long term rather than generating immediate material financial impact.

Oops, something went wrong

Tenet Healthcare (THC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this hospital operator have returned -5.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.5% change. The Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, to which Tenet belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Tenet is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.03 points to a change of +1.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.40 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Tenet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tenet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Tenet, the consensus sales estimate of $5.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.5%. The $20.84 billion and $21.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +5%, respectively.

Tenet reported revenues of $5.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.7%. EPS of $3.44 for the same period compares with $2.68 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.75%. The EPS surprise was +17.41%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tenet is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tenet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Oops, something went wrong

Chang Robotics has announced the launch of a new company, Curabotics, which aims to improve healthcare through robotics, automation, and AI.

The entity will transform hospital systems by addressing challenges such as rising costs, patient outcomes, labour shortages, burnout, and inefficiencies.

Chang Robotics has conducted a two-year pilot study at a hospital in the US, which demonstrated time savings of up to 40% when implementing multiple robotic functions.

It also showed that healthcare professionals could devote more time to direct patient care.

Chang Robotics president and Curabotics co-founder Kate McAfoose said: “Curabotics will focus exclusively on healthcare automation.

“In addition to our already proven nurse-assist robots and robotic pharmacy, Curabotics offers a comprehensive range of technology to improve efficiency, diagnostics, and patient outcomes.”

Curabotics has already accomplished a few use cases. Its nurse-assist bots led to a 15% workload reduction and a 96% adoption rate among nurses.

The robotic pharmacy helped 15 retail locations and reported a 90% fulfilment rate of prescription orders.

The ""autonomous building"" use case resulted in robotic control of badge access, security, HVAC and electrical systems, elevators, fire alarm systems, and machine-to-machine automation.

Utilising its engineering expertise, Curabotics plans to build and deploy automation solutions tailored to the healthcare industry.

It offers a range of technologies encompassing process automation with hospital warehouses, inter-campus delivery, smart building integrations, home health solutions, and telehealth solutions.

Diagnostic and surgery innovation capabilities comprise AI-driven metabolic scanning, mobile imaging devices, and robotic surgery equipment.

With these solutions, hospitals can enhance operational efficiency and provide new data insights.

Riyad Twahir has been appointed as the managing director of Curabotics, bringing experience in enterprise technology solutions, process transformation and autonomous robotic systems.

Twahir said: ""I'm very excited about this opportunity to address the systemic issues in healthcare. These are universal problems, and I look forward to collaborating with healthcare partners to provide business-driven solutions that improve patient care.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","Why hospital price transparency is essential to improving employee benefits","https://www.benefitnews.com/news/will-trump-save-healthcare-price-transparency","Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Despite healthcare price transparency regulations being in effect for the last four years, there's been little impact on the overall cost of care in the U.S. But the Trump administration seems determined to give the regulation teeth. 

President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring the Departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services to implement regulations that would further enforce the Hospital Price Transparency Rule and the Transparency in Coverage Rule by late May. The rules first came into effect during Trump's first administration, which mandated hospitals and insurers to share the costs of all services in machine-readable files. President Joe Biden signed another executive order in 2021, placing fines on uncompliant hospitals. 

Yet, just 21% of hospitals actually meet federal requirements, according to non-profit Patient Rights Advocate. A majority of hospitals are either completely ignoring the mandate or submitting illegible data, making it hard for consumers — including employers — to shop for quality, cost-effective care.

""The data itself is very much imperfect,"" says Mairin Mancino, senior adviser of policy at Peterson Center on Healthcare. ""It's hard to manipulate, and it takes data scientists months and months to make it into something useful. We're hopeful the administration will get these files cleaned up so that employers have the information they need when purchasing [plans] in the future.""

Ideally, access to this data would enable employers to pinpoint which hospitals and providers offer the best services for the best prices, explains Mancino. If one hospital is charging four times as much as the hospital down the road for the same procedure, it's worth exploring why there are added costs. More often than not, it's an arbitrary upcharge that has less to do with the provider's performance and more to do with the lack of transparency.

Read more: To reduce healthcare costs, address chronic conditions

""We know from the data that we do have that there are massive price differentials even within hospitals that don't seem to be supported by anything other than pricing power by incumbents like hospitals,"" says Mancino. ""So that has done a lot to galvanize employers to say, 'Hey, we're not getting a good deal.'""

Mancino is confident that more pricing information will push employers to change their health plans, whether or not they're self-insured. Given that Aon predicts health benefit costs will go up 9% this year, most employers won't have a choice. However, instead of cutting down their employees' access to care, employers can opt for stronger, if not smaller, provider networks. 

Read more: Are employers ready for the lawsuits a Trump-era EEOC will pursue?

""Spending has been increasing across all of healthcare, but it's been particularly prominent in the employer market,"" says Mancino. ""Better pricing data can help employers make novel benefit design decisions that are going to hold down costs and increase quality.""

While no one knows what shape Trump's executive order will take in May, Mancino is optimistic that more hospital and insurer data will come to light. In the meantime, she encourages employers to call their members o

 Congress and voice their need for clean, readable care data. 

""Get in touch and get involved,"" says Mancino. ""This is your opportunity to express your desire for more information so you can make better decisions with your healthcare dollars.""

If the Trump administration successfully ups price transparency compliance, employers will have vital data at their fingertips.

BELMONT COUNTY, Ohio — With the shuttering of some services at East Ohio Regional Hospital, Southeast Healthcare Services has announced it will accept patients that may no longer have a new medical facility to go to.

A Southeast representative also said it can provide transportation to and from appointments for these patients.

“We're so excited to bring CenterWell to Gladstone seniors,” said Drew Hare, Market President for Missouri and Kansas. “We work to help eliminate barriers to care by making a visit to the doctor's office convenient for the community, and it doesn't get more convenient than next to a Walmart. Like our other centers, this center is specifically designed for seniors, including dedicated entrances and easy parking. We're committed to helping our patients lead happier, healthier lives.”




Stephanie Ikeme, M.D., CenterWell's Chief Medical Officer for Missouri and Kansas, emphasized CenterWell's focus on whole-person health in a value-based care model has shown positive health outcomes for seniors.




“The newest data show that patients in value-based care models, like ours at CenterWell, see their primary care clinicians 10% more than non-value-based care patients, and this means more preventive care and better health maintenance for our seniors,” Dr. Ikeme said. “Additionally, those Medicare Advantage patients had 278,000 fewer inpatient admissions in 2023 versus those enrolled in Original Medicare. This holistic care is what we want for our seniors, and we're so thrilled to have another center open to expand access to our unique care model.”




CenterWell Senior Primary Care centers are staffed by board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, medical assistants and operational support staff, and patients will have access to nurse care coordinators, behavioral health specialists, social workers, a clinical pharmacist and referral specialists. The entire team has been specially trained to treat the senior population. In addition to its healthcare offerings, CenterWell facilities include activity centers open to the entire community, not just patients.




CenterWell locations in Missouri and Kansas accept Original Medicare and a wide range of Medicare Advantage health plans. CenterWell Gladstone joins seven other senior primary care centers in the Kansas City metropolitan area.




Other CenterWell and Conviva centers located next to Walmart stores will celebrate grand opening events this year in these metropolitan areas:

SAN DIEGO — Healthcare providers and parents raised concerns Wednesday about potential cuts to the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal.

They met with U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and U.S. Congresswoman Sara Jacobs at Rady Children's Hospital for a roundtable discussion. They vowed to fight back against potential cuts to Medicaid.

""As a health system, we see over 1.6 million pediatric visits a year,"" Patrick Frias, the CEO of Rady Children's Health, said. ""When you think 50 percent of kids we serve are Medicaid beneficiaries, that's a significant proportion of our patients. We're talking about a lot of families and children that could be impacted by this.""

The Trump administration has promised to slice $880 billion out of the next budget. Experts say that will mean major cuts to Medicaid, which funds Medi-Cal.

""It's not just a dollar figure, a percentage, a statistic when it comes to Medicaid, it's families. It's children,"" Senator Padilla said.

According to his office, 15 million Californians are enrolled in the program, which covers almost 40 percent of the state. It provides healthcare for low-income and disabled people.

Adelia Aguilar brought her 5-year-old daughter Delilah to Wednesday's discussion. Delilah was born with special needs. She is one of the more than 5 million kids enrolled in the state's Medi-Cal program. Her mom says being able to bring her daughter to Rady's for treatment has made a big difference in her life.

""If we wouldn't have this [enrollment in the Medi-Cal program], we wouldn't have this much progress with her right now,"" Aguilar said. ""She knows how to use her words.""

Opponents of the proposed cuts say they would have devastating effects on the healthcare system, straining services and raising healthcare costs for millions of Californians.

“Republicans are laying the groundwork to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid in order to pay for President Trump's tax cuts for billionaires,” Padilla said.

However, Republicans argue that one of the reasons the state's program is so expensive is due to a high enrollment of undocumented immigrants. 

""Our Republican colleagues like to talk about efficiency and cost savings,"" said Congresswoman Jacobs. ""The fact of the matter is, you save $12 for every dollar you invest in preventative healthcare. That's exactly what we want to be doing because when people show up in the ER, we will be paying for it either way. This way we can assure it is the most efficient use of resources.""

Senator Padilla said California isn't the only state dealing with budget issues when it comes to its Medicaid programs. He said it is due to a number of factors, including the rising cost of healthcare.","{'href': 'https://www.cbs8.com', 'title': 'CBS News 8'}"

(Montana – KFF) As Congress mulls potentially massive cuts to federal Medicaid funding, health centers that serve Native American communities are largely bracing for a massive hit. 

Indian Country has a unique relationship to Medicaid, because the program helps tribes cover chronic funding shortfalls from the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans.

Medicaid has accounted for about two-thirds of third-party revenue for tribal health providers, creating financial stability and helping facilities pay operational costs.

 More than a million Native Americans enrolled in Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program also rely on the insurance to pay for care outside of tribal health facilities.

Data privacy and security are leading concerns in highly regulated industries

CARY, N.C., March 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Generative AI is at the forefront of global innovation in both health care and life sciences. To better understand how technology is being used, data and AI leader SAS and Coleman Parkes Research conducted a global, cross-industry survey of 237 life sciences and pharma leaders and 240 health care leaders who are decision makers on their organization's GenAI, data and analytics strategy.

New study reports how the health care and life sciences industries are implementing GenAI to improve business outcomes.


The study offers a deep dive into how these sectors are implementing GenAI, what their biggest challenges are and how health care and life sciences compares to industries like insurance, the public sector, banking, manufacturing and more.


The study offers a deep dive into how these sectors are implementing GenAI, what their biggest challenges are and how health care and life sciences compares to industries like insurance, the public sector, banking, manufacturing and more.

Health care leans into GenAI innovation

The GenAI research for the health care sector revealed that leaders can envision the technology's transformative ability and are optimistic about the potential for GenAI to support and complement the work of doctors, researchers and other health care professionals. More specifically:

""The unique challenges and diverse functions of the health care sector demand special consideration to regulatory and compliance issues, data sensitivity, interoperability and bias in AI algorithms,"" said Alyssa Farrell, Global Health and Life Sciences Industry Marketing Director at SAS. ""The adoption of GenAI in health care is projected to rapidly catch up as the industry addresses these concerns.""

Access the full study and report findings for health care: Your journey to a GenAI future: A strategic path to success in health care.

Life sciences on the brink of GenAI-driven transformation

The GenAI research for life sciences and pharma found the industry is steadily embracing the technology. Leaders use the technology more regularly, are better prepared when it comes to GenAI usage policies, and an overwhelming majority plan to invest in it the next financial year. Specific findings include:

""The life sciences sector is looking toward a GenAI future with strong rates of organizational use – and the budgets to back it up,"" said Farrell. ""The technology's strengths in prediction and modeling suggest incredible potential to accelerate initiatives across the entire value chain, from R&D through clinical trials and commercialization. Leaders are feeling positive about what GenAI can do, particularly when it comes to innovating and maintaining a competitive advantage.""

Data privacy and security ranked as top concerns 

As GenAI technology expands, issues of data privacy and security uniquely affect leaders in health care and life sciences. These industries deal with sensitive and high-stakes outcomes and face particularly significant ethical and regulatory considerations. The research revealed:

Synthetic data embraced for data challenges 

Synthetic data is increasingly being used in the health care and life sciences industries to train and test AI systems in place of or in addition to real-world data. It also can augment data used to simulate patient workflows or supply chains. Synthetic data addresses data scarcity challenges by generating synthetic tabular data that statistically represents original training data without compromising sensitive patient health information.

The GenAI study revealed heightened openness to addressing data challenges – like data quality, scarcity and privacy scenarios – through synthetic data in both health care and pharma. Currently, 56% of life sciences organizations and 46% of health care entities are already using synthetic data or actively considering doing so. 

""Data is the lifeblood of the digital health ecosystem. Continued investment in interoperability and data governance is key to provide the fuel for a GenAI future,"" said Farrell. ""Incorporating synthetic data and technology, such as digital twins, is yet another way to derive more value from data for the benefit of patients and population health outcomes.""

Dr. Ian Weisberg Launches Scholarship Initiative: Advancing Healthcare Futures with the Dr. Ian Weisberg Scholarship for Medical Students.

Niceville, FL, March 20, 2025 -- The Dr. Ian Weisberg Scholarship for Medical Students announces a new opportunity for undergraduate students pursuing a career in medicine. This one-time $1,000 award, established by Dr. Ian Weisberg, aims to support students who demonstrate a genuine passion for healthcare. Open to applicants nationwide, the scholarship highlights the importance of fostering talent in the medical field.



Dr. Ian Weisberg, a seasoned cardiac electrophysiologist, founded this scholarship to encourage the next generation of healthcare professionals. His career reflects a deep commitment to patient care and education, and this program extends that dedication to students with big aspirations. The scholarship offers a platform for undergraduates to share their vision for improving medicine.

To qualify, applicants must be enrolled in a recognized college or university and show strong academic performance. A key requirement is an essay of 800 to 1,200 words responding to this prompt: “Medicine is not just about treating illness—it is about understanding the human condition and making a meaningful impact on people's lives. How do you envision yourself contributing to the future of healthcare? What drives your passion for medicine, and how do you plan to make a difference in the lives of your patients and the world?” Essays will be evaluated based on originality, clarity, and a clear commitment to healthcare.

HONOLULU (Island News) -- ""I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years,"" said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

""I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans,"" stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

""I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500,"" said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

""$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000,"" said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

""As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board,"" added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

""Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here,"" stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

""I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself,"" added Anacker.

    Fifteen organisations from Ghana's healthcare sector will be participating in a UK roadshow from 17-21 March 2025.


The UK's Department for Business and Trade has today welcomed a delegation of 15 organisations from Ghana's healthcare sector for a four-city roadshow aimed at strengthening trade partnerships and development opportunities.

The delegation, visiting the UK from 17-21 March 2025, includes representatives from the Ghanaian government, private health facilities, pharmaceutical and medical equipment distributors, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

The visit will strengthen the existing healthcare collaboration between the UK and Ghana, which already spans research and training, knowledge and expertise transfer, investment, and healthcare systems strengthening.

His Majesty's Trade Commissioner (HMTC) for Africa, John Humphrey, who is leading the UK delegation, said:

The UK is committed to strengthening its economic ties with Africa, and Ghana is a key partner in this effort as we partner together to unlock growth, jobs, trade, investment, and opportunities in our economies.

The roadshow begins in London before continuing to Birmingham, Leeds, and Cardiff. Throughout the tour, Ghanaian delegates will meet with UK companies offering solutions and expertise that match Ghana's healthcare needs. This initiative aligns with the UK's commitment to strengthening economic ties with African nations and building capacity to address issues around supply chain disruption over the past years. By working together – we can get ahead of global shocks, mitigate their impact, and unlock new opportunities for growth between our two countries.

British High Commissioner to Ghana, H.E. Harriet Thompson said:

The UK and Ghana have enjoyed a long and consistent partnership on healthcare, enhancing the health services available to citizens as well as supporting opportunities for both British and Ghanaian businesses. This roadshow is an opportunity to deepen that partnership, harnessing our nations' collective expertise, innovation, experience and dynamism. I am confident that the visit will foster productive connections, paving the way for growth and prosperity between Ghana and the UK.

This visit presents a valuable opportunity for UK businesses to explore Ghana's growing healthcare market, while enabling Ghana to access the UK's expertise, products, and services in the sector.

The Department for Business and Trade looks forward to productive engagement between the delegations, leading to increased trade and collaboration in healthcare.

NFL business keeps booming. And the latest evidence of the ongoing spike in franchise value comes from the latest sale of a non-NFL team.

Via Shams Charania of ESPN.com, Bill Chisolm will buy the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion.

That beats the highest price ever paid for an NFL franchise by $50 million. In 2023, a group led by Josh Harris bought the Commanders for $6.05 billion.

No NFL team is currently for sale. After seeing the price tag for the Celtics, some owners might consider taking the money and running.

Several years ago, we were told that, sooner than later, the average NFL team would be worth $8 billion to $10 billion. We seem to be there. 

And imagine what a team like the Cowboys would fetch on the open market. $15 billion? $20 billion? More?

It doesn't matter because the Cowboys aren't for sale. Even if most Cowboys fans wish they were.

          / CBS Colorado
        

A community in Colorado is planning a new project to build a mega sports complex while preserving more than 400 acres of open space.

The Board of Douglas County Commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to enter a partnership for the development of the Zebulon Regional Sports Complex. The board went into a private executive session for discussion earlier that morning before the public vote.

The first phase of development will include three ice rinks and basketball courts, a soccer complex and a baseball complex. Officials said the project will also preserve over 400 acres of open space in the area, including a 104-acre wildlife corridor adjacent to Sterling Ranch and Louviers.  

""This is such an exciting time. We are in the golden era of Douglas County where we can start moving on what our citizens want – a best-in-class regional sports facility paired with ongoing efforts to preserve open space,"" said Commissioner Abe Laydon.

Officials said the proposed site for the new sports complex is four miles south of C-470. The Sterling Ranch Development Company, which is partnering with the board of commissioners, said, ""This project will attract new shopping, dining, recreation, and community gathering spaces that Sterling Ranch would not be able to support on its own at this time.""

Funding for the sports complex comes from a .17% sales tax approved by voters in Nov. 1994 to cover the acquisition, administration, planning, development, construction, operations and maintenance of parks, trails, historic resources and open space. That tax was recently extended by voters in Nov. 2022.

Officials said the design process is underway for the first phase of the project. They said the estimated cost is between $60 million and $70 million.

A live town hall in April will allow residents to learn about the Zebulon project as well as other parks and open space projects in the county.

Two new parks, High Note Regional Park and Wildcat Regional Park, are also planned for Lone Tree and Highlands Ranch.

Current conditions in Dubuque, IA













Mike Van Milligen

Brad Cavanagh







Sports tourism in the greater Dubuque area has long been a matter of faith: If you build it, will they come?

The community took a leap of faith on greyhound racing in the 1980s. It became the movie site for “Field of Dreams,” first bringing Hollywood actors depicting baseball players to the tri-state area and later real big leaguers for a pair of MLB games.

In 2010, Dubuque became a center for ice hockey in Iowa with the construction of the ice arena on Chaplain Schmitt Island. Now, the city and DRA are considering whether more youth sports facilities could make the Key City a destination for sports tourism.

The DRA — the nonprofit license holder for Dubuque's casinos — used gaming revenue to fund a sports complex feasibility study, which was presented to the Dubuque City Council this week and included two major options for a potential youth sports complex attached to the existing ImOn Arena.

City Manager Mike Van Milligen cautioned that there is no money allocated for additional youth sports facilities, and the session was purely informational.

Still, the discussion got several City Council members dreaming that if they could build it, the families would come.

“It is important to recognize both the dreams and the constraints,” Mayor Brad Cavanagh said. “This is a real tough environment. We're not going to get much help from our federal government.”

But, he said, “It is time to think big about what we can have in Dubuque.”

Consultants looked at a range of sporting facilities, including more baseball fields, soccer fields and an indoor turf complex, before recommending expanding ImOn Arena with a large gymnasium complex featuring multiple courts for basketball or volleyball and a second sheet of ice to expand an option that is at capacity and fills a niche in this corner of the Midwest.

While participation in baseball, softball and football is falling, the study showed growth for a list of indoor sports: figure skating, ice hockey, basketball, gymnastics, volleyball and competitive cheerleading.

“It creates that ‘wow' factor as you arrive on the island,” said Tom Ohle, a senior partner at RDG Planning & Design. “Funding is always the biggest challenge. It's going to take a focused team dedicated to seeing it happen.”

Both types of facilities would have a significant cost — $18 million to $26 million for the gymnasium complex and $23 million to $33 million for the second ice rink.

Brandon Dowling, a principal at Johnson Consulting in Chicago, zeroed in on the ice rink as a niche that other communities within a four-hour drive don't have. The Chicago area has a number of them, but the saturation could lead families to attend tournaments in Dubuque if the local rink had the additional capacity.

“It's a very heavily utilized facility today,” Dowling said.

“I think it is a niche,” Council Member Susan Farber said. “I look forward to how this can get articulated and actually delivered.”

Dowling said Dubuque may have a population of only 60,000 people, but there are 125,000 people within a 30-minute drive, 1.3 million people within a 90-minute drive and nearly 20 million people within four hours of Dubuque who could use the sports facility.

And while Dubuque residents' median income is lower than the national average, expand the map outward and nearby populations meet the median income and have discretionary money to spend on the growing area of youth sports.

“There is a lot of demand for this type of sports consumerism,” Dowling said.

Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has large indoor facilities for both ice sports and gym sports. Madison, Wis., has an ice arena with two sheets of ice, while Bettendorf, Iowa, has an indoor sports complex with eight courts.

A consultant's public survey garnered 2,000 responses, with 84% saying there are not enough playing areas for their sport in the tri-state region, and a majority of respondents said they leave the area at least monthly to compete.

TBK Sports Bank Complex in Bettendorf receives about 18,000 visits from Dubuque residents annually, per the study.

The study shows the expanded ice facility could generate $4.5 million in economic activity per year and raise $300,000 in tax revenue. The court facility was an even bigger economic draw — $14.3 million in increased consumer spending and $1 million in tax revenues.

Boxing will be included on the sports programme of the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028 (LA28). This was approved today by the 144th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session during the second day of its meeting in Costa Navarino, Greece.

This decision was based on the proposal from the IOC Executive Board (EB), following the recommendation from the Olympic Programme Commission, and the provisional recognition of World Boxing as the International Federation (IF) within the Olympic Movement governing the sport of boxing at world level.

Boxing was not included on the LA28 initial sports programme approved by the IOC Session in February 2022, because of the then-ongoing concerns around the then-IF for boxing, the International Boxing Association (IBA). Following the withdrawal of the IBA's recognition on 22 June 2023, the inclusion of boxing on the LA28 sports programme remained on hold.

The IOC made it clear that National Boxing Federations had to reach a consensus around a new IF in order for boxing to be included on the sports programme of the Olympic Games LA28. Following an assessment of the various criteria regarding governance and sports integrity, the IOC EB decided on 26 February to provisionally recognise World Boxing, which is currently composed of 88 National Federations across the five continents.

The sport of boxing has a long tradition at the Olympic Games. It was first included in the modern Olympic Games in 1904, and has been contested at every edition since then except for Stockholm 1912, due to a local law banning the sport at the time.

At the most recent Olympic Games, in Paris, the boxing competition and its qualifying tournaments were organised under the authority of the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit, an ad hoc task force created by the IOC EB following the withdrawal of recognition of the IBA. This decision was taken in order to protect athlete participation at Paris 2024 and deliver a clear, fair and transparent pathway for boxers to qualify, ensuring a fair and just competition.

At Paris 2024, 68 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were represented in the boxing competition. In all, 31 of them medalled across the 13 events, including Cabo Verde and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team, which claimed their first-ever Olympic medals (bronze). This was the highest ratio of competing NOCs to medal in one sport at the Olympic Games Paris 2024.

New name for Giants in CBS Sports' 3-round mock draft

Another day, another mock draft.

The latest analyst to release their predictions for next month's NFL Draft is CBS Sports' Chris Trapasso, who put out a new three-round mock draft this week.

With the third overall pick, Trapasso has the Giants selecting a name we have yet to hear during mock draft season - Missouri offensive tackle Armand Membou.

""Whoever is eventually the starter for the Giants in 2025 will need to be better protected than past quarterbacks in the Brian Daboll era,"" the CBS Sports analyst wrote. ""Membou is a powerful blocker with elite testing numbers.""

The 6-foot-4, 332-pound tackle out of Missouri did not allow a single sack across 411 pass block snaps as a junior this past season, according to Pro Football Focus, and allowed a total of just three sacks between his first two years with the Tigers. He was named second-team All-SEC by both the Associated Press and the conference's coaches following his dominant 2024 campaign.

At this year's NFL Combine, Membou finished with Next Gen Stats' highest athleticism score among offensive tackles after he ran a 4.91 40-yard dash to go with his 34"" vertical jump and 31 bench press reps.

Membou lined up exclusively at right tackle during his time in Columbia, but also has experience playing guard going back to high school.

Moving to the second round, Trapasso has the Giants adding another pass rusher in the form of Marshall edge Mike Green.

Green began his collegiate career at Virginia, where he played in six games as a freshman back in 2021. After not playing at all during the 2022 campaign, the 6-foot-3, 251-pound edge rusher transferred to Marshall where his career took off.

Green totaled 4.5 sacks and nine tackles for loss across 13 games in 2023. But it was this past season that really saw his draft stock skyrocket.

Playing in 13 games, Green put together one of the most decorated seasons in Marshall history as he led the FBS with 17 sacks and 22.5 tackles for loss. His sack total set a Sun Belt conference record and tied the Marshall record, previously set by Cecil Fletcher in 1986.

This performance led to Green being named the Sun Belt Player of the Year and first-team All-SBC, along with second-team All-American by the Associated Press.

With the team's third pick in CBS Sports' three-round mock draft, Trapasso has the Giants finally addressing the quarterback position with the selection of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe at No. 65.

Milroe was a two-year starter for the Crimson Tide with 26 starts under center across the last two seasons. As a redshirt sophomore in 2023, the 6-foot-2, 217-pound quarterback completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 2,834 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions while adding 12 rushing touchdowns. This led to him being named second-team All-SEC and finishing sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting.

Across 13 games this past season, Milroe finished with 2,844 passing yards, a 64.3 completion percentage, 16 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, but scored a whopping 20 rushing touchdowns.

Milroe participated in Alabama's Pro Day on Wednesday, where he put together an impressive performance. His Next Gen Stats athleticism score of 99 ranks No. 1 among all quarterbacks in the 2025 NFL Draft.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Charlotte FC fans, your head coach is sticking around the Queen City.

On Thursday, the club announced that Dean Smith had signed a new contract that will see him lead the black and blue through the 2027 Major League Soccer season. The announcement comes after Smith lead the club to its first-ever playoff win in the last season and as Charlotte FC kicks off the current season with its best start in team history.

“I've thoroughly enjoyed being the head coach of Charlotte FC and I'm honored to sign a new contract with the club,” said Smith in a statement. “Everyone at the club is aligned in our vision to be a leader in Major League Soccer. To our supporters, you have made our family feel welcome in this city and for that we're grateful to each one of you. We will work together with the aim of consistently challenging for major trophies every season.”

Smith's first season at the helm saw him lead Charlotte FC to earning a record 51 points total along with the playoff win. The Crown also had the league's second-best defensive record, with goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina earning MLS honors as Goalkeeper of the Year.

“Dean has been an exceptional leader for Charlotte FC and we are excited for him to sign a new contract,” said club owner David Tepper, who also owns the Carolina Panthers NFL team. ""The club's success over the past year is a reflection of his dedication and commitment to excellence both on and off the pitch. We look forward to what the future holds with Dean leading the way.”

Smith, originally from England, had previously spent more than a decade managing in the English football system, notably with Aston Villa in the English Premier League. He also spent time at Walsall FC, Brentford FC, Norwich City FC and Leicester City FC.

Prior to managing teams, Smith himself was a player; he started as a defender with Walsall in 1989 and played 166 league and cup games there. He also played for Hereford United, Leyton Orient, Sheffield Wednesday and Port Vale before retiring from the pitch as a player in 2005. His managerial career in the English system spanned 18 years.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — University of Kentucky women's basketball coach Kenny Brooks is The Sporting News' National Coach of the Year. The publication announced the honor on Wednesday.

In his first year at UK, Brooks has led the team to its best season-to-season turnaround in program history. So far this year, the Cats are 22-7 overall and have an 11-5 record in the Southeastern Conference. Kentucky begins its NCAA Tournament run Friday, March 21 against Liberty at noon ET.

Brooks had to get off to a fast start when he arrived in Lexington. He recruited 11 players and hired 11 coaches and staff members.

The 2024-2025 season is the program's first 20-plus win season in five years. Brooks tied the late Terry Hall as the quickest head coaches in program history to reach their first 20 wins at UK (24 games).

 According to the university, Brooks is only the second head coach in program history to begin his first season at UK undefeated through seven games. Terry Hall went undefeated through her first nine games in 1980-81. She coached the Cats from 1980 to 1987.

Brooks has brought renewed excitement to the program. Reserved season tickets sold out before the season and the school said four home games sold out before tip off.

The University of Kentucky is hosting the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament at Memorial Coliseum. Brooks has now taken three programs to the NCAA Tournament. ","{'href': 'https://spectrumnews1.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News 1'}"

A Successful Inaugural Season Behind It, Unrivaled Is Eyeing a Long Future in Women's Sports

MEDLEY, Fla. (AP) — Unrivaled, the 3-on-3 women's basketball league founded by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, is eyeing a sustained future in women's sports after concluding its inaugural season in Miami.

The league debuted in January at a point of huge growth and momentum in women's sports and wrapped up its eight-week season with Rose winning the first championship on Monday. While WNBA players have historically competed overseas to supplement their income during the offseason, Unrivaled set out to give them a domestic alternative while pushing athlete development, fast-paced and physical play and substantial player salaries.

While platforming some of the game's biggest stars like Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese, Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner and others, Unrivaled averaged 221,000 viewers on TNT and truTV during its regular season and two-day postseason, the league announced Thursday. The league said it sold out every game held at the new Wayfair Arena — which seats 850 people — with ticket sales surpassing seven figures.

Unrivaled coverage reached more than 11.9 million viewers across TNT and truTV and delivered the 10 most-watched women's basketball games ever on TNT Sports' networks, the league said. Games were also available for livestreaming on Max, resulting in the 10 most-streamed women's basketball games on the service.

Monday's final between Rose and Vinyl averaged 364,000 viewers with a peak of 385,000 — a 99% increase from the regular season. And 398,000 people watched Collier take home $200,000 after winning Unrivaled's midseason 1 on 1 tournament last month.

“We've built an incredible foundation,” Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell said in an end-of-season news conference. ""Based on what the viewership is, now it's our job to — how do we grow that a bit? We're very proud about where we stand in the women's sports ecosystem of viewership. And what I've said all along is we're not going to go out there and do WNBA numbers in Year 1.

“But if you look at our viewership, the fact that we're holding is a real sign the product is sticking.”

Collier's six-figure payday was the largest one-day prize in women's basketball history, Unrivaled commissioner Micky Lawler said. That was part of the league's goal in setting a new standard for pay in women's sports.

Players had an average salary of more than $220,000 — the highest average salary for players of any professional women's sports league and close to the maximum base salary in the WNBA. The league reached more than $8.65 million in total compensation earned by players between their salary pool, 1 on 1 tournament, and championship, on top of the equity they receive in the league. Each player on the championship-winning Rose squad took home $50,000.

Leading up to its launch, Unrivaled raised more than $35 million from various sources and dozens of individual investors, including Stephen Curry, Dawn Staley, Geno Auriemma and Coco Gauff.

Fan interest was high all season. The league's main social media accounts reached almost 400,000 total followers, and the 36 Unrivaled players collectively gained nearly 1 million followers since the season began in January.

Players praised the experience, from the training facility and weight room at WayFair Arena to all of the child care options like nursing rooms on-site.

Unrivaled will continue with six teams in Year 2 and will remain based in Miami but could potentially explore other markets. There are plans for possible expansion in the future, Bazzell said, but the league wants to find a way to do it without cutting into player salaries.

MAYVILLE — Ty Harper stepped down as head coach of the Clymer/Sherman/Panama football program in mid-January.

As it turns out, Harper won't be away from the sideline long.

In fact, he'll be back this coming season.

Harper was approved as the Chautauqua Lake/Westfield/Brocton head coach at the Chautauqua Lake Board of Education meeting Wednesday evening.

“In recent years, we've hired some exceptional teachers who are also remarkable coaches. Coach Harper is an excellent example of a teacher and coach who is dedicated to ensuring his students succeed both in the classroom and on the athletic field,” Chautauqua Lake superintendent Dr. Josh Liddell said Wednesday. “Time and time again, we've seen that outstanding coaches also make exceptional teachers, demonstrating a strong work ethic and competitiveness that drive their success in all aspects of school life.”

When he resigned as the Wolfpack's head coach, Harper cited a desire to be closer to his family – his wife, Lauren, is Westfield's director of instruction and special education, and his three sons are elementary students at Westfield.

“Chautauqua Lake door to door for me is eight minutes. It certainly frees up time, especially in the fall. Being able to attend (son Colt's) practices more frequently is going to be a welcome change,” Harper said Wednesday. “Being able to make all of the twins' flag games, which are typically on Saturdays, is going to be an important thing for me to be able to do.”

In addition to being more hands-on coaching his sons' youth teams in the near-term, the move will allow him to be their varsity coach in the long term if they continue playing football.

“Typically in the past we played home games on Saturday afternoons and I think I made it to two of the twins' flag days this past season,” Harper added. “I'm excited to be more present for the boys and their football endeavors.”

Harper's reputation precedes him to Mayville. After coaching Clymer/Sherman to a 1-7 record in 2014, the Fredonia High School and St. John Fisher graduate led a decade of dominance with Clymer/Sherman/Panama that included a 78-23 record and three New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class D state championships — in 2018, 2019 and 2024.

The Wolfpack produced 18 New York State Sportswriters Association first-team all-state selections in the past eight seasons, including five Class D Players of the Year – Derek Ecklund in 2018, Cameron Barmore and Gerrit Hinsdale in 2019, and Tate Catanese and Bryce Hinsdale this past year.

This past season, Clymer/Sherman/Panama returned a ton of talent to its skill positions, but was forced due to graduation and injury into playing five new starters along the offensive line. By the end of the season, that group was as responsible for the team's success as any other group.

“I'm so grateful that Josh and (athletic director) Bryan (Bongiovanni) have given me this opportunity,” Harper said.

Harper will not be unfamiliar with his staff in Mayville. In fact, he'll be bringing Wolfpack defensive coordinator Chris Payne with him to serve in the same position with the Eagles.

“Chautauqua Lake is proud to welcome Coach Harper and Coach Payne to our athletic staff. We are very fortunate to have them, as both bring a proven track record of motivating and coaching athletes to reach their full potential while achieving a lot of team success. Of equal importance, both coaches possess great character and understand the value of shaping their players into good people,” Liddell said. “Coach Harper and Coach Payne are beloved by their players and the community and we cannot wait to see the positive culture they develop.”

“I care about Chris both as a colleague and a friend. We worked together the past 10 years. There is a lot of trust that's been built up between the two of us. I feel fortunate that he was willing and able to make this jump with me,” Harper added. “I think he's still got a lot of football left in him. I'm thrilled that we'll be able to share the sideline together again.”

The addition of Harper continues a trend at Chautauqua Lake of adding teachers and coaches who experienced great success as student-athletes themselves, including boys basketball coach Devin Pope and girls basketball coach Sarah Burnett.

“Our district is fortunate to have seen an increase in the number of outstanding families, coaches, and teachers looking to join our school community,” Liddell said. “The overall culture is great right now and it's an exciting time to be part of both our athletic and academic programs.”

The cupboard is certainly not bare with the Eagles. The recent coaching staff has led the program to its most success in a decade in the past couple of years.

This season, Chautauqua Lake/Westfield/Brocton finished 7-3 overall, including 5-2 in Class C South, and earned two home playoff games. After beating Alden 41-28, the Eagles lost to Class C runnerup Portville/Cuba-Rushford 32-17.

“They obviously had a really successful season last fall. They were a game away from playing for a sectional title. I think there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic,” Harper said. ” … I've said for a long time that I think, whether it's Class C or Class D, Section VI plays the best small-school football in the state. I stand by that. I think that's shown year in and year out through the teams that advance in the state playoffs.”

Junior wide receiver Nick Jacobson was named a second-team all-state selection, junior quarterback Brayden Gibbs was named a third-team all-state selection, and sophomore running back Thandon Bensink and junior kicker Carson Fairbank were named honorable-mention all-state selections.

“Class C is a really competitive league. Every team is well coached and I certainly don't anticipate that it will be easy. … It's going to be a gauntlet. I'm excited for the challenge,” Harper said. “We have a great core of kids who were scratching the surface last year. I would expect us to be very competitive this fall. Additionally, there's a fantastic program (Clymer/Sherman/Panama) moving into the league from Class D that's had a lot of success. I think that only adds to the strength of the league.”

At January's board meeting, Harper was approved as a social studies teacher beginning March 3. He'll now take over the football program with next season set to begin Saturday, Aug. 23.

“Overwhelmingly everyone has been extremely welcoming, which has definitely made the transition a lot easier. It seems to be a great faculty and staff,” he said. “A lot of the returning players have shown excitement and been extremely friendly. … I'm really excited about getting to work with them.”

FILE - West Virginia athletic director Wren Baker answers questions during a news conference, June 26, 2023, in Morgantown, W.Va.  (AP Photo/Kathleen Batten, File)

MORGANTOWN — It can be theorized that WVU athletic director Wren Baker lost men's basketball coach Darian DeVries to Indiana after just one season because of tradition or national recognition.

To some degree, there may be some truth to that, as Indiana has five national championship banners hanging within Assembly Hall.

“The opportunity came along to possibly be the head coach at Indiana, a dream job for anyone, but especially for someone that grew up in the Midwest watching the old Big 8 and Big 10 basketball,” DeVries said during his introductory press conference. “The chance to lead one of the biggest brands in college basketball was something that I could not pass up.”

The heart of the matter lies in the checkbook, which was an unfortunate story Baker had to tell to West Virginia media on Wednesday, just hours after DeVries was introduced at Indiana.

“From a resource perspective, we are prepared to stretch what we have, but there are certainly people in college athletics who have more money,” Baker said.

Indiana's financial resources — much of it gained through Big Ten TV contracts that pays each member school between $80-100 million annually — allowed the school to offer DeVries a reported six-year deal worth more than $30 million.

That dwarfs WVU's contract with DeVries that was worth $15 million over five years.

“Do I think that was a factor?” Baker said. “If I'm being honest, yes.”

Baker said he had attempted to negotiate some better financial terms with DeVries, beginning long before anyone in the state had considered the possibility of Indiana going after him.

“I first talked to his agent in early February and made sure they knew we wanted to reward his success,” Baker said. “I sat down with him several times over the last few weeks to talk about his contract and his compensation and what we could do there.

“We talked about what we could do with revenue sharing and NIL opportunities. I think we had a really good shared vision of what we needed to do in order to continue to build the program.”

That shared vision broke off after DeVries accepted the Hoosier's offer on Tuesday afternoon, and now Baker is conducting a third search over the course of three seasons for the WVU men's program.

“I'm at peace that we were aggressive in trying to retain him,” Baker said. “Ultimately, I recognize it's not my decision to make. He gets to make that. We wish him well.”

In additional efforts to retain DeVries, Baker said he made it clear that WVU wanted to make a counter offer, but the school was never given that chance.

“I made it clear to him that we would like a chance to counter if there was an offer that came from Indiana,” Baker said. “Just the way it unfolded, we didn't get that chance. I made it clear that, within reason, we would do whatever it takes to keep him here and keep building on this program.”

In his heart, did Baker believe WVU's limited budget — when compared to Big Ten and SEC schools — could compete with the money Indiana was throwing at DeVries.

“I think we could have competed,” Baker said. “We have had a lot of donors over the course of the last few weeks who were very interested in keeping Darian and continuing to build on what he was doing.

“Even since the (NCAA tournament) snub on Sunday, we've had some double back and say, ‘We want whatever we need to do to build a roster and keep him.' I do think we could have made a competitive counter offer. What that would have ultimately done, I don't know. I wanted the chance to do that and it just didn't work out. He had the offer and I think he was pretty set that's what he was going to do.”

The next move is again on Baker. He did not discuss any candidates on Wednesday, other than essentially ruling out the return of Bob Huggins.

He gave no timeline, but there was a hint that this could be a quick process to introduce the next coach.

“We went through this process a year ago,” he said. “While some of those candidates are off the board, there are probably a few new ones on the board. A lot of them we've already done deep, deep dives on.”

In terms of what will be owed to WVU, Baker confirmed the school will receive a buyout check, “In excess of $6 million dollars,” he said.

The final number will settle in around $6.15 million, which includes reimbursing WVU for the money it paid DeVries for moving costs incurred when he first came to Morgantown from Drake University last year. It also reimburses WVU for the money it paid to Drake to buy out DeVries' contract with the Bulldogs.

“Collecting $6 million will help us make a transition to a new coach and help us with some other items,” Baker said.

Baker said the coaching search will include candidates with ties to WVU, but certainly wouldn't be limited to just those coaches.

“I know there can be a knee-jerk reaction whenever you lose a coach after a year,” Baker said. “Human nature is to think we have to get someone who has a connection to here.

I just think my job is to go out and get the best coach I can. You want to have coaches that other people covet and want to come after. The alternative to that is no one wants your coach, and that's not very good.”

NOTE

Baker confirmed that WVU has already lost one player to the transfer portal. That player is freshman Jonathan Powell, who averaged 8.3 points and 3.1 rebounds in his first season.

A group led by Symphony Technology Group managing partner William Chisholm has agreed to purchase the Boston Celtics for at least $6.1 billion, which would make the sale the richest in U.S. major pro sports history, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday.

It remains unclear when exactly the deal will be closed and how the deal will be structured, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side had made any public announcement of the agreement.

But the $6.1 billion valuation would set the U.S. major sports league record, coming in just ahead of the $6.05 billion that a group led by Josh Harris spent to buy the Washington Commanders in 2023.

Sportico and ESPN were among those first reporting the agreement for the sale of the reigning NBA champions.

Boston Basketball Partners LLC announced last summer that it intended to sell the majority of the Celtics either late last year or early this year, then would sell the balance of its shares in 2028. Wyc Grousbeck, whose family leads the ownership group, is expected to remain the Celtics' governor until the sale is complete.

Grousbeck's group bought the Celtics for $360 million in 2002.

The $6.1 billion figure would also top — by a big margin — recent NBA franchise sales. In 2023, the Phoenix Suns were purchased by mortgage firm owner Mat Ishbia for $4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks were sold to Cleveland Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam for $3.5 billion, and Mark Cuban agreed to the sale of the majority of his Dallas Mavericks' ownership shares to Miriam Adelson and son-in-law Patrick Dumont, who operates the Las Vegas Sands casino company, for $3.5 billion.

BOSTON, Mass. — The Boston Celtics have been sold to William Chisholm for a reported $6.1 billion, according to ESPN.

Chisholm is a co-founder and managing partner of Symphony Technology Group, a private equity firm. He previously worked for Boston-based Bain & Company. Chisholm is a native of Georgetown, Massachusetts, a Dartmouth College graduate and lifelong Celtics fan, The Boston Globe reported.

ESPN's Shams Charania reports that the $6.1 billion deal becomes the largest sale for a sports franchise in North America. It surpasses the $6.05 billion sale of the Washington Commanders in 2023.

The Grousbeck family said last year they would be selling the team, just weeks after the Celtics won the franchise's 18th NBA championship. Current Celtics managing partner Steve Pagliuca was seen as a potential buyer for the team.

The Celtics were last purchased for $360 million in 2002.

With the bracket officially set, March Madness can finally begin. The field of 68 was determined by the selection committee on Sunday, and while some of its choices invited controversy, the show must go on.

But before that can happen, the field needs to be whittled down to 64 teams. The opening set of games — called the First Four — will take place Tuesday and Wednesday. The winners of those games will advance to the First Round of the event.

On Tuesday, St. Francis and Alabama State will square off to determine which team will become the No. 16 seed in the South. After that, North Carolina and San Diego will battle to see which team will be the No. 11 seed in the South.

The final two games of the First Four will take place Wednesday. The winner of Mount St. Mary's and American will slot into the No. 16 seed in the East, and Xavier and Texas will play for the No. 11 seed in the Midwest.

Four different networks will carry March Madness games in 2025. The entire First Four will air on TruTV on Tuesday and Wednesday. TruTV is channel 246 on DirecTV. It's listed as channel 242 on Dish. It varies on other providers. Once the first round of the tournament begins, TruTV, CBS, TNT and TBS will carry various games.

Game times and TV networks have not been announced for the second round, Sweet 16 or Elite Eight at this time. Both Final Four games and the national championship will air on CBS.

WICHITA, Kan. — The chances of Houston cutting down the nets at the Final Four in a few weeks could depend on the uncertain status of J'Wan Roberts' ailing right ankle. The same can be said for fellow No. 1 seed Duke and Cooper Flagg's left ankle.

Or injuries that have impacted second-seeded Alabama, No. 3 seeds Iowa State and Texas Tech, and so many others.

Health is always a factor in the NCAA Tournament, shaping the way games transpire. And the status of some key players on some noteworthy teams should likewise shape the way millions of Americans fill out their brackets.

In the case of the Cougars, the headliner in the Midwest Region, the 6-foot-8 Roberts is both their best rebounder and one of their veteran leaders, one of just a few players left from their Final Four team in 2021. Roberts sprained his ankle in the Big 12 Tournament and watched from the bench as Houston romped to the title in Kansas City, Missouri.

“I'm doing pretty good,” Roberts said before taking part in the Cougars' open practice for their opener against No. 16 seed SIU-Edwardsville. “Getting a lot of treatment and just taking it day by day so I can be 100%.”

Elsewhere in the region, third-seeded Kentucky is expected to have Lamont Butler back for its first-round game against No. 14 seed Troy. The Wildcats' assist and steals leader hurt his shoulder in their SEC Tournament opener against Oklahoma.

No. 4 seed Purdue is hopeful Fletcher Loyer is able to play against No. 13 seed High Point. The Boilermakers' third-leading scorer hurt his elbow during a quarterfinal loss to eventual champion Michigan in the Big Ten Tournament.

The news wasn't so positive for No. 5 seed Clemson, which lost Dillon Hunter to a broken hand in the ACC Tournament. He had been averaging more than 22 minutes off the bench, and coach Brad Brownell described him as a “glue guy” for the Tigers.

There's been no more closely watched injury than the one to Flagg, the first-team All-American from Duke, who sprained his ankle against Georgia Tech in the ACC Tournament. Flagg missed the rest of the tourney, but the Blue Devils were so confident in his availability that they informed the NCAA Tournament selection committee of it.

The Blue Devils, who play Mount St. Mary's, probably won't need Flagg and his team-best 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game in their opener. They might for a second-round game against Mississippi State or Baylor.

Duke also is monitoring Maliq Brown, one of its best defenders, who re-injured his shoulder in the same game Flagg was hurt.

In the bottom half of the East Region, second-seeded Alabama hopes Grant Nelson will be available this weekend, though he may miss its game against No. 15 seed Robert Morris. Nelson hurt his knee in the SEC Tournament.

No. 10 seed Arkansas and coach John Calipari face seventh-seeded Kansas and Bill Self, and the Razorbacks expect to have freshman Boogie Fland on the floor. Their second-leading scorer and top distributor hurt his hand in January.

The Razorbacks are still expected to be without Adou Thiero, their top scorer and rebounder, who missed their last six games because of a knee injury. That could hurt Arkansas' ability to defend the Jayhawks' 7-foot-2 center, Hunter Dickinson.

Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland, whose third-seeded team plays No. 14 seed UNC Wilmington, said he expects to have “everybody playing” in its first-round matchup. That would include second-leading scorer Darrion Williams, who has been dealing with a leg injury, and third-leading scorer Chance McMillian, who has an upper-body injury.

Memphis is unsure whether guards Tyrese Hunter (foot) and Dante Harris (ankle) will be available when the fifth-seeded Tigers play No. 12 seed Colorado State. Hunter started 32 games this season while Harris appeared in 16.

Third-seeded Iowa State ruled out second-leading scorer Keshon Gilbert with a muscle strain that had limited him late in the season and allowed him to play just 11 minutes in the Big 12 Tournament. Gilbert also led the Cyclones in assists.

That makes Tamin Lipsey's availability against No. 14 seed Lipscomb even more important. He sustained a groin injury in the Big 12 tourney and did not play in Iowa State's loss to BYU, but he should be on the floor for its NCAA opener.

No. 8 seed Louisville is still monitoring the ankle of Reyne Smith, who sprained it on March 5 in a win over California and missed the ACC Tournament. But coach Pat Kelsey indicated the senior guard would play against No. 9 seed Creighton.

Rewind to a year ago and it was not only the first trip to states for this group of Frewsburg girls basketball players, but the first trip in the history of the program. 

It's safe to say that the nerves for a moment like that were quite high. 

Well almost all of those same girls return today for a second shot at the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class C championships and now they know exactly what to expect. 

“The first time you do anything is always nervewracking,” Frewsburg head coach Sierra Beaver said about heading back to states after the Far West Regional win. “Last year we got there and you walk out onto that court and there's all the cameras there and it's tough mentally to not get nervous. This time I think we'll be a little bit more calm, we know what to expect and we've been scouting the teams that we think will make it through.”  

In the 2024 semifinal, Frewsburg was outscored 16-7 in the second quarter and trailed 30-21 at halftime. That uncharacteristically slow quarter proved to be the demise of the Bears even after a strong final period as they lost 54-51.

Frewsburg sophomore Jadyn Trocki returns to the NYSPHSAA Class C state championships tonight against Section I's Tuckahoe at Hudson Valley CC.

“We talk about all the time that 10 points don't mean anything,” Beaver said about the mindset returning to states. “Continuing to try and win every quarter and continuing to make adjustments every quarter so we come out on top.”

However, this year the Bears come into tonight's Class C state semifinal at 7:45 at Hudson Valley Community College against Section I's Tuckahoe battle tested and ready for everything that comes with playing on the big stage.

“We're excited to be back at the final four again this year,” Beaver added. “We're hoping to come out to play with a lot of intensity and do whatever we can to get into the finals.”

Frewsburg enters the tournament as the No. 2 team in the state and it's for good reason having spent plenty of the year in the top spot. The Bears have a balanced attack which could see up to five different girls even score double digits and is provided at multiple levels. 

“We always talk about if we're a one-dimensional team we're easier to defend,” Beaver said about the Frewsburg offense after clinching a spot at states. “We pride ourselves on having a lot of people that can score all the time. It's hard to stop five people that can score in double-figures, so when you don't know who to guard, that makes things tough and that's our goal.”

The main cog to Frewsburg's offense is sophomore Jadyn Trocki, who averages 17.7 points per game and picks up 6.5 assists per game as she makes sure her opponents have to worry about everyone on the floor. 

When Jadyn Trocki is heating up from beyond the arc she is often joined by her sharpshooting sister Teghan Trocki who averages 11.5 per game, including 74 3-pointers this season. 

“Jadyn always does a great job finding people,” Beaver said about the Trocki sisters after the Far West Regional victory. “She's really good at beating her defender, making somebody step up and then being able to dish for a shot in the corner and her sister is a counterpart to that. She (Teghan) is the one who can knock down shots from anywhere and when we get her going it's pretty hard to stop us.”

Twin sisters Ava and Taytum Jimerson give Frewsburg another family threat on the floor that provides plenty of offense, but also are key pieces to a defense that limits opponents to 43.6 points per game this season. 

“They both are super important offensively and defensively,” Beaver said about the Trockis. “They do a good job talking and communicating on defense. Offensively they are kind of exact opposites, if they stop Jadyn then she kicks it out to Teghan and if they cover Teghan, Jadyn has a lane to drive it. While that's happening, Ava, Taytum and Abery are cutting to the basket too.”

The defense thrives on athleticism and both Jadyn Trocki and Taytum Jimerson find no trouble pickpocketing their opponents 4.6 and 3 steals per game, respectively. 

“Defense was our big focus coming into the year,” Beaver said about her team. “We thought defense was what kept us from getting into the final last year. … It's just about having good communication and having each other's backs and making sure we're playing good team defense all the time.”

After emerging late in the season last year as a sophomore, Harvey gives the Bears a formidable 1-2 punch on the glass with Ava Jimerson. Harvey averages 9.6 points per game and 4.3 rebounds per game, while Ava Jimerson provides 14 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. 

Then coming off the bench the Bears have several girls that can step in and make sure the tempo is not dropped and the defense does not miss a beat. 

“We talk all the time it takes five on the floor, but it takes people at practice working us all season long,” Beaver said about her team's depth. “If we get people in foul trouble we have multiple people who can come off the bench and not even notice a difference in the flow of the game.”

Tuckahoe also returns to the state final four after experiencing a similar trip last year in which the Tigers lost to eventual state champion Moravia of Section IV 54-42. 

The Tigers reached the state final four with a Section I Class C semifinal win against Keio Academy and then in the final they defeated Haldane 50-29. In their regional matchup, the Tigers dominated the Section IX champion Pine Plains Bombers 59-25.

“They're really fast,” Beaver said about Tuckahoe. “They play hard with intensity, they like to push the ball and they love to press all game long. It's important for us to protect the ball and prevent those turnovers.”

Sophomore Cara Doherty paced the Tigers in their regional matchup with a team-high 9 points, but Tuckahoe dominated with a complete team effort. Freshman Chloe Angello was also named All-Section team for Section I and is a player the Bears will have to focus on. 

If Frewsburg can reach the finals the Bears will either play the state's top-ranked Stillwater out of Section II or Section III's Cooperstown, which is ranked No. 3 in Class C. 

“Watching a little film on both of them,” Beaver said about Stillwater and Cooperstown. “I think both are really good, Cooperstown is a little younger and Stillwater I think is very well rounded with five as a threat to score. Both of those teams do a nice job of playing defense.”

Stillwater is having the best season in program history, capturing its first Section II title and then winning against Section X's Lisbon Central last week to advance to the program's first state semifinals. 

The Warriors overcame the odds in their sectional final when they beat Greenwich, which has delivered Stillwater its only two losses this season and both by a 20-point margin. Stillwater won the third meeting 49-42 and then reached states with the 49-45 win over Lisbon Central. 

Cooperstown is the only team in the remaining field of four that has won the Class C state championship, claiming the title a decade ago against Section VIII's Northern Adirondack 59-34.

Cooperstown is led by seventh-grader Emma Johnson scoring 14.2 points and 6.4 rebounds per game with 58 triples on the year; senior Brenna Seamon averages 10.1 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3 assists and 4.3 steals per game.

The final four Class C teams are all formidable opponents, but the Bears will come in battle tested after going through a grueling nonleague schedule which included victories over teams heading to states today in even higher classes. The Bears defeated the Madison Francis-led Lancaster Legends 68-43 who are representing Section VI in Class AAA, they also defeated Section VI Class A champion Williamsville South 82-71 and even took on 2024 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class 5A runnerup Cathedral Prep in two close contests. 

“We tried hard to make nonleague schedule really difficult,” Beaver said. “From top to bottom we had a good schedule planned for us against different styles of basketball. We had to guard people fast and tall, but also teams to prepare us for the whole 32 minutes.”

With Section IV's Moravia falling in its sectional playoffs this season, one thing is for certain that there will be a new state champion crowned by Friday evening and all teams have that chance starting tonight at 6 with Stillwater and Cooperstown at Hudson Valley Community College.

Spencer Miller, right, was presented on Monday with the Missouri Park and Recreation Association Sports Section Outstanding Official Award for 2025 by Kristy McLain, recreation and aquatic supervisor at Maryville Parks and Recreation, who wrote the nomination letter.

MARYVILLE, Mo. — Umpire Spencer Miller was honored last month with the Missouri Park and Recreation Association Sport Section Outstanding Official Award for 2025.

Each year the organization recognizes one person from across the state for outstanding service to the community and modeling positive behavior through their work as a sports official.

Miller has umpired softball games for Maryville Parks and Recreation for 10 years. Across his more than 1,000 games, Miller is known for his fairness, consistency and composure under pressure, according to the nomination letter.

Miller was presented with the award during Monday's parks board meeting. He said he was honored by the award, and used the opportunity to implore more people to officiate youth sports.

“I'm concerned about the shortage of officials that we have available,” he said. “It is a serious problem.”

The ongoing shortage for recreational and competitive youth sports has only gotten worse in recent years. In 2023, the Missouri State High School Activities Association said that the number of high school officials alone had dropped by more than 1,200 since 2013 — plummeting about 15 percent over a decade. And as the number of officials continues to shrink, schools have been forced to rethink when games can be played in order to ensure there are officials to work them.

“The fact of the matter is there are no perfect officials,” Miller said. “I've missed my calls and others have as well. But what I'm concerned about is that we need to be working on developing that next generation of officials.”

One of the chief issues, whether it's in school sponsored sports or community recreation leagues, is the age of officials. According to MSHSAA, the average age of its officials last year was 55.

“So I think we need to be encouraging younger kids to consider this as an option, and then provide opportunities for that,” said Miller, 77.

His own kids, he said, didn't want to do it for the same reason so many don't: constant abuse from adults.

“I think we need to provide an atmosphere that's conducive to the development of these officials,” Miller said. “There is nothing that will break an aspiring official's spirit faster than people that are nitpicking and giving a lot of lip from the stands.”

MPR Director Jeff Stubblefield, who was an official for youth sports for more than 25 years, said the same to the board.

“All of you who are parents that have had kids (play), you've seen the abuse that officials take,” he said.

Stubblefield, who served as president of the statewide park and recreation association last year, said the organization continues to support legislation like Missouri House Bill 295 that would increase penalties for assaulting a sports official — a growing problem across the state.

Miller, though, said he isn't deterred and is signed up to do at least one more season.

Mar 20, 2025

Jaekairah Harden of Loyalsock dives to the floor as Kennedy Heyer of Towanda reaches for the ball in Montgomery. Loyalsock won 52-20. 
DAVE KENNEDY/Sun-Gazette

When he coached the San Francisco 49ERS, legendary coach Bill Walsh posted a sign upon the wall and each player signed it, pledging they would never be out hit during a game.

Loyalsock coach Curtis Jacobson felt a similar vibe when he became Loyalsock's coach in 2016. There is no sign and no signatures required but the message is the same each season. Loyalsock continues committing itself to never being outworked.

That determined work ethic and unrelenting desire has established Loyalsock as one of Class AAA's premier programs. And those qualities which go beyond statistics have again earned it a Final 4 appearance. The Lancers (28-2) play Imhotep in Friday's state semifinals at Parkland High School after thumping Dunmore, 60-36 in last Friday's quarterfinals.

“I've always said nobody should ever play harder than Loyalsock. That is something you can control,” Jacobson said. “Years ago when we started you look at teams like Dunmore and Mount Carmel that beat us. You try and match those teams that have been there and done it. Why did we put the Dunmore's of the world on our schedule five years ago? To get ourselves exposed to what it takes. It's just not acceptable for someone to compete a higher level than you're playing.”

There are game aspects players and/or teams cannot control. Effort is something which each player always can control. Loyalsock might not win every game but it does its best to make sure it is never defeated.

It is about emptying their collective tanks in pursuit of victory as much as it is about winning itself. Loyalsock has the bumps and bruises to show that it has put fourth spirited efforts throughout the season. Whether fighting through injuries, illnesses or tough opponents, Loyalsock has kept moving forward.

It takes not just excellent talent to reach this point but a lot of heart, too. Loyalsock has revealed its heart beats mighty strong the last nine years, reaching states each time, and especially this season. Along the way, the Lancers have captured a district championship and set a program record for wins.

“It's really hard. At practice all our teammates push each other and help everyone get better,” point guard Jaekairah Harden said. “They give us the motivation to keep going.”

“The gutsiness of their mentality stands out. They care for each other and they do it for each other,” Jacobson said. “They don't want anything to be their last game. They want to come to practice, they want to keep going. I've had lots of really, really great teams but it's the gutsiest team I've ever had.”

That says a lot because Jacobson and his staffs have had some terrific teams, including ones which have won at least 18 games the past nine seasons. Each of those teams has laid more bricks in the foundation and Loyalsock has continued growing stronger, its house adding more levels nearly every year.

A standard has been set as well as an example. Those are built on sacrifice and toughness. That includes the offseason, practices and the games themselves. Loyalsock has passed those tests this season, rallying against 5A state semifinalist when it trailed by 19 and tying the game late before losing at the buzzer.

The Lancers overcame an injury to Julie Ellis and a seven-point second half deficit at Jersey Shore when the entire school was there to watch and cheer against them, winning 56-51. Loyalsock then thundered back from an 11-point third quarter hole to defeat Hughesville for the district championship before smoothly navigating turbulence against West Catholic and Dunmore to win those last two state tournament games in impressive fashion.

“We talk a lot about being mentally tough. Honestly, we know physically we can handle the games and we've played 30 this season,” senior Julie Ellis said. “We've been doing this all season but it's mentally what these games really are. It's staying locked in throughout the turnovers or mistakes, and just staying with the game.”

Following last season's run, Loyalsock possessed strong potential entering this year. But that's all it was. Success is not based on past results. Once one season ends, each team starts back at the bottom and works its way up.

So, while Loyalsock retained experienced, quality players nothing was guaranteed. Everything must be earned the hard way and Loyalsock again has turned its hard work into tremendous results. Each player has battled some kind of obstacle this season, but watch Loyalsock play, and one really never can tell.

Loyalsock has built success upon its will as much as its skill. The work continues leading up to Friday and the fight goes on. It's another game and another opportunity for Loyalsock to showcase its drive.

“It's their toughness, I can see them wincing in pain and limping down the court and then they go and dive on the court and get a loose ball or a rebound,” Jacobson said. “They don't let anything get in their way of being so determined. It's really a pleasure to coach them. We can talk about how good they are and how talented they are but it's a real pleasure to coach girls that just want to get after it like that.”

Lucas Byrd, who won a Big Ten championship at 133 pounds, is one of eight Illini wrestlers who will compete in this week's NCAA championships at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.

Eight Illinois wrestlers will compete at the NCAA Championships in Philadelphia starting on Thursday. Lucas Byrd enters the biggest individual event of the season as a

Big Ten champion at 133 pounds, joined by Illini teammates Danny Pucino (141),

Kannon Webster (149), Braeden Scoles (165), Danny Braunagel (174), Edmond Ruth (184), Zac Braunagel (197) and Luke Luffman (285). Joey Wright caught up with Illinois coach Mike Poeta as Illinois put together its final preparations for the weekend:

“We've got guys that I have a lot of trust in. All eight guys, I think they can beat anybody that they step on the mat against. And it's exciting to bring a full team as opposed to the past few years where it's been three, four guys. They're all supporting each other and they're all helping each other, so it's nice, this big group.”

“It really boosted his confidence. His pin in the Big Ten finals was like an epic Illinois wrestling moment that I think will live on for a very long time. Anytime you're showing highlights of Illinois wrestling on ESPN or the Big Ten Network, that clip of him getting that pin in the Big Ten finals will absolutely be on it. And Lucas, he feeds off that excitement, that energy, that pressure of being the one seed at this tournament. There's a little more of a target on you, but that's what he wants. He's asking for it.”

“Kannon had probably the biggest win of his career so far. Hopefully, we add to the list this weekend, but the Penn State kid that he beat in the semifinals is like a world-class guy. And for a freshman to have the (courage) to go out there and beat someone that's an upperclassman and has that much of a pedigree, is just a testament that shows just how tough he is, how good at wrestling he is and how mentally tough he is.”

“He took sixth at the Big Tens and he's a No. 8 seed at the national tournament, so that shows how tough the Big Tens were, especially at heavyweight. But Luke has done everything right. He's grown so much over the years. I'd say his mental toughness has just grown and grown and grown. I think it's at a place right now for him to do really well. It's at a place where I think he's really starting to recognize that he can be and he should be an All-American.”

“We have a team of guys that are obsessed with wrestling. They live and breathe this sport, and I have all the trust in the world in them. So, the past couple of weeks was a lot of training kind of on their own. We had a set practice time, but everybody came in and they did their own thing because they're adults, they're professionals, and all it is is about keeping your body healthy, your mind healthy and happy, and then feeling good for this weekend. Really no grind to it. Guys just kind of had a lot of autonomy, and that's what we did leading up to the Big Ten. It seemed like a good recipe.”

Over the past several years, sports betting across the country and in Colorado has exploded in popularity, and with March Madness finally here, everyone is trying to pick the underdog they can win big on.

Monarch Casino Resort Spa is one place where they've seen a lot more people gambling on the games and watching them too.

Erica Ferris, the director of casino marketing at Monarch Casino Resort Spa said March Madness is the busiest time of the year for them. Plus, any time big games are happening in Denver, they always see more people coming in and filling the sportsbook.

""This is such an exciting time of year. We know that we're going to get lots of folks coming up to our sportsbook and it will be full of people watching games,"" said Ferris.

This year's March Madness betting also comes as Colorado sports fans have been betting on sports at a record-setting pace.

Colorado legalized sports betting in 2020 and now, 38 states have legalized sports betting in some form. It's gained a lot of popularity in recent years, including in Colorado. According to the state's Department of Revenue, Coloradans bet on sports at a record-breaking pace in January, resulting in $4.4 million in sports betting taxes collected.

""Colorado, it has a vibrant sports betting and it's really showing that Coloradans are interested in really getting and grasping on to sports betting, and the excitement that it can bring along with the game,"" said Ferris. ""It is an exciting time in sports betting. So, as it becomes more popular and people become more knowledgeable in what they're doing, the betters we're seeing are smarter. They're doing more bets at a wider variety.""

While most sports betters are men, Ferris says the casino has also seen a lot more people betting on women's sports, including female and male betters. She added this comes as the WNBA and women's college hoops have gained popularity in recent years.

""We are excited, not only this year, about the men's tournament, but also the women's tournament. It's a very exciting time during this great resurgence of women's sports,"" said Ferris.

Monarch Casino Resort Spa also offers a hotel spa, plus five restaurants, one of which is located next to the sportsbook where guests can enjoy a bite to eat while watching the game.

""This weekend can be not just for sports, but also for a little bit of relaxation. So, make sure to make reservations,"" said Ferris.

Above: Dawson-Boyd's Drew Hjelmeland cuts down a piece of the net after the Blackjacks' 3A title win over Hills-Beaver Creek on Thursday in Marshall. The Blackjacks will take on Heritage Christian Academy in the Class A quarterfinals at the Target Center in Minneapolis today at 3 p.m.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Dawson-Boyd boys basketball team makes its first state tournament appearance of the 21st century today as the No. 2 seed in the Class A tournament. The Blackjacks earned the No. 2 seed in the tournament and will take on No. 7 Heritage Christian Academy in the Target Center.

“[I told the players that] the venue is changing, but everything else about it is not,” Dawson-Boyd head coach Cory Larson said. “It's very similar to when you go from playing games in your high school gyms to having to move to SMSU [Southwest Minnesota State University]… The crowd just makes it feel different. Certainly, the space of the Target Center makes them feel different that way.

“It's a basketball game that's still 36 minutes long. Dimensions of the court, the hoops, all that stuff to go Hoosiers on you a little bit, you've just got to remember it's just a basketball game. Year, you're now at the pinnacle of high school basketball in Minnesota, so be able to control your emotions, go and showcase your talents, play hard, play together and let's go see what happens.”

Entering the tournament, the Blackjacks are 27-3 on the season and are riding a 17-game win streak since they lost to third-ranked Dell Rapids St. Mary (S.D.) on Jan. 18. 

Dawson-Boyd's only other losses this season came against No. 1 Cherry 70-64 and Class AA No. 1 Albany 74-53. They've also picked up ranked wins over No. 4 Nevis, No. 9 Hills-Beaver Creek and Class AA No. 9 Montevideo.

To reach state, the Blackjacks overcame a 13-point first-half deficit to defeat Hills-Beaver Creek 59-52 behind Brayson Boike's 19 points, Drew Hjelmeland's 17 and Gunner Liebl's 10 points and seven assists. 

Prior to today's tip-off, Dawson-Boyd had one other state appearance in 1991. Dawson High School also appeared in the 1949 state tournament before the tournament was separated by class size.

“I'm definitely happy for these guys because they've worked so hard,” Larson said. “The amount of time that they've put into the game, and then to get it to pay off so that they're now getting to play in a state tournament, it's certainly very rewarding for them as players and for me as a coach.”

Heritage Christian earned its way to the state tournament with a 24-5 record. The Eagles started the season with a 6-3 record but closed the year on an eight-game win streak. Still, they are 0-2 against top-10 opponents after losing 77-62 to No. 4 Nevis on Dec. 28 and Iowa Class AA No. 1 Western Christian on Dec. 13.

The Eagles were given the No. 2 seed in their section tournament but no opponents played them tight; Heritage Christian defeated No. 10 West Lutheran 76-46 in the quarterfinals, No. 3 Avail Academy 76-52 in the semifinals and top-seeded Liberty Classical Academy 93-72 in the section championship.

Heritage Christian also earned a berth in last year's state tournament and went home to Maple Grove with a fifth-place trophy after defeating Russell-Tyler-Ruthton by a point, 63-62, in the consolation championship. Abu Tarawallie was fouled with two seconds remaining in regulation and made one of the shots to give the Eagles the narrow victory.

“I think any team that you face is going to present challenges. So yeah, certainly the success they had last year making it to the state tournament as you move into the state tournament for the second year in a row,” Larson said.

The Eagles return each of their top 7 players in minutes from last year's state tournament run. Owen Haag and Joshua Sokeye have led the team with 18 and 16 points per game, respectively, while Tarawallie has added another 14.7 Aaron Palmer and Jonah Moulton also average double figures while Sokeye has grabbed 11.6 rebounds per game and dished out 4.2 assists per game.

As a group, the Eagles have shot 46% from the field and 31% from 3-point range this year. As such, Larson said the Blackjacks will be putting a premium on defensive effort, specifically in their ability to get in transition and rebound well.

Today's quarterfinal game can be streamed on NSPN.TV. Tickets must be purchased online and ara available on mshsl.org/tickets, with admission costing $22 for adults and $14 for students.

After months of uncertainty, the Boston Celtics have reportedly found a new owner. The team's current ownership group, the Grousbeck family, has reportedly agreed to sell the franchise to a group led by Bill Chisholm, co-founder of Symphony Technology Group, per ESPN's Shams Charania.

The team will reportedly be bought for $6.1 billion, a record for a North American sports franchise.

The Washington Commanders held the previous record after being sold to Josh Harris for $6.05 billion in 2023.

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

The news comes nine months after Celtics majority owner Wyc Grousbeck announced he was looking to sell the team. Grousbeck made that announcement just weeks after the Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks to win the 2024 NBA Finals.

Grousbeck, with the assistance of an investment group, purchased the team for $360 million in 2002. Under his guidance, the Celtics won two championships and appeared in the NBA Finals four times. As of October 2024, Forbes valued the franchise at $6 billion, the highest total among all NBA teams. That valuation wasn't far off based on Thursday's reported agreement.

Chisholm co-founded Symphony Technology Group in 2002 and serves as its managing partner and chief investment officer. Symphony Technology Group is a private equity firm that manages ""data, software and analytics ventures,"" per its website.

Prior to co-founding the business, Chisholm worked at The Valent Group, a risk-management company; Bain & Company, a consulting firm; and PaineWebber, Inc., a bank and stock brokerage firm.

Chisholm received his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and his MBA from The Wharton School.

Chisholm's group was one of at least four in the running to buy the Celtics, per Sportico. Those groups were reportedly required to submit revised offers for the Celtics on March 14. The Grousbeck family didn't waste much time debating those offers, opting to go with Chisholm's group less than a week after that deadline.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Netflix is hosting a Willy Wonka-inspired competition TV show!

The streamer announced The Golden Ticket, inspired by the Wonka universe, and casting is now underway.

Here's a synopsis: ""Lucky contestants will have the chance to enter Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but there's a catch—only players who find a coveted golden ticket will gain entry to the factory. But a golden ticket doesn't guarantee a sweet ride once the gates open; only those who can adapt, strategize, and withstand the unknown will make it through. Set inside a retro-futuristic dreamscape, this high-stakes social experiment will challenge players not just physically, but mentally as they navigate games, tests, and temptations designed to probe their instincts, resilience, and ability to thrive in chaos.""

The drama series will be available to stream in American Sign Language, Max announced on Wednesday.

The ASL versions of The Last of Us will be performed by CODA star Daniel Durant and Leila Hanaumi.

This makes Max the first streaming service to offer ASL versions of a major series alongside its premiere episode. It is also the first time original HBO programming will be available to stream in ASL on the platform.

Max previously offered ASL versions of several Warner Bros. movies, including Barbie, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.

“We are thrilled to expand our ASL program and debut our first HBO Original series in ASL with The Last of Us,” Naomi Waibel, SVP of global product management at Warner Bros. Discovery, said. “This debut brings the show to life in an authentic and fully accessible way for Deaf audiences and is another meaningful step towards our goal of offering an inclusive streaming experience.”

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey return as Joel and Ellie in season 2 of The Last of Us. Set five years after the first season, ""Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind,"" according to season 2's official logline.

Frank Ferrer has left Guns N' Roses (GNR).

The 58-year-old drummer has left the legendary rock band after 19 years, with the group insisting that the split is ""amicable"".

In a statement posted on social media, they said: ""The band thanks Frank for his friendship, creativity and sturdy presence over the past 19 years, and wish him success in the next chapter of his musical journey.

""Frank first joined GNR during a show in June 2006 helping anchor the rhythm section during subsequent tours, including their recent outings featuring the reunited trio of Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan. His last show with the band took place Nov 5, 2023, in Mexico.""

Frank joined the band back in 2006, when he replaced Bryan Mantia. Guns N' Roses' previous drummers also include the likes of Rob Gardner, Steven Adler, Matt Sorum and Josh Freese.

The band are set to begin their world tour in May, but the group have yet to confirm who will replace Frank in the band.

Meanwhile, Frank previously revealed that he made a conscious effort to recreate the sounds of the group's former drummers.

He told KKDM: ""I really had to work hard to make sure I was able to represent Adler's feel, Matt Sorum's feel and [Bryan's] feel of the Chinese Democracy [era].""

Frank loved joining the band — but he admitted that it was a ""challenge"" too.

He said: ""That was the toughest challenge — finding all three eras of Guns N' Roses and bringing them together to one cohesive way of playing their material.""

Sia — who was married to Erik Anders Lang between 2014 and 2016 — shared: ""They are both finding it pretty difficult, one more so than the other.

""But they're both doing things that are really good for them right now, that are really helpful. They're really doing a lot of educational stuff that's good for them.""

A French scientist was denied entry to the US after immigration officials found text messages that were critical of Donald Trump, the Guardian reported. According to a diplomatic source, the incident unfolded on March 9, when the French space researcher was barred from entering the United States upon arrival in Texas, where he was scheduled to attend a conference near Houston.

Upon arrival in Texas, the researcher was subjected to a random check, which included a search of his work computer and personal phone. US Customs and Border Protection officials found messages on his devices that were critical of the Trump administration's policies on research funding and scientific priorities, describing them as ""hateful and conspiratorial"" and potentially linked to terrorism.

The researcher's equipment was confiscated, and he was put on a plane back to Europe the following day. The French government has strongly condemned the incident, highlighting the growing tensions between the two nations. 

""This measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher's phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policy,"" Philippe Baptiste, France's minister of higher education and research, said in a statement to AFP, published by French newspaper Le Monde.

""Freedom of opinion, free research, and academic freedom are values ​​that we will continue to proudly uphold. I will defend the right of all French researchers to be faithful to them, while respecting the law,"" the minister added.

Meanwhile, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged the US's sovereign right to decide who enters its country, while also expressing disappointment over the situation. The ministry emphasised France's commitment to academic and scientific cooperation, as well as its desire to promote freedom of expression. 

Notably, Donald Trump's administration has made significant changes to scientific research funding since taking office in January. One major change is the capping of indirect costs for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants at 15%. This move has been met with opposition, as it would cut billions of dollars in funding for life-saving research.

The United States this year fell to its lowest-ever place on the World Happiness Report, an annual survey published on International Day of Happiness. The 2025 report highlights the positive effects benevolence and social connections have on people's life satisfaction.

Finland remained the happiest nation for the eighth year in a row, while Mexico and Costa Rico ranked among the top 10 for the first time since the report was first published in 2012. 

This year's report ranks 147 countries by their happiness levels — based on a population's average assessment of their quality of life from 2022 to 2024. Data from the Gallup World Poll, which asks respondents to evaluate their current life, is the primary source for the annual happiness rankings.

Researchers found that the belief in the kindness of others, as well as actively caring about and sharing with others, has strong effects on happiness, according to the report.

""Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,"" Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, said in a statement.

The U.S. ranked 24th in the world, one place lower than its 2024 ranking. America previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.

One factor highlighted in the report was the increasing number of people who eat alone.

""In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day — an increase of 53% since 2003,"" the report said. ""Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group, but especially for young people.""

Data reviewed for the report indicates major differences in the rates of meal-sharing around the world, with sharing meals having a positive effect on wellbeing.

Another factor contributing to America's drop in the rankings, as well as the rankings of some European countries, was ""the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system,'"" the report said.

""The country-wide evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and the United States,"" the authors wrote.

A key reason for the rise in Mexico and Costa Rica's rankings appeared to be family household size.

""Latin American societies, characterized by larger household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing,"" the report said. 

The report compared Mexico to European countries, explaining that even though it is poorer, ""larger households imply a potential advantage to build positive social interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance the differences in income with Europe.""

In Europe, 23% of households were single-person, while in Mexico, only 11% were single-person, according to data cited in the report. 

""In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is reported by people who live in households with four to five members,"" the authors wrote. ""We also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as households with six or seven members.""

The Gallup World Poll asked people in 2019 if they thought others would return a lost wallet, and found that ""people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of others.""

""When wallets were dropped in the street by researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than people expected,"" the report said.

The belief that others would return the lost wallets also contributed to a country's ranking.

The Nordic nations, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ranked in the top 10 countries and were among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the report said.

""The wallet data are so convincing because they confirm that people are much happier living where they think people care about each other,"" John F. Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the World Happiness Report, said in a statement.

Additionally, the researchers found that globally, benevolent acts were 10% more frequent in 2024 than in 2017-2019.

By Deborah Castellano Lubov

Syria remains among the world's most disastrous humanitarian crises.

This was at the forefront of a recent report of the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, which brought to light the ongoing catastrophe. It was released on 18 March - 100 days after Syria's long-term President Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship abruptly collapsed on 8 December after decades of his family reigning.

Reflecting on the suffering in the tried Middle Eastern nation, UNICEF decried that 16.7 million people, including 7.5 million children, are in need in the embattled nation.

Moreover, it noted that over 7.4 million people are internally displaced, with more than half being children.

Detailing horrors facing children, the agency highlighted that over 7.5 million children in Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance and that all children are facing some form of psychosocial distress.

At least 5 million children are threatened by unexploded ordnances and UNICEF lamented that estimates show nearly 300,000 unexploded devices are scattered throughout Syria. 

In a country where 14.9 million people need healthcare assistance, the UN Children's Fund reported 500,000 children are malnourished, and 2 million children have no access to adequate nutrition. 

At this time, nearly 2.5 million children are out of school, and more than 1 million children risk dropping out.

Moreover, the UN organization added, 7.2 million children need educational support, and 1 in 3 schools is unusable because it has been destroyed, damaged, or used as a shelter for displaced persons.

Access to essential services and providing for basic needs also leaves much to be desired, UNICEF explained, drawing attention to the inadequacy of water and sanitation services.

Estimates, it continued, show that nine out of ten people in Syria live below the poverty line, one in four are unemployed, and roughly two in three people live in extreme poverty.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's federal police have raided the homes in Rio de Janeiro of suspects behind the smuggling of 2,000 assault rifles from Miami for a criminal organization in the city. Police said they carried out 14 search and seizure warrants in Rio de Janeiro but did not specify how many individuals were targeted. One man was arrested after shooting at an officer when police attempted to enter his home for the search. Thursday's operation stemmed from the 2017 seizure of 60 pieces of firearms at Rio de Janeiro's international airport. Police said the investigation identified the group's leader. Suspects could face charges such as international gun trafficking, belonging to a criminal organization, money laundering, currency evasion and corruption.

LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S.

The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.

Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction.

The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of England's main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 .

However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the bank's 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes.

“There's a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment,"" said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. “We still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we've held them at 4.5% today.”



If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the bank's latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.

Bailey said rate-setters will be “looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving” and that whatever happens, ""it's our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.

The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economy's growth performance has been notably below its long-run average.

Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses.

Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth.

Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards.

“But beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor,” said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.

Two goals in two minutes helped Australia secure a 5-1 thrashing of Indonesia to inch closer to World Cup qualification as Dutch legend Patrick Kluivert was well beaten in his first game in charge.

Indonesia missed an early penalty before a Martin Boyle spot-kick and a Nishan Velupillay strike during a frantic opening 20 minutes did the damage at Sydney Football Stadium.

A brace from Jackson Irvine and another by Lewis Miller sealed the win.

“The result today was very important and the fact that we did it with five goals, really pleased,” said man-of-the-match Irvine.

Australian skipper Mat Ryan was not entirely satisfied.

“I think the scoreline flatters us a little bit, to be honest,” the goalkeeper said. “At the start of the game they had two big chances, and if they put one of them away, it could have been a different game.

“But momentum is an important thing in sport, and we've kick-started that winning momentum now in an important [FIFA] window, and it's important we learn and get better.”

The win was a huge boost for Tony Popovic's men in the race to come second in Asian Group C behind runaway leaders Japan and automatically qualify for the 48-team tournament in North America next year.

Australia now have 10 points, four clear of Indonesia, with three games to play, including a crucial away fixture against China on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia and China, who meet later in Riyadh, both have six points, as do Bahrain, who clash with Japan in Saitama. Japan will book their place at the World Cup if they win.

Only the top two progress automatically, with the third and fourth forced into another round of Asian qualifying.

Defeat reinforced the scale of the task facing former Barcelona forward Kluivert, who was appointed in January after South Korea's Shin Tae-yong was sacked.

His side head home for a must-win showdown against Bahrain next week in their bid to reach the World Cup for the first time since independence in 1945.

Australia were without a handful of injured regulars, including Leicester defender Harry Souttar and Middlesbrough midfielder Riley McGree.

But they still got the job done against a team featuring 10 players born in the Netherlands and naturalised to play for Indonesia.

In a breathless start, Ryan pulled off a spectacular save to deny Jay Idzes's glancing header and minutes later Indonesia won a penalty when Kye Rowles took down Rafael Struick.

But Kevin Diks's spot-kick hit the post.

Ten minutes later, it was the Socceroos's turn when they were awarded a penalty after a VAR intervention and Hibernian striker Boyle made no mistake.

With momentum on their side, the hosts doubled their lead two minutes later when Adam Taggart found Velupillay, who calmly chipped in over advancing goalkeeper Maarten Paes.

Irvine made it 3-0 in the 34th minute, forcing a fine save from Paes but converting the rebound.

Both Miller and Irvine added to the tally in the second half from Craig Goodwin corners before Indonesia's Ole Romeny pulled one back late on.

Finland is named the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

📺 Los Angeles news 24/7: Watch NBC4 free wherever you are

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,"" said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. ""If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

News from around the country and around the globe

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Overall, researchers said global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at 8th. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at 6th and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness —the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking the 3rd from the bottom. 

In a concerning development, the study said 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.","{'href': 'https://www.nbclosangeles.com', 'title': 'NBC Los Angeles'}"

HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

Aino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.

“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. ""And I think it's because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It's clean and the air is fresh and what's there not to love?” 

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,"" said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. ""If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”



  Sharing meals and having somebody to count on
 

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Alexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.

“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other,"" Peth said. ""So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”

Overall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.



  The U.S. falls to its lowest-ever position in the happiness ranking
 

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom. 



  Almost one-fifth of young adults globally have no social support
 

In a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.

Jouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”

“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.

President Donald Trump said he has a ""very good relationship"" with India, but the ""only problem"" he has with the country is that it is ""one of the highest tariffing nations in the world."" Trump reiterated his threat to impose reciprocal US tariffs on the country starting April 2.

In an interview with Breitbart News, an American news, opinion, and commentary website, Trump discussed the US' relationship with India.

Asked about his summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, Trump said: ""I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest tariffing nations in the world. I believe they're going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us"".

On the India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor (IMEC), Trump said it was a ""group of wonderful nations"" banding together ""countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade."" ""We have a powerful group of partners in trade,"" Trump said.

""Again, we can't let those partners treat us badly, however, we do better in many ways frankly with our foes than we do with our friends...the ones that wouldn't be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly, like the European Union, which treats us terribly on trade. India and everybody would think of them as an ally,"" the US president said.

""I can say the same for others. But this is a group of wonderful nations that is countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade,"" he added.

Trump has repeatedly criticised the high tariffs charged by India. He has said that India is a very high tariff nation and reiterated that reciprocal tariffs on countries that impose levies on American goods will kick in on April 2.

In the past, Trump has called India ""tariff king"" and a ""big abuser"".

Last month, during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the White House, Trump had said that India has ""been very strong on tariffs"", and ""I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs."" Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal told a Parliamentary panel in New Delhi on March 10 that negotiations are still on and no agreement on trade tariffs has been reached so far between India and the US.

Trump has been criticising the high tariffs charged by India.

India had said it was looking at deepening trade ties with the US, including by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, under a bilateral trade agreement.

During Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US last month, both sides announced plans to negotiate a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA).

A major railway operator in Japan is set to build the world's first 3D-printed train station in just six hours.

The new Hatsushima Station will replace a weathered wooden structure with a modern, single-story building made of reinforced concrete. It will be located in the southern prefecture of Wakayama, 60 miles south of Osaka, West Japan Railway (JR West) said in a statement last week.

The new station will be a little less than 10-square-meter reinforced concrete construction. It will be 2.6 meters in height, 6.3 meters in width, and 2.1 meters in depth. Images of Arida City's famous oranges and tachiuo fish will adorn the walls as homage to the local life.

The structure will be created using a high-tech 3D printer, which will print the key building components, including the foundation. Once printed, the parts will be filled with concrete and delivered to the station site.

On-site, workers will use a crane to assemble and join the building parts. From taking down the old station to putting together the new one, the entire procedure will take only six hours to complete. On March 25, construction will start after the final train leaves and be completed before the first train arrives the next morning.



JR West chose Hatsushima Station for the project due to its seaside position, which allows the company to evaluate the building's resilience against exposure to salty air. To extend the project in the future, the company also intends to assess the expenses of building, upkeep, and management.

“The exterior design aims to create a station building that reflects the unique characteristics of the area and is loved by residents, contributing to regional coexistence,” the company said.

The new technology is also being explored as a possible solution to Japan's labour shortages in railway construction.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C.The Trump administration is framing a legal fight over flights deporting alleged gang members as a constitutional showdown pitting the vast power of the executive branch against a judiciary determined to thwart it.

 The clash with U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., which could be headed to the Supreme Court, has emerged as an early top test case for the president's sweeping assertions of executive authority.  The Trump administration has faced more than 100 lawsuits since it took office this year, and a string of injunctions and orders have paused or halted some of its priorities. This week, President Trump and his administration have singled out Boasberg as the face of its attacks on what it describes as activist, Democratic-appointed judges who are seeking to derail Trump's agenda and undermine his authority on critical issues such as immigration and national security.  A court filing Wednesday signed by Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accused the judge of “continued intrusions into the prerogatives of the Executive Branch.” Trump went so far as to call for Boasberg's impeachment on Tuesday, triggering a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday accused Boasberg of “undermining the will of the American public.” Boasberg has remained undeterred in demanding answers, in writing and under oath, from Trump officials about two weekend flights that deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members, despite his order that the airplanes turn around and return to U.S. soil. He was appointed to the bench by both a Republican and a Democrat—first to DC's Superior Court by George W. Bush before being tapped for the federal bench by former President Barack Obama. Police at El Salvador International Airport escort alleged Venezuelan gang members, deported by the U.S. government, to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador.Boasberg initially gave the Justice Department a Wednesday deadline to provide information about the flights, but extended that to Thursday so the department could determine whether it is invoking the “state secrets doctrine,” which allows the government to withhold information in litigation when disclosure would compromise national security. The Justice Department has largely stonewalled Boasberg's requests for information about when the deportation flights took off and who was on board. The department said those repeated demands represent “grave encroachments on core aspects of absolute and unreviewable Executive Branch authority relating to national security, foreign relations, and foreign policy,” according to Wednesday's brief. Boasberg rejected the notion that he is exceeding his authority, while pushing back at the government's characterization of his actions. “To begin, the Court seeks this information, not as a ‘micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expedition,' but to determine if the Government deliberately flouted its Orders issued on March 15, 2025, and, if so, what the consequences should be,” Boasberg wrote when he granted the extension. The standoff, which began Saturday, has quickly come to a head. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, challenged the president's move to invoke powers under the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport members of Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang The ACLU lawsuit said it is an abuse of emergency powers to accelerate mass deportations, sidestepping procedures and protections in immigration law. The Trump administration has asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's restraining order, a request that could end up with the Supreme Court.During an emergency hearing on Saturday, Boasberg issued a restraining order that temporarily blocked Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. He said his restraining order wasn't a final ruling on whether Trump's proclamation was lawful, but would preserve the status quo until he could consider the legality of Trump's move. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,” Boasberg said during the hearing. About 30 minutes later, Boasberg issued a written order that blocked deportation flights but made no mention of his directive to turn around flights. The Justice Department has argued that the written order is what matters, and that “the Court's earlier oral statements were not independently enforceable as injunctions.” Boasberg has yet to rule on that argument, but called it a “heck of a stretch” during a hearing on Monday. His order on Wednesday rejected the Justice Department's arguments that he should back off his demands for information until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has had a chance to weigh in. The Trump administration has asked that court to lift Boasberg's restraining order, and then reassign the lawsuit to another judge. The appeal will likely ultimately end up with the Supreme Court, where Trump has appointed three of the court's nine justices and where his administration hopes to find a majority sympathetic to his view of executive power. Asked about the administration's legal setbacks during a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Bondi said, “We're moving fast.

The standoff, which began Saturday, has quickly come to a head. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, challenged the president's move to invoke powers under the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport members of Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang

The ACLU lawsuit said it is an abuse of emergency powers to accelerate mass deportations, sidestepping procedures and protections in immigration law.

During an emergency hearing on Saturday, Boasberg issued a restraining order that temporarily blocked Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. He said his restraining order wasn't a final ruling on whether Trump's proclamation was lawful, but would preserve the status quo until he could consider the legality of Trump's move.

“Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,” Boasberg said during the hearing.

About 30 minutes later, Boasberg issued a written order that blocked deportation flights but made no mention of his directive to turn around flights. The Justice Department has argued that the written order is what matters, and that “the Court's earlier oral statements were not independently enforceable as injunctions.”

Boasberg has yet to rule on that argument, but called it a “heck of a stretch” during a hearing on Monday. His order on Wednesday rejected the Justice Department's arguments that he should back off his demands for information until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has had a chance to weigh in.

The Trump administration has asked that court to lift Boasberg's restraining order, and then reassign the lawsuit to another judge. The appeal will likely ultimately end up with the Supreme Court, where Trump has appointed three of the court's nine justices and where his administration hopes to find a majority sympathetic to his view of executive power.

Asked about the administration's legal setbacks during a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Bondi said, “We're moving fast. We will get to the Supreme Court as fast as we can, and we will prevail.”

 Valerie Montchalin found out who her friends were when she transitioned to being a transgender woman in her village high in the Massif Central of central France. 

 Some turned their backs on the 52-year-old builder. And she was not invited to the village get-together. 

 Everybody knows everybody and everything about them in Saint-Victor-Malescours, a village of 700 souls surrounded by wooded hills. 

 Montchalin kept her secret for decades. She knew she was different ""when I was six or seven... without being able to put a word on it. But if I had told my mother that I didn't feel right in my body, I would have got a good slap,"" she told AFP. 

 Her family were afraid of ""what people would say"". 

 So, growing up, ""I did what was expected of me,"" she said. She became a builder, married at 22 and had two children. As a man, she was ""gruff, pretty macho the opposite of what I really was,"" Montchalin admitted. 

 But she was ""suffering"" inside, the discomfort particularly acute in men's clothes shops or when she looked into a mirror at the barbers. Finally, at age 48, she came out to her wife and children. 

 Since then, Montchalin has moved to the nearest city, Saint-Etienne, where she is receiving hormone therapy. She has let her hair grow and regularly goes to the beautician. ""I am quite coquettish."" 

 Her workers were initially quite ""shocked"", but now they greet her with a kiss on the cheek. 

 Her transition was not a dramatic ""flag-waving one"", she says a feeling echoed by six other transgender people from rural areas who talked to AFP. 

 All told how they learned to deal with the isolation and odd looks and of having to travel for hours for medical attention. Being transgender in the French countryside can be a long and lonely path.

 Yet rarely have transgender people been more in the news. 

 On the one hand ""Emilia Perez"", a film about a transitioning Mexican drug lord, won two Oscars this month after triumphing at Cannes and the Golden Globes. 

 On the other, US President Donald Trump banned transgender people from the military and from women's sports and dressing rooms, a move quickly replicated elsewhere. 

 France has somewhere between 20,000 and 60,000 transgender people, according to official figures from 2022. 

 Despite a handful being elected as local councillors over the past five years, ""trans people are a long way from being well represented socially or politically,"" said Virginie Le Corre, a sociologist at the LinCS institute in Strasbourg. 

 Gynaecologist Maud Karinthi, who specialises in trans identity, said lots of patients she sees in her clinic in Clermont-Ferrand come from far-flung villages across the thinly populated centre of France. 

 As well as travel, transgender people in the countryside have to deal with ""isolation and rejection in their communities"", she said.

 ""You can't talk about it and there is no access to information,"" said Valentin, a 25-year-old trans man. 

 It was only when he was 18 that the penny dropped. ""I discovered the existence of transgender people on social media and that you could change your gender,"" he said. 

 ""I said to myself: 'That's my problem.'"" 

 ""It changed my life,"" said the entrepreneur, who asked AFP to alter his name for fear it may cause him trouble at work. 

 The dearth of support groups and role models outside towns and cities does not help, said sociologist Le Corre, adding that the school system ""has a lot of catching up to do"". 

 Twenty-nine-year-old Ines, who is non-binary and does not see herself in any gender, finds it ""very hard"" when people see her as a woman. 

 Despite working in tourism in a small ski resort in the Alps, they are afraid of coming out there for fear of ""not being understood"". 

 ""Non-binary isn't concrete for people,"" she said. 

 Getting surgery is still hard in rural areas ""with waiting lists counted in years , too little available treatment and what there is patchy geographically"", a 2022 French health ministry report found. 

 ""Where I grew up all we had was a doctor's surgery, and it was open only one day in four,"" said Isaac Douhet, a transgender man who had to travel two hours each way for genital surgery in Lyon. 

 Armelle, a 22-year-old transgender woman who works in a cheesemonger's, had a similar marathon, travelling four hours from her home in Aurillac to Clermont-Ferrand.

 In the countryside, ""you need to have real force of character to not be affected by how others see you,"" she said. 

 Douhet agrees. While his foster family and their neighbours ""were good"" about his transition, he was made to suffer at school. 

 ""People don't understand, they judge, they turn their back on you in the street and you will be insulted,"" he said. 

 He was once beaten up by other pupils. 

 Sarah Valroff, who is non-binary, calls themselves Saraph combining her birth name Sarah with the male moniker Raphael dresses in androgynous clothes and uses they/them/their pronouns. 

 But the 29-year-old business owner avoids ""dressing like a man"" when they go out in the country town of Ambert famous for its blue cheese or holding hands with their partner. 

 ""The smaller the place, the more those who are a bit different stand out,"" said researcher Le Corre. But it is often more ""generational than geographic"". 

 Several of those AFP talked to decided to quit the country for the city. Douhet moved to Clermont-Ferrand where he likes being ""lost in the crowd"" and where he can regularly drop in on a centre Dr Karinthi set up for women and trans people. 

 Armelle is also thinking of moving to the city to smooth her treatment and be ""more at ease"" in meeting other trans people.

 However, change is afoot in the countryside. ""There is a new, more open attitude with people moving out from the cities and groups are being set up,"" according to sociologist Le Corre. 

 There is ""a marked difference between young people who have grown up with the internet and those who were a bit closed in by their village,"" she added. 

 Trans people were also talking more openly and ""refusing to hide"". 

 Saraph has set up the podcast ""Queer Horizons"" that shines a light on rural queer life with the young in mind ""to be the adult I would love to have had during my childhood."" 

 Dermot Duchossois, a 23-year-old transgender man with the beginnings of a beard, loves his life in Pionsat, a village of 1,000, where he is a home help. 

 The only people who did not accept him were the managers of the supermarket he worked in before his transition. ""They would not allow me in the men's changing room even though it was awkward for me to be with girls in their underwear."" 

 But ""in my village I never felt I was being stared at when I began to change. I was really well accepted. Even old people asked how I was getting on.""

Ukraine struck a major Russian strategic bomber airfield on Thursday with drones, triggering a huge blast and fire about 700 km (435 miles) from the front lines of the war, Russian and Ukrainian officials said.

Videos verified by Reuters showed a huge blast spreading out from the airfield, wrecking nearby cottages. Russia's defence ministry said air defences had shot down 132 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions.

Other verified videos showed a giant plume of smoke rising into the dawn sky and an intense fire.

The base in Engels, which dates back to Soviet times, hosts Russia's Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers, known unofficially as White Swans.

Roman Busargin, governor of Saratov, said there had been a Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Engels that had left an airfield on fire, and that nearby residents had been evacuated. He did not specifically mention the Engels base, but it is the main airfield in the area.

Ukraine's defence ministry said its forces had struck the airfield and triggered secondary detonations of ammunition. Kyiv said Russia had used the Engels base to carry out strikes on Ukraine.

Ten people were injured in the attack, local officials said. Some local residents expressed surprise at finding various parts of Ukrainian drones in their gardens. The Shot Telegram channel said that Ukraine struck with PD-2 and Liutyi drones.

Engels district head Maxim Leonov said that a local state of emergency had been declared but gave few details. Reuters was unable to independently confirm what had taken place at the airfield.

Ukraine has conducted previous attacks on the Engels air base dating back to December 2022. In January it claimed to have struck an oil depot serving the base, causing a huge fire that took five days to put out.

A Ukrainian security source said at the time that a drone attack had struck a storage facility holding guided bombs and missiles at the Engels base.

The United Kingdom has reported its lowest average life evaluation, ranking 23rd in the world.  (Getty Image: Mike Kemp/In Pictures)

Australia has dropped out the top 10 in the latest list of the world's happiest countries. 

The World Happiness Report ranked Australia 11th and New Zealand 12th in the world, lagging behind Israel, Mexico and Nordic countries. 

Believing in the kindness of others is more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

Australia is no longer one of the top 10 happiest countries in world. 

The latest World Happiness Report ranks Australia 11th and New Zealand 12th in the world, lagging behind Israel, Mexico and some Nordic countries. 

Finland has taken out the title as the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row.

Other Nordic countries, including Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings. 

Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at 8th, while Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at 6th and 10th.

Australia made the last annual report top 10 but slipped one place to 11 in 2025, while Switzerland also dropped out of the top 10.

The annual report, which collects data from 2022-2024 but is published in 2025, is based on a single life evaluation question called the Cantril Ladder. 

The survey asks more than 100,000 people in 140 countries and territories to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a zero. 

The respondents are then asked to rate their own current lives on that scale.

The study, which was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, faced criticism from academics last year, who suggested the question makes people think more about power and wealth.

“The risk is that we are measuring a narrow, wealth and power-oriented form of well-being, rather than broader definitions of happiness,” PhD student August Nilsson wrote at the time.

The Lund University researcher said the ladder reflected people's income levels and social status to a larger degree than other well-being metrics.

When it comes to decreasing happiness , the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. 

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women, the subject of severe restrictions under the Taliban regime, saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking the 3rd from the bottom.

While Israel is in the top 10 for happiness, the State of Palestine is ranked 108th.

Researchers said sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size were the key factors for happiness. 

In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Texas becomes the third US state after Georgia and New York to formally recognise Holi (Photo:PTI)


	The Texas Senate has passed its first-ever resolution recognising Holi, officially acknowledging the Hindu festival of colours as a significant cultural celebration.


	With this move, Texas becomes the third US state after Georgia and New York to formally recognise Holi.


	The resolution was introduced by Senator Sarah Eckhardt and passed just ahead of Holi celebrations on March 14. It highlights Holi's cultural and spiritual significance, celebrating spring, renewal, unity, and the triumph of good over evil.


	""The origins of this jubilant festival can be traced back many millennia, and the holiday is recognised and celebrated throughout the world by people of all backgrounds who relate to the festival's themes of love, renewal, and progress,"" the resolution states.


	The Senate also emphasised Holi's role in strengthening community bonds and enriching Texas's cultural diversity.


	Consul General of India in Houston, DC Manjunath, told PTI, This is a proud and historic moment for Texas. The recognition of Holi by the State Senate affirms our commitment to diversity, unity, friendship, and cultural heritage. We thank Senator Sarah Eckhardt and all those who made this resolution possible. Holi's message of unity and renewal resonates across communities, and we are honoured to see it formally celebrated in our state.


	The resolution was supported by the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), which worked closely with Senator Eckhardt's office.


	HAF representatives and members of the Hindu American community were present in the Senate gallery during the reading.


	In a statement, HAF said, ""Texas Senate passes its FIRST-EVER Holi resolution! @SarahEckhardt TX makes history as Texas becomes the third state after Georgia and New York to recognise Holi, celebrating unity, colour, and the spirit of unity and friendship."" 
	The resolution marks a key milestone in recognising the growing cultural contributions of the Indian American community across Texas.

 New definition needed as spending caps eased 

 * 

 'Defence-relevant' items will qualify 

 * 

 But some countries want broader scope 

 By Jan Strupczewski 

 BRUSSELS, - When do state investments in arms factories, or the wages of tank crews and pilots not count as defence spending? Answer: When the EU rules say they don't. 

 Until a few days ago that was the case, with the bloc sticking to a narrow definition of spending on defence hardware. 

 On Thursday, EU leaders will study ways to mobilise hundreds of billions of euros to boost the military readiness of the bloc, which has hastily redefined what it classifies as defence spending. 

 The revamp, needed because of Russia's threats to its eastern flank and concern over the U.S.' commitment to European security, means the region's 27 national governments will get a four-year reprieve from EU deficit caps that will allow them to spend more on defence. 

 But while that spending - worth around 1.5% of Europe's total economy each year - will start to make up for decades of underinvestment in security, it can only be given the green light if everybody agrees on what defence spending actually means. 

 Before a rule change agreed by finance chiefs last week, the building of an ammunition plant was classified as construction rather than defence - something Poland discovered when it pressed ahead with a new 5 billion zloty factory. 

 Until now, the defence category was quite narrow, allowing EU governments to apply it only to already-delivered hardware - tanks, planes, guns - while excluding the costs of training, hiring and paying new tank crews, pilots and mechanics. 

 That will change as the EU broadens the category to include most things that are relevant to defence, including so-called ""dual-use"" goods that can be used by both the military and civilians. 

 These include stronger roads and bridges to support the passage of tanks, or the production of drones, helicopters, satellites, radars and underground shelters. 

 BORDERS? 

 The wider definition is more aligned with what NATO classifies as defence spending as part of a longstanding target for such expenditure to reach 2% of GDP. But it still leaves a lot of room for interpretation by national capitals. 

 ""The debate went already very broad and now, of course, what you're seeing is specific member states coming with their own specific ideas on what else should be considered as defence,"" one senior EU official said. 

 While Italy shares no borders with Russia, its arch-conservative government wants the wider definition to include what it spends on dealing with migrants coming from Northern Africa - a request that will not fly, EU officials said. 

 EU officials say border protection can be defined as ""defence"" only if it is refers to part of a military installation built to prevent an invasion, rather than normal border guard spending on patrolling the sea to catch boats carrying migrants. 

 Spain meanwhile has asked for climate change projects to be included in the defence category, an idea the Commission dismissed in the same way as it did migration-control spending. 

 While cyber security in general would not make the defence list, EU officials said, computers bought by the military to prevent cyber attacks would qualify. 

 ""The idea is that it has to be of defence relevance,"" a second senior EU official said.

Beijing's embassy in Ottawa said the executions were because of drug crimes and noted China does not recognise dual citizenship.

Thursday 20 March 2025 10:44, UK

China has executed four Canadians over the last few months, Canada's foreign affairs minister has said.

Melanie Joly said she and former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau asked for clemency in the case of the dual citizens, who were accused of drug-related charges.

Beijing's embassy in Ottawa said the executions were because of drug crimes and noted China does not recognise dual citizenship.

""We strongly condemn the executions,"" Ms Joly said. ""I asked personally for leniency ... They were all dual citizens.""

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said: ""China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes.

""The facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.""

China is thought to execute more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined - though the total number is a state secret.

Traditionally executions are carried out by gunshot, but lethal injections have been introduced in recent years.

The Chinese embassy spokesperson said Beijing ""fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned,"" and urged the Canadian government to ""stop making irresponsible remarks"".

Ms Joly said Canada consistently seeks clemency for Canadians facing the death penalty abroad.

The families of those executed asked the government to withhold their identities, she added.

Canada's global affairs spokesperson Charlotte MacLeod said Ottawa is continuing to ask for clemency for Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian who was sentenced to death for drug smuggling.

Amnesty International condemned the executions, saying China executed thousands of people in 2023.

""These shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,"" said Ketty Nivyabandi, the group's head for English-speaking Canada.

It comes after China imposed tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports earlier this month in retaliation for Canadian duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products in October.

Blowing foghorns and beating drums, thousands of Israelis on Wednesday took over the winding Jerusalem street outside the prime minister's residence to protest what they see as Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to weaken democracy.

""We've all been taken hostage by the government of blood,"" some chanted.

Others called for the long-serving Netanyahu to stand down, yelling: ""You're the head, you're to blame for this catastrophe"" -- a reference to the failure to prevent Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, which led to full-blown war in Gaza.

On Tuesday, Israel launched a series of deadly air strikes on the Palestinian territory after a nearly two-month ceasefire that largely halted violence and saw the handover of 33 Israeli hostages seized during the Hamas attack.

Among the banners held by protesters in Jerusalem were many calling on the government to end the war and return the hostages, with some reading: ""We are all hostages.""

Some relatives of the hostages still being held in Gaza also joined the protest, after expressing anger that the decision to resume strikes could ""sacrifice"" their loved ones.

Of the 251 hostages seized during the Hamas attack, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

""We want him to know that the most important issue is to get the hostages back,"" Nehama Krysler, 67, told AFP, explaining why she was protesting outside Netanyahu's house.

Arriving from across the country, protesters marched by foot the final ascent into Jerusalem early in the morning, first rallying outside the parliament, and then sitting down defiantly on the black asphalt as close as they could get to Netanyahu's residence.

A tense police force manned makeshift barricades around the protest, which grew throughout the day. 

By the afternoon police said that four protesters were arrested for ""attempting to break through the protest area fences"".

Wednesday's demonstration was organised by a broad conglomeration of anti-Netanyahu groups, who called to protest the premier's move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency.

Similar protests were widespread throughout the year leading up to October 2023.

At that time, the government had been attempting to reform the country's judicial branch, a move that was halted when the war broke out.

But it has returned to the government's agenda in recent weeks as attorney general and government legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, has contested some of Netanyahu's moves.

Justice Minister Yariv Levin has been clear about his intentions to remove Baharav-Miara from her position.

""They still want to change the judiciary because they want to do whatever they like without any limits,"" Raffi Lipkin, 76, from Tel Aviv said of Netanyahu's government.

""Our democracy is under threat from this government.""

Opposition leader and former prime minister Yair Lapid joined the protest, saying ""he had come to tell the world what is happening to our democracy.""

In a post on X on his way to the demonstration, Lapid said: ""This government is tearing us apart, it is dismantling us, it is an illegitimate government and we are taking to the streets."" 

Some of those demonstrating also accused Netanyahu of using the war against Hamas to distract from his personal troubles, including a series of criminal cases against him for which he is currently on trial.

""The protest is to stop this government from taking Israel on this awful path, to losing our democracy,"" said Eyal Ben-Reuven, 70, a former parliament member and vocal Netanyahu critic.

""This prime minister needs to go home, he has failed and by staying in power, he is hurting the country and its citizens,"" Ben-Reuven, a retired army general, told AFP.

Earlier, outside the parliament, 18-year-old Roni Sharon, a student from the city of Rehovot, told AFP that she had skipped school to join the protest.

""This is my country, and at this rate we won't have a country left -- not a democratic one. It will be a dictatorship,"" she said.

In the remnant rainforests of coastal far-north Queensland, bushwalkers may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a diminutive marsupial that's the last living representative of its family.

The musky rat-kangaroo (Hypsiprymnodon moschatus) weighs only 500 grams and looks a bit like a potoroo. It's part of a lineage that extends back to before kangaroos evolved their distinctive hopping gait.

Unlike their bigger relatives, muskies can be seen out and about during the day, foraging in the forest litter for fruits, fungi and invertebrates.

As the only living macropodoid (the group that includes kangaroos, wallabies, potoroos and bettongs) that doesn't hop, they can provide a crucial insight into how and when this iconic form of locomotion evolved in Australia.

Our study, published in Australian Mammalogy today, aimed to observe muskies in their native habitat in order to better understand how they move.

If we look around the world, hopping animals are quite rare. Hopping evolved once in macropodoids, four times in rodents, and probably once in an extinct group of South American marsupials known as argyrolagids.

In animals heavier than five kilograms, hopping is an incredibly efficient form of locomotion, in large part thanks to energy being stored in the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel.

However, the vast majority of animals that hop are really small. The only hopping animals with body masses over 500 grams are kangaroos. And Australia used to have a lot more kangaroo species, many of them quite large.

Despite the abundance of fossil kangaroos, we still don't really know why they evolved their hopping gait, especially given it only really becomes more efficient at body masses over five kilograms. Hypotheses range from predator escape, to energy preservation, to the opening of vegetation as Australia shifted to a drier climate.

Researchers looking at limb proportions have suggested that fossil kangaroos also hopped. But it's likely the ways that extinct roos moved were much more diverse than has previously been suggested.

Muskies are the last living member of the Hypsiprymnodontidae, a macropodoid family that branched off early in kangaroo evolution. For this reason, it is thought muskies may move in a similar way to early kangaroo ancestors.

Studies on kangaroo evolution will often mention locomotion in muskies, but only in passing. And only a single, brief, first-hand description of locomotor behaviour in muskies has actually been published, in 1982. The authors observed that muskies moved their hindlimbs together in a bound and that all four limbs were used, even at fast speeds.

So, we set out to answer the question: can H. moschatus hop? And if not, what form of locomotion does it use?

Using high-speed video recordings, we studied the sequence in which muskies place their four feet on the ground, and the relative timing and duration of each footfall.

Through this gait analysis, we determined that muskies predominantly use what is called a ""bound"" or ""half-bound"" gait. Bounding gaits are characterised by the hindfeet moving together in synchrony - just like when bipedal kangaroos hop. In the case of muskies, the forefeet (or ""hands"") also generally move together in close synchrony.

No other marsupial that moves on all fours is known to use this distinctive style of movement to the same extent as muskies. Rather, other species tend to use a combination of the half-bound and some form of galloping (the gait that horses, cats and dogs use) or hopping.

We were also able to confirm that tantalisingly brief observation from the 1980s: even when travelling at high speeds, muskies always use quadrupedal gaits, never rearing up on just their back legs.

They are, therefore, the only living kangaroo that doesn't hop.

Combined with further investigation of their anatomy, these observations help us get closer to understanding how and why kangaroos adopted their distinctive bipedal hopping behaviours.

These results also signal a potential pathway to how bipedal hopping evolved in kangaroos. Perhaps it started with an ancestor that moved about on all fours like other marsupials, such as brush-tail possums, then an animal that bounded like the muskies, and finally evolved into the iconic hopping kangaroos we see in Australia today.

However, we are no clearer on how the remarkable energy economy of kangaroo movement evolved, or why hopping kangaroos got so much bigger than hopping rodents.

The next part of the research needs to focus on that and will be informed by key fossil discoveries from early periods in kangaroo evolution.

Trump has derided the Department of Education as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology (Photo: Reuters)


	President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the shutdown of the U.S. Education Department, according to a White House official, advancing a campaign promise to eliminate an agency that's been a longtime target of conservatives.


	The official spoke on the condition of anonymity before an announcement.


	Trump has derided the Department of Education as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, finalising its dismantling is likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979.


	A White House fact sheet said the order would direct Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.


	The Trump adminstration has already been gutting the agency through layoffs and program cuts. The department is working to cut in half its workforce and reduce the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress.

Thursday 20 March 2025 09:31, UK

Chhaava, a 2025 Bollywood action film based on Hindu warrior Sambhaji who fought against the Muslim Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, has been blamed for inciting riots in the city of Nagpur.

In a speech in the Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis said: ""Chhaava has ignited people's anger against Aurangzeb. After the movie, people's emotions have been reignited. The anger against Aurangzeb is being exhibited in a big way. Still, everyone must keep Maharashtra peaceful.""

The 17th-century Muslim ruler is a loathed figure among Hindu nationalists, who accuse him of persecuting Hindus during his rule, though some historians say such stories are exaggerated.

In an election campaign for Maharashtra, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raked up the Muslim ruler and targeted the opposition Congress party for propagating Aurangzeb's ideas and considering him as a messiah.

Aurangzeb was buried in the city of Aurangabad in 1707, which was rechristened by the state government as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar city in 2022.

For months a communal rhetoric has been building up against the 17th-century ruler's tomb. Hindu leaders and right-wing organisations demand the tomb be destroyed or removed from the state.

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said the US refused to bury Osama bin Laden on its land and disposed of his body into the sea to prevent any kind of glorification. ""Why should we allow his glorification in our state? He is a blot on our history.""

On Monday a rally was held by hundreds of workers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal seeking the removal of the tomb during which effigies were burnt of the ruler.

Later in the day rumours circulated on social media that the Holy Quran was desecrated and things containing religious contents were burnt.

It led to communal clashes in various parts of the city that carried on late into the night. Appeals for peace by federal and state ministers lacked weight as leaders of the same parties had stoked communal tension for months with provocative speeches.

Curfew has been imposed in various parts of the city since then. The police have arrested 51 people and have begun criminal investigations against hundreds of unnamed individuals. Some 34 police personnel were also injured and several houses and vehicles were damaged during the violence.

India is now more polarised than before, with an ever-widening gap between the majority Hindus and minority Muslim population.

Over the last decade, fault lines have deepened and trust eroded between communities under Mr Modi's right-wing government.

Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, feel they have been targeted by right-wing mobs tacitly supported by the government.

Mr Modi has been criticised for his defining silence on the many instances of lynching of Muslim men for alleged trading in cow meat, Love Jihad - a conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of wooing Hindu women to force them to convert to Islam - and bulldozing of homes belonging to Muslims.

The prime minster has maintained he does not indulge in appeasement politics and his government is for every citizen of the country.

Website names it one of the best eight downtowns in the Maritimes

PICTOU – The mix of history, culture and unique shops earned Pictou a place on World Atlas' eight best downtowns in the Maritimes list.

World Atlas is a website that combines detailed maps of places across the globe with information such as the history, economics, and politics of different locations. The most recent list of best downtowns in the Maritimes included Pictou as well as Wolfville, Lunenburg, Amherst, and Annapolis Royal in N.S. They were joined by Shediac and St. Andrews in New Brunswick, and Summerside, P.E.I.

“Pictou's waterfront is a testament to Scottish heritage and maritime resilience,” reads the website.

“The Hector Heritage Quay commemorates the Hector, the ship that brought Nova Scotia's first Scottish settlers in 1773. The Northumberland Fisheries Museum highlights the region's deep connection to the sea and features a live lobster hatchery.

“Downtown Water Street is lined with independent boutiques and artisanal shops, including TABITHA + CO., known for its handcrafted leather goods.”



It goes on to mention the Grohmann Knives Factory Outlet. Terri Howard, originally from southern Ontario but who has lived in Pictou for 17 years and worked at Grohmann's for about a year and a half, can see why they selected Pictou.

“You're not tunnelled,” Howard said, referring to how crowds on big city sidewalks, like Toronto where she has lived, can make a person feel boxed-in and with no choice but to go with the flow of pedestrian traffic. “You don't need to go where everyone else is going, you go where you want to go. It's not crowded.”

Howard said since her time at Grohmann's, she has built a bit of a reputation as a talker.



“People love coming here and most times they call for the girl from Ontario,” she said with a chuckle, noting she loves meeting people and sharing stories, especially when it comes to praising Pictou.

“It's a close-knit community,” she said. “Could we use a Costco in Pictou County? Sure, but do I want a place like Walmart or other big department stores in Pictou? No way. I'm OK driving the 15 minutes (to New Glasgow). I like the little sleepy town, that is why I left Toronto.

“If I had a choice to pick between Pictou and anywhere else, it would still be Pictou.”



Another downtown business that reflects the Pictou charm is Mrs. MacGregor's Shortbreads on Water Street operated by Helen Buchan and her husband Hollis Corbin. Corbin said he had read the World Atlas article and found it “pretty cool.”

“Our downtown is definitely an interesting tourist area,” Corbin said, adding he agrees with the website's assertion about the combination of heritage with places to shop and have a snack or meal, being a great blend.

A little further down the street is Seaside Treasure Trove which shares its location with Ahead of Hair Health and Beauty Retreat.

“It's a special place,” Seaside's Johanne Doyle said, adding that, like Corbin, she had recently noticed the recognition.

“It's a very friendly little place and, come summertime, it's just a booming little town with all kinds of visitors,” she said. “People should come visit the Pictou downtown; it's a great little spot.”

Pictou County Chamber of Commerce executive director Layla Rahmeh would concur, adding that the recognition is well deserved and more evidence that Pictou and the entire county have a lot to offer both residents and visitors.

“Our businesses and the people behind them reflect their pride in Pictou County and that is certainly evident in Pictou's downtown,” she said. “It's a must-see for those visiting the area which we expect will be many as we move into the spring and summer.”

A team of South African scientists are stuck with an alleged ‘madman' in a remote Antarctica research station. The group sent an urgent plea via email reporting physical assault, sexual assault, and death threats from a colleague. The nine researchers are based at the Sanae IV research station, located about 100 miles south of the continent's ice shelf. With winter storms coming, the crew is expected to remain there until December.

The crew is made of three women and six men, The New York Post reported. One of them is a doctor who owns a skincare brand. Another one is a meteorologist and the rest are engineers. While the violent crew members, described by The Post as a ‘madman', has not been identified, we have the roster of the mission as published on the South African National Antarctic Programme website.

 Most Asian equities rose Thursday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell suggested any increase in consumer prices caused by tariffs would likely be short-lived, even as the central bank slashed its growth outlook and hiked inflation expectations. 

 Markets have been seized by volatility recently as US President Donald Trump embarks on his hardball trade policy that has seen him impose painful duties on imports from major partners, stoking recession fears. 

 Some observers have also warned his pledges to slash taxes, regulations and immigration will reignite inflation and force the Fed to reassess its monetary policy, with some even fearing rate hikes. 

 After a closely watched meeting on Wednesday, the US central bank stood pat on borrowing costs for the second time in a row and said ""uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased"". 

 It also predicted the economy would expand 1.7 percent this year, compared with 2.1 percent estimated in December, and tipped core inflation to hit 2.8 percent as opposed to the 2.5 percent previously seen. 

 However, its dot plot estimate for rate cuts still showed officials saw two this year. 

 Powell said: ""We do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not yet and so we are watching carefully. 

 ""I would tell people the economy seems to be healthy."" 

 He added that inflation had ""started to move up"" and officials think that is ""partly in response to tariffs. And there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year"". 

 Any increase would be ""transitory"", Powell said, but warned it would be hard to determine how much of a factor the levies as opposed to other factors would play in lifting prices. 

 The remarks were taken as market-supportive and 10-year US Treasury yields, a proxy of monetary policy, dropped. 

 That was also helped by news the Fed would slow its pace of balance sheet reduction the bank ramped up bond-buying during the pandemic to keep rates low and has been offloading them in recent months to normalise monetary policy.

 Trump late Wednesday called on decision-makers to cut rates now, urging on his Truth Social platform to ""do the right thing"". 

 Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: ""The Fed doesn't have all the answers but faces plenty of questions about how it is interpreting the shift in the US economy and policy impacts. 

 ""For now, the market seems reassured that the Fed is ready to act if needed."" 

 But he added: ""Overall, the outlook remains uncertain."" 

 All three main indexes on Wall Street rallied. 

 And most of Asia followed suit, with Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington and Manila all up. 

 Jakarta gained almost two percent to extend Wednesday's gains, but the index remains under pressure it has dropped 10 percent in 2025 on concerns about Indonesia's economy, Southeast Asia's biggest. 

 Hong Kong, however, retreated after a breathtaking run-up this year that has seen the Hang Seng Index pile on more than 20 percent. Shanghai also dropped. 

 Tokyo was closed for a holiday. 

 The yen extended Wednesday's gains after Powell's dovish comments, while the dollar was also softer against the pound and euro. 

 But lingering tariff fears and geopolitical developments helped safe-haven gold to another record above $3,056. 

 Oil rose again following a fresh upsurge in Middle East hostilities after Israel launched its most intense strikes on Gaza since a ceasefire with Hamas took effect. 

 Traders are also keeping tabs on eastern Europe after Trump told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky that the United States could own and run his country's nuclear power plants as part of his bid to secure a ceasefire with Russia. 

 Zelensky said he was ready to pause attacks on Russia's energy network and infrastructure, a day after Vladimir Putin agreed to halt similar strikes on Ukraine.

 Patience Capital Group planning $1.4 billion mega-resort

 Foreigners already own many local businesses but only operate in winter

 Myoko City looking at new rules for larger projects 

 By Mariko Katsumura 

 MYOKO, Japan, - Three winters from now, Japan's snowy Myoko highlands will be home to a $1.4 billion mega-resort built by a Singaporean fund, with hotels charging some $1,350 a night. 

 The project by Patience Capital Group promises to create 1,000 jobs and spur winter tourism. But for many Myoko locals, foreign interest has become a double-edged sword, threatening overdevelopment, sky-high prices and the sweeping away of traditional culture. 

 Even before news of PCG's interest, many inns, ski rental shops and restaurants in Akakura - one of five major ski resort towns in the Myoko region - had been snapped up by foreigners. 

 But they're only interested in the snow and once that melts, those businesses shut. The town, also once a bustling hot-spring destination, no longer has enough going on to attract many visitors during the rest of the year. 

 ""If you come to Akakura in summer, it's pitch dark at night,"" said Masafumi Nakajima, owner of local inn Furuya and head of the 200-year-old town's hot spring-inn tourism association. He estimates only 10 of about 80 inns in Akakura operate year-round. 

 Located roughly 2.5 hours from Tokyo by train in Niigata prefecture, Myoko, along with the more famed Japanese ski resorts of Niseko and Hakuba, is known for powder snow, dubbed ""Japow"". 

 The resort areas are a huge part of Japan's tourism boom, also fuelled by a weak yen, which saw inbound tourist numbers jump 17% in February, hitting a record high for that month. 

 Nakajima said many foreign business owners in Akakura have refused to join the local tourism association. One consequence is a lot of broken rules on the part of businesses and tourists that range from not disposing of garbage properly, to overparking to late-night fireworks. 

 ""We have no idea who they are and what they're doing. They just come in December and disappear when spring comes,"" he said. Nakajima recently started approaching foreign businesses to offer lectures on the town's rules. 

 PRICED OUT 

 Many locals fear Myoko could go the way of Niseko. 

 The resort on the northern island of Hokkaido has become a world-renowned winter sports destination on the back of high-end foreign developments, but the surge in property prices brought higher taxes for locals choosing not to sell. Inflation there - from labour costs to a bowl of ramen - has gone through the roof, pricing locals and most domestic travellers out of the market. 

 Hakuba, in the Japanese Alps, has followed a similar path, while one township in Myoko has already seen land prices jump as much as 9% last year. 

 PCG's Tokyo-born founder, Ken Chan, said he's mindful of local fears about his project, which will span 350 hectares and two ski slopes. 

 To attract visitors year-round, PCG wants to promote its two planned luxury hotels for business conferences and is considering discounts during non-peak times for local residents who want to ski or snowboard, he told Reuters. 

 He also intends to host a meeting with residents in the coming months. 

 Myoko City mayor Yoji Kido said he's cautiously optimistic about PCG's development plans but has heard few specifics. 

 Kido has been fielding more enquiries from foreign investors and conscious of local concerns, the city is considering new regulations for larger projects from the 2027 fiscal year. 

 ""It's going to be an unusually big development for our city,"" he said. ""I can't deny that things aren't worry-free."" 

 Koji Miyashita, the owner of a half-century-old shop in Akakura that sells steamed buns filled with red bean paste, said he sometimes feels like he doesn't live in Japan as Westerners throng the town's streets. 

 Development in Myoko should sustain the region's culture, he said, adding: ""We don't want to be another Niseko.""

Something went wrong

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) price has surged ahead of US president Donald Trump's anticipated address at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York on Thursday.

Bitcoin rose more than 3% on Thursday to trade above $86,000 (£66,382), a 7% gain in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.

Trump's upcoming speech follows a significant policy move earlier in March, when he signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The order states that bitcoin deposited into the reserve will not be sold, but instead maintained as a long-term strategic asset to bolster the US's financial stability.

Joining the speaker lineup at DAS is Strategy's (MSTR) — formerly MicroStrategy — Michael Saylor, who will deliver a keynote speech, BlackRock's (BLK) head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick and Nasdaq's (^IXIC) head of US equities & exchange-traded products Giang Bui.

Trump's participation was confirmed following comments from Bo Hines, executive director on digital assets for president Trump, who spoke at DAS earlier this week. Hines reiterated the administration's commitment to bitcoin accumulation for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, saying: ""It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away.”

In a post on X.com Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz said: “When we started Blockworks, we could barely get someone from a bank to attend an event. Now we have a sitting US president addressing 2,500 institutional participants. It is incredible how far this industry has come.""

During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to position the US as the “world's crypto capital.” In the summer of 2023, he spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, where he hinted at plans to form a national bitcoin reserve.

Since taking office in January, he has signed executive orders instructing regulatory bodies to accommodate digital assets, established a White House crypto advisory team, and created both the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. He has also appointed pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, including the SEC and Treasury Department.

Bitcoin's price increase comes as the US Federal Reserve left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.50% on Wednesday, marking the second consecutive pause following three straight rate cuts in late 2024.

The Fed's latest economic projections indicate a slowdown, with 2025 GDP growth now expected at just 1.7%, down from December's 2.1% forecast. Growth projections for 2026 and 2027 have also been revised downward.

""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" the US central bank said, likely referring to economic volatility stemming from Trump's proposed tariff policies.

In addition to slowing growth, core PCE inflation is now forecasted at 2.8% for 2025, up from the previous 2.5% estimate. Projections for 2026 and 2027 remain at 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively.

The Fed's ""dot plot"" still continues to project two rate cuts by the end of this year. At Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell also announced that the central bank will slow the pace of its balance sheet reduction from April.

As part of this shift in quantitative tightening (QT), the Fed will lower the monthly cap on Treasury securities allowed to mature without reinvestment from $25bn (£19bn) to $5bn (£3.86bn), effective 1 April. When the Federal Reserve slows quantitative tightening or implements quantitative easing (QE), it injects liquidity into the financial system, which could lead to greater capital flows into riskier assets, such as bitcoin.

Bitcoin has climbed after the Federal Reserve met expectations by leaving interest rates on hold and confirmed a major flip—though traders are now being warned of a major new threat.

The bitcoin price soared toward $88,000 per bitcoin, adding almost $10,000 from the low it fell to last week, helped by a huge bitcoin price prediction hitting its first milestone.

Now, as Russia is revealed to be gearing up for a crypto showdown with the U.S., a leak that primed the bitcoin price for a “big” crypto update from president Donald Trump has been confirmed.

“I'm told a big announcement regarding Donald Trump's plans for next steps in crypto policy is coming imminently out of the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit,” 
 Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter who's now hosting a crypto podcast, posted to X.

Blockworks, a crypto media company, later confirmed the leak, touting a pre-recorded speech by Trump that's due to be broadcast to attendees on Thursday morning as “the first time a sitting president has ever addressed a crypto industry conference.""

The details of Trump's speech are not yet known, however, Trump's executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets Bo Hines earlier told the conference the U.S. wants ""as much [bitcoin] as we can get.”

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines said, referring to Trump's executive order that prevents the sale of bitcoin and crypto that U.S. has seized.

Last week, Hines told attendees of a closed-door round table hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute that the White House plans to buy as much bitcoin as it can.

Earlier this month, after Trump's surprise announcement that Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies.

Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin during the much-hyped White House crypto summit, placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve.

Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile.

""The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge
 fund manager so he's going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and
 we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management,"" Sacks said, speaking on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the White House job.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

Brad Garlinghouse said the case against his company, Ripple Labs, ""has ended.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its yearslong case and appeal against a cryptocurrency firm whose CEO has ties to the White House, the CEO said Wednesday.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, said on the social media platform X that the case against his company ""has ended.""

""Today is a victory -- and a long overdue surrender by the SEC,"" he said.

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment to ABC News.

The move, which was not confirmed by the SEC, prevents Ripple from potentially facing a $125 million fine -- and comes less than two weeks after Garlinghouse was at the White House for President Donald Trump's crypto summit.

Ripple also donated $5 million to Trump's inaugural committee, sources previously told ABC News, and Garlinghouse posted a photo to social media of him meeting with Trump in January.

The SEC's case had been going on for over four years. In December 2020 -- while Trump was still in office -- the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple and two executives for violating securities laws when they raised $1.4 billion through the sale of XRP crypto tokens.

A federal judge handed Ripple a landmark legal victory in 2023 when she ruled that the publicly sold tokens did not constitute a security, though she still fined the company $125 million because the tokens should have been sold to institutional investors. The SEC had appealed that ruling.

Ripple's appeal of the $125 million fine was still pending as of Wednesday.

Following Garlinghouse's announcement of the SEC dropping its appeal, the price of XRP surged more than 10% on Wednesday.

In his video statement on X, Garlinghouse called the case again him ""lawfare"" and praised the change in government.

""Thankfully, we have new leadership in the executive and legislative branches of our government,"" he said. ""That leadership is actively seeking a rational and constructive way forward on crypto. Let's make the most of this.""

PROVIDENCE – Timmons Roberts' letter to state lawmakers began with this painful admission: ""On April 16th, 2024, I was scammed. Pretty badly.""

""I'm here telling you about it because I wish someone had [warned] me,"" said Roberts, 64, a professor of environmental studies at Brown University. ""The CoinStar machines in supermarkets made it possible.""

The worst part, Robbins wrote, wasn't the $2,200 he lost – ""that can be lived with"" – but rather the three things he hasn't been able to let go of since.

He can't get the man, who was on the phone doing a ""brilliant"" imitation of a federal marshal, out of his head, Roberts said. His trust in humanity is badly shaken. And the fact that he fell for the scam is ""humiliating.""

""Everyone thinks they are smart enough to not let this happen to them, that it's only 'old clueless women' or something who get scammed,"" Roberts wrote. ""Talking to the FBI was helpful in convincing me otherwise, and apparently there's some research on the fact that highly educated people with good jobs are just as likely to fall victim as anyone,"" but they are just too ashamed to admit it.

Roberts shared his story of how he, a professor at an Ivy League university, was sucked into this scam during the first of two State House hearings on a bill to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, which AARP Rhode Island has described as a top priority this year.

Westerly Police Chief Paul Gingerella told lawmakers that in Westerly alone, many residents have lost significant sums of money, even their entire life savings, because of cryptocurrency scams and cryptocurrency ATMs.

""We have investigated cases where individuals deposited and lost $40,000 in just two days and multiple instances of $15,000 or more losses in a single day,"" Gingerella said. ""When we attempt to work with these machine owners to recover these funds, we are met with indifference and little to no cooperation.""

Looking beyond Westerly, AARP Associate State Director Matthew Netto told the House Committee on House Innovation, Internet, & Technology that in 2023, the FBI found that Americans reported losing more than $5.6 billion to cryptocurrency fraud, and $2 million of those losses were from Rhode Islanders.

The scams, Netto said, involve making payments using cryptocurrency ATMs, or ""crypto kiosks"" and ""virtual currency kiosks"" that can be found in supermarkets, shopping malls, gas stations and convenience stores.

He estimated there are at least 120 in operation in Rhode Island today.

The legislation, as originally proposed in the House by Rep. Julie Casimiro and in the Senate by Sen. Victoria Gu, would have required:

It also would have required cryptocurrency operators to refund transactions and ATM fees for fraudulent transactions.

Two of the larger players in the crypto-kiosk industry, CoinFlip and Bitcoin Depot pushed back, resulting in a compromise announced just ahead of Tuesday's Senate hearing on the bill.

""CoinFlip would support a 'reasonable transaction limit' for new users who may not be familiar withthe kiosks,"" and limit equal to the federal gift card limit of $10,000 for seasoned users, the company's general counsel, Larry Lipka, had suggested at an earlier hearing.

At that time, he called the proposed fee caps a ""de-facto ban on the industry,"" because it would not allow the full recovery of operational costs. And he likened the required refund of ""scam victims"" authorized transactions to requiring Target to refund the purchase of a gift card if the customer later gave their gift card to a bad actor.""

On Tuesday, AARP Rhode Island – and an industry lobbyist – announced the proposed compromise that Casimiro, the House sponsor, negotiated with industry representatives. Key features:

Roberts said he received a call while driving on the Mass Pike from a Washington, D.C., number. The basic premise was that he had failed to appear for federal jury duty in Providence and was in contempt of court.

Roberts said he never got a summons, and the caller, posing as a lieutenant, said he checked and it looked like the signature on the paperwork was forged. He gave Roberts a callback number and the answering machine said it was the federal court in Providence and sounded ""completely legit.""

The scammer picked up the extension, told Roberts he was in contempt of court and he could either appear at the federal courthouse and possibly be detained for eight to 10 hours, or he could pay a fee at a CoinStar machine in a ""Federal Payment Kiosk"" that, the scammer said, the government had been using since COVID.

The scammer told Roberts to put the cash in the machine and transfer the payment. Once the forgery was cleared, Roberts would be refunded the money.

""Looking back, of course this seems absurd,"" Roberts wrote.

Roberts took out a first round of cash and deposited it into a CoinStar machine at a Stop & Shop. He didn't realize it was a scam until he had to get more cash and the teller told him it was a fraud, hung up Roberts' phone and told him not to answer it.

When Roberts called the real court number listed on Google, the woman in the jury duty division told him several people had been scammed that week.","{'href': 'https://www.providencejournal.com', 'title': 'The Providence Journal'}"

FARGO, N.D. – Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner says he's seen an increase of cryptocurrency scams.

Jahner has seen schemes where people are convinced to put up to $15,000 of their money into the kiosk to get the digital currency so others won't have access to it. The money then goes into the suspect's virtual wallet and they send it to multiple locations to stay ahead of law enforcement.

Financial institutions have 10 days to comply with a search warrant to provide records, but Jahner says the money is often spent by fraudsters by then.

“Our best option is to be able to prevent this activity rather than investigate it and be reactive. Typically probably less than one percent that we're able to solve these crimes and get the money back to victims,” Jahner said.

A bill in the North Dakota legislature would prevent people from depositing more than $2,000 into a kiosk per day to get cryptocurrency. Warnings would be put on the machines saying “Consumer fraud often starts with contact from a stranger who is initiating a dishonest scheme. Kiosk operators would also have to have a compliance officer and have blockchain analytics software to detect and prevent suspicious activity.”

The measure was passed by the House and Senate. Since the Senate added amendments, the bill has gone back to the House.

BANGKOK (AP) — The price of XRP jumped more than 8% Thursday after the CEO of cryptocurrency company Ripple said U.S. regulators have dropped its four-year-old case against the company. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple and two of its executives in late 2020 after they raised $1.4 billion by selling XRP crypto coins. 

The SEC under the Biden administration held that digital assets like cryptocurrences should be regulated like securities, such as stocks, and should be considered commodities like gold or oil. Securities generally face stricter regulations. 

The Trump administration is easing those rules. 

CEO Brad Garlinghouse that the SEC overstepped its authority in alleging that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP without a securities registration. 

“I'm finally able to announce that this case has ended,” Garlinghouse said in a video posted on X. “It's over.”

The SEC has not confirmed its decision to withdraw the case against Ripple, yet other crypto companies have already announced that the SEC under the Trump administration has dropped cases against them. Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to ease restrictions in the cryptocurrency market, a significant change compared with the last several years under Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC in the Biden administration. 

In February, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said the SEC had dropped its case against it after it was targeted in a lawsuit alleging it was operating as an unregistered securities platform and brokerage service. Ditto for the cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.




The SEC also recently asked a federal court to pause ongoing litigation against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, because leadership was rethinking previous enforcement actions. 

Trump has pledged to make the U.S. a world leader in cryptocurrencies and the industry scored some early wins after his return to the White House. That includes the repeal of an SEC accounting rule and an executive order by the president directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations. 

Trump signed an executive order two weeks ago establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency's journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

The crypto industry spent heavily to help elect Trump and other crypto-friendly lawmakers and is eager to cement its influence in politics and mainstream financial systems.

Garlinghouse, a Trump supporter, caused waves when he said he'd like to see a U.S. government crypto reserve include various digital assets rather than just bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency. That idea is a nonstarter for many bitcoin diehards.

The SEC was due to hold a series of roundtables on regulation of crypto assets, beginning with one on Saturday at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 

Early Thursday, the value of Ripple rose to more than $2.50.

 The Fed's quantitative tightening is “basically over,” which has crypto analysts feeling slightly more bullish about its implications for the crypto market. 

Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $77,000 price level anytime soon after the Fed signaled a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.

On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped near the $77,000 level for the first time since November, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob,” Hayes said in a March 20 X post after declaring that QT is “basically over” following the Fed's March 19 announcement that starting in April, it will slow its securities sell-off by reducing the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion. 

Bitcoin is up 3.53% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap

This could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates. 

“The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,” Hayes added.

The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending.

Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that “QT is effectively dead.” Coutts explained that “treasury volatility” has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity.

Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is “great for both crypto and equity markets.”

“The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,” Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, “the dam is going to break.”

Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed's comments. 

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into “Neutral” territory at 49 after lingering in the “Fear” area since Feb. 26.

Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a “normal mid-bull correction.”

“I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,” Warwick said. “My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.”

    Kraken, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said on Thursday it would buy retail futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, in a deal that would allow it to expand into multiple asset classes and grow its user base.

The acquisition comes at a time the crypto industry is optimistic about more relaxed regulation under U.S. President Donald Trump, who courted crypto donors during the election and promised to support the sector.

Industry leaders hope for policy shifts that roll back enforcement actions, encourage institutional adoption and create clearer rules for digital asset trading.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed a civil lawsuit accusing Kraken of operating illegally as an unregistered securities exchange.

Kraken is the world's tenth-ranked cryptocurrency spot exchange based on traffic, liquidity, trading volumes and confidence in the legitimacy of reported trading volumes, according to trading data website CoinMarketCap.

The deal also highlights the deepening ties between crypto companies and traditional financial firms as digital assets gain wider acceptance.

Growing demand from retail traders to access a wide range of assets — from stocks and bonds to crypto and derivatives — has pushed companies to expand beyond their roots and integrate more deeply into their customers' financial habits.

""It is an important deal for the industry because it is a deal that a crypto native acquiring a traditional finance and it is a large, billion-dollar-plus deal,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.

Lau expects ""more deals to come under the most pro-crypto president, Congress and regulators"", and said ""there will be continuous crypto-traditional finance convergence"".

Long Ridge Equity Partners-backed NinjaTrader will continue to operate as a standalone platform under Kraken.

Founded in 2003, NinjaTrader provides affordable retail future trading platform to nearly 2 million traders.

   The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.

Pakistan unveils plans to legalise bitcoin and crypto and implement a regulatory framework to attract foreign investment and boost adoption.

Pakistan unveils plans to legalise bitcoin and crypto and implement a regulatory framework to attract foreign investment and boost adoption.

Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, told Bloomberg on Thursday that Pakistan has unveiled plans to legalise bitcoin and crypto and implement a regulatory framework to attract foreign investment and boost adoption.

The government aims to devise clear regulations and align with international best practices. Pakistan's Finance Minister formed the PCC last week to steer the country's crypto strategy.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines” regarding bitcoin and crypto, Saqib told Bloomberg. “We want to attract international investment because Pakistan is a low-cost, high-growth market with 60% of the population under 30.”

“Trump is making crypto a national priority, and every country, including Pakistan, will have to follow suit,” he said.

This move comes amid a global shift in attitudes towards bitcoin and crypto after the United States pushed for greater mainstream acceptance. The new stance is a stark change for Pakistan, which had previously banned crypto. By embracing bitcoin and crypto early, Pakistan is looking to position itself as a regional leader and attract investors.

Pakistan's central bank had expressed concerns earlier. However, the government now seeks to mitigate risks through prudent legislation. Clear rules could boost innovation and prevent potential abuse of decentralised networks.

 Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, said that forfeited crypto “should work for the benefit of the government.” 

Amid the growing adoption of cryptocurrency reserves in countries like the United States, legal activists in Russia are pushing to create a potential crypto fund.

Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, has proposed creating a government cryptocurrency fund that would include assets confiscated from criminal proceedings.

The projected cryptocurrency fund would aim for revenues for the government, targeting social projects, Masharov said, according to a March 20 report by the local news agency TASS.

“The proceeds from the cryptocurrency fund can then be used for social, environmental and educational projects,” he reportedly stated.

Masharov's proposal came amid Russian officials progressing with new legislation on recognizing cryptocurrencies as property for the purposes of criminal procedure legislation.

Alexander Bastrykin, Chairman of Russia's Investigative Committee, said that a related draft bill was sent to the government for consideration, the local news agency RBC reported on March 19.

“Cryptocurrencies confiscated as part of criminal proceedings must work for the benefit of the state,” Masharov said while commenting on the proposed legislation.

“For these purposes, a special fund can be created, putting cryptocurrencies on its balance,” Masharov said, expressing confidence that many of the seized crypto assets could see their market capitalization “rising significantly over time.”

Masharov's proposal to turn confiscated crypto assets for the benefit of the state follows years of the development of related legislation in Russia.

Russian prosecutors have been pushing legal initiatives to allow the government to seize crypto obtained from criminal activity since at least 2021, but there has not been a clear framework set in place.

In the meantime, the Russian government has not missed the opportunity to confiscate millions in cryptocurrency from illegal cases, sometimes involving law enforcement officials. Apparently, Russia's current laws do not provide standards on where and how such funds should be distributed.

The idea of a potential social crypto fund in Russia may sound similar to initiatives like a Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve, which currently targets holding confiscated BTC exclusively.

In the meantime, Russia's central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has previously strongly opposed the idea of potential investments in crypto by the Bank of Russia.

“Cryptocurrency investment doesn't make any sense for the Central Bank in terms of preserving value since it's a very volatile asset,” Nabiullina reportedly said in December 2024.

Bakkt Holdings is blowing it all up and starting fresh.

The digital asset and payments platform on Monday (March 17) suffered a major blow when Bank of America and Webull announced they would not be renewing their commercial agreements with the company. 

On Wednesday (March 19), after delaying twice, the digital asset and payments platform held its earnings call sharing the financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.

The big news? Bakkt signed a definitive agreement to get rid of its Trust custody business entirely, named a new co-CEO, and announced a pivot to “become a pure play crypto infrastructure company.”

Webull, per a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), represented nearly three quarters (74%) of Bakkt's crypto services revenue.

“As we move forward to a pure play crypto ecosystem player, [the divesture] enables us to double down on our core offerings — providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity, and subject to applicable regulatory approvals, payment solutions,” said Andy Main, CEO of Bakkt.

Main also announced the appointment of Akshay Naheta as co-CEO. 

“As we enter 2025, Bakkt is sharpening its focus on the future of crypto, leveraging our technology, market expertise and strategic partnerships to be in a position to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Our partnership with DTR [Distributed Technologies Research, founded by Naheta], combined with Akshay Naheta agreeing to joining as co-CEO, marks a pivotal moment by expanding our capabilities, and we believe will position us to be able to capture market share in the global stablecoin payments network,” he told investors on Wednesday's call. 

The company's stock remained relatively flat, hovering around $9, after dropping by 30% to start the week. There was no Q&A session following Wednesday's earnings call.

Few companies have undergone as radical a transformation as Bakkt, which once sought to bridge traditional finance and digital assets through loyalty rewards and consumer-friendly crypto solutions, and is now pivoting to a focused strategy: becoming a full-fledged crypto infrastructure company.

Bakkt has entered into a strategic partnership with DTR, a stablecoin payments platform. This collaboration aims to enhance Bakkt's capabilities in the global stablecoin payments network.

To concentrate on its core offerings, Bakkt has signed a definitive agreement to divest its Trust custody business to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). This divestiture allows Bakkt to focus on providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity and, subject to regulatory approvals, payment solutions.

Simultaneously, Bakkt is evaluating alternatives for its Loyalty business, a segment that once seemed integral. Whether through a sale or a full wind-down, the company is signaling to investors that its future is not in travel miles or gift card conversions but in digital asset markets, trading infrastructure and institutional-grade solutions.

Bakkt's Q4 2024 earnings report, including leadership changes and divestitures, tells a story of aggressive restructuring, divestitures, and a shift toward high-volume crypto trading.

Bakkt reported total revenues of $1.797 billion for the quarter, an increase of 737.9% year over year. This surge is attributed to heightened crypto market activity and increased asset prices.​

Despite the revenue growth, Bakkt reported a net loss of $40.4 million for the quarter, an improvement of 48.7% year over year. The adjusted EBITDA loss also decreased by 66.3% to $6.4 million, reflecting the company's efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs.

Bakkt faces substantial headwinds. The nonrenewal of its Webull commercial contract, a key revenue stream, raises questions about its ability to maintain retail partnerships while shifting toward institutional business. 

Moreover, the company's dependence on volatile crypto markets means that external shocks — regulatory crackdowns, liquidity crunches or security breaches — could impact performance.

With revenue projections between $1.03 billion and $1.28 billion for Q1 2025, the company is betting on sustained crypto adoption and a deeper integration into the institutional space. Whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Bakkt is no longer a consumer-facing crypto startup, it's aiming to become instead a serious player in the infrastructure that powers digital asset markets.

U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday, days after White House signaled interest in stockpiling Bitcoin.

President Donald Trump is set to address the Digital Asset Summit in New York City on Thursday, March 20, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president has spoken at a cryptocurrency industry conference. According to a press release, Trump's speech is scheduled for 10:40 a.m. ET at North Javits and comes amid growing discussion about the U.S. government's potential involvement in Bitcoin (BTC).

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away. I've been asked all the time, it's like how much do you want, right? I mean, as much as we can get.”

Bo Hines, executive director of the White House's presidents council of advisers on digital assets

The administration's stance on Bitcoin appears to be evolving, though details remain unclear. A few weeks ago, Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich, have since introduced proposals for the U.S. to acquire up to 1 million BTC over the next five years.

Trump has already signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. As crypto.news reported earlier, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers won't bear any cost.

White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks noted that the U.S. government already holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve, likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.”

Alongside Trump, other key speakers at DAS include Strategy's Michael Saylor and Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who will discuss spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and institutional adoption.

Crypto update: The price of Bitcoin neared the $86,000 level on March 20 after United States Federal Reserve's rate decision sent markets soaring.

The rise was supported by the US Fed decision and news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) had officially dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.

During the early hours today, on March 20, Bitcoin briefly touched the $87,299 level at 5.50 am, but soon settled close below $86,000.

At 10.10 am, the world's biggest cryptocurrency was at $85,596.80 — up 3.18 per cent from the previous day, according to data on Coinmarketcap. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin was at $1.69 trillion, with trading volume recorded was at $35.82 billion over the past 24 hours.

The second biggest cryptocurrency, Ether also saw a rise, trading at $2,020.95 — up 4.51 per cent, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token's market cap is at $243.78 billion, with trading volume of $20.26 billion.

Stablecoin Tether, linked to the US Dollar, remained steady on March 20, at $1 with market cap of $143.66 billion and trading volume of $78.91 billion, CoinMarketCap showed.

Further, Solana token, which will see two linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) jumped 5.69 per cent to $133.09, with market cap of $67.9 billion and trade volume of $3.64 billion, as per CoinMarketCap data.

Florida-based Volatility Shares LLC, is debuting the first ever Solana-linked ETFs on March 20, Bloomberg reported.

The ETFs are — Volatility Shares Solana ETF (ticker SOLZ) which will track Solana futures; and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT) which will offer twice the leveraged exposure. SOLZ and SOLT will carry expense ratios of 0.95% and 1.85 per cent, respectively, the report added.

Meanwhile, Ripple Labs on March 19 said that the US SEC had dropped its appeal against the company, Reuters reported. The watchdog was appealing a July 2023 decision by Manhattan District Judge the XRP token sold by Ripple on public exchanges did not meet the legal definition of a security. In a post on X, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the end of the SEC appeal a “resounding victory” and “long overdue surrender”.

Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42 noted that Bitcoin and the overall crypto space continue their rebound after the Fed maintained interest rates unchanged.

“Investors expect an all-time high in Q2, driven by dovish cues from Jerome Powell and increased institutional demand. Bitcoin Whale accumulation rose by a whopping $13 billion over the course of three days, demonstrating robust investor sentiment,” Shekhar noted.

He added that net inflows went into positive territory, accounting for a change in sentiment as Ethereum and Dogecoin also recovered. “As liquidity rises and macroeconomic fundamentals are in sympathy, the universe of crypto is set for further upside. The coming two months can be decisive in shaping the path of Bitcoin as it deals with bettering fundamentals and increasing investor appetite.” Shekhar felt.

According to the CoinSwitch Markets Desk, “Bitcoin experienced a modest increase of nearly 4 per cent, trading at approximately $86,000. Ethereum also saw gains, rising 5 per cent to around $2,031.”

It noted the following developments that had an impact on crypto prices:

 As Bitcoin's value surges, tax agencies are ramping up efforts to track crypto transactions, leaving no room for complacency. 

Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly

In the race between regulation and Bitcoin (BTC) all-time highs, there is no doubt tax agencies will double down on their crypto-tracking systems well before Bitcoin hits $1 million.

Crypto investors shouldn't become complacent or assume they can skate by until the million-dollar price tag. In addition to their laser focus on the future, they are becoming skilled at scrutinizing the past. Many jurisdictions have the power to backtrack on previous years, and if tax authorities realize how much they've missed, they won't just let it slide…

This could spell trouble for misinformed Bitcoiners who have already begun spending their profits.

Governments are still in this weird gray area where crypto tax rules can change anytime. Take the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for example. In a shock move, as of 2025, the IRS now mandates that investors use the wallet-by-wallet cost tracking method, no longer allowing the universal wallet method. The latter is far more labor-intensive than the former but hands the IRS more data it craves.

Though automated data sharing with tax agencies might not be as extensive as stock market data, it's only a matter of time before crypto data from centralized exchanges catches up. Several crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance.US, issue Forms 1099-MISC to the IRS for users with more than $600 in rewards in a financial year.

Then there's the global village challenge, with each tax agency worldwide taking its own approach. For instance, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) automates stock cost and sale reporting through pre-filled data for taxpayers. Crypto data isn't, however, included in the pre-fill. 

Instead, any activity on a centralized exchange triggers an alert on the taxpayer's tax return, indicating that the ATO is aware of the crypto activity. This leaves it up to the taxpayer to be honest about whether they've made capital gains or losses during the financial year.

Whether you've made any sales or simply bought crypto, consistent alerts over several years without reporting from the taxpayer will likely increase the risk of an audit.

Worldwide, the honesty system is on its deathbed. Once tax authorities have advanced their crypto monitoring systems, they can retroactively review previous years if they choose to. The ATO already has a reasonably intensive data-matching program with centralized exchanges in the jurisdiction.

If you value your sanity, a multi-year audit of your crypto portfolio is the last thing you want to deal with. Every tax authority is catching up, and accountants want to protect clients from getting caught out as compliance measures become more sophisticated.

Over the coming years, we should expect to see an increase in global tax data sharing between jurisdictions, something we're already starting to see. In March 2024, Australia's and Indonesia's governments reached an agreement to exchange tax information, with one of the key focuses being the use of crypto.

A few months earlier, in November 2023, 47 national governments, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany and Japan, committed to the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and planned to activate exchange agreements for information sharing by 2027.

Recent: Indian crypto holders face 70% tax penalty on undisclosed gains

Don't operate under the assumption that decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens are flying under the radar, either. Tax authorities are fully aware of the gains made on decentralized exchanges. Agencies like the IRS have already introduced guidance to collect user data from non-custodial brokers, though this has been delayed until 2027. 

While tracking might be more challenging, and some investors believe their assets are untraceable until they are moved to centralized exchanges, tax authorities are already catching on. It's not a “crypto industry knows best” situation. Tax authorities are bringing in more experts from the crypto space to help them understand how people might try to bypass the system.

Bitcoin traders seemed to take the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision well—too well, to hear deVere Group CEO Nigel Green tell it.

Although the Federal Reserve did not lower rates, as crypto traders might have hoped, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks provided some hope to markets that there would be two rate cuts later in the year.

But Green insists that President Donald Trump's tariffs—taxes on imported goods—will have long-lasting effects that should scuttle the Fed's optimistic projections.

Protectionist trade policies may encourage companies to manufacture their products in the U.S., he wrote. But however good ""American made"" sounds politically, it will be coupled with higher labor costs and fuel wage growth.

""The notion that inflationary pressures will quickly subside under these conditions is wishful thinking at best,"" he wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. ""Markets, it would appear, have bought into Powell's messaging. Stocks surged as he reassured investors that the inflationary effect of tariffs would be short-lived.""

For now, investors seem happy with Powell's hopeful outlook.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin's price is up 1.8% compared to this time yesterday, trading at $85,208. Earlier in the day, it climbed above $86,000, according to CoinGecko data. But Bitcoin is still trading 11% lower than it was a month ago.

Users of on-chain prediction market MYRIAD, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, remain bullish on Bitcoin, with over 74% expecting it to hold above $83,000 by the end of the week.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows have slowed to a crawl, but that's not necessarily bad news, wrote BRN analyst Valentin Fournier in a trading note Thursday. He said overall trading activity remains elevated.

""Bitcoin ETFs saw $11.8 million in inflows, while Ethereum ETFs experienced $11.7 million in outflows, extending the trend of diverging netflows between the two assets,"" he said. ""While inflows have momentarily decreased, sustained high trading volumes indicate ongoing market engagement rather than weakening interest.""

Fournier said the firm remains neutral on Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that BTC is doing well just to maintain its price position and ETH is still recovering its momentum.

But he rated Solana as ""overweight"" a day after the altcoin saw some big ETF news.

Later today, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF, which will track Solana futures contracts, will begin trading under the SOLZ ticker. And the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF, which will trade under the SOLT ticker, is a leveraged fund that will grant investors access to amplified returns—or losses. They'll both trade on the Nasdaq.

At the time of writing, Solana has retreated slightly from the $136.09 high it set in the past day. But it's still trading 2.5% above yesterday's price, according to CoinGecko data.

Bitcoin (BTC) punters are looking at topside options bets in a bullish shift in price expectations after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) meeting, but ether (ETH) continues to lag sentiment. 

As of writing, BTC's short-term and long-term risk reversals, which show the implied volatility premium (demand) for bullish bets or calls versus puts, were positive, implying investor interest in chasing price gains in the leading cryptocurrency, per data source Amberdata.

It marks a shift from the bearish sentiment that prevailed weeks before the Fed meeting when short and near-dated puts were pricier than calls, reflecting downside fears.

""Frontend skew flipped calls. Flows featured 21 Mar outright calls and calendars bought, while 28 Mar puts were sold,"" institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm noted in the Telegram chat. Institutions and large traders execute block trades via OTC platforms like Paradigm, which are then listed on Deribit.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.

The bullish shift in the short and near-dated options happened as the Federal Reserve (Fed) retained the forecast for two rate cuts this year despite making the expected stagflationary adjustment in economic forecasts. The bank said it will slow the pace of balance sheet run off from April. 

More importantly, Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed fears about the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, calling it transitory.

Additionally, the end of the prolonged legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple, which uses XRP for cross border transactions, likely aided the sentiment. XRP, with the market cap of $142.21 billion, is the world's fourth largest cryptocurrency. 

These positive developments, however, are yet to translate into a positive flip in the short and near-dated ether options. 

At press time, ether risk reversals showed a bias for puts out to the May expiry, retaining the pre-Fed cautious sentiment despite the looming Ethereum Pectra upgrade.

The technological update will introduce smart accounts to ethereum, blob scaling and validator UX enhancements and seen as a game changer by many. Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week to carry out the impending upgrade, expected to take effect on March 26.

Note that the persistent bias for ether puts could be partly driven by traders looking to hedge downside risks in other altcoins. Ether is widely seen as the altcoin leader.

Global cryptocurrency exchange spot volumes fell sharply in February 2025, dropping 23% month-over-month (Mom) to $1.3 trillion as Bitcoin prices retreated from recent highs. Despite the monthly decline, year-over-year (YoY) comparisons show robust 45% growth across major trading platforms.

Crypto Exchange Volumes Plunge as Bitcoin Slump Drives Four-Month Low

The February cooldown marks the second consecutive month of declining volumes, bringing trading activity to its lowest level since October 2024. The downturn comes amid broader market consolidation following Bitcoin's volatile price action in early 2025.

In January, Bitcoin tested historical highs above $108,000. Since then, a sharper correction began, briefly pushing the price below $80,000—a nearly 30% drop. While bear markets also drive trading activity, historically, the highest volumes are seen during bullish surges. 

The result? A significant month-over-month decline in trading volumes.

Exchange Performance Shows Widespread Declines

Nine of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges reported volume decreases in February, with South Korea's Upbit experiencing the steepest drop at 46% MoM. The platform's trading activity fell from $187.87 billion in January to $101.51 billion in February, though it maintained its 8% market share.

Binance retained its commanding market position with 49% share despite seeing volumes fall 19% to $651.48 billion. ByBit and Coinbase rounded out the top three, commanding 13% and 9% market share, respectively.

Bitfinex emerged as the only exchange to buck the downward trend, posting a 16% increase in trading volume. However, its overall market impact remains limited with just 1% market share.

Crypto Trading Activity Shows 45% Annual Growth

The YoY data paints a more optimistic picture of the cryptocurrency trading landscape. Total volume across major exchanges grew 45% compared to February 2024, with ByBit leading the annual growth charts with a remarkable 116% increase.

Coinbase showed particularly strong annual performance with a 66% volume increase compared to February 2024, while Binance grew 46% year-over-year. Even smaller exchanges like Bitstamp demonstrated robust annual growth at 44%, despite its modest market share.

The contrasting monthly and annual trends suggest the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a temporary pullback rather than a fundamental shift in trading patterns. The top three exchanges maintained their collective dominance with approximately 71% market share, virtually unchanged from January.

According to Crypto Rover, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has decided not to follow former President Trump's push to hold Bitcoin reserves. This decision is significant for traders as it indicates that SNB is not aligning with trends of central banks diversifying into cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market saw significant gains today, with Bitcoin approaching $86,000 and Ethereum reclaiming the $2,000 level. This rally comes as the SEC dropped its multi-year enforcement action against Ripple, signaling a potential shift in regulatory stance, while the Federal Reserve maintained its target range for interest rates and projected two cuts in 2025.

Latest crypto market news



Positive legislative news along with consistent Federal Reserve monetary policy caused prices of cryptocurrencies to skyrocket everywhere. For the sector, the SEC's choice to abandon its lawsuit against Ripple following four years of litigation constitutes a major triumph. Underlining a possible “new chapter” for cryptocurrency control under the Trump administration, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said this event “a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it.”

Institutional interest is rising meantime as Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller presents the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, allowing the state to make investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is in line with laws in 22 other American states, where 39 separate proposals pertaining to state Bitcoin investments are under introduction all around.

 

After the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates at their present level between 4.25% and 4.5%, Bitcoin BTC/USD started to slow down its surge toward $86,000 Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated plans to lower the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion to $5 billion and maintained the potential of two rate cuts in 2025, hence the bitcoin peaked at $85,950 in intraday.

On-chain data points reveal a distinct market dynamic emerging. Despite recent corrections to a four-month low of $76,600 on March 11, long-term holders—those who have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days—have exhibited a declining selling pressure. Glassnode data indicates that these investors still retain a significant share of their gains, implying strong belief on the long-term direction of Bitcoin.

New Bitcoin whales—addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC with an average acquisition age of less than six months—have also aggressively collected over 1 million BTC since November 2024, so establishing themselves as significant market participants.

 

Rising almost 8% over the past 24 hours, Ethereum ETH/USD broke above $2,000 to peak at $2,064. After producing higher lows and hitting resistance at $1,950 many times, the altcoin showed a successful breakout from an ascending triangle pattern.

On March 12, ETH moves into accumulation addresses and records a one-day total of 345,210 ETH, suggesting notable long-term holding behavior. Suggesting significant holders are using ETH's current pricing, which remains 58.4% below its all-time high, these accumulation addresses have gathered over 5.8 million ETH during a 12-month period in 2024 and already purchased 4.73 million ETH in under three months in 2025.

 

Following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's declaration that the SEC will revoke its appeal against the company, XRP XRP/USD price jumped 15% to $2.55. Comparatively to $5.5 million in long liquidations, the news set over $11.96 million worth of short XRP positions to be sold in just one hour on motion.

Declaring the company engaged in an unregistered securities sale, the SEC started its action against Ripple in December 2020. A federal judge penalized Ripple $125 million—far less than the SEC's $2 billion demand—and decided that XRP itself is not a security for retail sales in August 2024, therefore rendering a partial success for Ripple. With the SEC's appeal dropped, the regulatory scene for cryptocurrencies undergoes a clear change.

 

As investors moved to riskier assets ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments, Solana's native token SOL surged 8% to $ 133.44. Solana's total value locked (TVL) achieved its highest level since July 2022, rising to 53.2 million SOL on March 17—a 10% rise from the month before—despite a 47% reduction in on-chain traffic over two weeks—a trend witnessed across several blockchains.

Still among the top 10 in prices, several Solana DApps beat more established rivals. Leading in fee generating include Pump.fun, Jupiter, Meteora, and Jito; Solana's weekly base layer costs exceed those of Ethereum. SOL/USD seems positioned to maybe recover the $170 level last observed on March 3, with balanced leverage levels between longs and shorts and lowered token unlocks projected in the next months.

 

Cardano's price dropped 32% in February then rose 13.5% in March. Social attitude about ADA/USD has reached its greatest positive level in four months while floating sideways between $0.78 and $0.70 over the past ten days.

The SEC's latest remarks labeling Cardano's use case as “smart contracts for government services” helped ADA investors. Though on a downturn since its 2024 high of $1.32, the altcoin has maintained a position above the 0.50 Fibonacci retracing line, suggesting that its high-time frame chart stays on a technical uptrend.

Supported by the 200-day exponential moving average, a breakout could perhaps set off a 20% surge toward the $0.84-$0.88 region with immediate opposition at $0.78. Cardano has historically shown extended sideways movement, nevertheless, which may restrict quick gains.","{'href': 'https://www.fxleaders.com', 'title': 'FX Leaders'}"

It was not long ago that XRP made its way onto the list of assets eligible for use as collateral in perpetual futures trading on Coinbase International Exchange. Now, Cardano ADAUSD and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) have joined the lineup, marking yet another step in Coinbase's ongoing expansion of supported cryptocurrencies within its derivatives trading ecosystem.

For ADA, this development is particularly noteworthy. It is not just another cryptocurrency added to the mix; it is a token that, like XRP, has been at the center of regulatory scrutiny in the past. The SEC had taken issue with both, alleging them to be unregistered securities. But times change, and so does the regulatory landscape. 

With the departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC and a shift in how the commission approaches cryptocurrency enforcement, cases against digital assets have been seeing a different fate. What was once an uphill battle for ADA and XRP now appears to be turning into an opportunity for broader market adoption.

Just added: Cardano $ADA and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH $cbETH can now be used as collateral for perpetual futures trading on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. pic.twitter.com/v8XLSklVMg

Beyond just futures trading, Coinbase is also making moves toward bringing more assets on-chain, aligning with the broader industry trend of tokenization and blockchain integration into financial services. 

Coinbase goes on-chain

This push is not just about increasing trading options - it is also about compliance and accessibility. Some assets may only be available to accredited investors or require verification under U.S. law, and Coinbase is working on ways to navigate these barriers within the decentralized ecosystem.

With ADA's inclusion, the exchange is making it clear that blockchain networks with strong technological foundations are seen as valuable components of the evolving financial infrastructure. Whether this signals further institutional interest or simply a logical extension of market trends, it is evident that ADA's role in crypto trading is being reinforced. 

As Coinbase continues to expand its reach, the question is not just which assets will be added next but how this growing integration will shape the future of digital asset trading as a whole.

Lawrence Jengar
 Mar 20, 2025 04:08


Cryptocurrency is increasingly used in fentanyl trafficking, with blockchain intelligence offering critical tools to combat this global issue, according to Chainalysis.

Cryptocurrency has emerged as a significant facilitator in the global fentanyl trade, posing both challenges and opportunities for law enforcement agencies trying to combat the opioid epidemic. According to Chainalysis, the intertwining of digital currencies with illicit drug trade is more substantial than commonly perceived.

The synthetic opioid crisis has been exacerbated by the use of cryptocurrency, which allows drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) to bypass traditional financial systems. The fentanyl trade involves a broad array of players, including precursor manufacturers, darknet markets (DNMs), drug forums, and research chemical vendors, all utilizing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) to conduct transactions.

Precursor manufacturers, often based in China, play a pivotal role by supplying chemicals necessary for fentanyl production. These transactions are typically conducted online, with payments made in cryptocurrencies, highlighting the on-chain nexus within the fentanyl ecosystem.

Cryptocurrencies facilitate a broader financial scheme involving countries like China, Mexico, and the U.S. Chinese money laundering networks are increasingly collaborating with Mexican DTOs to launder proceeds from drug sales. Despite China's cryptocurrency ban, it remains a major source of fentanyl precursors and related services.

Recent cases have shown the reach of these networks. For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned individuals and entities across the globe for their roles in the fentanyl trade, including Chinese chemical traders and Canadian entities facilitating the distribution of chemical precursors.

Blockchain analytics have proven to be a powerful tool in tracing and disrupting these illicit activities. For example, a civil forfeiture case in Wisconsin resulted in the seizure of over $5.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical suppliers. Chainalysis highlighted how blockchain data can reveal financial flows that would otherwise remain hidden.

Another case involved a family in Pennsylvania who used cryptocurrency to facilitate the distribution of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl. This case exemplifies how fentanyl distribution is not limited to large networks but also includes smaller, decentralized operations.

Chainalysis emphasizes the importance of using blockchain intelligence to proactively generate threat intelligence and promote collaboration among global law enforcement agencies. By analyzing cryptocurrency transactions, authorities can identify and disrupt financial networks involved in the fentanyl trade.

While the use of cryptocurrency in drug trafficking poses significant challenges, it also offers opportunities for disruption. By leveraging blockchain intelligence, law enforcement agencies can trace financial activities and dismantle networks involved in the illicit drug trade.

For more information, visit the Chainalysis website.

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) filed papers on Tuesday criticising the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights.

The lawsuit seeks an end to what it describes as ""monopolistic control"" of the tennis tour, as well as financial compensation from the ATP, the WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

""It was surprising for me, because no one had told me about it,"" Alcaraz, 21, told reporters at the Miami Open.

""There are things I agree with and there are other things I don't agree with. The main thing is I don't support what was done.""

The ATP Tour, the men's professional body, has been critical of the advocacy group, saying it was guilty of ""division and distraction"" while the WTA, which oversees the women's tour, called the lawsuit ""regrettable and misguided"".

The complaint is being brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Djokovic's co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios. They say the action is acting ""on behalf of the entire player population"".

The lawsuit has accused governing bodies of disregarding player welfare and included a quote from four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz, who criticised the hectic calendar last September.

""Yesterday I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn't aware of it. I honestly don't support that letter, because I wasn't aware of it,"" Alcaraz said.

Formed in 2020, the PTPA wants to increase the amount of control players to run the game and reduce the role of the governing bodies.

It says the governing bodies act as a ""cartel"" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money. It has also described the ranking points system as ""draconian"".

			Saudi restrictions on women's rights makes nation's financial support for mothers on tour deeply uncomfortable

When the Women's Tennis Association unveiled its maternity policy earlier this month, it was billed as a breakthrough moment for women's sport.

Under the scheme, players who pause their careers to have children will be able to access maternity leave for up to a year, while grants for fertility treatments, including egg-freezing and IVF, will also be made available. Those who become a parent via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption will also be entitled to two months of paid leave. Never before has such a comprehensive maternity policy been packaged together for female athletes.

The WTA estimates that the world's top 320 players will be eligible for the scheme, which those on the lower rungs of tennis's ranking ladder will no doubt welcome. It also claims it is an example of female empowerment.

Pioneering? Groundbreaking? Trailblazing? If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. The less celebratory fact is that the WTA's maternity scheme will be bankrolled entirely by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), marking a significant development in the multi-year partnership the organisation signed with the country's sovereign wealth fund in May last year. Forget the Saudi Pro League, LIV Golf and Fifa awarding the 2034 men's World Cup to the kingdom – this is the grossest example of sportswashing yet.

Nobody is disputing the WTA's intention here. No sportswoman should be disadvantaged for wanting to start a family and the organisation rightly wants to support mothers who compete on the tour. Victoria Azarenka, a representative on the WTA Players' Council who gave birth to her son Leo in 2016, described the news as “incredible” and claimed it would help normalise motherhood in sport. But there are also uncomfortable questions.

Any notion of progress is completely undermined by the WTA's dependence on a country that jails and tortures those who campaign for women's rights. On The Tennis Podcast (listen below), sports commentator Catherine Whitaker went as far as to claim the situation would not look out of place in The Handmaid's Tale, claiming female tennis players are now being used as “pawns” by the Saudi state.

When asked about the disconnect between employment benefits for women being so closely tied to a nation whose human-rights record for women and LGBTQ+ people has been heavily criticised by human rights groups, Portia Archer, the WTA's chief executive, was quick to swat away any controversy. “Questions about Saudi society are really not questions for me or the WTA,” was the pointed response she gave in a video interview. “They're questions for the Saudis to answer.”

Any element of truth to this was dwarfed by her ignorance. Saudi Arabia might have advanced women's rights in recent years – women in the country are eligible for 10 weeks of paid maternity leave – but by using Saudi Arabia's public money to position itself as a bastion of female empowerment, the WTA is complicit in the country's ongoing persecution of women. It is complicit in the kidnapping of women such as Manahel al-Otaibi, a 30-year-old fitness instructor and women's rights activist. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison for “terrorist offences” after posting photos of herself in a shopping mall without wearing an abaya, a traditional Saudi dress, on Snapchat.

Manahel's sister, Fawzia, who has been campaigning for her sister's release since she forcibly disappeared between November 2023 and January last year, expressed her indignation at the WTA's maternity scheme on social media.

While Saudi Arabia funds paid maternity leave for WTA players, my sister, a fitness trainer, Manahel remains imprisoned and tortured simply for being a woman who chose to live freely.Saudi Arabia doesn't support women—it buys global silence on its crimes against them… https://t.co/dMfDmqf4Tt pic.twitter.com/S3Rezjt8Y9

While official figures have not been disclosed, it is thought players who compete in 15 events a year on the WTA tour will be entitled to monthly maternity payments of up to $7,000 (£5,395). When you consider Saudi's PIF is valued at £712 billion – and at present around 20 mothers are competing on the circuit – the total sum of the scheme will hardly make a dent in the fund.

And where does this leave players such as Daria Kasatkina, currently ranked just outside the world's top 10, who came out publicly in July 2022? Given same-sex relationships in Mohammed bin Salman's nation are punishable by the death penalty under a system of Sharia law, it is a significant grey area. The WTA would not comment directly on the issue to Telegraph Sport, clarifying that the scheme would simply be available to “any eligible players”.

Tennis can skirt around the subject as much as it likes, but the jarring reality is this: the Saudi state stumping up the cash to fund players' maternity leave in an attempt to sanitise its public image and distract from its own human-rights abuses is deeply uncomfortable.

Something went wrong

Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz insists he does not support legal action taken against the ATP and WTA Tours by Novak Djokovic's Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA).

The PTPA this week brought lawsuits “on behalf of the entire player population” against tennis chiefs, alleging that they abused their dominant position to the detriment of players' welfare.

Comments made by Alcaraz to the media appear in documents supporting the legal action but the Spaniard says he wasn't aware of it and doesn't endorse it.

“It was surprising for me, because no one had told me about it,” said the four-time Grand Slam winner.

“There are things I agree with and there are other things I don't agree with. The main thing is I don't support what was done.

“Yesterday I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn't aware of it. I honestly don't support that letter, because I wasn't aware of it.”

The PTPA, which was founded by Djokovic, hopes to force reform by suing the men's and women's elite tours, the International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency, which manages anti-doping efforts in the game.

Djokovic is not named as one of the 12 plaintiffs, which include co-founder and former player Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios, but is “certainly very involved”, PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar has said. Alcaraz is not among the dozen.

It wants more prize money, which it says is suppressed by collusion between the tours and tournament organisers, and a shorter season to replace the “unsustainable” current 11-month calendar.

The PTPA also takes issue with the methods employed by the ITIA, including “invasive searches of personal devices and random middle-of-the-night drug tests”.

It says it has brought the legal action in the US, EU and UK after becoming frustrated with attempts to achieve change through talks.

The tours have vowed to defend themselves, with the ATP calling the action “entirely without merit” and the WTA labelling it “both regrettable and misguided”.","{'href': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance UK'}"

Tennis star Francisco Comesana was so desperate to light a cigarette, he did so courtside at the Miami Open. The Argentine had been competing against Michael Mmoh in a qualifying match when he was spotted taking a drag mid-match.

Comesana won the first set against the American, with the 24-year-old retiring to his seat in Miami for a quick cigarette break. What's more, Comesana even had the cheek to ask the umpire if he could light it for him.

Speaking to the official, Comesana asked: “Excuse me, do you have a light.” Unsurprisingly, the umpire remained unmoved by the request.

It proved a good luck charm for Comesana, who went on to beat Mmoh in straight sets, securing a 6-3, 6-4 victory. As a result, he progressed into the second qualifying match, which he also won, this time against Shintaro Mochizuki. Comesana beat the Japanese ace 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 to move into the main draw.

However, the cigarette-wielding tennis star would see his tournament come to an end in the first round proper when he was paired up against teenage sensation Federico Cina. It wasn't for a lack of trying on Comesana's part, as Cina needed deciders in both sets, eventually winning the match 6-7 (4-7), 6-7 (2-7).

17 years and 354 days oldFederico Cinà is the youngest Italian player able to win an ATP Tour match since Jannik Sinner did so in 2019He gets a very convincing 7-6 7-6 win over Francisco Comesaña and flies into the Miami Masters R2 pic.twitter.com/OBgKrtebz4

With the win, Cina became the first player born in 2007 to win an ATP 1000 tournament, with the Italian reflecting on his epic victory by saying: “I'm very happy. It was very difficult. But I'm very happy to win. I started the match very good, played a very good tie-break. Then in the second set, I was [ahead] 5-2, then I got cramps. But it was very good to stay there every point.”

The 17-year-old comes from a tennis-loving family and is coached by his father Francesco - an ex-coach to Italian tennis star Roberta Vinci. Francesco, who also runs a tennis academy in Palermo, said of his son: “Federico really likes this life and doesn't feel the pressure at the moment; he enjoys doing what he loves.

“Federico feels better on clay and hard courts, but overall he prefers to play on hard court. He needs to improve his serve, and this will happen with physical growth. During preparation, we worked well on this fundamental, and I am sure that in the coming months he will be able to serve even better. His forehand is showing great improvements, while his two-handed backhand remains his best shot.""

Cina faces the biggest game of his fledgling career against Grigor Dimitrov in Miami on Friday.

 This marks their second consecutive championship win for Team America

Team America emerged victorious in the 2025 Rainbow Nations Challenge, successfully defending their title in a thrilling competition at the Accra Lawn Tennis Club.

This marks their second consecutive championship win in the prestigious tournament.

""It's a great feeling. This is the second time we have won this tournament—two in a row—and it took a lot of effort on our part,"" a member of Team America said after their victory.

The team endured a demanding schedule, playing nine matches over two days. Adverse weather conditions on Thursday, March 13, 2025, forced delays, compressing the schedule into a single intense day of competition.

""We played a total of nine matches, which is a lot to fit into two days. Unfortunately, we got rained out on Thursday and had to play everything today. But we had a lot of fun—it's a great tournament and a fantastic way to network,"" the player added.

The Rainbow Nations Tennis Tournament, now in its fourth edition, continues to foster sportsmanship, unity, and community development.

This year's event featured 56 players from 23 countries, reflecting the tournament's growing reputation as a global sporting spectacle.

With another thrilling edition in the books, teams will now look ahead to 2026, hoping to challenge Team America's dominance and etch their names into the tournament's history.

BOILING SPRINGS, N.C. – The Gardner-Webb University men's tennis team has made its debut in the 2025 ITA Division I National Poll, checking in at No. 70 in the latest rankings as announced on Tuesday, March 18 following an impressive start to the season.

The Runnin' Bulldogs have amassed a brilliant 15-4 overall record, including 2-0 in Big South Conference action. Gardner-Webb picked up its biggest win of the season on March 10, a 5-2 victory at then No. 72 Liberty University. During conference play, the 'Dawgs have not dropped a single flight, defeating Presbyterian and Longwood 7-0.

Head coach Mike Griffith on the team's achievement: ""To be in the national rankings is a huge accomplishment for our team, alumni, and friends of GWU Tennis. It was one of our preseason goals, but we are not finished yet.""

The ITA Rankings Algorithm is based on an accumulation of win points and loss points, accounting for a win-loss record, the strength of schedule, and the depth/significance of wins and losses. As the season progresses, the value of each win and loss adjusts to reflect the most recent ranking of the opponent.

Rutgers started the spring 9-3, their best start since the COVID-19 shortened 2020 season. The team also added two Big Ten regular season wins, defeating Michigan State and Minnesota.  

Rutgers made history in the ITA rankings, claiming its first-ever team and doubles ranking. The Scarlet Knights reached as high as No. 68 in the polls while the pair of Amira Badawi and Mai Nguyen came in at a season-best No. 54.  

Graduate Student Yana Gurevich became the first Scarlet Knight in program history to earn All-Big Ten honors, after going 12-5 in conference play.

Chilton, who came to Rutgers in the fall of 2023 at the start of her junior season, has made a long-lasting impact on the Scarlet Knights. During her time On The Banks Chilton has excelled in all areas including in tennis, academics and volunteering in her community. 

""The Arthur Ashe Award is a prestigious ITA Award and Tara is a perfect recipient,"" head coach Hilary Ritchie said. ""Tara always strives for excellence. In her two years at Rutgers, she made a big impact on our team, the business school and the student-athlete community overall."" 

The ITA Assistant Coach of the Year honors an assistant coach who has exhibited outstanding leadership in ways that contribute to on and off-court team performance. These are qualities that assistant coach Barrett has exemplified since arriving On The Banks.  

""Hailey is so deserving of this award,"" Ritchie said. ""She wears an incredible number of hats to help this team and the individual student-athletes as well. During a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in college athletics, Hailey always remains positive and puts her passion for tennis first.""

In the offseason, head coach Hilary Ritchie welcomed four newcomers to the team including two freshman in Zeynep Ilker and Karina Jumazhanova in addition to two transfers in Zuzanna Frankowska and Zhou ""Cindy"" Xintong.

DEI Resources

 

Tempe, AZ – Working in collaboration with the ITA Student-Athlete Council, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (“ITA”) is proud to spotlight another student-athlete in our monthly heritage month spotlights that aim to highlight the many diverse backgrounds that make up the sport of college tennis.

With March being Women's History Month, the ITA is continuing to spotlight female student-athletes and coaches, allowing them to have a platform to share their stories and experiences. This week's spotlight features Lindsay Eisenman from CMS who has been a leader of one of the nation's top programs, helping guide the Athena's to an NCAA Championship her freshman year and a ITA National Team Indoor Championship last year. 

As a three-time ITA All-American (2x Doubles, 1x Singles) during her first two seasons with the Athenas, Eisenman has quickly cemented herself as one of the top players in the country, compiling a 41-11 singles record from the No. 1 spot for CMS. As a freshman, Eisenman went 40-1 in all dual match competition (20-1 in singles, 20-0 in doubles) helping the Athenas to a NCAA Championship.

Returning last season with more pressure and more of a leadership role on the team, Eisenman rose once again to the occasion finishing as a finalist at the ITA Cup and clinching the ITA National Team Indoor Championship title over UChicago to claim her second National Championship in as many years. This season, Eisenman is once again playing an influential role for a CMS team that finished as the ITA National Team Indoor Championship finalists and who currently rank No. 2 in the country.

In this spotlight, Eisenman will share a little bit about herself and some of her experiences as a female athlete in the tennis community and how she hopes to make an impact on future generations.

See what Eisenman had to say in this spotlight below:

How did you start playing tennis? What inspired you to pursue tennis at this level?I was introduced to tennis at a young age by my dad, who played at UC Berkeley and competed on the pro tour. He would take me to public courts where we'd hit together, and I soon fell in love with the sport. Even though I played several other sports growing up, tennis stood out to me because it was more of an individual sport that constantly challenged me to improve. I loved the competition aspect, strategy, and the sense of accomplishment that came with hard work day in and day out. As I played more tournaments and built friendships within the tennis community, I knew I wanted to continue playing at a high level. Through years of dedication, I worked my way up to playing and competing in national tournaments, and eventually, the opportunity to play for CMS. Through college tennis, I have had the opportunity to see the collaborative and team-oriented side of tennis, which has only inspired me more.

Who were your role models or biggest supporters along the way? How did they influence your tennis career?My biggest supporters have always been my parents, who made my dream of playing college tennis possible. My dad, in particular, was a huge influence—not only as my role model but also as my coach. He was a successful college player himself, and throughout my junior career, he trained with me every day, taking me to tournaments on the weekends and being my biggest motivator. He taught me the value of perseverance, mental toughness, and discipline. These qualities have shaped my approach to both tennis and life. My mom has also been instrumental, offering constant encouragement and unconditional support. My parents continue to show this same support in my college career, coming to a majority of my matches.

Did you face any challenges as a woman pursuing sports at a high level? If so, how did you overcome them?Yes, I've faced challenges, especially in terms of equal recognition and support for women's sports in comparison to men's. Growing up, I often noticed that boys' matches drew larger crowds and received more media attention, which was discouraging at times. There were also moments when I felt underestimated or had to prove myself more, simply because I was a woman in sport. However, I used those experiences as motivation to work even harder. I surrounded myself with a strong support system who reinforced my belief in my abilities. At Claremont McKenna, I'm involved in the Women Empowerment in Sports Club, which has also provided me with a network of strong and supportive women who are involved in different collegiate sports but collectively uplift each other. Overcoming these challenges required resilience and confidence, and I hope to inspire young girls to push past similar barriers in their own journeys.

What has been the most rewarding part of your college tennis experience so far?Winning the NCAA championship my freshman year in Orlando has definitely been the most rewarding part of my college tennis experience so far. That victory wasn't just about the title and the trophy that came with it; it highlighted the reward of months of dedication, early morning lifts, late-night practices, and the commitment of our entire team. The journey was just as rewarding as the result, and sharing that experience with my teammates, who had become some of my closest friends, made it even more special. The joy, camaraderie, and sense of accomplishment in that moment reminded me why I love this sport and competing for my college.

Did you have a favorite female athlete you looked up to as a child? How did seeing this representation inspire you to pursue sports?Maria Sharapova was my favorite female athlete growing up. Although I admired her aggressive game style, what stood out the most to me was her mentality. She never showed doubt, never let emotions take over, and always fought until the very last point. Whenever I would watch her play, I could never tell if she was winning or losing based on her attitude and body language. I tried to embody that same resilience in my own game. Seeing a strong female athlete dominate on the biggest stages reassured me that women's tennis was a space where I could thrive, and it pushed me to pursue my own aspirations.

What advice would you give to young girls who dream of playing college tennis?I would tell young girls who dream of playing college tennis to trust the process and focus on consistent improvement rather than immediate results. Success in tennis isn't about winning every junior match—it's about developing your game, learning from the tough losses, and staying dedicated to growth so that you can become a better player. Improvement is not a straight line and sometimes comes with ups and downs that provide crucial lessons for long term success. It is important to work hard every time you step on the court and to keep a positive attitude. Most importantly, enjoy the journey! Tennis is an incredible sport that can open so many doors and create lifelong friendships.

What are some ways that female athletes can be better supported in collegiate athletics? Are there any specific changes or initiatives you'd like to see in college athletics to uplift female student-athletes?I think increasing visibility and equal support for women's sports is crucial. That means better attendance at matches, more media coverage, and equal access to resources like facilities and coaching staff. At my school, I'm involved in the Women Empowerment in Sports Club, which works to support female athletes and empower the younger generation. One of my favorite events has been celebrating National Girls and Women in Sports Day, where we introduce elementary school girls to different sports and host a “Women and Historical Events in Sports” bingo game. I'd love to see similar programs expand at other universities, fostering mentorship between college athletes and younger girls. Representation matters, and when girls see strong female athletes being celebrated, it inspires them to chase their own dreams.

What legacy do you hope to leave for future women's tennis players at your school or in the sport overall?I hope to leave a legacy of resilience, leadership, and community. I want to be remembered not just for my performance on the court but for the impact I had in supporting my teammates and uplifting women's tennis at my school and broader community. I want future players to know that their presence, their efforts, and their dreams are just as valuable as anyone else's. If I can inspire even one young girl to believe in herself and pursue tennis with confidence, then I know I've made a difference. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to a culture where female athletes continue to be empowered, celebrated, and given the opportunities they deserve.

For someone who does not like change in her life, Giovanna Patrocinio made a big one when coming to the United States for school from her home in Brazil. Patrocinio knew it was the best option for her to continue playing tennis, the sport she's always loved. She had a couple of schools in mind, but she's happy she picked Augusta University.

""In Brazil I live in a big city and Augusta is one of those cities that is big but not the biggest one. I like the size of the classes here and I love the tennis program,"" she said.

Patrocinio only remembers her life with tennis in it, she's been playing since she was five years old. There was never going to be another sport for her.

""My father is a tennis coach, and my grandfather played tennis. My mom is a big fan of tennis. They've always supported me with tennis,"" said Patrocinio.

Her dad was actually her tennis coach for most of her life up until two years before leaving Brazil. This had its challenges in the beginning, but she appreciated he was always in her corner. Her dad knows her best and can push her the way she needs it.

One of Patrocinio's biggest challenges when coming to AU was the fact that tennis was more than just an individual sport, it was a team one. It was such an adjustment for her that when she first arrived here, and it was her worst times playing tennis.

""My first couple of matches I couldn't play. It was like three horrible matches on the court. I was anxious and nervous. It was horrible, I can say that. The worst moment of tennis for me, but then after that I was fine,"" said Patrocinio.

She can now say she prefers the team aspect and the energy it brings. Patrocinio knows the team is always there to support each other, win or lose and the pressure isn't just on one person.

Patrocinio has two more years at AU playing tennis, but she knows once she graduates, she'll be done playing competitively. Her love for the sport won't go away and she still plans to play for fun or even give lessons when she can.

Her plans after graduation consist of her going to school for her masters. She started college with a declared major in psychology but quickly changed it to kinesiology and she's still working towards that goal. But when she's done, she wants to pursue a masters in either sports psychology or athletic training. Patrocinio is unsure what school she wants to do this at but has time to figure it out.

One thing about Patrocinio is she does not like being alone. The only time she enjoys being alone is right before bed.

""I really like to just be around people. I hate to be alone. I love to be around people talking and doing something. I hate to spend all day at home,"" she said.

She also really loves to travel and one of her favorite places so far was the Netherlands visiting her aunt. She considers her time there as her best summer so far. It has left her wanting to travel to more countries in Europe.

Since coming to the U.S. Patrocinio hasn't been able to drive since she only has a license from Brazil. She's happy to report that she'll be taking her test soon and is excited to finally have her car.
""Here it is easier to drive. The city I live in is a big city and it is horrible to drive in. Like a lot of traffic. It's very stressful. I'm not worried about driving here,"" said Patrocinio.

While she misses Brazil and seeing her family (and really the food), she values the support she has from them. She's also excited because during spring break her parents and little brother will be making a trip to see her.

Patrocinio might be naturally shy she does eventually gets comfortable enough to be herself. It took two months when she joined the team before she really started talking to her teammates. But now she considers everyone on both the men's and women's team as close friends.  

""We are all together a lot,"" said Patrocinio. ""We always make plans with each other. It helps us not be so alone especially when we miss home.""

information submitted by Coach Sorenson

Final Scores:

It was an interesting day on the court as Okanogan arrived with only four boys, leading to an unusual match setup. Right from the start, Okanogan forfeited the #2 Singles, #3 Singles, and #2 Doubles matches, which resulted in automatic wins for Carston Steiner, PD Sanchez, and the doubles team of Gabe Cameron/Dylan Farrar for Manson. To complete the match, Okanogan had to rotate players, making for a unique competitive experience.

On the girls' side, all matches were played as scheduled, and the Trojans secured dominant victories. Destiny Lopez controlled her #2 Singles match with a 6-1 win, while Maggie Gosvener blanked her opponent at #3 Singles with a perfect 6-0, 6-0 score. The doubles teams of Kayden Koth/Addie Richmond (#1 Doubles) and Stella Petersen/Brynn Williams (#2 Doubles) also won decisively at 6-0, (6-0).

With rain starting to pour heavily, the Okanogan coach called the match early, granting wins to those who had already established commanding leads. Despite the challenging conditions, the Trojans walked away with two wins

FLORENCE, Ala. (March 19, 2025) – The University of North Alabama men's tennis team earned its first home win in Atlantic Sun Conference play Wednesday afternoon, rolling to a 6-1 triumph over the Lipscomb Bisons in Florence.

In the home test against the Bisons, North Alabama excelled with the dominant effort from the UNA Tennis Courts. The Lions took the doubles point against the Bisons, extending the momentum into singles play with five of the six courts won by UNA. North Alabama gained its 12th win of the campaign to improve to 12-3, while the Lions stay perfect in conference play with a 3-0 record. The UNA Tennis Courts continue to prove a tough venue for opposing teams, as UNA also stays perfect in home action with a 6-0 record.

All six Lions secured wins against the Bisons, with senior Nazar Fedoryshyn, junior Lachlan Brain and sophomore Birtan Duran leading the way with a singles and doubles win. Brain picked up his sixth singles win and fifth doubles victory, while Duran won for the ninth time in singles and eighth in doubles. Fedoryshyn claimed his eighth doubles win in a court-two victory with Duran, along with his fourth singles win.

Dominguez and Brain got the day started from the third doubles court, opening with a 6-2 win over Giovanni Ciocca and Oliver Thoeny. Duran and Fedoryshyn followed with a court-two victory, seizing the doubles point for UNA in a hard-fought, 7-5 triumph over Oskar Szymczak and Antoine Testaud.

Orgiles got the winning started in singles, taking the second court with a 6-1, 6-1 win over Ciocca. Brain earned the Lions second-straight singles win, rolling from the top flight in a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Szymczak. Fedoryshyn's second win of the day clinched the team dual, with the senior defeating Testaud, 6-1, 6-3, from the fifth flight.

Altur kept UNA's winning ways going from flight three, beating Juan Lombisano in a 6-2, 6-2 result. The final win came from Duran, with the sophomore victorious over Facundo Perlov from flight four, 6-3, 6-1.

VICKSBURG, Miss.(VHS)–The Vicksburg High School Tennis Team secured a decisive victory over Callaway High School on senior night, marking their first district match win of the season in a 6-1 victory. This achievement reflects the team's dedication, hard work, and commitment to excellence on the court. Under the leadership of Coach Monica Williams, the

players have demonstrated strong teamwork, resilience, and skill, paving the way for continued success.

“Last night was bittersweet,” said Coach Monica Williams. “Winning our district match was an incredible achievement, but saying goodbye to five remarkable seniors made it an emotional night. Kennedy Mullen, Alysha Murrell, Midori Allen, Gideon Thompson, and Sam Baker have been the heart of our team, demonstrating leadership, dedication, and passion for the game. Their impact extends far beyond the court, and they will truly be missed. I am so proud of everything they have accomplished, and I know they have bright futures ahead.”

Kennedy Mullins earned shutout wins in the girl's singles(6-0,6-0) against Madison Williams. Chaez Moore took home a victory in the boy's singles(6-0,6-2) over Tyler Wells. 

Sam Baker and Gideon Thompson both teamed up in the boy's doubles(6-2,6-0) for a win while Arthur Davis and Kaleb Bailey came out on top in the boy's doubles 2(6-2,6-0).

The girls' doubles was a hard-fought battle as Grace Tyler and Madison Bailey finished strong(4-6, 6-6, 7-5, 10-8). Midori Allen and Alysha Murrell defeated Krista Harris and Paige Wells in the girl's doubles 2(6-1,6-2).

The Gators only took one loss in the win which was in the mixed doubles.

BRIDGEWATER, Mass. -- The Bridgewater State University men's tennis team entertains Wentworth Institute of Technology on Thursday afternoon at 3:30 from the Rosen Memorial Tennis Courts. The match maks the home opener for the Bears.

Bridgewater opened the 2025 season earlier this week with a 6-3 victory at Thomas College. Wentworth enters today's match with an overall record of 1-7. The Leopards, who are coming off a 5-2 win over Rhode Island College this past weekend at RIC, competed three times in the fall as well as four matches earlier this month during their Spring Break trip to Orlando, Florida.

The two teams have met seven times since 2015 with six of the seven matches taking place at the Rosen Courts. Wentworth has won five of the seven meetings including a 6-3 victory last season.

 Gustavus Adolphus College

3/22/2025 | 2:00 PM

Tufts (8-1) set the tone early in doubles, with the top pairing of Vuk Vuksanovic and Javier Gonzalez cruising to a 6-2 victory over Hopkins' Dylan Blenkiron and Daniel Ardila. The momentum carried over to the second and third courts, where Lachie Macintosh and Derin Acaroglu clinched a 6-3 win, while Nico Tremblay and Sacha Maes closed out the sweep with a 6-4 victory at No. 3. The Jumbos' ability to control the net and capitalize on key points put them in the driver's seat heading into singles play.

Tufts wasted no time extending its advantage, with Vuksanovic delivering a clinical 6-2, 6-0 win over Ardila at No. 1 singles. Gonzalez followed suit with an equally dominant 6-1, 6-1 triumph over Rajendra at the No. 2 spot, showcasing his consistency and aggressive baseline play.

At No. 5, first-year Stavros Mastrogamvrakis put in a rock-solid performance, dispatching Allen Gong 6-2, 6-2 to clinch the team victory, while junior Alex Ganchev sealed the team victory with a 7-5, 6-3 win at No. 6, overcoming a tight opening set before pulling away.

The match of the day came at No. 3 singles, where Acaroglu battled through a three-set thriller against Blenkiron. After splitting the first two sets, the Tufts senior held his nerve in a marathon super tiebreaker, edging out a 15-13 victory to add to the Jumbos' tally.

Johns Hopkins managed to salvage a point at No. 4, where Zahari Stoimenov outlasted Andrej Djokic in another three-set battle, 6-4, 4-6, 10-7. But by that point, Tufts had already secured a resounding win.

Tufts will now return home to take on No. 14 Gustavus Adolphus College Saturday at 2 p.m. in non-conference play at Voute Courts at the Tufts Tennis Center.

Venus Williams is a five-time Wimbledon singles champion and won the US Open singles twice

At the end of March, Venus Williams will lose her world ranking and her page on the WTA Tour website will turn from purple to grey.

The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion will be considered an inactive player, having gone a whole year without competing.

But that status may not last long. The feeling persists that the American icon is not yet ready for retirement.

A wildcard for Indian Wells was announced but then swiftly declined. A ""miscommunication"" was the reason given.

Sources say Williams was then offered a wildcard for the Miami Open, which began on Tuesday and was the venue of her last match.

The 44-year-old thought about it for a couple of days - although it was no great surprise when she turned it down.

However, the Florida resident did take to the practice court there on Wednesday for a session with Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.

Indian Wells and Miami were the only two tournaments Williams played last year. 

Her last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that.

The last time Williams played a full schedule was 2019. 

It was some achievement to do so in the year she turned 39, having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, external - an autoimmune condition which can cause fatigue and joint pain - a few years earlier.

But turning 45 - which she will do just two weeks before Wimbledon on 17 June - is historically not a barrier to competing on tour. After all, Martina Navratilova won a singles match at the All England Club aged 47. 

Should Williams request a wildcard for either Wimbledon, where she is a five-time singles champion, or for the US Open, where she won the singles title twice, it seems unlikely it would be rejected.

Fashion is a big part of Williams' life and she was at Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago - one of the reasons she did not play in Indian Wells.

She owns the interior design company V Starr but, even though more than 30 years have passed since her professional debut, many feel she will attempt a final foray into professional tennis.

It is possible Williams, who is ranked number 1,151, will never retire. 

Former US Open and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has not played since Wimbledon 2021, but is yet formally to call it a day. 

Venus' sister Serena, meanwhile, did not like the word retirement, preferring instead  to ""evolve away from the sport"" in September 2022.

Serena's name does, however, appear on the International Tennis Integrity Agency's retired players list. 

Joining that list is a strong commitment to retiring, as any player who later changes their mind must make themselves available for drug testing for six months before returning to play.

It means Venus could still expect a visit from out-of-competition testers. But she no longer needs to submit details of her daily whereabouts as she was removed from the international registered testing pool last June - a usual process for singles players who drop out of the world's top 100.

Williams has not played frequently enough to qualify as either a full or associate member of the WTA Tour this year, but she has also not completed a WTA retirement form. 

To play again she would need to fill out an annual player form and find a $250 administration fee from the nearly $43m of prize money she has earned. 

Her management team did not respond to a request for information about her plans and it seems Williams will keep us guessing a little longer. Any ideas she might have for the summer have not been widely shared within the sport.

Many retirement tributes have been written and signed off a long time ago.

They may still need updating.

Warren's boys tennis team opened with a 5-2 win over District 9's Elk County Catholic on Wednesday at Betts Park.

“We decided to play by the District 9 format today to get more kids in the lineup,” said Warren coach Thomas Pellegrino. “They play a 4-3 (four singles and three doubles) format, which allowed us to get 10 players into the lineup tonight.”

Warren won three of the four singles matches.

At top singles, Adam Strandburg defeated Bradyn Pistner, 6-1, 6-0. 

“Adam set the tone for the team today,” said Pellegrino. “He went out there, played aggressive and put pressure on his opponent early and never let up.”

At No. 2, Lucas Thrift defeated Frank Messineo, 6-3, 6-3.

At third singles, Brody Alexander defeated Julien Lanzel, 6-1, 6-1. 

“Brody played steady from the baseline today and kept his errors to a minimum,” said Pellegrino. “This was a solid showing for his singles debut.”

At No. 4, ECC's Will Wortman edged Warren's Finn Ordiway, 6-0, 2-6, 10-8. 

“In doubles action, we had three competitive matches as ECC elected to repeat all of their top singles players,” said Pellegrino.

At first doubles, the Warren duo of Jack Lynds and Ben Scott defeated Pistner and Lanzel, 8-3. 

“This was a competitive matchup for Jack and Ben as they were playing a team's (numbers) one and three,” said Pellegrino. “Coach Tarpenning and I were impressed with how they handled the matchup and took care of business.”

At No. 2, the ECC pair of Messineo and Wortman defeated Jaxon Thrift and Collin Ellis, 8-6.

At third doubles, the Warren duo of Bill Bennett and Owen Baldensperger defeated Simon Dornisch and Mac Messineo, 8-3. 

“Bill and Owen stepped on the court when the team match was at 3-0 and wanted to be the ones to seal things up,” said Pellegrino. “They got off to a quick 4-1 start and took over the net to close out the match for the Dragons.”

Josh Westover, Elliott Striker, Gabe Dougherty, Karson McCollough, and Tobia Reinard were victorious in junior varsity play.  

“Being the first match of the season, we were happy with today's performance,” added Pellegrino. “We had the opportunity to start 10 players tonight and get a good look at options as we go into region matchups in a couple weeks.”

Former finalist Kei Nishikori announced his withdrawal from the Miami Open presented by Itau on Thursday, citing a back injury ahead of his opener at the ATP Masters 1000.

The Japanese 35-year-old reached the semi-finals of an ATP Challenger Tour event in Phoenix last week, where he fell to the eventual champion Joao Fonseca. Nishikori, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2016 Miami final, was scheduled to play countryman Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round on Thursday.



“Unfortunately I have to pull out of the @MiamiOpen today,” Nishikori, the former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, wrote on X. “My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season.”

Unfortunately I have to pull out of the @MiamiOpen today. My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season.

Nishikori has been hampered by various injuries since undergoing hip surgery in 2022. The 12-time ATP Tour champion played just one tour-level event in 2023 before making his comeback at the end of the 2024 season. After reaching the quarter-finals at his home ATP 500 in Tokyo and winning a Challenger Tour event in Helsinki, Nishikori was nominated for ATP's Comeback Player of the Year in 2024.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Thursday to close the Education Department, fulfilling a yearslong pledge to dismantle the federal agency, the White House confirmed.

Trump will hold an event at the White House to sign the order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”

USA Today first reported that Trump will sign the order Thursday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared the story Thursday morning in a post to X, writing in all-capital letters that the signing was ""happening today at 4pm ET.""

Formally closing the department requires an act of Congress. But even without formally shutting it down, the Trump administration could effectively make it nearly impossible for employees to carry out their work, as it has done with the U.S. Agency for International Development.

President Jimmy Carter established the department in 1979 after Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act in bipartisan votes.

McMahon recently moved to drastically reduce the size of the Education Department by cutting its workforce in half. She called the job terminations the first step toward shutting down the department.

""That was the president's mandate,"" McMahon said last week in an interview with Fox News. ""His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know we'll have to work with Congress, you know, to get that accomplished.""

McMahon similarly vowed at her Senate confirmation hearing to work with Congress to advance Trump's plan to dismantle the department. She telegraphed in an email to employees this month that major changes were coming.

“Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected, who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education—a momentous final mission—quickly and responsibly,” she wrote, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.

The Senate confirmed McMahon in a 51-45 vote. No Democrat voted for her.

Trump has suggested that he could garner enough congressional support to formally close the department, characterizing teachers unions as more of a threat to the plan than lawmakers.

“I think I'd work with Congress,” Trump said last month in the Oval Office. “We'd have to work with the teachers union, because the teachers union is the only one that's opposed to it.”

It is unclear whether Trump has secured the support of any Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have balked at his efforts on that front.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, accused Trump and Elon Musk, the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, of “robbing our students and families of critical funding.”

“The effects of Trump and Musk's slash and burn campaign will be felt across our state—by students and families who suffer from the loss of Department staff working to ensure their rights under federal law, school districts who have to lay off teachers, students who can't get the help they need to get financial aid, and families who get ripped off because the watchdogs were fired,” Murray said in a statement Wednesday night. “This issue is personal for me, and for every single family. We cannot relent in this fight.”

A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit last week arguing any attempt by Trump to eliminate the department is unlawful.

""Because neither the President nor his agencies can undo the many acts of Congress that authorize the Department, dictate its responsibilities, and appropriate funds for it to administer, the President's directive to eliminate the Department of Education—including through the March 11 decimation of the Department's workforce and any other agency implementation—is an unlawful violation of the separation of powers, and the Executive's obligation to take care that the law be faithfully executed,"" the lawsuit reads.

The Education Department is one of the smallest Cabinet-level departments. Its $268 billion appropriations last year represented 4% of the U.S. budget.

The department does not dictate curricula used in classrooms. It is largely a funding and civil rights enforcement organization, distributing money for schools with high rates of impoverished students and to assist children with disabilities.

It also runs the public student loan program, which has more consumer protections and lower interest rates than private education loan programs.

Trump's executive order will direct McMahon to ensure the agency's funds do not go toward programs or activities that advance diversity, equity and inclusion goals or gender ideology. 

The Education Department last week announced investigations into more than 50 universities it accused of “engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.”

Diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, is a widely used label applied to efforts to improve workplace culture and create more opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and they are not inherently discriminatory.

National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement Wednesday that Trump's effort to close the Education Department could have disastrous implications for students across the country.

""If successful, Trump's continued actions will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections,"" Pringle said in a statement.

She accused Trump and Musk of aiming ""their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America to pay for tax handouts for billionaires.""

McMahon said last week that at least three DOGE staffers had been auditing the Education Department.

Keri Rodrigues, the president of the National Parents Union, said dismantling the department would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities.

“Let's be clear: Before federal oversight, millions of children—particularly those with disabilities and those from our most vulnerable communities—were denied the opportunities they deserved,” Rodrigues said in a statement Wednesday night. “The Department of Education was created to ensure that every child, regardless of background or zip code, has access to a public education that prepares them for their future. Eliminating it would roll back decades of progress, leaving countless children behind in an education system that has historically failed the most marginalized.”

Trump has long pledged to dismantle the Education Department, first mentioning the idea during his previous term and campaigning on the promise extensively throughout the 2024 election. He has suggested that states should take over administering educational policy and that other parts of the federal government could absorb current agency responsibilities, like overseeing federal student loans.

""Your state is going to control your children's education. We're moving it out of Washington immediately,"" Trump said at a campaign event last year in Saginaw, Michigan. ""We're going to do that very fast, and it's going to be great.""

A Georgetown University researcher has been detained by immigration authorities, sources with the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Wednesday amid the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.

Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching on a student visa.

According to a statement from Georgetown University spokesperson, Suri obtained his visa in order ""to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

""We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,"" the school spokesperson told CBS News. ""We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.""

In its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a ""foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.""

The DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had ""close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that ""Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable"" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added. It was unclear exactly how and when Suri was detained. 

According to ICE's online detention locator, Suri was being held at an ICE detention facility at Alexandria International Airport in Louisiana. 

A writ of habeas corpus — a lawsuit challenging Suri's detention — was filed on his behalf on March 18. CBS News has reached out to his attorney. 

This follows the controversial March 8 New York City arrest by ICE agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.

The 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time. 

In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS alleged Khalil's arrest was ""in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,"" alleging the former student ""led activities aligned to Hamas,"" but without providing evidence of the claim or detailing any alleged criminal charges against him. 

A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Khalil's case can be heard in New Jersey, rather than New York or Louisiana. Khalil was briefly held at a detention facility in New Jersey before being moved to Louisiana.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Georgetown University researcher who is married to a Palestinian American was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked, prompting another high-profile legal fight over deportation proceedings against foreign-born visa holders authorized to live in the U.S.

Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India, was arrested Monday night outside of his Virginia home by officers who identified themselves as Department of Homeland Security agents, according to a legal filing by Suri's lawyer.

Hassan Ahmad, Suri's Virginia-based attorney, wrote in a court filing that Suri was targeted because of his wife's “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.”

Suri was later taken to a detention facility in Louisiana, according to a government website. His lawyers are seeking his immediate release and to halt deportation proceedings through their habeas motion filed Tuesday against the Trump administration.

“The Trump Administration has openly expressed its intention to weaponize immigration law to punish noncitizens whose views are deemed critical of U.S. policy as it relates to Israel,” Suri's attorney wrote.

Suri's detention more than 1,000 miles (about 1,600 kilometers) away from his family and attorney is “plainly intended as retaliation and punishment for Mr. Suri's protected speech,"" his attorney added.

The deportation effort comes amid legal fights over cases involving a Columbia University international affairs graduate student and a doctor from Lebanon.

Suri was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media” and determined to be deportable by the Secretary of State's office, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said late Wednesday on X, formerly known as Twitter. Suri's case was first reported by Politico.

The filing by Suri's lawyer said that federal authorities have provided no evidence that he's committed any crimes and that his detention violates his free speech and due process rights. Suri, who has no criminal record, holds a visa authorizing him to be in the U.S. as a visiting scholar, and his wife is a U.S. citizen, according to the motion.

His lawyer didn't immediately respond to an messages seeking further comment Thursday.

Suri's lawyers say he's currently teaching a course at Georgetown and hopes to become a university professor. A Georgetown webpage identifies Suri as a postdoctoral fellow at Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the university. The university said his areas of interest include religion, violence and peace processes in the Middle East and South Asia. The bio said that he earned a doctorate in India while studying efforts to introduce democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq, and he has traveled extensively in conflict zones in several countries.

The university said in a statement Thursday that Suri is an Indian national who was “duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.”

“We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,” the school said. “We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”

The U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement detainee locator website lists Suri as being in the custody of immigration officials at the Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana.

Separately, Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with no criminal record, was detained earlier this month over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. And Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported over the weekend despite having a U.S. visa.

OTTAWA – The tariff war with the United States could have been very different if Canada had decided to build the Energy East and LNG Quebec pipelines over the past decade, according to a new study by the Montreal Economic Institute.

Both pipelines could have redirected $38.4 billion worth of energy products per year to markets other than the United States and the institute argues that the construction of pipelines between Eastern and Western Canada “would have helped diversify Canadian export markets” significantly.

In 2023, Canada exported 97 per cent of its crude oil to the United States.

“Canada's high level of dependence on U.S. trade is not unavoidable. It is the direct result of years of policy decisions that have delayed or actively impeded major infrastructure projects,” said Gabriel Giguère, senior policy analyst and author of the report at MEI.

Giguère noted in his study that based on its transport capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day, commissioning of the pipeline Energy East could have diverted 27.7 per cent of Canadian oil exports from the United States to Europe, an amount worth $36.7 billion per year.

Energy East, a 4,500 km pipeline from Alberta to the Irving refinery in New Brunswick, was proposed in 2013 by TransCanada (TC Energy) and abandoned in 2017 due to regulatory hurdles in Canada and strong opposition from environmental groups. The project was estimated at over $15 billion at the time.

It was expected to be operational by 2021. The revival of the project has not yet been announced. In fact, TC Energy doesn't even build pipelines for heavy crude oil anymore, having moved its heavy oil operations to South Bow.

In an interview with the National Post, the chairman of Strathcona Resources said that moving crude oil from Alberta to New Brunswick is not an easy task.

“There would have to be, not only pipelines built to the east, but there would have to be refining capacity configured to be able to receive heavy crudes,” said Adam Waterous.



Energy East was also unpopular in Quebec at the time. The provincial government never signed on to it because it saw few benefits and the pipeline route would have to cross several rivers, which raised concerns among Quebecers.

Another project, GNL Québec, was blocked by the Quebec government due to environmental concerns in 2021. The project was a $14-billion pipeline with a terminal in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.

Based on its transport capacity of 46 million cubic meters of gas per day, its implementation could have diverted 19 per cent of Canadian gas exports to Europe, representing $1.7 billion worth of goods per year.

According to a recent poll, both projects now receive a tremendous amount of support from Quebecers and both Liberals and Conservatives support pipeline construction in the context of a trade war with the United States.

Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently said that Canada should immediately build a pipeline “in the east so we can supply our own country with energy.” Mr. Harper was speaking Tuesday during a panel on energy at the Raisina Dialogue, India's largest geopolitical conference.

However, the costs of building such infrastructures have risen considerably.

“The cost to build the infrastructure is what drives the competitiveness of the product in each market. Going west is a quarter the distance of going east, therefore going west will always be more cost competitive than going east,” said TC Energy's CEO François Poirier in an interview with the National Post.

“And so that is where I think as a nation, in terms of diversifying our markets, both in crude oil and natural gas, we need to be looking west,” he added.

Scientists have uncovered new details about the mysterious matter that makes up neutron stars, the incredibly dense remnants of exploded stars.

“The determination of the internal structure of neutron stars presents a long-standing and important challenge for nuclear theory,” wrote the team in their paper published in Physical Review Letters. “Since neutron stars were first predicted in the 1930s and observed 30 years later, many models for the structure of their interiors have been proposed, including various phases of nuclear matter.”

These incredibly dense celestial objects pack a star's entire mass into a sphere just 10 kilometers wide, making them far denser than atomic nuclei. This extreme density makes it incredibly challenging to study their properties — like temperature and composition — which is what makes the researchers' breakthrough so impressive.



Neutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that had ended their life cycle in a spectacular supernova explosion. Afterward, the core that is left behind is compressed into an extremely small space, and the intense gravity crushes atoms so tightly that it forces atoms to collapse.

In normal matter, electrons orbit atomic nuclei made up of protons and neutrons. However, in a neutron star, the gravity is so intense that it pulls electrons into the nuclei, where they combine with protons to form neutrons. This process creates a star made up mostly of densely packed neutrons, hence why it's called a neutron star.

While their extreme properties made them fascinating celestial objects, one of the biggest obstacles to studying neutron stars is the difficulty of probing their interiors. 

Their small size and vast distance from Earth — the closest being RX J1856. 5−3754, which is about 400 light-years away — make direct observations nearly impossible. As a result, scientists have to rely mainly on theoretical models to understand them. 

The properties of ordinary matter — the kind that makes up most objects around us and most celestial bodies — are determined by how the electrons of neighboring atoms interact. As a result, quantum electrodynamics, which describes electromagnetic interactions, is sufficient to explain their behavior. However, to describe the matter inside a neutron star, researchers need to rely on quantum chromodynamics, a fundamental theory in physics that explains how the building blocks of matter, called quarks, interact with each other through the strong force. This is the force that holds the nucleus of an atom together and binds quarks inside particles like protons and neutrons.

Due to the extreme density and gravity inside a neutron star, understanding how quarks interact is key to studying the star. However, applying quantum chromodynamics in these conditions is challenging because conventional mathematical tools struggle to account for the particles' behavior in such an intense environment.

This means there are limits to what we can predict or know about the star's inner workings.



The scientists behind the current study have got around this problem by turning to a theory that helps simplify the problem.

In lattice quantum chromodynamics, space is divided into a discrete grid, or “lattice,” which makes it easier to calculate and model the interactions of hadron particles, which includes neutrons, under extreme conditions. 

Using this method, the team was able to figure out how different factors, like temperature, density, and pressure, relate to each other in the matter inside neutron stars. 

With this new information, the team could predict how mass is distributed inside a neutron star, its size, and how neutron stars behave in extreme astrophysical scenarios, such as mergers with other neutron stars or black holes. 

The connection to these mergers is significant because they generate gravitational waves that can be detected on Earth. By comparing gravitational wave signals with theoretical predictions, the team can test how realistic their theory is in predicting the interiors of neutron stars.



One of the most intriguing results of the study concerns the speed of sound inside neutron stars. The researchers found that sound waves can travel at nearly three quarters the speed of light, which is about 30% faster than previous models suggested.

This is significant because the speed of sound in a material tells us how resistant it is to being compressed. If the speed of sound is higher, it means the material is stiffer and harder to compress. The new findings suggest that neutron star matter is stiffer than scientists previously believed. 

This means that neutron stars can support more mass before collapsing into black holes, which could change our understanding of how massive neutron stars can get before they reach the point of no return.



While the study provides valuable new insights, several challenges remain. The calculations are computationally demanding, requiring significant resources to simulate the vast range of conditions found inside neutron stars. Additionally, the team's results apply to neutron-rich matter composed only of the two lightest types of quarks: up and down quarks. However, in the ultra-dense cores of neutron stars, it is possible that strange quarks also play a role. 

Future research will need to incorporate these additional degrees of freedom to provide a more complete picture of neutron star interiors.

Testing these findings observationally will also require more precise measurements of neutron star properties. While current gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA have provided valuable data, they are not yet sensitive enough to fully probe the equation of state. Next-generation observatories may be needed to test the researchers' predictions.

Skidattl has announced the commercial launch of its augmented reality engagement platform, which applies geospatial intelligence to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds for businesses seeking to connect more closely with their customers. 

This groundbreaking technology allows anyone to create enhanced real-world experiences for their customers and prospects by providing virtual information overlays in physical spaces. By revolutionizing how people interact with their surroundings, it transforms outdoor experiences, encourages real-world exploration, and connects businesses with their audiences in more meaningful ways.

In the golf space, Turtle Bay Golf Course in Kahuku, Hawaii, has conducted a pilot of Skidattl and has reported significant enhancements to the interactions it has had with golfers, in addition to the experiences that their customers have with their offerings. For example, golfers can look through their phone to see the direction and distance to any green, providing real-time caddy advice and course information – all done with beacons overlaid on the real-world setting.

“Skidattl brings a brand new innovative element to the game of golf,” said Travis Joerger, Director of Golf at Turtle Bay. “The way it augments the real-world experience of golfing with digital insights is game-changing.  We have been delighted to participate in the early development of Skidattl's golf features and look forward to deploying it on a daily basis.”  

Founded by serial entrepreneur Randy Marsden, known for numerous successful ventures including Swype, acquired by Microsoft, and Dryft, acquired by Apple, Skidattl represents a paradigm shift in geospatial technology applied to augmented reality applications. Also, unlike traditional AR experiences that require extensive programming knowledge to create and focus on gaming or fantastical elements, Skidattl lets anyone use AR as a practical tool to enrich real-world engagement. 

Marsden envisions a future where virtual information seamlessly integrates with the real world, and Skidattl's architecture transcends mobile phone access, offering brands an evergreen conduit for immersive engagement across interfaces including AR glasses and other wearables, heads-up displays and others that will emerge.

Key features of the Skidattl platform include:

“Skidattl isn't just another AR company; it's a paradigm shift in how we interact with the world around us using geospatial technology,” said Marsden. “We're creating a bridge between the virtual and physical realms, encouraging people to step away from their screens and engage with their surroundings in meaningful ways. 

“In the next few years, I envision Skidattl becoming as intuitive and ubiquitous as social media is today, but instead of isolating people, it will connect them more deeply with the physical world. This isn't about replacing reality with virtual elements; it's about enriching our real-world interactions through seamless, contextual information. Skidattl represents the next evolution in human-computer interaction, one that prioritizes our connection to the physical world while leveraging the power of digital information.”

The platform is now available for enterprise subscriptions, with plans starting at $5,000 per year.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been signed as a brand ambassador for Callaway Golf as he switches up his focus to bagging aces on the golf course rather than the tennis court. 

Vilamoura Golf reinforced its sustainability credentials when the Portuguese resort's four courses were each awarded two of the highest environmental, social and governance accolades in recognition of a dedication and commitment to biodiversity and strong environmental strategy.

Simon Grand, Course Manager at North Foreland Golf Club in Kent, has reported impressive results from using BASF's Attraxor, a plant growth regulator recommended and supplied by Agrovista Amenity.

RTL's streaming subscribers in Germany, Hungary and France jumped 21 percent to 6.8 million last year, the company announced, with streaming revenue up 42 percent at $440 million. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	European television giant RTL Group is closing in on profitability in its streaming division, with subscriber figures and online revenues surging last year and start-up costs falling. 


	In its year-end results, published Thursday, RTL said subscribers to its streaming services RTL+ in Germany and Hungary and the new M6+ platform in France jumped 21 percent to more than 6.8 million. Streaming revenues were up an impressive 42 percent at €403 million ($437 million), boosted by price hikes for the RTL+ service in Germany. RTL's German service accounts for the lion's share of the group's subscriber business, with some 6.06 million paying subscribers. Streaming start-up losses at the division were down some 22 percent to €137 million ($149 million)

	RTL CEO Thomas Rabe hailed the results as a “turning point” for the company's digital future. “Our streaming services continued to grow dynamically and significantly reduced their start-up losses in 2024. We are firmly on track to reach profitability by 2026,” Rabe said in a statement.

	RTL's aggressive push into streaming was further bolstered by a renewed partnership with Deutsche Telekom, extending RTL+ Premium's integration into Telekom's MagentaTV through 2030. The move is expected to drive further subscriber gains in Germany. Rabe also pointed to promising early results in France, where the company rebranded its streaming service M6+ (from 6play) and launched last May, noting monthly users on the new platform were up 30 percent and streaming hours increased by 35 percent compared to its predecessor. 


	Looking ahead, RTL projects 9 million streaming subscribers and €750 million ($816 million) in revenue by 2026. 


	RTL's free TV business, still the company's core, presented a less rosy picture. The combined audience share of RTL Deutschland's German networks in its key 14-59 demographic fell to 26.3 percent from 27.4 percent a year earlier. TV ad revenue was flat at €2.35 billion ($2.56 billion). Rabe put a positive spin on the figures by pointing to the worse-off competitor ProSiebenSat.1, noting that RTL Deutschland's audience share over ProSiebenSat.1's combined channel reach was 6.3 percentage points, the widest in more than 10 years. 


	Overall, group revenue at RTL was stable at €6.25 billion ($6.81 billion), with total group profit down slightly at €555 million ($604 million) compared to €598 million a year earlier. 

	











	Revenue at Fremantle, RTL's content production division, saw an 8 percent “organic” decline, which the group attributed to the 2023 U.S. actor and director strikes and by budget cuts from streaming services and advertising-financed broadcasters. The drop was particularly offset by Fremantle's acquisition of TV production groups Asacha Media and Beach House Pictures. Asacha, a private equity-backed group, owns several production outfits in France, Italy and the U.K., including Death in Paradise producers Red Planet Pictures; Italian scripted groups Picomedia (Beyond the Sea, La Storia) and Stand by Me (Diaries); and France's Srab Films (Saint Omer, Happening) and Mintee Studios (Cimetiere Indien). Singapore-based Beach House has a non-scripted focus and produces shows including Netflix's Mind Your Manners and Mr. Midnight as well as local versions of global franchises such as Masterchef Singapore.


	On the creative side, Fremantle enjoyed a banner 2024, with Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things, produced by Fremantle-owned Element Pictures, picking up four Oscars.


	But with revenues of €2.25 billion ($2.45 billion), Fremantle is still a long way off its stated target of €3 billion ($3.26 billion) in annual revenues. RTL on Thursday casually moved the goalposts for that target, saying it hopes to hit the €3 billion mark “mid-term,” not by 2026, as originally forecast.

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low.

U.S. jobless claims filings rose by 2,000 to 223,000 for the week ending March 15, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's just less than the 224,000 new applications analysts forecast.

Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.

The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, inched up by 750 to 227,000.

It's not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE,” will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though the Labor Department's February jobs report showed that the federal government shed 10,000 jobs. That's the most since June of 2022. 

Economists don't expect the federal workforce layoffs to have much of an impact until the March jobs report.

Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through DOGE, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.

Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion late last month via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired — though two federal judges last week issued orders requiring the rehiring of thousands of those workers.

Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.

The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs last month, and while the unemployment rate ticked up to a 4.1%, it remains a historically healthy figure.

Some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year, including Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 8 rose by 33,000 to 1.89 million.

MEQUON — Milwaukee-based Cobalt Partners will purchase the 6.5-acre Hy & Richard Smith JCC Water Park located at 11015 North Market St. in Mequon.

""We love the site — its location, size and potential are outstanding,"" Cobalt president and CEO Scott Yauck said in a statement earlier this week. ""We're excited about the possibilities this site presents and the opportunity to positively contribute to the community's vitality."" The firm was selected to lead the redevelopment effort after a multi-month analysis and selection process. It has not yet announced its plans for the property, but is working with the city and neighboring owners to explore various options, according to a press release.

The transaction is expected to close in June.

""Cobalt Partners has a reputation for working productively with municipalities and delivering positive outcomes, even when projects involve executional complexities,"" Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center President and CEO Mark Shapiro added.

The water park, which was operated by the Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center, closed after the 2024 season due to what the JCC said is a result of the ongoing national lifeguard shortage and the challenges that come with operating an outdoor pool in Wisconsin. JCC staff said its currently developing new programs and events for members to enjoy this summer.

“The future of golf course management is rooted in the fundamentals – proven, reliable techniques combined with hard work from the teams on the ground and emerging technologies”. That's the message from Simon Doyle, Troon's Vice President of Agronomy for the international division, following a world tour of Troon experts who visited nine countries across the Troon International network.

Doyle was reflecting on the success of the second Troon International Agronomy Conference in Prague back, alongside site visits to Greece, Portugal, Spain Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, UAE, and Australia in November, where Troon's agronomy experts shared insights and their vision for the future.

Alongside Doyle, Troon International, the international division of Troon, the world's largest golf hospitality management company, welcomed a host of company experts including Dave Nicholls, Jeff Spangler, Brian Hampson, Clinton Southorn, David Lunardelli and Brianne Kenny.

More than 65 delegates from more than 20 Troon facilities across the globe gathered for the Troon International Agronomy Conference, offering an invaluable platform for knowledge sharing, professional development, and collaboration around agronomy best practice, while the site visits to Troon facilities across Europe, Asia and Australasia provided hands-on practical guidance for teams on the ground.

“By adopting smarter decision-making systems we can make more accurate choices, reduce waste, and minimize our environmental footprint,” commented Doyle. “Technology, including GPS, and sensors, is now allowing us to dial in proven techniques alongside smarter decision-making systems such as Clipping Volume (ClipVol), Growth Degree Days (GDD) and Disease forecasting models which make us much more accurate whilst helping prevent indiscriminate applications. 

“The integration of new technologies also allows us to be more precise and sustainable in our approach to course management, all while enhancing the overall golfing experience.”

The tour highlighted several key developments in golf course agronomy that will shape the industry moving forward. These included five important takeaways:

Skidattl has announced the commercial launch of its augmented reality engagement platform, which applies geospatial intelligence to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds for businesses seeking to connect more closely with their customers. 

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been signed as a brand ambassador for Callaway Golf as he switches up his focus to bagging aces on the golf course rather than the tennis court.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been signed as a brand ambassador for Callaway Golf as he switches his focus to bagging aces on the golf course rather than the tennis court. 

The 37-year-old double Olympic gold medallist has been putting all of his efforts into lowering his seven handicap since stepping away from professional tennis in August last year.  

Leveraging Murray's influence and passion for the game, Callaway will work with the sportsman to help introduce new and emerging audiences to golf, demonstrating its accessibility, excitement, and the unique challenges the game has which keep seasoned and new golfers striving to learn more.

Through this partnership fans will also have the opportunity to be part of Murray's golf story, as Callaway creates exclusive content showcasing his progress, insights, and experiences on the course.

“I've been playing a lot of golf since I retired from tennis and Callaway have been supporting me with this,” said Murray, who is a member at Beaverbrook Golf Club in Surrey. “I was fitted at their European Performance Centre in September and I've been using their clubs since then. It's made a huge difference to my performance already. I'm hoping to reduce my handicap so I'm looking forward to working with them to keep improving my game.”

“Andy's dedication and competitive mindset have made him one of the most respected athletes in the world and we're proud to welcome him to the Callaway family,” said Chris Gregg, Marketing Director, Callaway Golf EMEA. “His enthusiasm for golf is infectious, and we can't wait to support him on this journey while creating content that inspires both existing and new golfers alike.”

Skidattl has announced the commercial launch of its augmented reality engagement platform, which applies geospatial intelligence to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds for businesses seeking to connect more closely with their customers. 

Vilamoura Golf reinforced its sustainability credentials when the Portuguese resort's four courses were each awarded two of the highest environmental, social and governance accolades in recognition of a dedication and commitment to biodiversity and strong environmental strategy.

Vilamoura Golf reinforced its sustainability credentials when the Portuguese resort's four courses were each awarded two of the highest environmental, social and governance accolades in recognition of a dedication and commitment to biodiversity and strong environmental strategy.

The Old Course, Pinhal, Millennium and Laguna courses now all have GEO Certification and are Biosphere Certified after a number of projects garnered praise for their reduction in water usage and chemicals as well as respecting and enhancing the local environment in the Algarve resort.

The GEO Foundation confirmed all four courses achieved GEO Certified status for their outstanding work to foster nature, conserve resources and support the community. GEO Certified is the most respected certification for golf, based on a credibly and transparently developed modern sustainability.

The ‘Biosphere Certified' distinction is a certification that recognises destinations and organisations implementing sustainable tourism practices and is a guarantee they are fulfilling commitments related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda.

All four courses received warm praise from the GEO Foundation. Specific projects highlighted by the inspection team included improved irrigation systems, reduced water usage and chemical dependency, and fostering long-term ecological health. 

The Old Course, the second oldest in the Algarve, was praised for its strong commitment to sustainability, and initiatives such as a new pump station to reduce energy consumption, a pine management program and its positive impact on local biodiversity, and a proactive approach to resource efficiency.

The Millennium was cited as ‘an example of environmental stewardship in the golf industry' for its focus on water-efficient irrigation systems and strategic tree management as well as a determination to reduce its ecological footprint.

The Laguna received recognition for protecting local ecosystems as well as a renovated irrigation system, achieving a 20% reduction in water consumption, while the Pinhal was praised for its social initiatives, such as supporting golf education for young people and collaborating with local organizations to help create lasting positive impacts on the community.

The Vilamoura Golf courses are all overseen by the management platform DETAILS and co-CEO Nuno Sepúlvedasaid sustainability and enhancing the natural environment were the highest of priorities.

“Vilamoura has some of nature's most stunning settings, and we feel a great weight of responsibility to make sure it not only is maintained but flourishes for generations to come.

“Understanding the importance of sustainability and avoiding waste of any sort is a key part of our business strategy and also increasingly important for our customers and visitors. We are grateful to receive these very prestigious accolades and are determined to ensure we continue to be the leader when it comes to setting a strong environmental agenda.“

Simon Grand, Course Manager at North Foreland Golf Club in Kent, has reported impressive results from using BASF's Attraxor, a plant growth regulator recommended and supplied by Agrovista Amenity. 

Known for its unique coastal setting and historic courses, North Foreland faces the dual challenges of high traffic and dry, windswept conditions. For Grand, the location was a major draw when he joined nine years ago. Moving from a North London clay course, he was eager to manage turf on the free-draining chalk downland and embrace the challenges of this coastal environment.

Managing the club's courses, which host approximately 60,000 rounds of golf annually, presents unique challenges. The main course is particularly demanding, with its exposure to winds and a need for consistent, high-quality turf management. With a relatively small team of eight full-time staff, efficiency and innovative solutions are key.





Grand's relationship with Agrovista Amenity dates back years. Familiar with their product range and expertise, he has trusted the company's advice and offerings to optimise the club's turf management. 

This year, Grand decided to trial BASF's Attraxor plant growth regulator: “I'd read positive studies and listened to feedback about the product from other users, particularly its seed head suppression and disease management benefits. The buzz around it grew to the point where I had to see for myself,” he said. 

Attraxor is designed to reduce vertical grass growth while promoting lateral spread and tillering. This leads to a denser turf with improved playability and less frequent mowing, freeing up valuable time for other maintenance tasks. The product is especially beneficial for suppressing seed head production and can play a role in disease management.





Grand's first application on the Northcliffe course was in early spring. “We applied it at the full rate during a mild March. The results were immediate. Within the first few weeks, we noticed significantly reduced growth leading to less leaf removal when cutting and more consistent putting surfaces. I definitely noticed a reduction in seed head as well, when normally they would have been very prevalent at that time of year. There was also a major decrease in disease considering the conditions we were facing. After the initial application we are generally applying it every three weeks and have continued to do so ever since.”

The results impressed Grand enough to integrate Attraxor into the main course maintenance plan later in the summer. “It wasn't just a short-term solution; it became part of our long-term strategy.”

Attraxor's use on the two courses demonstrated benefits like reduced mowing frequency and lower disease presence, which were crucial given the limited resources of the team. “We're not the largest team managing two busy courses, so any product that helps us maintain quality while reducing workload is invaluable. The challenges we face now as an industry are immense. Greenkeeping can be a tough environment based around labour shortages and the limited products you can use, so a good growth regulator can be a key product in this respect,” he said.

Grand values the ongoing relationship with Andrew Norman, his Agrovista Amenity representative, whose knowledge helps guide North Foreland's maintenance practices. “Andrew and I have a great understanding, and we work well together. Furthermore, Agrovista's seminars and resources have been great for learning about new products like Attraxor and fitting them into our programmes,” he added.

The positive results from the initial trials have encouraged Grand to explore Attraxor's use on tees, aprons, and even bunker faces as time and conditions allow. He remains committed to building on this year's success and integrating Attraxor into a broader, year-round turf management plan. “I think all the time the grass is growing, Attraxor will be a part of the programme,” Grand said.

Kubota (UK) Ltd has implemented a series of changes to three of its dealer sales areas following recent appointments that have taken place within the dealer network covering Warwickshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. 

The first involves south Wales-based Hopkins Machinery, which gains access to Kubota groundcare and M-series tractor ranges through its Kilcot depot located near Newent, Gloucestershire, creating opportunities for the family-run dealership around Ross-on-Wye, Gloucester and the western side of Cheltenham.

“We're extremely pleased to be able to provide sales, service and support for all the existing Kubota products we handle, but now through our Kilcot depot in addition to our St Brides Wentloog, South Wales headquarters, and our Brecon, Powys locations,” said Evan Hopkins, a director of the company.

The second change sees Pallisers of Hereford gain area to the east of its former territory, taking in Upton-upon-Severn and the western side of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, while also extending north and east toward Pershore, Hanbury and Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire. 

“We're pleased to be expanding our Kubota tractor business within these additional areas,” said Camilla Palliser, dealer principal at Pallisers of Hereford. “We're looking forward to supporting new Pallisers customers throughout these areas.”

The third dealer to benefit is Lister Wilder, which gains additional area in the north of its territory, extending eastwards from Cheltenham to encompass Northleach and Hazleton, and stretching north into the Cotswolds towards Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, adjoining the area recently taken over by Hunts Engineering at Halford, Warwickshire.

“Any extension to our sales area is always going to be a positive step forward for Lister Wilder and the Kubota brand,” says Lister Wilder sales director Phill Hughes. “It's an opportunity to work with and support many new customers.”

Updated on:  March 19, 2025 / 9:54 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

In a win for the oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer,  a nine-person North Dakota jury found the environmental group Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages and defamation for the 2016 to 2017 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In their lawsuit, Dallas-based Energy Transfer claimed Greenpeace was responsible for defamation, disruption and property damage for the protests that captured national attention in 2016. Greenpeace claimed the lawsuit threatened its freedom of speech. 

In a statement, Energy Transfer said, ""This win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law.""

Greenpeace plans to appeal the verdict. ""This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don't have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money."" Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace Inc., told CBS News.

Greenpeace accused Energy Transfer of filing a ""SLAPP"" lawsuit, short for strategic lawsuits against public participation. SLAPP lawsuits have been criticized as being a method of curtailing free speech and assembly by individuals, organizations or press by threatening lengthy and expensive legal proceedings in court. 35 states have anti-SLAPP laws aimed at preventing these types of lawsuits. North Dakota is not among them. 

Energy Transfer previously filed a federal RICO lawsuit against Greenpeace seeking $300 million in damages in 2017, but that case was dismissed by a federal judge. Energy Transfer then filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace in North Dakota state court shortly after.

""The verdict against Greenpeace not only represents an assault on free speech and protest rights,"" said Rebecca Brown, president and CEO of the Center for International and Environmental Law, in a statement. ""This case is a textbook example of corporate weaponization of the legal system to silence protest and intimidate communities. This misuse of the legal system stifles legitimate dissent and must be seen as a direct threat to environmental justice and democratic freedoms.""

In the weeks and months preceding the trial, Greenpeace raised the alarm that the damages sought by Energy Transfer, thought at the time to be in the $300 million range, would be catastrophic to the group, claiming that would amount to 10 times the group's annual U.S. operating budget. Energy Transfer reported over $82 billion in revenue in 2024.

The damages ultimately awarded total roughly $667 million and will be split up among several arms of Greenpeace. Greenpeace USA is on the hook for about $404 million, while Greenpeace Fund Inc. and Greenpeace International must each pay some $131 million, according to The Associated Press.  

The 1,172-mile pipeline crosses four states and has been operating since late 2017 despite the controversy and the protest, which stemmed from a pipeline crossing under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe called the pipeline a violation of its treaty rights and claimed the pipeline route risked polluting the tribe's primary water source and would damage sacred sites. 

The protests at Standing Rock drew thousands of people from around the country who camped outside the pipeline's construction site. Celebrities and prominent figures including now-Trump cabinet members Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also visited the camp. 

But violence erupted between police, security guards and protestors several times, culminating in tear gas and water cannons being used against protestors. The camps were cleared in February of 2017. More than 140 people were arrested at the Standing Rock protests.  

One of the organizers of the protests was Chase Iron Eyes, an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, who was arrested during the demonstrations and charged with felony inciting a riot. Iron Eyes questioned Greenpeace's liability for the protests.

""I never met a single Greenpeace person, a representative, or ever went to a training or anything like that,"" Iron Eyes told CBS News. 

Instead, Iron Eyes found the ruling to delegitimize the concerns and agency of Native Americans who chose to protest at Standing Rock. ""To hold them solely responsible for our fight, this is a tribal nation fight,"" he said. ""I think it's disrespectful to tribal nations, to the Sioux Nation in particular, it was our nation, and our people who stood up.""

EU Health Regulator Clears Use of AI Tool in Fatty Liver Disease Trials

Reuters

FILE PHOTO: A message reading ""AI artificial intelligence"", a keyboard, and robot hands are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025.

(Reuters) -A European Medicines Agency committee, on Thursday, accepted the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool called AIM-NASH in clinical trials to help identify the severity of a type of fatty liver disease.

The condition, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, is a difficult-to-treat disease that affects around 1.5% to 6.5% of adults in the U.S., according to the American Liver Foundation.

The AI-based AIM-NASH tool employs a machine learning model trained on more than 100,000 annotations from 59 pathologists who assessed over 5,000 liver biopsies across nine large clinical trials.

The EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) said evidence showed the AI tool can reliably determine disease activity from biopsies with less variability than the current standard in trials that rely on a consensus of three pathologists.

On that basis, the CHMP concluded, it can accept evidence generated by the tool as scientifically valid, which will help researchers obtain clearer evidence on the benefits of new treatments in clinical trials.

Currently, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals', Rezdiffra is the only U.S.-approved drug for MASH.

Drugmakers such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also conducting trials with their blockbuster GLP-1 treatments to treat patients with the liver disease.

The AHR Expo is a showcase of innovation and ingenuity, where HVACR manufacturers from around the globe converge to unveil cutting-edge technologies and solutions designed to tackle the industry's most pressing challenges. This year, exhibitors placed a strong emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, highlighting products that not only reduce energy consumption but also align with global decarbonization and electrification goals. 

 

Even though the political winds have changed since the last presidential election, most manufacturers remain confident that electrification will continue to be a key trend. Infinitum, for example, expects to see skyrocketing growth in electrification, said Stephen Mathew, director of product management at Infinitum. 

“AI and data centers are putting enormous pressure on the HVAC world to prioritize energy management and deliver more efficient cooling systems that optimize power consumption in buildings and support electric grid stability,” said Mathew. “Motors play a key role in a building's energy consumption, data centers, and other mission-critical facilities. In fact, 40% of a data center's energy consumption is consumed by motors in HVAC equipment to cool servers. Infinitum's next-gen, sustainable motor systems support decarbonization initiatives by powering cooling equipment with 20% less energy, 20% fewer emissions, and no waste.”

Heat pumps also play a key role in the electrification movement, but for them to have a meaningful impact on decarbonization and electrification, they need to utilize technologies that make them more competitive in colder climates, as this will increase their adoption across more of the country, said Brian Dail, application engineering manager at Danfoss Climate Solutions. 

“Danfoss' vapor injected scroll compressor, EKE110 controller, and economizer products all make it easier for heat pumps to operate in lower ambient conditions, and they also provide efficiency improvements in these same conditions. These are critical for heat pumps to have a wider adoption across climates,” said Dail. 

As new heat pump system technologies continue to support the electrification and decarbonization of space and water heating, Copeland's integrated compression, drives, and controls solutions are helping to meet energy-efficiency and capacity requirements, said John Schneider, president of HVACR technologies at Americas at Copeland. 

“Copeland will soon launch its next-generation, variable-speed scroll compressor platform: a new best-in-class offering designed to deliver excellent performance in the residential heat pump and air conditioning market,” said Schneider. “This solution-based offering combines proven scroll performance with matched inverter drive technology for long life, reliability, and ease of application.” 

 

The advanced technologies needed to support the electrification movement were on display all over the AHR Expo. Danfoss, for example, showed its new line of variable-speed, vapor injection, and scroll compressors, as well as its fixed-speed compressors that have recently been approved for vapor injection. 

“To further aid with vapor injection, our new EKE110 controller controls superheat entering a vapor-injected compressor's vapor injection port,” said Dail. “The EKE110 can also monitor the compressor's discharge temperature. This will allow it to enter ‘wet injection' mode if the scroll compressor's discharge temperature is too high, enabling the scroll compressor to operate with a larger operating envelope and allowing a heat pump to provide higher leaving water/leaving air temperatures at lower outdoor temperatures. The EKE110 is designed to be used with Danfoss scroll compressors but can potentially be used with other manufacturers' compressors as well.” 

INJECTION TECHNOLOGY: The injection technology in the new Danfoss VZH-VI compressor range makes it easier for heat pumps to operate in lower ambient conditions. (Courtesy of Danfoss) 

In addition, Danfoss showcased its vapor injection applications, which included electric expansion valves and brazed plate heat exchangers. The braze plate heat exchangers utilize Danfoss's microplate technology, enabling smaller heat exchangers to deliver the same level of heat transfer, said Dail. 

Copeland demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by showcasing products that support the energy transition and accelerate the adoption of low-GWP refrigerant technologies across heating, cooling, refrigeration, and industrial applications, said Schneider. Among these were advanced cooling solutions specifically designed to improve efficiency in energy- and heat-intensive data centers. 

“The Copeland oil-free centrifugal compressor with Aero-lift bearing technology unlocks new opportunities for air-cooled data center chillers, delivering best-in-class performance and increased efficiencies in part-load and full-load conditions,” said Schneider. “In addition, the Copeland YDV variable-speed scroll platform is optimized explicitly for data center applications and delivers best-in-class efficiency, reliability, and performance across a wide range of outdoor ambient and evaporating temperatures.” 

Copeland also showcased its YAW vapor-injection optimized scroll compressor, which is capable of delivering high supply air temperatures at outdoor temperatures as low as -25°F. This technology enables the creation of reliable, high-efficiency heat pumps that can perform effectively in cold climates, supporting wider adoption across all regions. On the commercial refrigeration side, Copeland highlighted its expanded CO2 solutions and optimized scroll compression platforms for A2L and R-290 refrigerants. 

Infinitum unveiled the Aircore Heavy Duty, a next-generation motor system specifically designed for mission-critical HVAC fan and pump applications. According to Mathew, this sustainable motor reduces energy consumption, emissions, noise, and waste, while delivering reliable performance for the most demanding tasks. 

“The Aircore Heavy Duty features an integrated variable-frequency drive and sustainably powers demanding, energy-intense applications with up to 25% more efficiency, while being 50% lighter and 60% shorter when compared to conventional motor and drive solutions,” said Mathew. “Built with a rugged exterior for protection against dust, dirt, and water, the Aircore Heavy Duty operates reliably in harsh outdoor or wet environments and at high efficiency over a wide range of operating points.” 

Infinitum also showcased new motor system technology that features an integrated Active Front End within the VFD, which reduces total harmonic distortion. This feature improves HVAC equipment efficiency, reliability, and safety, while eliminating the need for bulky, energy-consuming passive filters, said Mathew. By integrating this feature, he added, the technology saves space, energy, and costs, while achieving greater harmonic reduction.

The Sporlan Division of Parker Hannifin strives to be the market leader in energy-efficient and sustainable HVACR solutions that enable a better tomorrow, said John Eric Hoffmann, marketing communications manager at Sporlan. To that end, they introduced several new products, including the multi-purpose gas cooler (GCM) valve. 

“The GCM valve is used in transcritical CO2 applications in supermarket refrigeration, so that our customers can move to natural refrigerants for their cooling systems,” said Hoffmann. “In addition, we showcased products for the new lower-GWP A2L refrigerants in both air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Two of these products are our check shut-off valve (CSOV) and safety shut-off valve (SSOV), which are UL certified for A2L refrigerants and used in walk-in cooler applications to provide safety in a customer's system if a leak emerges.” 

Other products Sporlan displayed included Micro Thermo controls for CO2, which are designed with high-performance algorithms to increase the energy efficiency of CO2 refrigeration systems in supermarkets, as well as new TEVs, which have new charges for both commercial and residential air conditioning. “We are pleased to learn that these have been independently tested by several of our prospective and legacy customers, who are indicating that these units exceed the performance of our direct competitors in new A2L systems,” said Hoffmann. 

As shown here, the AHR Expo once again demonstrated the HVACR industry's commitment to innovation, with manufacturers unveiling groundbreaking solutions that prioritize energy efficiency, sustainability, and the transition to lower-GWP refrigerants.

The Llama Nemotron models are available as an API on Nvidia's platform and on Hugging Face

Nvidia released a new family of artificial intelligence (AI) models on Tuesday at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2025. Dubbed Llama Nemotron, these are the company's latest reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) that are designed to offer a foundation for agentic AI workflows. The Santa Clara-based tech giant said these models were aimed at developers and enterprises to enable them to make advanced AI agents that can either work independently or as connected teams to perform complex tasks. The Llama Nemotron models are currently available via Nvidia's platform and Hugging Face.

In a newsroom post, the tech giant detailed the new AI models. The Llama Nemotron reasoning models are based on Meta's Llama 3 series models, with post-training enhancements added by Nvidia. The company highlighted that the family of AI models display improved capabilities in multistep mathematics, coding, reasoning, and complex decision-making.

The company highlighted that the process improved the accuracy of the models by up to 20 percent compared to the based models. The inference speed is also said to have been improved by five times compared to similar-sized open-source reasoning models. Nvidia claimed that “the models can handle more complex reasoning tasks, enhance decision-making capabilities, and reduce operational costs for enterprises.” With these advancements, the LLM can be used to build and power AI agents.

Llama Nemotron reasoning models are available in three parameter sizes — Nano, Super, and Ultra. The Nano model is best suited for on-device and edge-based tasks that require high accuracy. The Super variant is placed in the middle to offer high accuracy and throughput on a single GPU. Finally, the Ultra model is meant to be run on multi-GPU servers and offers agentic accuracy.

The post-training of the reasoning models was done on the Nvidia DGX Cloud using curated synthetic data generated using the Nemotron platform as well as other open models. The tech giant is also making the tools, datasets, and post-training optimisation techniques used to develop the Llama Nemotron models available to the open-source community.

Nvidia is also working with enterprise partners to bring the models to developers and businesses. These reasoning models and the NIM microservices can be accessed via Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry as well as an option via the Azure AI Agent Services. SAP is also using the models for its Business AI solutions and the AI copilot dubbed Joule, the company said. Other enterprises using Llama Nemotron models include ServiceNow, Accenture, and Deloitte.

The Llama Nemotron Nano and Super models and NIM microservices are available for businesses and developers as an application programming interface (API) via Nvidia's platform as well as its Hugging Face listing. It is available with the permissive Nvidia Open Model License Agreement which allows both research and commercial usage.

A new Canvas button is being added to the Gemini text box, next to the Deep Research button

Gemini is getting two new artificial intelligence (AI) features, Google announced on Tuesday. The Mountain View-based tech giant is adding Canvas, an interactive space that lets human users and AI collaborate on projects involving documents and coding-related tasks. Another feature making its way to Gemini is Audio Overview, which was previously exclusive to NotebookLM, and lets users generate an engaging podcast-like audio discussion based on documents, slides, and Deep Research reports. These features are currently being rolled out globally to both Gemini Advanced subscribers and those on the free tier.

In a blog post, the tech giant announced the two new features that are being added to Gemini. This follows the Deep Research feature that can generate a detailed report on complex topics, and the iOS-exclusive lockscreen widgets. The new features — Canvas and Audio Overview — will be available on both Gemini on web and mobile apps.

Canvas is a new interactive space on Gemini, which is aimed at letting users collaborate with the AI over certain projects. Users can now see a new Canvas button next to Deep Research in the text box on Gemini's interface. Selecting the feature and adding a document or lines of code will now open a sandbox where the AI creates a first draft based on the user's prompt, and then the user can take over to make edits and further refine the output with the help of the chatbot.

Currently, Canvas only works with documents and coding-related tasks. For documents, users will have to upload a file, and then write a prompt while the Canvas button is selected. The user can say something like “Create a speech based on these classroom notes” and the AI will open a sandbox-style interface and write the draft. Then users can make manual edits or highlight portions of the text and ask Gemini to change the tone or regenerate content with specific feedback.

Users can ask the AI to write code based on prompts. Then, with Canvas, they can ask Gemini to generate and preview the code and other web app prototypes to see a visual representation. This only works with HTML and React code currently. After the preview, the user can also request changes to input fields or call-to-action buttons, and see the updated preview. Notably, the feature is similar to OpenAI's Canvas feature, although ChatGPT only offers it on the web.

Google said that after witnessing the popularity of the Audio Overview feature in NotebookLM, it is now bringing it to Gemini. The feature works with documents, slides, and even reports created using Deep Research. Whenever a file or response fits the criteria, the Gemini platform will show a floating action button (FAB) about the feature.

Once a user taps the button, Gemini will begin generating a podcast-style audio discussion featuring two AI hosts, a male and a female voice, who will discuss the topic, draw connections between topics, and engage in a dynamic back-and-forth to provide unique perspectives. Notably, it can take a few minutes to generate an AI Overview.

Gadgets 360 staff members spotted both the features on the web interface of Gemini, but not on the apps. Since Google is rolling out the feature globally, it may take a few days before all users gain access to them.

London has established itself as a leader in finance and technology, and its iGaming Sector is now thriving. The city is shaping the online gambling market with fast growth, new technologies, and fresh business strategies. From AI tools to blockchain systems and mobile gaming, London's operators are helping to redefine the industry.

Artificial intelligence is at the core of online gaming. Companies use it to capture user habits and provide clear advice to hold players' attention. It also spots risky gambling behavior and supplies tools that support responsible gaming. Firms based in London lead by adopting AI to boost both the user experience and player safety. Equally, utilizing this tech to allow users to start gaming with no verification needed is something that has been driving a lot of new customers to iGaming, in a climate where people are increasingly worried about their privacy.

Chatbots powered by AI are also transforming customer support. They handle queries, process transactions, and verify accounts quickly. Faster responses and automated assistance make gaming platforms more user-friendly.

Blockchain is improving fairness and security in online gambling. London companies are adopting these systems to provide tamper-proof transactions and fair gameplay. Virtual casinos built on blockchain are also becoming popular, offering players a secure and interactive environment.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are another trend that has been around for a while. They allow players to own unique in-game items, join exclusive contests, or access special features. NFTs are helping operators boost engagement and unlock extra revenue.

Many operators are now focusing on mobile gaming, as most users access games through phones or tablets. Companies are investing in apps and mobile-friendly websites to ensure a smooth experience on smaller screens. Better design and faster platforms make gaming more accessible.

The rollout of 5G networks has enhanced mobile gaming. Faster data speeds and low latency allow players to enjoy immersive features like augmented reality or cloud-based games without expensive devices.

Mergers and acquisitions speed up growth in the sector. Big companies buy small ones to reach new markets and gain modern technology. These deals extend business and help them remain competitive in a busy field.

With more pressure to create, companies try to work hard, save money, and offer better features. This plan helps them keep their edge as the market expands.

London companies have been looking overseas since the UK market has been maturing. Areas such as Latin America and Africa now seem favorable because rules have changed, and there is improved internet access available. Firms expanding early into these regions gain a lead before competition arrives.

Governments in these regions are introducing new rules for online gambling. This opens doors for London companies to partner with local businesses and create games tailored to these markets.

Collaborating with influencers has become a key marketing tool. Popular streamers and content creators connect operators with younger audiences. Social media campaigns and themed events also keep players involved and loyal.

Live-streamed gaming events are gaining traction, too. These allow viewers to watch matches, chat with others, and place bets during the action. This interactive approach strengthens player engagement.

Gamification is becoming a standard feature in iGaming. Features like leaderboards, daily challenges, and achievements make games more engaging. Loyalty programs are also on the rise. Players receive personalized rewards that encourage them to stick with specific platforms.

Subscription plans are another growing trend. These give users access to premium games and services while providing operators with steady revenue. Players benefit from exclusive perks, enhancing their overall experience.

London's iGaming future looks promising. Companies plan to use new tools such as AI, blockchain, and 5G to help upgrade their work. Regulatory changes will also shape the industry, with stricter rules ensuring fair and responsible gaming, which puts users at ease and encourages transparency.

Environmental matters get more attention. Businesses choose eco-friendly ways, supporting greener practices and ethical gaming to meet consumer expectations. These steps may help the field keep growing.

London holds its global role for iGaming, but competition remains fierce. Firms need to follow trends, invest in tech, and keep players' interest to do well. By doing so, they secure a spot in this quickly-changing market.

Rajesh Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025


	Technology is shaping economies more profoundly than ever before, Nasscom President Rajesh Nambiar said on Thursday as he outlined India's strengths as a global talent hub which positions it as a preferred partner in the global technological ecosystem.


	Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025 here.


	""Today, the world is in a bit of an inflection point than ever before. Some of the technologies are actually playing a lot more influence on the economic models that we are seeing in the country,"" he said.


	Nambiar noted that the world is experiencing a global technological shift, which has created a rising demand for a high-quality talent base to meet the challenges and opportunities of this new landscape.


	There is no industry or country that is growing without technology playing a leading role. All of them have always been driven by technology to some extent, he said.


	""A country like India continues to be a partner of choice for the global technological ecosystem,"" he said.


	The IT industry is projected to close FY25 with a valuation of approximately $283 billion and is expected to surpass $300 billion in the following year, he stated. He also acknowledged the digital economy's contribution to GDP, which is anticipated to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.


	India's unmatched technology talent pool stands out as one of its key competitive advantages, he remarked.


	""This industry employs roughly about 5.8 million people as of today and it continues to grow. We are 28 per cent of the global STEM talent market worldwide. 23 per cent of the software engineering talent is housed in India,"" he pointed out.


	Another point that makes India an important partner in the broader global tech ecosystem is its thriving startup and innovation ecosystem, Nambiar further said.


	With over 34,000 technology startups and 3,600 deep tech startups, the nation's fundamentals are strong, and technologies such as AI and quantum computing are well-established, he said.


	""The third one is around the very strong digital infrastructure. It is a critical component of what the digital economy depends on and how the economy grows over a period of time,"" Nambiar said.


	GCCs, which are growing rapidly, are another positive aspect, he noted.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news","Indian Search Engine ‘Retifo' launched by Zordo Technologies","https://indiatechnologynews.in/indian-search-engine-retifo-launched-by-zordo-technologies/","Thu, 20 Mar 2025 09:26:38 GMT","

New Delhi [India], March 20: Zordo Technologies has unveiled Retifo, a revolutionary private Indian search engine created to tackle emerging issues of online privacy and data security in today's digital world. Retifo is a private search engine, i.e., it does not store, monitor, or record users' personal information or their search history. Unlike most search engines that heavily use user information for targeted ads and personalized content, Retifo provides a non-tracking search engine with total anonymity while surfing. With focus on encrypted search engines and safe browsing software, Retifo provides private browsing where all user activity is kept confidential and safe from unwanted spying or data gathering.

The introduction of Retifo India into the Indian market benefits not just consumers but the larger digital community. As more and more Indian users of the internet are now privacy-conscious about their data, Retifo gives users a needed solution to default to international search engines that may collect user habits and sell this information to outside agencies. Indian users can now use a privacy-respecting search engine that provides data protection search functionality and safe browsing tools that shield their information from misuse. Furthermore, Retifo's local availability provides Indian users with a choice that is familiar with their needs and cultural background, delivering results that are customized to their preferences while safeguarding their data.

Join Retifo's Pay Per Keyword (PPK) program for online presence

Retifo's Pay Per Keyword (PPK) program is an innovative digital marketing solution that empowers businesses to boost their online presence by focusing on the specific keywords that matter most to their audience. With this program, companies can select and bid on individual keywords, enabling them to drive highly targeted traffic to their website. Unlike traditional advertising models where costs are based on impressions or clicks, the Pay Per Keyword model allows businesses to pay only when a user engages with the content through the selected keyword. This creates a more cost-efficient approach for businesses to reach their ideal customers, especially when they can tailor campaigns to focus on high-conversion keywords that align with their products or services. By offering a pay-per-keyword system, Retifo ensures that clients only pay for relevant exposure, resulting in a better return on investment (ROI) and improved marketing performance.

One of the standout features of Retifo's Pay Per Keyword program is its ability to offer businesses complete transparency and control over their campaigns. With detailed analytics and insights, clients can track the effectiveness of individual keywords, making it easier to adjust bids and refine strategies based on real-time performance data. This model is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses that may have limited advertising budgets but still want to compete in search engine results. Additionally, Retifo offers expert guidance and keyword optimization strategies to ensure that businesses are targeting the right terms and achieving the best possible outcomes.

The Rise of Private Search Engines: Keeping Your Data Safe

The emergence of private search engines represents a monumental change in internet browsing, as users grow more concerned with their online privacy. Private search engines focus on anonymity and data security compared to conventional search engines that record users' search history and gather personal information to display targeted advertising. These sites, do not collect personal data or monitor user behavior, so users' searches are kept private and secure. By prioritizing search engine privacy, these alternatives offer a more secure browsing experience by avoiding the harvesting of sensitive information, which is usually used for advertising or sold to third-party firms. Private search engines add even more privacy, encrypting users' queries so their data won't be intercepted en route, providing a great measure of security from cyber threats. With data breaches and spying happening routinely in the world today, private search engines are a critical safe surfing aid for anyone looking to safeguard their private data on the web.

The need for data protection search is emerging more forcefully as more people and companies understand the threat of data exploitation. Amidst anxiety regarding government spying, ad-tracking, and third-party data brokers, the demand for tracking-free search engines has never been greater. Not only do these engines block tracking of search history, but they also kill the intrusive exploitation of personal data for financial gain. For users who want to have control over their online presence, making a transition to private search engines is a good idea to prevent unwanted data collection.

Zordo Technologies Expands Digital Reach with Acquisition of Retifo Search Engine

Zordo Technologies, a prominent player in digital transformation and cybersecurity, has recently acquired Retifo, a private search engine renowned for its robust privacy features and secure browsing tools. Retifo stands out as a non-tracking search engine that emphasizes encrypted search engines and data protection search capabilities. By leveraging Retifo's ability to deliver Google-like search results while eliminating tracking and safeguarding user privacy, Zordo Technologies aims to redefine the landscape of search engine privacy. Retifo employs proxy servers and an Anonymous View feature, allowing users to browse securely without compromising their data. This acquisition aligns with Zordo Technologies broader vision of fostering trust and security in India's digital ecosystem, supported by its investment in cybersecurity innovation and three local data centers. With this move, Zordo solidifies its commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions for secure browsing while empowering individuals and businesses with privacy-focused tools.

Private search engines like Retifo are increasingly vital in today's digital age, where concerns about data breaches and invasive tracking dominate the online experience. Unlike conventional search engines that collect user data for targeted advertising, private search engines prioritize anonymity, encrypted searches, and non-tracking mechanisms to ensure user information remains secure.
