President Donald Trump said he has a "very good relationship" with India, but the "only problem" he has with the country is that it is "one of the highest tariffing nations in the world." Trump reiterated his threat to impose reciprocal US tariffs on the country starting April 2.

In an interview with Breitbart News, an American news, opinion, and commentary website, Trump discussed the US' relationship with India.

Asked about his summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, Trump said: "I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest tariffing nations in the world. I believe they're going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us".

On the India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor (IMEC), Trump said it was a "group of wonderful nations" banding together "countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade." "We have a powerful group of partners in trade," Trump said.

"Again, we can't let those partners treat us badly, however, we do better in many ways frankly with our foes than we do with our friends...the ones that wouldn't be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly, like the European Union, which treats us terribly on trade. India and everybody would think of them as an ally," the US president said.

"I can say the same for others. But this is a group of wonderful nations that is countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade," he added.

Trump has repeatedly criticised the high tariffs charged by India. He has said that India is a very high tariff nation and reiterated that reciprocal tariffs on countries that impose levies on American goods will kick in on April 2.

In the past, Trump has called India "tariff king" and a "big abuser".

Last month, during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the White House, Trump had said that India has "been very strong on tariffs", and "I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs." Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal told a Parliamentary panel in New Delhi on March 10 that negotiations are still on and no agreement on trade tariffs has been reached so far between India and the US.

Trump has been criticising the high tariffs charged by India.

India had said it was looking at deepening trade ties with the US, including by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, under a bilateral trade agreement.

During Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US last month, both sides announced plans to negotiate a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA).

The United States this year fell to its lowest-ever place on the World Happiness Report, an annual survey published on International Day of Happiness. The 2025 report highlights the positive effects benevolence and social connections have on people's life satisfaction.

Finland remained the happiest nation for the eighth year in a row, while Mexico and Costa Rico ranked among the top 10 for the first time since the report was first published in 2012. 

This year's report ranks 147 countries by their happiness levels — based on a population's average assessment of their quality of life from 2022 to 2024. Data from the Gallup World Poll, which asks respondents to evaluate their current life, is the primary source for the annual happiness rankings.

Researchers found that the belief in the kindness of others, as well as actively caring about and sharing with others, has strong effects on happiness, according to the report.

"Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back," Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, said in a statement.

The U.S. ranked 24th in the world, one place lower than its 2024 ranking. America previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.

One factor highlighted in the report was the increasing number of people who eat alone.

"In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day — an increase of 53% since 2003," the report said. "Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group, but especially for young people."

Data reviewed for the report indicates major differences in the rates of meal-sharing around the world, with sharing meals having a positive effect on wellbeing.

Another factor contributing to America's drop in the rankings, as well as the rankings of some European countries, was "the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system,'" the report said.

"The country-wide evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and the United States," the authors wrote.

A key reason for the rise in Mexico and Costa Rica's rankings appeared to be family household size.

"Latin American societies, characterized by larger household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing," the report said. 

The report compared Mexico to European countries, explaining that even though it is poorer, "larger households imply a potential advantage to build positive social interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance the differences in income with Europe."

In Europe, 23% of households were single-person, while in Mexico, only 11% were single-person, according to data cited in the report. 

"In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is reported by people who live in households with four to five members," the authors wrote. "We also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as households with six or seven members."

The Gallup World Poll asked people in 2019 if they thought others would return a lost wallet, and found that "people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of others."

"When wallets were dropped in the street by researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than people expected," the report said.

The belief that others would return the lost wallets also contributed to a country's ranking.

The Nordic nations, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ranked in the top 10 countries and were among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the report said.

"The wallet data are so convincing because they confirm that people are much happier living where they think people care about each other," John F. Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the World Happiness Report, said in a statement.

Additionally, the researchers found that globally, benevolent acts were 10% more frequent in 2024 than in 2017-2019.

Senate and House committee chairs warn against plan for US to relinquish command of Nato forces in Europe

Republicans on Capitol Hill are threatening a revolt against a defence shake-up reportedly planned by the Trump administration that could see the US relinquish its command of Nato forces in Europe.

The two top Republicans on the Senate and House of Representatives armed services committees, Roger Wicker and Mike Rogers, signaled their opposition in an extraordinary joint statement warning that the change would “risk undermining American deterrence around the globe”.

The statement – a rare display of congressional Republicans rebelling since Donald Trump's return to the White House – followed an NBC report that the Pentagon is considering giving up the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur), a position held by an American general since the Nato alliance was formed in 1949.

The proposed shake-up could also include folding separate US Europe and Africa military commands into a joint command structure based in Germany and the scrapping of plans to expand American forces in Japan as part of a military buildup in the far east.

Wicker and Rogers said such changes would not be accepted without recourse to Congress, which holds the “power of the purse” under US constitutional norms.

“US combatant commands are the tip of the American warfighting spear,” they said. “Therefore, we are very concerned about reports that claim DoD is considering unilateral changes on major strategic issues, including significant reductions to US forces stationed abroad, absent coordination with the White House and Congress.

“We will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the joint staff, and collaboration with Congress. Such moves risk undermining American deterrence around the globe and detracting from our negotiating positions with America's adversaries.”

Trump has already floated the idea of refusing to defend any Nato member that is attacked – an obligation enshrined under Nato's article five – if it is deemed to have fallen short of its defence spending commitments.

The two congressional leaders said they supported Trump's calls for Nato alliance partners to raise defence spending “to strengthen our alliance partnership” and pointedly added: “We support continuing America's leadership abroad.”

The Punchbowl news website said the statement reflected Republican defence hawks' “longstanding frustrations” with the Trump administration. It represents a jarring departure from Republicans' meek acceptance of White House encroachment on congressional prerogatives over spending in the two months since Trump returned to office, which has seen Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” impose brutal cuts on government.

The plans stem from proposed 8% cuts in the Pentagon budget floated by Pete Hegseth, last month.

Defence experts and retired generals say giving up the Saceur role would signal a wider abandonment of the US leadership role in Nato, which Trump has frequently criticised.

“For the United States to give up the role of supreme allied commander of Nato would be seen in Europe as a significant signal of walking away from the alliance,” retired Adm James Stavridis, who served in the role and as head of European Command from 2009 to 2013, told NBC.

“It would be a political mistake of epic proportion, and once we give it up, they are not going to give it back … This would be seen, correctly, as probably the first step toward leaving the alliance altogether.”

The current Saceur commander, Gen Chris Cavoli, will end his three-year stint this summer. The position has been the preserve of four-star US generals since Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme commander of allied forces in the second world war and a later Republican president, first held it. Other holders have included Alexander Haig, who also served as a White House chief of staff and US secretary of state.

People gather at city hall and students march in anger at arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu, a likely opposition candidate for presidency

Outside Istanbul's city hall on Wednesday night a mass of protesters gathered in the freezing air to defy a city-wide ban on gatherings. A banner bearing a portrait of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, giving a speech alongside the words “sovereignty belongs unconditionally to the nation” covered part of the facade of his now vacant office.

In dawn raids that morning police had detained İmamoğlu, the only contender seen as capable of defeating Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in presidential elections. For many residents of Turkey's largest city, the arrest symbolised how far the state was willing to go to remove a perceived threat to the incumbent president.

Lines of armoured water cannon trucks were lined up and riot police massed beneath the arches of a nearby Roman aqueduct, some marching to the edge of the protest that filled the park around the city hall. Illuminated by the lights from a nearby minaret, a group of teenagers waved Turkish flags and smoked cigarettes as they sat atop a high wall to get a view of the assembled crowds.

“I'm not here for political reasons. This is about something more than politics; this is about injustice,” said Beril, an Istanbul university student who was protesting with her mother. She said she had been shocked at the number of armed police on campus to repress the protests, although it had done little to quell the anger.

Like most protesters gathered outside the city hall, Beril and her mother declined to give their full names, fearing the consequences of attending the demonstration as lines of riot police marched past. “We have laws on the books here that are not being obeyed. So there is no rule of law,” her mother said, breaking off to join in chants demanding the government resign.

While some of those who had gathered were faithful to the opposition Republican People's party (CHP), most said they felt compelled to defy the protest ban imposed by the Istanbul governor in order to defend what remained of Turkish democracy.

İmamoğlu and more than 100 others were ordered to be detained in two separate cases brought by the Istanbul prosecutor's office. The first accuses Istanbul's mayor and dozens of others of financial corruption and embezzlement. The second accuses him of “aiding a terrorist organisation” by working with a banned Kurdish militant group prior to local elections last year, when Erdoğan's party suffered significant losses.

Wednesday's arrests marked a dramatic escalation in a crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey which has been led by Erdoğan – a populist with increasingly authoritarian tendencies – as prime minister or president for more than 20 years. His term runs until 2028 but he has indicated he would like to serve longer – something he could achieve with a constitutional change or if early elections are called.

On Thursday the interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said a further 37 people had been detained on suspicion of making “provocative posts inciting crime and hatred” about İmamoğlu's detention.

The justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, rebuffed suggestions that İmamoğlu's arrest was politicised, and labelled calls for street protests as “disinformation”.

A group of lawyers gathered on the edge of Saraçhane park around the city hall scoffed at Tunç's statement, and said they were demonstrating because they felt the government no longer cared to follow the rules set out in Turkey's constitution. None were CHP supporters, they added. “This situation is a step closer towards one-man rule, and we have to do something about it,” said a lawyer who gave her name as Özlem. “The government isn't following the law.”

Another group of recent university graduates said they were protesting “because we could not be silent in the face of this injustice”.

“He is our hope,” one said emphatically of İmamoğlu, who was widely expected to be named as CHP's candidate for president in a primary vote in just a few days. The 53-year-old mayor, who swept into office on a wave of popular support in 2019, defying efforts to annul his first victory and later a political ban, is widely seen as Erdoğan's nemesis and his only true challenger.

“They can't put İmamoğlu in jail – if they try to do that, he'll only get more support,” said the protester. He said he struggled to believe the authorities would dare to keep the mayor behind bars, but believed that if they did, it would only spur more protests.

“We got too complacent about the situation here, so now this could really be the beginning of something,” his friend said. CHP officials called for further protests on Thursday, shortly after İmamoğlu was taken for questioning in custody.

Another young protester walked past carrying a sign that read: “Don't be afraid, we are the people”, a slogan of the Gezi park protests in 2013 that marked a major point of civil unrest and anti-government sentiment.

“Ekrem İmamoğlu's only crime is leading in the polls,” the CHP leader, Özgür Özel, told the assembled crowds, who responded with cheers. “This is nothing but an attempt to overthrow the national will.”

On Thursday, hundreds of university students held a peaceful march in Istanbul to protest against the detentions. Another demonstration was planned outside the city hall on Thursday evening.

Town in North Kivu province is the farthest west the group has reached since the start of its advance in January

M23 rebels have captured a strategic mining hub in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, defying calls from the presidents of Rwanda and the DRC for an immediate ceasefire.

A Congolese army spokesperson said M23 was in control of the town of Walikale. An officer separately told Agence France-Presse its forces were about 20 miles (30km) away in the town of Mubi.

Walikale, in North Kivu province, is the farthest west that M23 has reached during its lightning advance that started in January.

The town has large deposits of tin and many significant goldmines. Tin is widely used as a protective coating for other metals and in industries including food packaging and electronics.

In taking control of Walikale, the rebels also seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country, cutting off the army's positions. It also puts them within 250 miles of Kisangani, the country's fourth-largest city.

Gunfire rang out from near Nyabangi neighbourhood on Wednesday, according to Janvier Kabutwa, who lives in Walikale. An army source said the rebels were battling soldiers and pro-government militias after overrunning an army position outside the town in a surprise attack.

“The information is confirmed. The rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office,” said Prince Kihangi, a former provincial official for Walikale, referring to locations in the town centre.

Heavy artillery fire was heard throughout Wednesday but stopped in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, said Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale. “Our Congolese army is no longer fighting,” he said. “It's as if we were being sacrificed.”

M23 captured Goma, the largest city in North Kivu, in late January. It then started moving south towards Bukavu, the second-largest city in the region.

More than 7,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands uprooted from their homes since January in the latest escalation in the conflict, which has lasted for decades and has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is the worst escalation in more than a decade.

M23, which is backed by Rwanda, is one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces to make territorial gains in the DRC's mineral-rich eastern provinces. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them from Hutu rebel groups that escaped to the DRC after taking part in the genocide. The DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the region's mineral resources.

The fall of Walikale came a day after DRC's president, Félix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, met in Qatar for their first direct talks since January and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.

The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola after Tshisekedi's government went back on its longstanding refusal to speak to the rebels, but M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, citing EU sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Senior military officers from countries across Europe and beyond will meet Thursday outside London to flesh out plans for an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine as details of a partial ceasefire are worked out.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the “coalition of the willing” plan, led by Britain and France, is moving into an “operational phase.” But it's unclear how many countries are willing to send troops, or whether there will be any ceasefire to protect.

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remained to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.

The tentative deal to partially rein in the three-year war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump's push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war.

AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a limited ceasefire, but there's work ahead to put it in place.

Negotiators from Moscow and the U.S. will meet Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Sergei Ushakov told Russian news agencies. 




Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. 

Ukraine said Russia had launched 171 long-range drones and it shot down 75 while another 63 decoy drones disappeared from radar after likely being jammed. Russia said it destroyed 132 Ukrainian drones in six Russian regions and the annexed Crimea. 

Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, faced its biggest attack of the war as about four dozen drones injured 14 people, including a couple with serious burns, and damaged houses and apartments. 

“In a cruel twist, enemy drones hit Myru Street (‘Peace Street' in English),” Andrii Raikovych, head of the regional administration, said.

More than 50 drones were intercepted in Russia's Saratov region — the largest attack of its kind in the area — shattering windows in a hospital and damaging two kindergartens, a school and about 30 homes, Gov. Roman Busargin said. The attacks were focused on Engels, an industrial city near Russia's main base for nuclear-capable strategic bombers. 

The U.K. Defense Ministry estimated that 900,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. That's a jump of 200,000 from its estimate in the fall after it said Russian forces suffered heavy losses in October.

Defense intelligence said up to 250,000 Russian soldiers had been killed.

Western estimates of the parties' war losses have varied and couldn't be independently verified.

War losses have been a tightly guarded secret in Russia. The Defense Ministry's most recent figures were from 2023 when it reported 6,000 deaths, which was regarded as unreliable.

The U.K. did not release a similar estimate for Ukrainian casualties.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News last month that more than 46,000 soldiers had been killed, and more than 350,000 wounded. Those figures couldn't be independently confirmed and could be an undercount.

If peace comes to Ukraine, the number of troops that would help enforce it is vague. Officials have cited figures of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops. 

Only Britain and France have said they are willing to send troops, though countries including Australia, Canada, France and Finland say they are open to being involved in some way.

“This is more than just a focus on troops. We're talking about protection in air, at sea, and all the operational planning that is needed,” Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said. “What one country can contribute will be different to other countries.”

Around 30 leaders were involved in a video meeting on Saturday including Macron, Zelenskyy, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand and officials from NATO and the European Union.

Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil. And Trump has given no sign the U.S. will guarantee reserve firepower in case of any breaches of a truce. Starmer says the plan won't work without that U.S. “backstop.”

In addition to the meeting in England, EU leaders in Brussels planned to discuss Ukraine's security needs with Zelenskyy during a meeting about ramping up defense spending after the Trump administration signaled Europe must take care of its own security. 

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it's “central” that Ukraine must remain an independent democratic nation, that it can continue its journey toward EU membership and “that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.” 

The German parliament's budget committee is expected to decide Friday to clear up to 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in extra funding for German military aid to Ukraine this year. That comes after parliament voted to loosen Germany's debt rules for military and security spending.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal.

“Europe has engaged in militarization and has turned into a party of war,” Peskov said.

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's efforts to promote the tech CEO on Fox News backfired amid national protests

Donald Trump's commerce secretary told Americans to buy stock in Elon Musk's electric car company, only for shares in Tesla to keep falling.

“I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,” Howard Lutnick told Fox News on Wednesday. “It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap. It'll never be this cheap again.”

He added: “I mean, who wouldn't invest in Elon Musk? You gotta be kidding me.”

Regarding Tesla at least, the answer appears to be: lots of people. In the last month, shares have lost a third of their value. After Lutnick spoke, Tesla was down again in pre-market trading on Thursday.

Musk donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's re-election campaign and is now slashing government staffing and budgets under the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – work proving increasingly unpopular and damaging to his businesses. Amid protests that have included vandalism of Teslas and dealerships, Musk has claimed to have done nothing wrong.

On Tuesday, he told Fox: “It turns out when you take away the money people get fraudulently, they get very upset. They basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we are stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government. I guess they are bad people. Bad people do bad things.”

Republicans have attacked Democrats for speaking out against Tesla. Observers have pointed out how the same Republicans have attacked companies for promoting values they do not share, celebrating financial reverses.

Tesla's problems continue to grow. Last week, JP Morgan said: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.”

This week, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush and a major Tesla backer, said brand damage caused by Musk's work for Trump “has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterize as a brand tornado crisis moment”.

Lutnick spoke to Jesse Watters, a Fox primetime host and Trump cheerleader.

“It's just so outrageous,” the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO said. “You have probably the best entrepreneur, the best technologist, the best leader of any set of companies in America working for America, and you have this sort of weird side of the Democratic party attacking him.”

Lutnick repeated the claim that Musk “rescued” astronauts from the International Space Station via his SpaceX company on Wednesday – yet in fact, Nasa chose to wait for SpaceX to be ready for the mission.

Lutnick urged viewers to “buy Tesla” and expressed disbelief about the shares' performance.

He continued: “When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building, people are going to be dreaming of today and Jesse Watters, thinking, ‘Gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk's stock' … Whether today's the bottom or not, I tell you what, Elon Musk is probably the best person to bet on I've ever met. And I think we all know that.”

Lutnick and Watters then engaged in cheerful promotion of $30,000 robots for domestic chores that the commerce secretary said Musk would soon bring to market.

Concern is growing about conflicts of interest involving Musk and whether he is profiting from his government work. This week, as Musk's Starlink internet service was installed at the White House, senior Democrats called for investigations.

Lutnick told Fox: “Elon Musk is the best entrepreneur and technologist in America, and I bet on him. I wish I was allowed [to buy Tesla stock]. I'm not allowed to buy any stock.”

A rare indirect exchange between an Iranian official and an Israeli scholar took place last week. Mohammad Javad Zarif, a high-ranking diplomat and former foreign minister and vice president, responded to Thamar E. Gindin, an expert on Iran, following a video she published in Persian.Gindin's video was a response to claims made by Zarif during a speech to Iranian students in February. He had accused Israel of forging an enmity with Iran to “make up for the peace signed with Arabs” as part of the Oslo Accords.  “During the 1990s, when the Zionist regime began negotiating with the Arab world, they needed to change the narrative of enmity,” Zarif said in his speech. “They had made up a narrative in which Arabs were the enemies, and suddenly Iran became the enemy.”“Since Israel needed an enemy, they had to invent an enemy somewhere else,” he said, adding that prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as saying Iran was the substitute to the Arabs. AdvertisementZarif also said Israel was harnessing a “false biblical narrative” from the Book of Esther to propagate the narrative of Iranians who were trying to kill the Jews, while “it was in fact the other way around.”Following the speech, Gindin recorded a video addressing Zarif directly. She responded to his claims and challenged him to present proof for his quotes of Rabin.

(credit: DALATI NOHRA/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)To the surprise of many, Zarif directly referred to Gindin's video in an interview with Iranian host Mohammad Fazali – a rare instance of acknowledgment, referring to the Israeli scholar as “a Persian-speaking Israeli lady.”In his new interview, Zarif doubled down on his claims. He quoted an entry from Columbia University's Encyclopaedia Iranica in 1993, which claimed the same about Rabin's intentions.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Zarif also maintained that Israel's enmity toward Iran in the 1990s was the first time when Iran was “free to breathe” after a decade of war. He accused Gindin of continuing the line of bashing Iran's image, “even with a lovely tone.” Advertisement‘A regime lobbyist writing up an encyclopedia entry'The entry “Israeli Relations With Iran” in Encyclopaedia Iranica reads: “Israel's vision of the new Middle East order came at the expense of Iran since Yitzhak Rabin believed that the Israeli population would be unlikely to accept peace with the Arabs unless a greater and more ominous threat, namely Iran and Islamic fundamentalism, was looming in the horizon.Moreover, the Arab states would be more inclined to make peace with Israel if they felt more threatened by Iran's fundamentalist ideology than by Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and its nuclear arsenal.”In an interview with The Jerusalem Post, Gindin said she was surprised by Zarif's direct acknowledgment of her video. “I went on to read the said article Zarif was referring to,” she said.  “When you ask yourself who this mind-reading writer is, that wrote up this article, you find that this section was authored by none other than Trita Parsi, the founder of the National American Iranian Council, perceived as the pro-Islamic Republic lobby in the US,” Gindin said.“It strikes me as ironic that a lobbyist for the most anti-Israel regime was chosen to write up an entry regarding Iranian-Israeli relations,” she said. “Besides, the entry itself has no real references to Rabin ever mentioning such a goal.”The encyclopedia entry cites an accusation made by Israeli scholar Ephraim Inbar, who claimed that former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was “playing [the Iranian threat] more than it was deserved in order to sell the peace process,” Gindin said.Otherwise, no tangible source was brought to attribute such a quote to Rabin, she said, adding that contrary evidence from Dr. Haim Assa, a close adviser to Rabin, quoted him as dismissing the Iranian threat and deeming it “an American issue.”“In any case, I am very excited to have had this exchange with Zarif, whom I see as an intelligent persona, as opposed to the regime's loud mouthpieces,” Gindin said. “I just wish he would stop telling lies about Israel, and remember that it was [former supreme leader Ruhollah] Khomeini who first called for the destruction of the Jewish State, and Israel was the one who mirrored this call, as the entry correctly states.”

Following the speech, Gindin recorded a video addressing Zarif directly. She responded to his claims and challenged him to present proof for his quotes of Rabin.

From Russia's 2008 war in Georgia to its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Black Sea region has been key to Putin's efforts to restore Russian power and influence after the fall of the Soviet Union. RUSI's Dr Neil Melvin explains why the Black Sea is so strategically important to Russia.

Ukraine struck a major Russian strategic bomber airfield on Thursday with drones, triggering a huge blast and fire about 700 km (435 miles) from the front lines of the war, Russian and Ukrainian officials said.

Videos verified by Reuters showed a huge blast spreading out from the airfield, wrecking nearby cottages. Russia's defence ministry said air defences had shot down 132 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions.

Other verified videos showed a giant plume of smoke rising into the dawn sky and an intense fire.

The base in Engels, which dates back to Soviet times, hosts Russia's Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear-capable heavy strategic bombers, known unofficially as White Swans.

Roman Busargin, governor of Saratov, said there had been a Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Engels that had left an airfield on fire, and that nearby residents had been evacuated. He did not specifically mention the Engels base, but it is the main airfield in the area.

Ukraine's defence ministry said its forces had struck the airfield and triggered secondary detonations of ammunition. Kyiv said Russia had used the Engels base to carry out strikes on Ukraine.

Ten people were injured in the attack, local officials said. Some local residents expressed surprise at finding various parts of Ukrainian drones in their gardens. The Shot Telegram channel said that Ukraine struck with PD-2 and Liutyi drones.

Engels district head Maxim Leonov said that a local state of emergency had been declared but gave few details. Reuters was unable to independently confirm what had taken place at the airfield.

Ukraine has conducted previous attacks on the Engels air base dating back to December 2022. In January it claimed to have struck an oil depot serving the base, causing a huge fire that took five days to put out.

A Ukrainian security source said at the time that a drone attack had struck a storage facility holding guided bombs and missiles at the Engels base.

LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S.

The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.

Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction.

The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of England's main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 .

However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the bank's 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes.

“There's a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment," said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. “We still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we've held them at 4.5% today.”



If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the bank's latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.

Bailey said rate-setters will be “looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving” and that whatever happens, "it's our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.

The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economy's growth performance has been notably below its long-run average.

Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses.

Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth.

Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards.

“But beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor,” said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's federal police have raided the homes in Rio de Janeiro of suspects behind the smuggling of 2,000 assault rifles from Miami for a criminal organization in the city. Police said they carried out 14 search and seizure warrants in Rio de Janeiro but did not specify how many individuals were targeted. One man was arrested after shooting at an officer when police attempted to enter his home for the search. Thursday's operation stemmed from the 2017 seizure of 60 pieces of firearms at Rio de Janeiro's international airport. Police said the investigation identified the group's leader. Suspects could face charges such as international gun trafficking, belonging to a criminal organization, money laundering, currency evasion and corruption.

The Israel Police's Lahav 433 Unit of International Crime Investigations arrested two suspects in the ‘Qatargate' affair, in which close aides of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allegedly received funding from Qatar in order to promote its image while serving in the prime minister's office.The identity of the two suspects was not made public due to a gag order.  Israeli Businessman Gil Birger admitted in recordings published by KAN's Reshet Bet on Wednesday that he had transferred funds from a Qatari lobbyist to a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media team, Eli Feldstein.According to the recordings, the lobbyist, Jay Footlik, requested that Birger assist in transferring the funds to Feldstein for VAT purposes. The recordings confirm a report on Tuesday evening by Channel 13's Baruch Kara. AdvertisementAccording to Kara, Feldstein ceased receiving his salary from the prime minister's office in April 2024 after failing a security background check. However, he continued working for the prime minister until October 2024, when he was arrested on charges of leaking a classified document to the German newspaper Bild on behalf of Netanyahu, in order to relieve public outcry over the Hamas killing of six hostages in Rafah due to IDF proximity.According to Kara, Feldstein's salary was effectively paid by the Qatari government during that period, while at the same time working alongside the prime minister, serving primarily as his liaison to military reporters. The recordings and report regarding Feldstein's salary could not be independently confirmed by The Jerusalem Post.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore should be handed plastic cups to drink instead of normal cutlery as they recover their muscle strength, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said.

In an interview with NDTV, Tyson said that the two astronauts, who returned to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) after a nine-month delay, will need time to readjust to Earth's gravity.

"There is no reason to think their muscles will not be able to hold them up... on the ISS, they have many ways to exercise," Neil deGrasse Tyson told NDTV.

"The difference is... when you spend this much time being weightless, your ability to orient for what is 'up' and 'down' is compromised because you never had to use these tools of the inner ear to establish 'up' and 'down' in space. Now I haven't been in space... but I have spoken to astronauts, friends of mine, who have spent a lot of time there, and they say typically they will recover within a week..." he added.

Tyson further warned against handing glass cutlery to the two astronauts.

"... if you hand them a glass, they just let go (because their muscles are weaker). So, make sure the first few beverages are in a plastic cup," Tyson told NDTV with a smile.

Speaking about the extended stay of Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore at the ISS, Tyson said that he was never worried about their safety or about them returning home.

“They are professional astronauts... they are selected not just because they are physically fit but also because they are emotionally fit,” the astrophysicist said.

"And when you are emotionally fit, things like, 'okay, instead of eight days it's nine months'... you don't see them freaking out or reacting in some way that would jeopardise the safety of the crew. So that's why I was never worried... even if everybody else was. At no time did I have sympathy for them." he added.

An eight-day mission for Sunita Williams to the ISS was extended for months after her Boeing space flight developed technical issues.

Williams and Wilmore bid farewell to the ISS, their home since last June, departing aboard a SpaceX capsule alongside two other astronauts.

The capsule undocked from the space station on Tuesday and splashed down off the Florida coast on Wednesday morning after clocking 286 days in space. This was Williams' third space flight, and she clocked a cumulative 608 days in space.

Strikes by refuse workers in Birmingham have led to scenes of chaos, with bins piling up on streets, reports of rats, and some residents saying their recycling hasn't been collected in a month - how we got here

Bin bags are stacked six feet high in some places - one "angry and depressed" local tells the BBC "it's just everywhere"

See the latest pictures of some of the worst-hit areas

A mobile bin collection was called off on Wednesday after it was swarmed by people desperate to dispose of their rubbish - our reporter Katie Thompson says it was like "binmageddon"

Unite union members began on-off strikes in January, but just over a week ago moved to all-out action in a dispute over pay and working conditions

'You can smell the stench': Why rubbish is piling up on Birmingham streets

Andy Giddings and Trystan Jones

It's been nine days since all-out strike action started in Birmingham, but some residents say their waste hasn't been collected for much longer.

There are fears for public health as piled-up rubbish bags attract rats, with West Midlands MP Wendy Morton telling the House of Commons the "squeaky blinders" are not welcome in her constituency.

Here's how it looks today.

Birmingham residents aren't the only ones who've had to put up with bin strikes in recent years.

The Unite union was also in dispute with Coventry City Council over pay and staged six months of strike action in 2022.

That ended with workers accepting a pay rise for the drivers worth up to 12.9%, but the row between union and council reignited in 2023 over a decision to fire and rehire bin workers.

Josh SandifordBBC Radio WM, reporting from Birmingham

Student Milan Karki, who lives in Balsall Heath, has told me he feels let down by the city.

Originally from Nepal, he came to study at Birmingham City University and thought living conditions would be more "civilised".

I caught up with him on Ladypool Road and he explained he's worried the piled-up rubbish could lead to health problems.

"Where people live, it
should be clean," he says.

He thinks the council should survey residents affected by the strike and fulfil their demands.

"I feel like I need to change this area. This area is not good to live," he says.

Concerns have been raised in Parliament that "rats the
size of cats" are spreading across the West Midlands as a consequence of Birmingham's bin strike.

Wendy Morton, Conservative MP for Alridge-Brownhills, highlighted her fears in the House of Commons and said the "squeaky blinders" were not welcome in her constituency.

"Particularly in the communities that border Birmingham,
alarmingly we're hearing of rats the size of cats in Britain's second city," she said.

"Let's be quite certain, the squeaky blinders are definitely
not welcome in Aldridge-Brownhills."

Kath StancyzszynBBC Radio WM

Since the start of the strike action there has been a "small increase" in the number of rubbish fires, West Midlands Fire Service has said.

Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told BBC Radio WM: "Our biggest concern at the minute is where we see a build-up of rubbish outside anybody's property."

She said she was worried a big rubbish fire outside someone's home could have "devastating" consequences.

Ms McSweeney said it was not possible to conclusively link the increase in rubbish fires to the strike action and rubbish being left in the street.

But she urged people not to burn their rubbish and to safely dispose of items like lithium batteries in recycling banks if possible.

Matthew Howes is based in Balsall Heath and got in touch to tell us he saw rubbish
being ripped open by foxes earlier today. 

"It's difficult to enjoy the current warm weather because of
the stench of the rubbish hanging over the whole area," he says.

He worries children in a nearby playground will be bitten by rats, but says he does not blame the refuse collectors. 

"It is a tough dirty job and they work outside in all weathers," he says.

"I blame successive austerity measures, which have been in place since the financial crisis."

Waste is piling up on the streets of Birmingham amid an ongoing bin collection strike. 

Refuse collectors had been striking on and off since January, but the dispute escalated into an all-out strike on 11 March. Here's a recap of what's been going on:

'Crisis point'

That's how the situation is being described by local MP Preet Gill. She fears a "public health emergency" and says residents report it's "driving a plague of rats and cockroaches". The owner of a pest control business told the BBC "there are rats in front gardens, back, and gaining access".See our picture round-up to get a sense of how it's looking on the ground.

'Like binmageddon' 

Yesterday, the rare sighting of a bin lorry led to so many people turning up desperate to offload their rubbish that a local councillor called the police. The BBC's Katie Thompson was at the scene, and said people were rushing down the streets or arriving in cars. She described it as "like some sort of binmageddon" - read her report here. 

Mixed picture 

Our reporters suggest the picture is mixed across the city, with some areas not seeing the large piles of rubbish that have been observed in the worst-affected areas. The BBC's Josh Sandiford reports another mobile collection today was much calmer, but there appeared to be private security present. 

No end in sight 

So far, there's no sign either the council or the Unite union are budging. Unite has said its members face large pay cuts and insists the council can afford to pay them. The council has said it needs to get a grip of its finances and can't afford the Unite demands. See our brief explainer of the dispute here.

Dan O'Brien, 27, lives in central Birmingham and says he saw
four dead rats on his morning walk earlier today.

"For hundreds of residents in our apartments, the rubbish is
overflowing," he says. "As someone whose work takes them across
the city, the sights are absolutely shocking.

"Large rats, some dead from being
hit by cars, are now common on my walk to work. It's just everywhere."

Dan has resorted to using a
private firm to dispose of his recycling, which hadn't been collected since
December. He says the effort involved is "maddening".

"It's such a terrible situation," he says. "I empathise with
worker's rights, but day-to-day life is tremendously difficult. This is
something else we don't need."

He wonders whether "the public health
hazard in Birmingham" is a sign of things to come?

Despite the widespread mess, scenes of bin bags piled high in many parts of Birmingham are "unrecognisable" to residents in other parts of the city.

Some people living in Cotteridge and Bournville say that while recycling has been ignored, waste has been collected on schedule every week.

If you're one of those lucky to have rubbish-free streets in Birmingham, we'd love to hear from you as well.

Josh SandifordBBC News, West Midlands

Javed Haider has been speaking to us in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham.

He says he's seen rats around the bin bags on the streets and believes they have become a "health hazard".

Haider says there is a problem with fly-tipping too and adds: "There's spots where people just come of their cars, dump it and they go away."

He urges both sides in the dispute to "try to sort something out".

Elizabeth GlinkaPolitical editor, BBC Midlands

The ongoing row between the Labour-run authority and the
Unite union is uncomfortable for all involved, not least the residents of
Birmingham, but for Labour it is also a political tightrope. 

A succession of MPs and councillors will tell you the
council has made a fair offer, and that both sides need to get around the table
and find a solution, but that's easier said than done.

In recent years, the all-out bin strike by Unite staff in
Labour-run Coventry became deeply acrimonious after talks repeatedly failed, and eventually the authority moved to a policy of "fire and re-hire".

I'm told Labour in Birmingham wants to avoid that - indeed it is something the Labour
government wants to restrict in its Employment Rights Bill, which was introduced
last autumn.

While some politicians outside the second city may seem to
want to keep a public distance from this dispute, make no mistake that behind
the scenes, senior Labour figures in government and elsewhere are reaching out
to Unite in an effort to end this action as soon as possible.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has weighed in, using the rubbish piling up on Birmingham's streets as an attack line ahead of the local elections in May.

"If you vote Labour, you get trash," she says, in a broadside at the Labour-run council. 

It's a repeat of a line she used at Prime Minister's Questions the week before - responding to that and other criticisms, Keir Starmer addressed wider national issues, saying his party was fixing the "mess" left by the Conservatives. 

Onay Kasab, Unite's national lead officer, has been asked how this strike can be resolved.

He says there first needs to be clarity over the numbers of people affected and the amount of money they stand to lose - something the two sides have so far failed to agree on.

He also says it's "absolutely key" to have clarity over the impact the union's pay claim would have on equal pay at the council.

The council leader, John Cotton, has said making pay concessions to the largely male bin collecting workforce could lead to further equal pay claims for women, which it cannot afford.

He said the need to restructure pay across the council was behind the changes to the bin workers' pay.

But Kasab says: "The council are throwing out the argument about equal pay every two minutes implying that no resolution can be reached as a result. I don't accept that."

He says he wants to see the legal arguments to back this claim up.

Alexander BrockLocal Democracy Reporting Service

Even before this latest strike action began, Birmingham was struggling to keep up with its bin collections.

The city council had a target of no more than 90 missed collections per 100,000, but new figures show that in the third quarter of 2024-2025 it was missing 356 per 100,000.

That was 31% higher than the previous quarter and more than double the figure from the previous year.

The numbers appear in a council cabinet report which also reveals incidents of fly-tipping were up and the number of those cleared within a week was down.

Rachael LewisBBC Radio WM, reporting from Birmingham

Stephen Message from Hockley tells us he's "angry and depressed" by the bin strike.

There are bin bags in his street stacked six feet high, right up to the top of a hedge.

"It's just everywhere," he says.

He's worried about the smell that will be created now that we're getting some warmer weather. "Why would you come to Birmingham now with this dispute on," he adds.

Message is also very unhappy with Birmingham City Council.

He asks: "Why has the council left it to this point to not end the dispute?"

As we've been reporting, the bin strike has led to large piles of rubbish building up in some Birmingham streets. 

In one case, the rare sight of a collection lorry caused such a stir that the police were called. 

Here's a few images of the scene over the past few days: 

Birmingham MP Preet Gill said she feared a "public health emergency"

As the rubbish continues to pile up, people are becoming increasingly worried about pests and vermin.

Labour MP for Edgbaston Preet Gill has written to Birmingham City Council with her concerns, saying she now fears a "public health emergency".

She says the bin bags are obstructing pavements, adding: "Residents are reporting that the waste is driving a plague of rats and cockroaches."

With the warmer weather approaching, she fears the situation could get worse.

The issue was also raised during Prime Minister's Questions last week, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch attacking Labour, saying rubbish was "piling up" on the city's streets.

As rubbish piles up in the streets, Birmingham City Council and the Unite union are insisting they won't budge in their positions. 

An indefinite all-out strike began on 11 March, but refuse collectors had been striking on and off since January. So what's it all about?

What the union says

How about the council?



Birmingham City Council has been operating what it calls Mobile Household Waste Centres for a couple of years now.

Normally, the bin lorries are a way for people to get rid of their extra household waste or bulky items and there are two of them, which get around 10 locations in the city every week.

Every day they arrive at 07:30 GMT and leave at 13:00, and there is no need to book, pay or bring ID.

People have also been told they can visit the pick-up points as many times as they want, but while the strike is on, the city council has said it can not accept waste from people in vans who want to get rid of large quantities of waste.

Residents can check on the council website, external to learn where the collection service is due to visit.

The council has also said it sends staff out with the lorries.

Josh SandifordBBC Radio WM, reporting from Birmingham

I've been speaking to some of the people dropping off their rubbish at a mobile collection service in Bordesley Green this morning.

Mushtaq Hussain tells me it suits him because he is on an afternoon shift today. He says it's fine for "us youngsters" who could drive, but he worried about more elderly people who could not.

He also says there's a problem with people dumping waste in the streets.

"When you see one bag left somewhere someone else comes along and dumps rubbish," he explains. 

Asim Iqbal says there was "mess and smells everywhere".

He says there were seven people living in his house so they were producing a lot of waste and would normally have to visit the recycling centres to take it away.

Texas becomes the third US state after Georgia and New York to formally recognise Holi (Photo:PTI)


	The Texas Senate has passed its first-ever resolution recognising Holi, officially acknowledging the Hindu festival of colours as a significant cultural celebration.


	With this move, Texas becomes the third US state after Georgia and New York to formally recognise Holi.


	The resolution was introduced by Senator Sarah Eckhardt and passed just ahead of Holi celebrations on March 14. It highlights Holi's cultural and spiritual significance, celebrating spring, renewal, unity, and the triumph of good over evil.


	"The origins of this jubilant festival can be traced back many millennia, and the holiday is recognised and celebrated throughout the world by people of all backgrounds who relate to the festival's themes of love, renewal, and progress," the resolution states.


	The Senate also emphasised Holi's role in strengthening community bonds and enriching Texas's cultural diversity.


	Consul General of India in Houston, DC Manjunath, told PTI, This is a proud and historic moment for Texas. The recognition of Holi by the State Senate affirms our commitment to diversity, unity, friendship, and cultural heritage. We thank Senator Sarah Eckhardt and all those who made this resolution possible. Holi's message of unity and renewal resonates across communities, and we are honoured to see it formally celebrated in our state.


	The resolution was supported by the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), which worked closely with Senator Eckhardt's office.


	HAF representatives and members of the Hindu American community were present in the Senate gallery during the reading.


	In a statement, HAF said, "Texas Senate passes its FIRST-EVER Holi resolution! @SarahEckhardt TX makes history as Texas becomes the third state after Georgia and New York to recognise Holi, celebrating unity, colour, and the spirit of unity and friendship." 
	The resolution marks a key milestone in recognising the growing cultural contributions of the Indian American community across Texas.

Topic:Happiness

The United Kingdom has reported its lowest average life evaluation, ranking 23rd in the world.  (Getty Image: Mike Kemp/In Pictures)

Australia has dropped out the top 10 in the latest list of the world's happiest countries. 

The World Happiness Report ranked Australia 11th and New Zealand 12th in the world, lagging behind Israel, Mexico and Nordic countries. 

Believing in the kindness of others is more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

Australia is no longer one of the top 10 happiest countries in world. 

The latest World Happiness Report ranks Australia 11th and New Zealand 12th in the world, lagging behind Israel, Mexico and some Nordic countries. 

Finland has taken out the title as the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row.

Other Nordic countries, including Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings. 

Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at 8th, while Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at 6th and 10th.

Australia made the last annual report top 10 but slipped one place to 11 in 2025, while Switzerland also dropped out of the top 10.

The annual report, which collects data from 2022-2024 but is published in 2025, is based on a single life evaluation question called the Cantril Ladder. 

The survey asks more than 100,000 people in 140 countries and territories to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a zero. 

The respondents are then asked to rate their own current lives on that scale.

The study, which was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, faced criticism from academics last year, who suggested the question makes people think more about power and wealth.

“The risk is that we are measuring a narrow, wealth and power-oriented form of well-being, rather than broader definitions of happiness,” PhD student August Nilsson wrote at the time.

The Lund University researcher said the ladder reflected people's income levels and social status to a larger degree than other well-being metrics.

When it comes to decreasing happiness , the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. 

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women, the subject of severe restrictions under the Taliban regime, saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking the 3rd from the bottom.

While Israel is in the top 10 for happiness, the State of Palestine is ranked 108th.

Researchers said sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size were the key factors for happiness. 

In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Finland is named the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back," said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. "If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

News from around the country and around the globe

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Overall, researchers said global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at 8th. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at 6th and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness —the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking the 3rd from the bottom. 

In a concerning development, the study said 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.

        Authorities closed off roads and implemented a four-day demonstration ban in an effort to prevent protests following Ekrem İmamoğlu's arrest.
    

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Istanbul on Thursday following the arrest of the city's mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu. The opposition figure is seen as a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Several roads had been closed, some social media platforms were restricted, and a four-day demonstration ban was put into place in an attempt to thwart protests. 

However, despite the ban, many gathered outside the Istanbul's police headquarters, the City Hall, and outside the headquarters of İmamoğlu's Republican People's Party (CHP).

One protester called the arrest "unlawful" and "baseless". 

"This is not democracy. It's a sham of democracy. The people do not deserve this. We are upset of course. As humans, we are upset," he said. 

Riot policed blocked off roads leading to the Vatan Security Department, where the mayor was taken following his arrest. 

İmamoğlu is a popular oppositon leader and the main rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A total of 100 people, including the mayor and several other prominent figures, were arrested. 

İmamoğlu and his aides are suspected of alleged corruption, including extortion and fraud, as well as aiding the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), an outlawed party classified as a terrorist organisation by Ankara, Washington and other Turkish allies. 

İmamoğlu's arrest comes amid a wider crackdown on opposition figures, which has been criticised as a politically motivated in an attempt to silence dissent. 

A day earlier, Istanbul University revoked the mayor's bachelor degree, a requisite for running in elections under Turkish law.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, the leader Republican People's Party (CHP) Özgür Özel mirrored the criticism. He claimed Erdogan, who has experienced significant losses in local elections last year, targeted İmamoğlu as he feared losing to him in the ballots.

Özel also accused authorities of a "coup attempt".

"They can do any evil. We are ready for any evil they can do. Because it is clear that the issue is not a political struggle, but a matter of existence or non-existence for the country," he added.

Turkey's Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc countered the allegations, and reminded that the courts operate independently.

"Characterizing investigations carried out by an impartial and independent judiciary as something like a coup, or using similar terms is extremely dangerous and incorrect," Tunc said.

The justice minister emphasised that the judiciary "does not take instructions from anyone."

"Linking investigations and cases initiated by the judiciary to our president is, at best, presumptuous and inappropriate. The separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary is essential in our country," he concluded.

On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed deep concern over İmamoğlu's arrest, and reminded Turkey of its obligation to uphold democratic values. 

"Turkey is and an EU candidate country, Turkey must uphold the democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials," von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels.

"We want Turkey to remain anchored to Europe, but this requires a clear commitment to democratic norms and practices, and it is key that Turkey respects these fundamental principles," she added.

A new global report says that people in Finland are the happiest in the world

Finland Is Again Ranked the Happiest Country in the World. the US Falls to Its Lowest-Ever Position

HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.

Other Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.

Aino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.

“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. "And I think it's because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It's clean and the air is fresh and what's there not to love?” 

Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

“Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth — it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back," said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. "If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”



  Sharing meals and having somebody to count on
 

Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.

As an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.

Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

Alexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.

“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other," Peth said. "So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”

Overall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.



  The U.S. falls to its lowest-ever position in the happiness ranking
 

While European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.

When it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.

The United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.

Afghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.

Sierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom. 



  Almost one-fifth of young adults globally have no social support
 

In a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.

All countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024. 

Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.

Jouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”

“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.

The Nordic countries of Finland, Denmark, and Iceland once again topped the list of the happiest countries in the world, while the United States failed to recover from last year's historic drop out of the top 20, the World Happiness Report revealed.

The countries that rank in the upper echelons of joy are “not surprising,” to Julie Ray, Gallup's managing editor for world news.

“Finland, in particular, has a lack of inequality,” she told Quartz. “Strong safety nets and relatively strong economies are characteristic of the top of the list.”

A strong economy, however, is not enough to guarantee the happiness of a country's citizens. The United States, which ranked 24th in the world, was one of several wealthy, industrialized nations that has seen a decrease in overall happiness. Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Canada have all experienced noticeable declines – while less affluent countries like Mexico and Costa Rica rank among the happiest in the world.

“This year's report quantifies the human elements of life that are often hard to measure,” said Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, director of Oxford's Wellbeing Research Centre, in a statement. “These findings push us to look beyond traditional determinants like health and wealth and encourage people to get back around the table together.”

The World Happiness Report analysis suggests that people in Latin American countries are especially happy, relative to their countries' gross domestic products, because of the close social and familial ties which exist in their cultures.

Living with four to five people and sharing meals with others, for example, are both considered optimal for overall happiness. In less affluent countries, like Mexico, bigger households are more common than in Europe or the United States – which could counterbalance a relative lack of wealth.

“Although income does play a big role in people's life evaluations, it's not just money that explains why people are happy,” Ray said.

In fact, this year's report places special emphasis on themes of “sharing and caring” as significant factors in the overall happiness of individuals and entire countries. So-called “deaths of despair” – which are deaths linked to suicide or drug and alcohol use – are less common in countries where people frequently engage in benevolent acts.

“If you're giving to others by donating your time, donating your money, or even helping a stranger, that improves your wellbeing,” said Ray. “You're giving to somebody else, but you're getting happiness in return.”

FILE - In this July 10, 2013, file photo, prospective students tour Georgetown University's campus in Washington.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Georgetown University researcher who is married to a Palestinian American was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked, prompting another high-profile legal fight over deportation proceedings against foreign-born visa holders authorized to live in the U.S.

Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India, was arrested Monday night outside of his Virginia home by officers who identified themselves as Department of Homeland Security agents, according to a legal filing by Suri's lawyer.

Hassan Ahmad, Suri's Virginia-based attorney, wrote in a court filing that Suri was targeted because of his wife's “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.”

Suri was later taken to a detention facility in Louisiana, according to a government website. His lawyers are seeking his immediate release and to halt deportation proceedings through their habeas motion filed Tuesday against the Trump administration.

“The Trump Administration has openly expressed its intention to weaponize immigration law to punish noncitizens whose views are deemed critical of U.S. policy as it relates to Israel,” Suri's attorney wrote.

Suri's detention more than 1,000 miles (about 1,600 kilometers) away from his family and attorney is “plainly intended as retaliation and punishment for Mr. Suri's protected speech," his attorney added.

The deportation effort comes amid legal fights over cases involving a Columbia University international affairs graduate student and a doctor from Lebanon.

Suri was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media” and determined to be deportable by the Secretary of State's office, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said late Wednesday on X, formerly known as Twitter. Suri's case was first reported by Politico.

The filing by Suri's lawyer said that federal authorities have provided no evidence that he's committed any crimes and that his detention violates his free speech and due process rights. Suri, who has no criminal record, holds a visa authorizing him to be in the U.S. as a visiting scholar, and his wife is a U.S. citizen, according to the motion.

His lawyer didn't immediately respond to an messages seeking further comment Thursday.

Suri's lawyers say he's currently teaching a course at Georgetown and hopes to become a university professor. A Georgetown webpage identifies Suri as a postdoctoral fellow at Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the university. The university said his areas of interest include religion, violence and peace processes in the Middle East and South Asia. The bio said that he earned a doctorate in India while studying efforts to introduce democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq, and he has traveled extensively in conflict zones in several countries.

The university said in a statement Thursday that Suri is an Indian national who was “duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.”

“We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,” the school said. “We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”

The U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement detainee locator website lists Suri as being in the custody of immigration officials at the Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana.

Separately, Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with no criminal record, was detained earlier this month over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. And Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported over the weekend despite having a U.S. visa.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Thursday to close the Education Department, fulfilling a yearslong pledge to dismantle the federal agency, the White House confirmed.

Trump will hold an event at the White House to sign the order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”

USA Today first reported that Trump will sign the order Thursday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared the story Thursday morning in a post to X, writing in all-capital letters that the signing was "happening today at 4pm ET."

Formally closing the department requires an act of Congress. But even without formally shutting it down, the Trump administration could effectively make it nearly impossible for employees to carry out their work, as it has done with the U.S. Agency for International Development.

President Jimmy Carter established the department in 1979 after Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act in bipartisan votes.

McMahon recently moved to drastically reduce the size of the Education Department by cutting its workforce in half. She called the job terminations the first step toward shutting down the department.

"That was the president's mandate," McMahon said last week in an interview with Fox News. "His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know we'll have to work with Congress, you know, to get that accomplished."

McMahon similarly vowed at her Senate confirmation hearing to work with Congress to advance Trump's plan to dismantle the department. She telegraphed in an email to employees this month that major changes were coming.

“Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected, who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education—a momentous final mission—quickly and responsibly,” she wrote, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.

The Senate confirmed McMahon in a 51-45 vote. No Democrat voted for her.

Trump has suggested that he could garner enough congressional support to formally close the department, characterizing teachers unions as more of a threat to the plan than lawmakers.

“I think I'd work with Congress,” Trump said last month in the Oval Office. “We'd have to work with the teachers union, because the teachers union is the only one that's opposed to it.”

It is unclear whether Trump has secured the support of any Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have balked at his efforts on that front.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, accused Trump and Elon Musk, the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, of “robbing our students and families of critical funding.”

“The effects of Trump and Musk's slash and burn campaign will be felt across our state—by students and families who suffer from the loss of Department staff working to ensure their rights under federal law, school districts who have to lay off teachers, students who can't get the help they need to get financial aid, and families who get ripped off because the watchdogs were fired,” Murray said in a statement Wednesday night. “This issue is personal for me, and for every single family. We cannot relent in this fight.”

A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit last week arguing any attempt by Trump to eliminate the department is unlawful.

"Because neither the President nor his agencies can undo the many acts of Congress that authorize the Department, dictate its responsibilities, and appropriate funds for it to administer, the President's directive to eliminate the Department of Education—including through the March 11 decimation of the Department's workforce and any other agency implementation—is an unlawful violation of the separation of powers, and the Executive's obligation to take care that the law be faithfully executed," the lawsuit reads.

The Education Department is one of the smallest Cabinet-level departments. Its $268 billion appropriations last year represented 4% of the U.S. budget.

The department does not dictate curricula used in classrooms. It is largely a funding and civil rights enforcement organization, distributing money for schools with high rates of impoverished students and to assist children with disabilities.

It also runs the public student loan program, which has more consumer protections and lower interest rates than private education loan programs.

Trump's executive order will direct McMahon to ensure the agency's funds do not go toward programs or activities that advance diversity, equity and inclusion goals or gender ideology. 

The Education Department last week announced investigations into more than 50 universities it accused of “engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.”

Diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, is a widely used label applied to efforts to improve workplace culture and create more opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and they are not inherently discriminatory.

National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement Wednesday that Trump's effort to close the Education Department could have disastrous implications for students across the country.

"If successful, Trump's continued actions will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections," Pringle said in a statement.

She accused Trump and Musk of aiming "their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America to pay for tax handouts for billionaires."

McMahon said last week that at least three DOGE staffers had been auditing the Education Department.

Keri Rodrigues, the president of the National Parents Union, said dismantling the department would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities.

“Let's be clear: Before federal oversight, millions of children—particularly those with disabilities and those from our most vulnerable communities—were denied the opportunities they deserved,” Rodrigues said in a statement Wednesday night. “The Department of Education was created to ensure that every child, regardless of background or zip code, has access to a public education that prepares them for their future. Eliminating it would roll back decades of progress, leaving countless children behind in an education system that has historically failed the most marginalized.”

Trump has long pledged to dismantle the Education Department, first mentioning the idea during his previous term and campaigning on the promise extensively throughout the 2024 election. He has suggested that states should take over administering educational policy and that other parts of the federal government could absorb current agency responsibilities, like overseeing federal student loans.

"Your state is going to control your children's education. We're moving it out of Washington immediately," Trump said at a campaign event last year in Saginaw, Michigan. "We're going to do that very fast, and it's going to be great."

'Life, Liberty and Levin' host Mark Levin slams a judge's challenge to President Donald Trump's deportations on 'The Story.'

Many federal district court judges are issuing imprudent and obviously politicized decisions to block early actions by President Trump and his team on many fronts, even though Trump ran on a very specific agenda and won an overwhelming victory. The judges, of course, will say they don't care about elections but about the law and the constitution, but it sure feels like "the Resistance in Robes."

Some rulings are so wrong that even their beneficiaries give up before higher courts return to their cases, e.g. "Special Counsel" Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed to the obscure post in the vast civil service bureaucracy during the late Biden Regency and was confirmed in the job in February of last year.

Trump fired Dellinger early on in Term 2 —and it is settled law that it is Trump's right to do just that— but Dellinger made a play for a district court order preventing the firing…and got one from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C.!

JUDGES BLOCKING TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE ACTING ‘ERRONEOUSLY,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

"The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing — by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one," Jackson wrote in her decision.

That's just a bad decision, squarely contrary to long-standing precedent, and the ruling would have been reversed on appeal, but Dellinger must have figured just that: He and the judge would in fact get scorched on appeal, so he quit, mooting the case.

Too bad. Too many journalists think Trump "lost" that case when he didn't. He won that controversy despite the equivalent of an egregious call from the officials on the field of an NFL game, a call the plaintiff himself reversed by dropping the case.

There are other such bad court decisions and there will be more wins by Trump as the cases move through the ordinary appeals system. President Trump's lawyers are also pressing some novel theories that would upend decades of precedent, and there's nothing wrong with throwing the long legal ball, or even a few of them. The president is going to lose some of those, but if he wins some important ones, the Constitution will be better off.

Trump built part of the current Supreme Court during his first term. The highest court is always a sort of Constitutional trampoline where legal theories jump up and down over the decades, propelled by events and presidents. Now President Trump is jumping on that trampoline — just as FDR did early in his presidency — to see how high presidential power can go.

I hope the president's long-balls succeed at least as much as is necessary to curb the unelected, unresponsive federal bureaucracy and its core group of "independent agencies."

Our constitution did not envision a "fourth branch" of government made up of the kudzu of independent agencies, and this "fourth branch" needs to be checked and cut back, dramatically. This Supreme Court has set about doing that in the past two years with some major decisions paring back the power of the administrative state.

Trump will lose some cases, however, including, I think, his attempt to curtail "birthright citizenship" via executive order. It is the tradition in the United States, deeply etched in our history, that if you are born here, you are a citizen here. I believe the great migration of the 1880s to 1920s established that practice to so deep a level of American tradition that only an Amendment to the Constitution would change it, not even a statute and certainly not an executive order. But the very old Reagan-era judge who dismissed the argument about the executive order with intemperate language did not bring credit to the federal judiciary given that this is a high-profile case of first impression.

Another case of first impression is the president's deportation of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, who were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador on Saturday. The Venezuelan cartel is Tren de Aragua (TdA), and the president declared that organization was guilty of "perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States." Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in making his declaration and ordering the deportations. Combined with his inherent Article II authority under the Constitution, Trump is operating in what the late Justice Robert Jackson would have termed the zone of greatest presidential power. This is also a case of first impression —no court has ever dealt with such a situation before— so everyone is guessing what will happen in its aftermath.  

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, confronted with the deportations already underway on Saturday night, acted in a sloppy and frankly lazy and high-handed fashion, and in the absence of a specific, written order, Trump officials did not turn the planes around which the judge appears to have wanted them to do and which he assumed they would do. "Assumptions" are a bad strategy even for the most self-assured federal judges who think when they get to Heaven they will share the highest bench with God. 

Boasberg is now obviously embarrassed and angry that the Executive Branch didn't read his mind or his unwritten order and would dare blow him off, and so he has been busy digging his judicial hole deeper. What he should do is cut his losses, dismiss the case as the non-justiciable political question it is, and let the deportees decide if they want to appeal to the D.C. Circuit. Boasberg isn't likely to get the final word here whether he stomps his feet or not.

But he's flailing around this week and saying things that suggest he believes he runs the Executive Branch and not the president. That's when Republican House members started calling for his impeachment, echoing President Trump's own frustration with federal judges popping up like whack-a-mole to obstruct the president. (Meanwhile, the commander-in-chief is ordering military strikes on the Houthis. Perhaps Judge Boasberg has an opinion on that too?)

So the judges have clearly pushed themselves collectively to the forefront of many political disputes. That's not new. Maybe the number and pace of the disputes is new, but collisions between the branches of government are not new.  This is not a "crisis." It is the ordinary working of the Constitution. 

The effort to mainstream "impeachment" of left-wing, highly ideological judges is, however, unusual – and it is terrible governance and worse politics. Chief Justice Roberts spoke out against it this week as a threat against the independence of the third branch of government  — just as the chief justice did when Senator Schumer appeared in front of the Supreme Court to threaten it a few years back — and urged the "impeachment" chatter cease. The chief justice is right. Everything is fine, this is ordinary stuff and will work its way through the courts. But courts are slow. Some key reminders.

First, people who believe in the Constitution and the rule of law should have been disgusted by the politicization of the impeachment process against President Trump and even more repulsed by the weaponization of the DOJ, FBI, NARA and state prosecutors against a former president.

They ought also to have defended Judge Aileen Cannon against attacks on her judicial independence (and careful jurisprudence) as well as defended the SCOTUS and its individual members from outrageous threats made by Senator Schumer and smears by Senator Whitehouse and many others. 

The left wants to destroy the rule of law by breaking the Senate filibuster and "packing the Supreme Court." Our foreign adversaries advance these arguments via bots and trolls, but there are some populist actors on the left and on the right that care very little for the orderly rule of law. The foreign adversaries want to divide our country from its Constitution, and some conservatives have grown weary of being the party of the "rule of law" while the left just goes wild in the streets, but that's what the GOP has been and must remain.

People who believe in the Constitution have to fight back against the effort to use extra-judicial remedies every day. We can be clever about that. It might, for example, be a good idea for Senate Leader Thune to bring the "Court packing" bill from the Democrat wish list of 2021 up right now to see if Senate Democrats still support it. They won't, of course, because if it passed now it would not support their extreme ideological end. I hope every GOP senator would vote against it after bringing it through the cloture process just to get Democrats on record as being about power, not law.

Generally, however, we who believe in liberty, the rule of law and the Constitution should not embrace the revolutionary tactics of the hard left and use weapons of extraordinary power for ordinary arguments between the branches. It might be cathartic to demand "impeachment" of judges making lousy decisions, especially right now as we are swamped with many awful district court decisions, but the correct "rule of law" response is to defend the Constitution for the system to work has it has since 1789.

Students of history will recall the ill-conceived partisan attempt to impeach Justice Chase by Jefferson's hyper-supporters in 1804-5. Chase was impeached by the House, but cooler heads prevailed in the Senate and he was not convicted and removed, and we are blessed that it turned out that way and impeachment did not become part of the political process.

Justices and judges are always going to make mistakes (e.g. the great Justice Scalia got the decision in Employment Division v Smith on the Free Exercise Clause wrong, wrong, wrong in 1990) but the answer is in the appeals system and eventual reconsideration of bad precedents, not impeachment resolutions that waste time and won't succeed because they shouldn't succeed.

The answer comes in two forms: More great nominees for federal judgeships followed by quick confirmations and more terrific lawyering by Attorney General Pam Bondi of which we have already seen much and of which we should see much more.

In 2023, Canada exported 97 per cent of its crude oil to the United States

OTTAWA – The tariff war with the United States could have been very different if Canada had decided to build the Energy East and LNG Quebec pipelines over the past decade, according to a new study by the Montreal Economic Institute.

Both pipelines could have redirected $38.4 billion worth of energy products per year to markets other than the United States and the institute argues that the construction of pipelines between Eastern and Western Canada “would have helped diversify Canadian export markets” significantly.

In 2023, Canada exported 97 per cent of its crude oil to the United States.

“Canada's high level of dependence on U.S. trade is not unavoidable. It is the direct result of years of policy decisions that have delayed or actively impeded major infrastructure projects,” said Gabriel Giguère, senior policy analyst and author of the report at MEI.

Giguère noted in his study that based on its transport capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day, commissioning of the pipeline Energy East could have diverted 27.7 per cent of Canadian oil exports from the United States to Europe, an amount worth $36.7 billion per year.

Energy East, a 4,500 km pipeline from Alberta to the Irving refinery in New Brunswick, was proposed in 2013 by TransCanada (TC Energy) and abandoned in 2017 due to regulatory hurdles in Canada and strong opposition from environmental groups. The project was estimated at over $15 billion at the time.

It was expected to be operational by 2021. The revival of the project has not yet been announced. In fact, TC Energy doesn't even build pipelines for heavy crude oil anymore, having moved its heavy oil operations to South Bow.

In an interview with the National Post, the chairman of Strathcona Resources said that moving crude oil from Alberta to New Brunswick is not an easy task.

“There would have to be, not only pipelines built to the east, but there would have to be refining capacity configured to be able to receive heavy crudes,” said Adam Waterous.



Energy East was also unpopular in Quebec at the time. The provincial government never signed on to it because it saw few benefits and the pipeline route would have to cross several rivers, which raised concerns among Quebecers.

Another project, GNL Québec, was blocked by the Quebec government due to environmental concerns in 2021. The project was a $14-billion pipeline with a terminal in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.

Based on its transport capacity of 46 million cubic meters of gas per day, its implementation could have diverted 19 per cent of Canadian gas exports to Europe, representing $1.7 billion worth of goods per year.

According to a recent poll, both projects now receive a tremendous amount of support from Quebecers and both Liberals and Conservatives support pipeline construction in the context of a trade war with the United States.

Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently said that Canada should immediately build a pipeline “in the east so we can supply our own country with energy.” Mr. Harper was speaking Tuesday during a panel on energy at the Raisina Dialogue, India's largest geopolitical conference.

However, the costs of building such infrastructures have risen considerably.

“The cost to build the infrastructure is what drives the competitiveness of the product in each market. Going west is a quarter the distance of going east, therefore going west will always be more cost competitive than going east,” said TC Energy's CEO François Poirier in an interview with the National Post.

“And so that is where I think as a nation, in terms of diversifying our markets, both in crude oil and natural gas, we need to be looking west,” he added.

Hindalco will be investing  ₹45,000 crore across its aluminium, copper and speciality alumina businesses in the future, Aditya Birla group chairman Kumarmangalam Birla said on Thursday.

Speaking at an event to unveil a new brand identity for Hindalco, Birla said the company wants to be a force for good and affirmed the country's largest aluminium producer's commitment towards it.

"...we are committing  ₹45,000 crore across the aluminum, copper and specialty alumina businesses to deliver both upstream as well as next gen, high precision engineered products," Birla said at the event.

Aluminium, copper, and alumina are integral to solar modules and battery storage, Birla said, without spelling out a timeline for the investment.

Birla said the company is adding 150 MW to its renewable energy capacity to take the overall generation possibility to 350 MW.

The company has "pioneered" a 100-MW renewable energy solution in Odisha for aluminium smelting, combining wind, solar, and pumped hydro storage for stable, round-the-clock energy, Birla said.

The company is working on solutions in different areas, including EV mobility, renewable energy, energy storage, semiconductors, and high-end electronics, Birla said.

In auto, Hindalco is enabling lighter, more fuel-efficient, and EV-ready vehicles, and has helped design and manufacture lightweight battery enclosures for two-wheeler and cars, he said.

The company is setting up India's first Copper Foil facility for EVs, and also looking at high-speed transportation sector, Birla said, pointing that the first hyperloop test track has Hindalco's high-precision aluminium extrusions.

It is also developing hard alloy products for defence and working with ISRO on one-of-a-kind components for Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan.

Birla Copper is setting up India's first e-waste recycling plant, extracting and recycling metals from discarded devices, the head of the conglomerate said.

Hindalco runs 52 plants across the world and employs 47,000 people, Birla said.

Skidattl has announced the commercial launch of its augmented reality engagement platform, which applies geospatial intelligence to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds for businesses seeking to connect more closely with their customers. 

This groundbreaking technology allows anyone to create enhanced real-world experiences for their customers and prospects by providing virtual information overlays in physical spaces. By revolutionizing how people interact with their surroundings, it transforms outdoor experiences, encourages real-world exploration, and connects businesses with their audiences in more meaningful ways.

In the golf space, Turtle Bay Golf Course in Kahuku, Hawaii, has conducted a pilot of Skidattl and has reported significant enhancements to the interactions it has had with golfers, in addition to the experiences that their customers have with their offerings. For example, golfers can look through their phone to see the direction and distance to any green, providing real-time caddy advice and course information – all done with beacons overlaid on the real-world setting.

“Skidattl brings a brand new innovative element to the game of golf,” said Travis Joerger, Director of Golf at Turtle Bay. “The way it augments the real-world experience of golfing with digital insights is game-changing.  We have been delighted to participate in the early development of Skidattl's golf features and look forward to deploying it on a daily basis.”  

Founded by serial entrepreneur Randy Marsden, known for numerous successful ventures including Swype, acquired by Microsoft, and Dryft, acquired by Apple, Skidattl represents a paradigm shift in geospatial technology applied to augmented reality applications. Also, unlike traditional AR experiences that require extensive programming knowledge to create and focus on gaming or fantastical elements, Skidattl lets anyone use AR as a practical tool to enrich real-world engagement. 

Marsden envisions a future where virtual information seamlessly integrates with the real world, and Skidattl's architecture transcends mobile phone access, offering brands an evergreen conduit for immersive engagement across interfaces including AR glasses and other wearables, heads-up displays and others that will emerge.

Key features of the Skidattl platform include:

“Skidattl isn't just another AR company; it's a paradigm shift in how we interact with the world around us using geospatial technology,” said Marsden. “We're creating a bridge between the virtual and physical realms, encouraging people to step away from their screens and engage with their surroundings in meaningful ways. 

“In the next few years, I envision Skidattl becoming as intuitive and ubiquitous as social media is today, but instead of isolating people, it will connect them more deeply with the physical world. This isn't about replacing reality with virtual elements; it's about enriching our real-world interactions through seamless, contextual information. Skidattl represents the next evolution in human-computer interaction, one that prioritizes our connection to the physical world while leveraging the power of digital information.”

The platform is now available for enterprise subscriptions, with plans starting at $5,000 per year.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been signed as a brand ambassador for Callaway Golf as he switches up his focus to bagging aces on the golf course rather than the tennis court. 

Vilamoura Golf reinforced its sustainability credentials when the Portuguese resort's four courses were each awarded two of the highest environmental, social and governance accolades in recognition of a dedication and commitment to biodiversity and strong environmental strategy.

Simon Grand, Course Manager at North Foreland Golf Club in Kent, has reported impressive results from using BASF's Attraxor, a plant growth regulator recommended and supplied by Agrovista Amenity.

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low

Slightly more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low.

U.S. jobless claims filings rose by 2,000 to 223,000 for the week ending March 15, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's just less than the 224,000 new applications analysts forecast.

Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.

The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, inched up by 750 to 227,000.

It's not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE,” will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though the Labor Department's February jobs report showed that the federal government shed 10,000 jobs. That's the most since June of 2022. 

Economists don't expect the federal workforce layoffs to have much of an impact until the March jobs report.

Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through DOGE, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.

Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion late last month via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired — though two federal judges last week issued orders requiring the rehiring of thousands of those workers.

Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.

The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs last month, and while the unemployment rate ticked up to a 4.1%, it remains a historically healthy figure.

Some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year, including Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 8 rose by 33,000 to 1.89 million.

Oops, something went wrong

Dan Ives is prone to using sports metaphors and quips like it's a “white-knuckle moment” for investors. It seems the Tesla (TSLA) uber-bull is having a white-knuckle moment of his own.

The Wedbush tech analyst said CEO Elon Musk needs to refocus on Tesla after a brutal three-month stretch for Tesla stock.

“Musk needs to change course here ... Tesla's future depends on it,” Ives said, adding that Tesla is going through a “crisis” and that Musk is the only one who can fix it.

Ives said two things need to happen — and soon — to stem the negative tide on Tesla and get the stock back on track. Shares are down nearly 50% since hitting a closing high of $462.28 in late December, though the stock is up in premarket trading on Thursday.

First, Musk must formally announce he is going to balance his role as leader of the White House Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force and CEO of Tesla. With the perception that he is spending “110% of his time with DOGE,” Musk needs to recommit his attention to the struggling automaker.

“Musk needs to make a statement and his actions speak louder than words. We would expect this to happen either before or during the 1Q earnings conference call in early May,” Ives wrote.

If Musk recommits himself to Tesla and balances his DOGE commitments, this will start to “take the heat off Musk” regarding DOGE, Ives said, and likely alleviate brand damage.

Second, and more important for Tesla's business, Musk must finally give a “roadmap” for the lower-priced EVs Tesla has been promising since last year and that are slated for production in 2025. Reports suggest these cheaper vehicles may be de-contented or stripped-down Model Y EVs that would first go on sale in China.

Ives also wants to hear more about the unsupervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) Robotaxi rollout coming to Austin, Texas, in June, as autonomous is a major factor in most analysts' bull cases for the stock. Yesterday, California regulators said Tesla has received an initial permit to begin ride-hail testing with Tesla employees in piloted cars, a first step on the road to eventual Robotaxi testing, though this news did not come from Tesla's official communications channels.

“With a Model Y refresh, inventory issues, and a host of demand issues with Musk brand damage a worry ... there is one person Tesla investors need to hear from ... Musk,” Ives said, maintaining his Outperform rating and $550 price target.

Hearing from Musk soon, most likely next month during Tesla's earnings call, can't come soon enough. The company is facing another crisis with the Cybertruck's recall of 46,000 of the EV pickups due to exterior panels flying off when driven.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street banks are starting to cut what could be thousands of workers as new economic uncertainties mount.

In recent weeks, Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Bank of America (BAC) all began workforce reductions that affect various parts of their operations.

The layoffs come at a time of the year when it is common for Wall Street to cull some underperformers and trim staff as part of annual reviews.

The cuts also come at a time when hopes for an IPO bonanza and dealmaking boom in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies.

Morgan Stanley is planning to cut around 2,000 workers by the end of the first quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The reductions will affect front-office and back-office employees across all units. They won't include Morgan Stanley's army of 15,000 financial advisers, but the layoffs will affect some people working for the advisers in support functions.

The person familiar with the moves said they are part of the bank's ongoing process to assess its resource needs based on its business priorities, location strategy and employee performance globally.

"It's really about operational efficiency," the person said, adding that "it doesn't relate to market conditions."

Goldman Sachs is planning cuts amounting to 3%-5% of its workforce. Its headcount at the end of 2024 was 46,500.

The reductions are part of its annual trimming of underperformers.

"Like other banks, this is part of our normal, annual talent management process," a Goldman spokeswoman told Yahoo Finance, declining to discuss specifics.

The Wall Street Journal reported the culling will focus on vice presidents and that CEO David Solomon has told senior executives that in recent years the bank hired too many vice presidents relative to overall hiring.

At Bank of America, the company cut 150 junior investment bankers, The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday.

The move comes weeks after a larger reduction as part of BofA's annual review process, first reported by Reuters.

That reduction amounted to cutting 1% of staff across Bank of America's global banking and markets divisions and included managing directors, directors, and vice presidents, according to a person familiar with the matter.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country's largest bank, hasn't disclosed outright reductions but has indicated it is backing off hiring after adding roughly 50,000 more workers over the last four years.

Barron's reported the bank laid off “fewer than 1,000 employees” in February with plans for more cuts in the coming months.

“We have grown a lot,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts in January. “You have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced.”

	(Reuters) - Reliance group-owned Jio Financial Services has reached a preliminary agreement with Germany's Allianz SE to form an insurance business in India, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.


	This comes after Allianz earlier this week agreed to sell its 26% stake in its non-life and life insurance joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv to the Bajaj Group for around 2.6 billion euros ($2.82 billion).


	Bloomberg said that billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio and Allianz were in the process of finalising the ownership structure.


	Allianz is aiming for a majority stake in the venture but is also open to securing governance rights with a path to taking control in the future, the report said.


	Allianz and Jio Financial did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments.


	The German insurer has said that India remains an important growth market and that it would explore new opportunities that strengthen its position in the country's insurance market.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump once again turned up the pressure on the Federal Reserve, saying Wednesday evening on social media that the central bank would "be much better off" lowering interest rates as tariffs go into effect.

The comments on Truth Social came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

The president has promised to unveil "reciprocal" tariffs on many countries on April 2, which he has taken to calling "liberation day."

"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," Trump said in his post on Truth Social. "Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!"

Powell did not shy away from the impact of Trump's tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.

The Fed chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much — and whether the price changes would be "transitory."

In just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now "I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed."

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

"We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation," Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially "transitory" — reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices "kind of the base case but we really can't know that" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

It was a term that many — especially Trump allies — criticized for years after it was used only to see rising prices last longer than expected.

Trump's team has begun to use similar language to say any price effects from tariffs will be temporary and that the economy is in a "transition."

"Tariffs are a one-time price adjustment," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in another recent example.

Trump's pointed comments on rates follow a period when Trump has softened his criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy decisions and even made it clear he doesn't intend to fire Powell, someone he criticized repeatedly during his first term.

Bessent and other Trump aides have repeatedly said that the president is not focused on the Fed and is instead trying to bring down 10-year Treasury yields.

"Notice that he has stopped calling for the Fed to cut rates," Bessent said during a speech earlier this month, referring to the president.

But it's clear the White House does want a closer relationship with the central bank — and other independent agencies — after issuing a new executive order last week that gives Trump's appointees more power over such agencies.

The new order makes clear that monetary policy — the direction of interest rates — will remain under the Fed's full control, but that the Fed's oversight of the country's biggest banks will now have a closer connection to the policies and priorities of the White House.

Powell was asked at his press conference Wednesday if Trump's recent firings of board members at the FTC, another independent agency, loomed as a threat to the Fed's independence as well.

“I did answer that question” he said, referring to comments made last November that any removal of Powell is “not permitted by law.”

“I have no desire to change that answer and have nothing new on that for you today.”

RTL's streaming subscribers in Germany, Hungary and France jumped 21 percent to 6.8 million last year, the company announced, with streaming revenue up 42 percent at $440 million.

Europe Bureau Chief


	European television giant RTL Group is closing in on profitability in its streaming division, with subscriber figures and online revenues surging last year and start-up costs falling. 


	In its year-end results, published Thursday, RTL said subscribers to its streaming services RTL+ in Germany and Hungary and the new M6+ platform in France jumped 21 percent to more than 6.8 million. Streaming revenues were up an impressive 42 percent at €403 million ($437 million), boosted by price hikes for the RTL+ service in Germany. RTL's German service accounts for the lion's share of the group's subscriber business, with some 6.06 million paying subscribers. Streaming start-up losses at the division were down some 22 percent to €137 million ($149 million)

	RTL CEO Thomas Rabe hailed the results as a “turning point” for the company's digital future. “Our streaming services continued to grow dynamically and significantly reduced their start-up losses in 2024. We are firmly on track to reach profitability by 2026,” Rabe said in a statement.

	RTL's aggressive push into streaming was further bolstered by a renewed partnership with Deutsche Telekom, extending RTL+ Premium's integration into Telekom's MagentaTV through 2030. The move is expected to drive further subscriber gains in Germany. Rabe also pointed to promising early results in France, where the company rebranded its streaming service M6+ (from 6play) and launched last May, noting monthly users on the new platform were up 30 percent and streaming hours increased by 35 percent compared to its predecessor. 


	Looking ahead, RTL projects 9 million streaming subscribers and €750 million ($816 million) in revenue by 2026. 


	RTL's free TV business, still the company's core, presented a less rosy picture. The combined audience share of RTL Deutschland's German networks in its key 14-59 demographic fell to 26.3 percent from 27.4 percent a year earlier. TV ad revenue was flat at €2.35 billion ($2.56 billion). Rabe put a positive spin on the figures by pointing to the worse-off competitor ProSiebenSat.1, noting that RTL Deutschland's audience share over ProSiebenSat.1's combined channel reach was 6.3 percentage points, the widest in more than 10 years. 


	Overall, group revenue at RTL was stable at €6.25 billion ($6.81 billion), with total group profit down slightly at €555 million ($604 million) compared to €598 million a year earlier. 

	











	Revenue at Fremantle, RTL's content production division, saw an 8 percent “organic” decline, which the group attributed to the 2023 U.S. actor and director strikes and by budget cuts from streaming services and advertising-financed broadcasters. The drop was particularly offset by Fremantle's acquisition of TV production groups Asacha Media and Beach House Pictures. Asacha, a private equity-backed group, owns several production outfits in France, Italy and the U.K., including Death in Paradise producers Red Planet Pictures; Italian scripted groups Picomedia (Beyond the Sea, La Storia) and Stand by Me (Diaries); and France's Srab Films (Saint Omer, Happening) and Mintee Studios (Cimetiere Indien). Singapore-based Beach House has a non-scripted focus and produces shows including Netflix's Mind Your Manners and Mr. Midnight as well as local versions of global franchises such as Masterchef Singapore.


	On the creative side, Fremantle enjoyed a banner 2024, with Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things, produced by Fremantle-owned Element Pictures, picking up four Oscars.


	But with revenues of €2.25 billion ($2.45 billion), Fremantle is still a long way off its stated target of €3 billion ($3.26 billion) in annual revenues. RTL on Thursday casually moved the goalposts for that target, saying it hopes to hit the €3 billion mark “mid-term,” not by 2026, as originally forecast.

London has edged closer to becoming the world's top financial centre, fresh research shows, but concerns have been raised over the City's future competitiveness.

The 37th edition of Z/Yen Group's Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 37) showed London maintained its second-place ranking amongst the world's top financial centres, whilst climbing 12 points from its last rating in September.

New York topped the table yet again, but its lead over London has narrowed.

London dominates the European rankings, with a 19 point lead over Frankfurt which missed out on a spot in the top ten, ranking eleventh globally.

The capital was in the top three centres for all eight major industries and scored first for banking.

Elsewhere, in fintech London was chomping at the heels of the Big Apple, reducing the gap between first and second place to a singular point.

The survey also questioned respondents on their home centre prospects, with London ranking as one of the top centres anticipated to become more competitive.

However, concerns exist over risks to London's future status, given that business confidence has taken a hit since the Chancellor's Autumn Budget.

The latest release from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy shrunk 0.1 per cent in January, in another blow to growth prospects.

Reeves had pledged to unlock growth across the country, which has included the launch of a National Wealth Fund and slashing regulation.

London market's woes have continued into 2025, after 2024 saw the largest outflow of listed companies since the global financial crisis, according to data from auditing giant EY. In total, 88 companies moved out of the market last year, compared to just 18 new listings.

London ranked 12th on a sub survey focusing on future prospects, with only 17 respondents mentioning the City as a centre they consider likely to grow in significance over the next two to three years.

The Middle East and Asia dominated the top 15, with seven of the centres in the Asia/Pacific region and six in the Middle East and Africa.

Dubai scored first with 63 mentions and Seoul second at 48. 

Professor Michael Mainelli, chairman of Z/Yen and former Lord Mayor of London, said: “Confidence in leading international financial centres remains strong, with a high degree of stability in rankings.

However, Mainelli noted the index period of the report falls outside of the new US administration, which has triggered a period of economic uncertainty.

“A slowdown in US centres may indicate some projected decoupling from global markets,” Mainelli added.

The GFCI generates ratings through a combination of survey respondents and a statistical model.

GFCI 37 used 140 instrumental factors combined with 31,314 survey assessments of financial centres and 4,946 respondents to an online questionnaire for the research.

In a win for the oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer,  a nine-person North Dakota jury found the environmental group Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages and defamation for the 2016 to 2017 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In their lawsuit, Dallas-based Energy Transfer claimed Greenpeace was responsible for defamation, disruption and property damage for the protests that captured national attention in 2016. Greenpeace claimed the lawsuit threatened its freedom of speech. 

In a statement, Energy Transfer said, "This win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace. It is also a win for all law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law."

Greenpeace plans to appeal the verdict. "This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don't have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money." Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace Inc., told CBS News.

Greenpeace accused Energy Transfer of filing a "SLAPP" lawsuit, short for strategic lawsuits against public participation. SLAPP lawsuits have been criticized as being a method of curtailing free speech and assembly by individuals, organizations or press by threatening lengthy and expensive legal proceedings in court. 35 states have anti-SLAPP laws aimed at preventing these types of lawsuits. North Dakota is not among them. 

Energy Transfer previously filed a federal RICO lawsuit against Greenpeace seeking $300 million in damages in 2017, but that case was dismissed by a federal judge. Energy Transfer then filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace in North Dakota state court shortly after.

"The verdict against Greenpeace not only represents an assault on free speech and protest rights," said Rebecca Brown, president and CEO of the Center for International and Environmental Law, in a statement. "This case is a textbook example of corporate weaponization of the legal system to silence protest and intimidate communities. This misuse of the legal system stifles legitimate dissent and must be seen as a direct threat to environmental justice and democratic freedoms."

In the weeks and months preceding the trial, Greenpeace raised the alarm that the damages sought by Energy Transfer, thought at the time to be in the $300 million range, would be catastrophic to the group, claiming that would amount to 10 times the group's annual U.S. operating budget. Energy Transfer reported over $82 billion in revenue in 2024.

The damages ultimately awarded total roughly $667 million and will be split up among several arms of Greenpeace. Greenpeace USA is on the hook for about $404 million, while Greenpeace Fund Inc. and Greenpeace International must each pay some $131 million, according to The Associated Press.  

The 1,172-mile pipeline crosses four states and has been operating since late 2017 despite the controversy and the protest, which stemmed from a pipeline crossing under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe called the pipeline a violation of its treaty rights and claimed the pipeline route risked polluting the tribe's primary water source and would damage sacred sites. 

The protests at Standing Rock drew thousands of people from around the country who camped outside the pipeline's construction site. Celebrities and prominent figures including now-Trump cabinet members Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also visited the camp. 

But violence erupted between police, security guards and protestors several times, culminating in tear gas and water cannons being used against protestors. The camps were cleared in February of 2017. More than 140 people were arrested at the Standing Rock protests.  

One of the organizers of the protests was Chase Iron Eyes, an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, who was arrested during the demonstrations and charged with felony inciting a riot. Iron Eyes questioned Greenpeace's liability for the protests.

"I never met a single Greenpeace person, a representative, or ever went to a training or anything like that," Iron Eyes told CBS News. 

Instead, Iron Eyes found the ruling to delegitimize the concerns and agency of Native Americans who chose to protest at Standing Rock. "To hold them solely responsible for our fight, this is a tribal nation fight," he said. "I think it's disrespectful to tribal nations, to the Sioux Nation in particular, it was our nation, and our people who stood up."

FARGO, N.D. – Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner says he's seen an increase of cryptocurrency scams.

Jahner has seen schemes where people are convinced to put up to $15,000 of their money into the kiosk to get the digital currency so others won't have access to it. The money then goes into the suspect's virtual wallet and they send it to multiple locations to stay ahead of law enforcement.

Financial institutions have 10 days to comply with a search warrant to provide records, but Jahner says the money is often spent by fraudsters by then.

“Our best option is to be able to prevent this activity rather than investigate it and be reactive. Typically probably less than one percent that we're able to solve these crimes and get the money back to victims,” Jahner said.

A bill in the North Dakota legislature would prevent people from depositing more than $2,000 into a kiosk per day to get cryptocurrency. Warnings would be put on the machines saying “Consumer fraud often starts with contact from a stranger who is initiating a dishonest scheme. Kiosk operators would also have to have a compliance officer and have blockchain analytics software to detect and prevent suspicious activity.”

The measure was passed by the House and Senate. Since the Senate added amendments, the bill has gone back to the House.

 Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, said that forfeited crypto “should work for the benefit of the government.” 

Amid the growing adoption of cryptocurrency reserves in countries like the United States, legal activists in Russia are pushing to create a potential crypto fund.

Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, has proposed creating a government cryptocurrency fund that would include assets confiscated from criminal proceedings.

The projected cryptocurrency fund would aim for revenues for the government, targeting social projects, Masharov said, according to a March 20 report by the local news agency TASS.

“The proceeds from the cryptocurrency fund can then be used for social, environmental and educational projects,” he reportedly stated.

Masharov's proposal came amid Russian officials progressing with new legislation on recognizing cryptocurrencies as property for the purposes of criminal procedure legislation.

Alexander Bastrykin, Chairman of Russia's Investigative Committee, said that a related draft bill was sent to the government for consideration, the local news agency RBC reported on March 19.

“Cryptocurrencies confiscated as part of criminal proceedings must work for the benefit of the state,” Masharov said while commenting on the proposed legislation.

“For these purposes, a special fund can be created, putting cryptocurrencies on its balance,” Masharov said, expressing confidence that many of the seized crypto assets could see their market capitalization “rising significantly over time.”

Masharov's proposal to turn confiscated crypto assets for the benefit of the state follows years of the development of related legislation in Russia.

Russian prosecutors have been pushing legal initiatives to allow the government to seize crypto obtained from criminal activity since at least 2021, but there has not been a clear framework set in place.

In the meantime, the Russian government has not missed the opportunity to confiscate millions in cryptocurrency from illegal cases, sometimes involving law enforcement officials. Apparently, Russia's current laws do not provide standards on where and how such funds should be distributed.

The idea of a potential social crypto fund in Russia may sound similar to initiatives like a Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve, which currently targets holding confiscated BTC exclusively.

In the meantime, Russia's central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has previously strongly opposed the idea of potential investments in crypto by the Bank of Russia.

“Cryptocurrency investment doesn't make any sense for the Central Bank in terms of preserving value since it's a very volatile asset,” Nabiullina reportedly said in December 2024.

Global cryptocurrency exchange spot volumes fell sharply in February 2025, dropping 23% month-over-month (Mom) to $1.3 trillion as Bitcoin prices retreated from recent highs. Despite the monthly decline, year-over-year (YoY) comparisons show robust 45% growth across major trading platforms.

Crypto Exchange Volumes Plunge as Bitcoin Slump Drives Four-Month Low

The February cooldown marks the second consecutive month of declining volumes, bringing trading activity to its lowest level since October 2024. The downturn comes amid broader market consolidation following Bitcoin's volatile price action in early 2025.

In January, Bitcoin tested historical highs above $108,000. Since then, a sharper correction began, briefly pushing the price below $80,000—a nearly 30% drop. While bear markets also drive trading activity, historically, the highest volumes are seen during bullish surges. 

The result? A significant month-over-month decline in trading volumes.

Exchange Performance Shows Widespread Declines

Nine of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges reported volume decreases in February, with South Korea's Upbit experiencing the steepest drop at 46% MoM. The platform's trading activity fell from $187.87 billion in January to $101.51 billion in February, though it maintained its 8% market share.

Binance retained its commanding market position with 49% share despite seeing volumes fall 19% to $651.48 billion. ByBit and Coinbase rounded out the top three, commanding 13% and 9% market share, respectively.

Bitfinex emerged as the only exchange to buck the downward trend, posting a 16% increase in trading volume. However, its overall market impact remains limited with just 1% market share.

Crypto Trading Activity Shows 45% Annual Growth

The YoY data paints a more optimistic picture of the cryptocurrency trading landscape. Total volume across major exchanges grew 45% compared to February 2024, with ByBit leading the annual growth charts with a remarkable 116% increase.

Coinbase showed particularly strong annual performance with a 66% volume increase compared to February 2024, while Binance grew 46% year-over-year. Even smaller exchanges like Bitstamp demonstrated robust annual growth at 44%, despite its modest market share.

The contrasting monthly and annual trends suggest the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a temporary pullback rather than a fundamental shift in trading patterns. The top three exchanges maintained their collective dominance with approximately 71% market share, virtually unchanged from January.

BANGKOK (AP) — The price of XRP jumped more than 8% Thursday after the CEO of cryptocurrency company Ripple said U.S. regulators have dropped its four-year-old case against the company. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple and two of its executives in late 2020 after they raised $1.4 billion by selling XRP crypto coins. 

The SEC under the Biden administration held that digital assets like cryptocurrences should be regulated like securities, such as stocks, and should be considered commodities like gold or oil. Securities generally face stricter regulations. 

The Trump administration is easing those rules. 

CEO Brad Garlinghouse that the SEC overstepped its authority in alleging that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP without a securities registration. 

“I'm finally able to announce that this case has ended,” Garlinghouse said in a video posted on X. “It's over.”

The SEC has not confirmed its decision to withdraw the case against Ripple, yet other crypto companies have already announced that the SEC under the Trump administration has dropped cases against them. Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to ease restrictions in the cryptocurrency market, a significant change compared with the last several years under Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC in the Biden administration. 

In February, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said the SEC had dropped its case against it after it was targeted in a lawsuit alleging it was operating as an unregistered securities platform and brokerage service. Ditto for the cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.




The SEC also recently asked a federal court to pause ongoing litigation against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, because leadership was rethinking previous enforcement actions. 

Trump has pledged to make the U.S. a world leader in cryptocurrencies and the industry scored some early wins after his return to the White House. That includes the repeal of an SEC accounting rule and an executive order by the president directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations. 

Trump signed an executive order two weeks ago establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency's journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

The crypto industry spent heavily to help elect Trump and other crypto-friendly lawmakers and is eager to cement its influence in politics and mainstream financial systems.

Garlinghouse, a Trump supporter, caused waves when he said he'd like to see a U.S. government crypto reserve include various digital assets rather than just bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency. That idea is a nonstarter for many bitcoin diehards.

The SEC was due to hold a series of roundtables on regulation of crypto assets, beginning with one on Saturday at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 

Early Thursday, the value of Ripple rose to more than $2.50.

Bitcoin has climbed after the Federal Reserve met expectations by leaving interest rates on hold and confirmed a major flip—though traders are now being warned of a major new threat.

The bitcoin price soared toward $88,000 per bitcoin, adding almost $10,000 from the low it fell to last week, helped by a huge bitcoin price prediction hitting its first milestone.

Now, as Russia is revealed to be gearing up for a crypto showdown with the U.S., a leak that primed the bitcoin price for a “big” crypto update from president Donald Trump has been confirmed.

“I'm told a big announcement regarding Donald Trump's plans for next steps in crypto policy is coming imminently out of the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit,” 
 Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter who's now hosting a crypto podcast, posted to X.

Blockworks, a crypto media company, later confirmed the leak, touting a pre-recorded speech by Trump that's due to be broadcast to attendees on Thursday morning as “the first time a sitting president has ever addressed a crypto industry conference."

The details of Trump's speech are not yet known, however, Trump's executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets Bo Hines earlier told the conference the U.S. wants "as much [bitcoin] as we can get.”

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what president Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines said, referring to Trump's executive order that prevents the sale of bitcoin and crypto that U.S. has seized.

Last week, Hines told attendees of a closed-door round table hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute that the White House plans to buy as much bitcoin as it can.

Earlier this month, after Trump's surprise announcement that Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies.

Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin during the much-hyped White House crypto summit, placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve.

Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile.

"The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge
 fund manager so he's going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and
 we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said, speaking on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the White House job.

    Kraken, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said on Thursday it would buy retail futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, in a deal that would allow it to expand into multiple asset classes and grow its user base.

The acquisition comes at a time the crypto industry is optimistic about more relaxed regulation under U.S. President Donald Trump, who courted crypto donors during the election and promised to support the sector.

Industry leaders hope for policy shifts that roll back enforcement actions, encourage institutional adoption and create clearer rules for digital asset trading.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed a civil lawsuit accusing Kraken of operating illegally as an unregistered securities exchange.

Kraken is the world's tenth-ranked cryptocurrency spot exchange based on traffic, liquidity, trading volumes and confidence in the legitimacy of reported trading volumes, according to trading data website CoinMarketCap.

The deal also highlights the deepening ties between crypto companies and traditional financial firms as digital assets gain wider acceptance.

Growing demand from retail traders to access a wide range of assets — from stocks and bonds to crypto and derivatives — has pushed companies to expand beyond their roots and integrate more deeply into their customers' financial habits.

"It is an important deal for the industry because it is a deal that a crypto native acquiring a traditional finance and it is a large, billion-dollar-plus deal," said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.

Lau expects "more deals to come under the most pro-crypto president, Congress and regulators", and said "there will be continuous crypto-traditional finance convergence".

Long Ridge Equity Partners-backed NinjaTrader will continue to operate as a standalone platform under Kraken.

Founded in 2003, NinjaTrader provides affordable retail future trading platform to nearly 2 million traders.

   The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.

Bitcoin traders seemed to take the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision well—too well, to hear deVere Group CEO Nigel Green tell it.

Although the Federal Reserve did not lower rates, as crypto traders might have hoped, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks provided some hope to markets that there would be two rate cuts later in the year.

But Green insists that President Donald Trump's tariffs—taxes on imported goods—will have long-lasting effects that should scuttle the Fed's optimistic projections.

Protectionist trade policies may encourage companies to manufacture their products in the U.S., he wrote. But however good "American made" sounds politically, it will be coupled with higher labor costs and fuel wage growth.

"The notion that inflationary pressures will quickly subside under these conditions is wishful thinking at best," he wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. "Markets, it would appear, have bought into Powell's messaging. Stocks surged as he reassured investors that the inflationary effect of tariffs would be short-lived."

For now, investors seem happy with Powell's hopeful outlook.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin's price is up 1.8% compared to this time yesterday, trading at $85,208. Earlier in the day, it climbed above $86,000, according to CoinGecko data. But Bitcoin is still trading 11% lower than it was a month ago.

Users of on-chain prediction market MYRIAD, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, remain bullish on Bitcoin, with over 74% expecting it to hold above $83,000 by the end of the week.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows have slowed to a crawl, but that's not necessarily bad news, wrote BRN analyst Valentin Fournier in a trading note Thursday. He said overall trading activity remains elevated.

"Bitcoin ETFs saw $11.8 million in inflows, while Ethereum ETFs experienced $11.7 million in outflows, extending the trend of diverging netflows between the two assets," he said. "While inflows have momentarily decreased, sustained high trading volumes indicate ongoing market engagement rather than weakening interest."

Fournier said the firm remains neutral on Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that BTC is doing well just to maintain its price position and ETH is still recovering its momentum.

But he rated Solana as "overweight" a day after the altcoin saw some big ETF news.

Later today, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF, which will track Solana futures contracts, will begin trading under the SOLZ ticker. And the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF, which will trade under the SOLT ticker, is a leveraged fund that will grant investors access to amplified returns—or losses. They'll both trade on the Nasdaq.

At the time of writing, Solana has retreated slightly from the $136.09 high it set in the past day. But it's still trading 2.5% above yesterday's price, according to CoinGecko data.

It was not long ago that XRP made its way onto the list of assets eligible for use as collateral in perpetual futures trading on Coinbase International Exchange. Now, Cardano ADAUSD and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) have joined the lineup, marking yet another step in Coinbase's ongoing expansion of supported cryptocurrencies within its derivatives trading ecosystem.

For ADA, this development is particularly noteworthy. It is not just another cryptocurrency added to the mix; it is a token that, like XRP, has been at the center of regulatory scrutiny in the past. The SEC had taken issue with both, alleging them to be unregistered securities. But times change, and so does the regulatory landscape. 

With the departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC and a shift in how the commission approaches cryptocurrency enforcement, cases against digital assets have been seeing a different fate. What was once an uphill battle for ADA and XRP now appears to be turning into an opportunity for broader market adoption.

Beyond just futures trading, Coinbase is also making moves toward bringing more assets on-chain, aligning with the broader industry trend of tokenization and blockchain integration into financial services. 

Coinbase goes on-chain

This push is not just about increasing trading options - it is also about compliance and accessibility. Some assets may only be available to accredited investors or require verification under U.S. law, and Coinbase is working on ways to navigate these barriers within the decentralized ecosystem.

With ADA's inclusion, the exchange is making it clear that blockchain networks with strong technological foundations are seen as valuable components of the evolving financial infrastructure. Whether this signals further institutional interest or simply a logical extension of market trends, it is evident that ADA's role in crypto trading is being reinforced. 

As Coinbase continues to expand its reach, the question is not just which assets will be added next but how this growing integration will shape the future of digital asset trading as a whole.

U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday, days after White House signaled interest in stockpiling Bitcoin.

President Donald Trump is set to address the Digital Asset Summit in New York City on Thursday, March 20, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president has spoken at a cryptocurrency industry conference. According to a press release, Trump's speech is scheduled for 10:40 a.m. ET at North Javits and comes amid growing discussion about the U.S. government's potential involvement in Bitcoin (BTC).

“It's high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away. I've been asked all the time, it's like how much do you want, right? I mean, as much as we can get.”

Bo Hines, executive director of the White House's presidents council of advisers on digital assets

The administration's stance on Bitcoin appears to be evolving, though details remain unclear. A few weeks ago, Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich, have since introduced proposals for the U.S. to acquire up to 1 million BTC over the next five years.

Trump has already signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. As crypto.news reported earlier, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers won't bear any cost.

White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks noted that the U.S. government already holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve, likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.”

Alongside Trump, other key speakers at DAS include Strategy's Michael Saylor and Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who will discuss spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and institutional adoption.

 The Fed's quantitative tightening is “basically over,” which has crypto analysts feeling slightly more bullish about its implications for the crypto market. 

Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $77,000 price level anytime soon after the Fed signaled a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.

On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped near the $77,000 level for the first time since November, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob,” Hayes said in a March 20 X post after declaring that QT is “basically over” following the Fed's March 19 announcement that starting in April, it will slow its securities sell-off by reducing the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion.

This could ease liquidity pressures and support risk assets like Bitcoin, as QT involves central banks selling assets to reduce the money supply and possibly raise interest rates. 

“The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE,” Hayes added.

The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption was a temporary rule during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from their SLR calculations. Meanwhile, quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy and encourage more spending.

Echoing a similar sentiment to Hayes, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said in a March 19 X post that “QT is effectively dead.” Coutts explained that “treasury volatility” has calmed down following the US dollar's drop earlier this month, a positive signal for boosting liquidity.

Other optimists included Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin, who said the Fed slowdown is “great for both crypto and equity markets.”

“The Fed has significant leeway to loosen up, providing more support for businesses + markets,” Zirlin said, while Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss said that with QT ending, “the dam is going to break.”

Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment has spiked following the Fed's comments. 

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, has moved into “Neutral” territory at 49 after lingering in the “Fear” area since Feb. 26.

Despite Bitcoin being down nearly 22% from its January $109,000 all-time highs, Infinex founder Kain Warwick told Cointelegraph that it is a “normal mid-bull correction.”

“I would need to see a much larger breakdown to flip bearish,” Warwick said. “My baseline thesis is the four-year cycle holds once again, which means we keep grinding up through the rest of the year.”

PROVIDENCE – Timmons Roberts' letter to state lawmakers began with this painful admission: "On April 16th, 2024, I was scammed. Pretty badly."

"I'm here telling you about it because I wish someone had [warned] me," said Roberts, 64, a professor of environmental studies at Brown University. "The CoinStar machines in supermarkets made it possible."

The worst part, Robbins wrote, wasn't the $2,200 he lost – "that can be lived with" – but rather the three things he hasn't been able to let go of since.

He can't get the man, who was on the phone doing a "brilliant" imitation of a federal marshal, out of his head, Roberts said. His trust in humanity is badly shaken. And the fact that he fell for the scam is "humiliating."

"Everyone thinks they are smart enough to not let this happen to them, that it's only 'old clueless women' or something who get scammed," Roberts wrote. "Talking to the FBI was helpful in convincing me otherwise, and apparently there's some research on the fact that highly educated people with good jobs are just as likely to fall victim as anyone," but they are just too ashamed to admit it.

Roberts shared his story of how he, a professor at an Ivy League university, was sucked into this scam during the first of two State House hearings on a bill to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, which AARP Rhode Island has described as a top priority this year.

Westerly Police Chief Paul Gingerella told lawmakers that in Westerly alone, many residents have lost significant sums of money, even their entire life savings, because of cryptocurrency scams and cryptocurrency ATMs.

"We have investigated cases where individuals deposited and lost $40,000 in just two days and multiple instances of $15,000 or more losses in a single day," Gingerella said. "When we attempt to work with these machine owners to recover these funds, we are met with indifference and little to no cooperation."

Looking beyond Westerly, AARP Associate State Director Matthew Netto told the House Committee on House Innovation, Internet, & Technology that in 2023, the FBI found that Americans reported losing more than $5.6 billion to cryptocurrency fraud, and $2 million of those losses were from Rhode Islanders.

The scams, Netto said, involve making payments using cryptocurrency ATMs, or "crypto kiosks" and "virtual currency kiosks" that can be found in supermarkets, shopping malls, gas stations and convenience stores.

He estimated there are at least 120 in operation in Rhode Island today.

The legislation, as originally proposed in the House by Rep. Julie Casimiro and in the Senate by Sen. Victoria Gu, would have required:

It also would have required cryptocurrency operators to refund transactions and ATM fees for fraudulent transactions.

Two of the larger players in the crypto-kiosk industry, CoinFlip and Bitcoin Depot pushed back, resulting in a compromise announced just ahead of Tuesday's Senate hearing on the bill.

"CoinFlip would support a 'reasonable transaction limit' for new users who may not be familiar withthe kiosks," and limit equal to the federal gift card limit of $10,000 for seasoned users, the company's general counsel, Larry Lipka, had suggested at an earlier hearing.

At that time, he called the proposed fee caps a "de-facto ban on the industry," because it would not allow the full recovery of operational costs. And he likened the required refund of "scam victims" authorized transactions to requiring Target to refund the purchase of a gift card if the customer later gave their gift card to a bad actor."

On Tuesday, AARP Rhode Island – and an industry lobbyist – announced the proposed compromise that Casimiro, the House sponsor, negotiated with industry representatives. Key features:

Roberts said he received a call while driving on the Mass Pike from a Washington, D.C., number. The basic premise was that he had failed to appear for federal jury duty in Providence and was in contempt of court.

Roberts said he never got a summons, and the caller, posing as a lieutenant, said he checked and it looked like the signature on the paperwork was forged. He gave Roberts a callback number and the answering machine said it was the federal court in Providence and sounded "completely legit."

The scammer picked up the extension, told Roberts he was in contempt of court and he could either appear at the federal courthouse and possibly be detained for eight to 10 hours, or he could pay a fee at a CoinStar machine in a "Federal Payment Kiosk" that, the scammer said, the government had been using since COVID.

The scammer told Roberts to put the cash in the machine and transfer the payment. Once the forgery was cleared, Roberts would be refunded the money.

"Looking back, of course this seems absurd," Roberts wrote.

Roberts took out a first round of cash and deposited it into a CoinStar machine at a Stop & Shop. He didn't realize it was a scam until he had to get more cash and the teller told him it was a fraud, hung up Roberts' phone and told him not to answer it.

When Roberts called the real court number listed on Google, the woman in the jury duty division told him several people had been scammed that week.

Bakkt Holdings is blowing it all up and starting fresh.

The digital asset and payments platform on Monday (March 17) suffered a major blow when Bank of America and Webull announced they would not be renewing their commercial agreements with the company. 

On Wednesday (March 19), after delaying twice, the digital asset and payments platform held its earnings call sharing the financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.

The big news? Bakkt signed a definitive agreement to get rid of its Trust custody business entirely, named a new co-CEO, and announced a pivot to “become a pure play crypto infrastructure company.”

Webull, per a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), represented nearly three quarters (74%) of Bakkt's crypto services revenue.

“As we move forward to a pure play crypto ecosystem player, [the divesture] enables us to double down on our core offerings — providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity, and subject to applicable regulatory approvals, payment solutions,” said Andy Main, CEO of Bakkt.

Main also announced the appointment of Akshay Naheta as co-CEO. 

“As we enter 2025, Bakkt is sharpening its focus on the future of crypto, leveraging our technology, market expertise and strategic partnerships to be in a position to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Our partnership with DTR [Distributed Technologies Research, founded by Naheta], combined with Akshay Naheta agreeing to joining as co-CEO, marks a pivotal moment by expanding our capabilities, and we believe will position us to be able to capture market share in the global stablecoin payments network,” he told investors on Wednesday's call. 

The company's stock remained relatively flat, hovering around $9, after dropping by 30% to start the week. There was no Q&A session following Wednesday's earnings call.

Few companies have undergone as radical a transformation as Bakkt, which once sought to bridge traditional finance and digital assets through loyalty rewards and consumer-friendly crypto solutions, and is now pivoting to a focused strategy: becoming a full-fledged crypto infrastructure company.

Bakkt has entered into a strategic partnership with DTR, a stablecoin payments platform. This collaboration aims to enhance Bakkt's capabilities in the global stablecoin payments network.

To concentrate on its core offerings, Bakkt has signed a definitive agreement to divest its Trust custody business to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). This divestiture allows Bakkt to focus on providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity and, subject to regulatory approvals, payment solutions.

Simultaneously, Bakkt is evaluating alternatives for its Loyalty business, a segment that once seemed integral. Whether through a sale or a full wind-down, the company is signaling to investors that its future is not in travel miles or gift card conversions but in digital asset markets, trading infrastructure and institutional-grade solutions.

Bakkt's Q4 2024 earnings report, including leadership changes and divestitures, tells a story of aggressive restructuring, divestitures, and a shift toward high-volume crypto trading.

Bakkt reported total revenues of $1.797 billion for the quarter, an increase of 737.9% year over year. This surge is attributed to heightened crypto market activity and increased asset prices.​

Despite the revenue growth, Bakkt reported a net loss of $40.4 million for the quarter, an improvement of 48.7% year over year. The adjusted EBITDA loss also decreased by 66.3% to $6.4 million, reflecting the company's efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs.

Bakkt faces substantial headwinds. The nonrenewal of its Webull commercial contract, a key revenue stream, raises questions about its ability to maintain retail partnerships while shifting toward institutional business. 

Moreover, the company's dependence on volatile crypto markets means that external shocks — regulatory crackdowns, liquidity crunches or security breaches — could impact performance.

With revenue projections between $1.03 billion and $1.28 billion for Q1 2025, the company is betting on sustained crypto adoption and a deeper integration into the institutional space. Whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Bakkt is no longer a consumer-facing crypto startup, it's aiming to become instead a serious player in the infrastructure that powers digital asset markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) punters are looking at topside options bets in a bullish shift in price expectations after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) meeting, but ether (ETH) continues to lag sentiment. 

As of writing, BTC's short-term and long-term risk reversals, which show the implied volatility premium (demand) for bullish bets or calls versus puts, were positive, implying investor interest in chasing price gains in the leading cryptocurrency, per data source Amberdata.

It marks a shift from the bearish sentiment that prevailed weeks before the Fed meeting when short and near-dated puts were pricier than calls, reflecting downside fears.

"Frontend skew flipped calls. Flows featured 21 Mar outright calls and calendars bought, while 28 Mar puts were sold," institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm noted in the Telegram chat. Institutions and large traders execute block trades via OTC platforms like Paradigm, which are then listed on Deribit.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.

The bullish shift in the short and near-dated options happened as the Federal Reserve (Fed) retained the forecast for two rate cuts this year despite making the expected stagflationary adjustment in economic forecasts. The bank said it will slow the pace of balance sheet run off from April. 

More importantly, Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed fears about the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, calling it transitory.

Additionally, the end of the prolonged legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple, which uses XRP for cross border transactions, likely aided the sentiment. XRP, with the market cap of $142.21 billion, is the world's fourth largest cryptocurrency. 

These positive developments, however, are yet to translate into a positive flip in the short and near-dated ether options. 

At press time, ether risk reversals showed a bias for puts out to the May expiry, retaining the pre-Fed cautious sentiment despite the looming Ethereum Pectra upgrade.

The technological update will introduce smart accounts to ethereum, blob scaling and validator UX enhancements and seen as a game changer by many. Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, this week to carry out the impending upgrade, expected to take effect on March 26.

Note that the persistent bias for ether puts could be partly driven by traders looking to hedge downside risks in other altcoins. Ether is widely seen as the altcoin leader.

In 2009, Bitcoin launched as the first cryptocurrency. Just under two decades, President Trump has signed an executive order to create the "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile." On today's show, we look at what the U.S. government plans for this new strategy, plus who benefits from a crypto reserve.

Crypto update: The price of Bitcoin neared the $86,000 level on March 20 after United States Federal Reserve's rate decision sent markets soaring.

The rise was supported by the US Fed decision and news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) had officially dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.

During the early hours today, on March 20, Bitcoin briefly touched the $87,299 level at 5.50 am, but soon settled close below $86,000.

At 10.10 am, the world's biggest cryptocurrency was at $85,596.80 — up 3.18 per cent from the previous day, according to data on Coinmarketcap. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin was at $1.69 trillion, with trading volume recorded was at $35.82 billion over the past 24 hours.

The second biggest cryptocurrency, Ether also saw a rise, trading at $2,020.95 — up 4.51 per cent, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token's market cap is at $243.78 billion, with trading volume of $20.26 billion.

Stablecoin Tether, linked to the US Dollar, remained steady on March 20, at $1 with market cap of $143.66 billion and trading volume of $78.91 billion, CoinMarketCap showed.

Further, Solana token, which will see two linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) jumped 5.69 per cent to $133.09, with market cap of $67.9 billion and trade volume of $3.64 billion, as per CoinMarketCap data.

Florida-based Volatility Shares LLC, is debuting the first ever Solana-linked ETFs on March 20, Bloomberg reported.

The ETFs are — Volatility Shares Solana ETF (ticker SOLZ) which will track Solana futures; and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT) which will offer twice the leveraged exposure. SOLZ and SOLT will carry expense ratios of 0.95% and 1.85 per cent, respectively, the report added.

Meanwhile, Ripple Labs on March 19 said that the US SEC had dropped its appeal against the company, Reuters reported. The watchdog was appealing a July 2023 decision by Manhattan District Judge the XRP token sold by Ripple on public exchanges did not meet the legal definition of a security. In a post on X, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the end of the SEC appeal a “resounding victory” and “long overdue surrender”.

Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42 noted that Bitcoin and the overall crypto space continue their rebound after the Fed maintained interest rates unchanged.

“Investors expect an all-time high in Q2, driven by dovish cues from Jerome Powell and increased institutional demand. Bitcoin Whale accumulation rose by a whopping $13 billion over the course of three days, demonstrating robust investor sentiment,” Shekhar noted.

He added that net inflows went into positive territory, accounting for a change in sentiment as Ethereum and Dogecoin also recovered. “As liquidity rises and macroeconomic fundamentals are in sympathy, the universe of crypto is set for further upside. The coming two months can be decisive in shaping the path of Bitcoin as it deals with bettering fundamentals and increasing investor appetite.” Shekhar felt.

According to the CoinSwitch Markets Desk, “Bitcoin experienced a modest increase of nearly 4 per cent, trading at approximately $86,000. Ethereum also saw gains, rising 5 per cent to around $2,031.”

It noted the following developments that had an impact on crypto prices:

The cryptocurrency market saw significant gains today, with Bitcoin approaching $86,000 and Ethereum reclaiming the $2,000 level. This rally comes as the SEC dropped its multi-year enforcement action against Ripple, signaling a potential shift in regulatory stance, while the Federal Reserve maintained its target range for interest rates and projected two cuts in 2025.

Latest crypto market news



Positive legislative news along with consistent Federal Reserve monetary policy caused prices of cryptocurrencies to skyrocket everywhere. For the sector, the SEC's choice to abandon its lawsuit against Ripple following four years of litigation constitutes a major triumph. Underlining a possible “new chapter” for cryptocurrency control under the Trump administration, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said this event “a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it.”

Institutional interest is rising meantime as Minnesota state Senator Jeremy Miller presents the Minnesota Bitcoin Act, allowing the state to make investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is in line with laws in 22 other American states, where 39 separate proposals pertaining to state Bitcoin investments are under introduction all around.

 

After the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates at their present level between 4.25% and 4.5%, Bitcoin BTC/USD started to slow down its surge toward $86,000 Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated plans to lower the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion to $5 billion and maintained the potential of two rate cuts in 2025, hence the bitcoin peaked at $85,950 in intraday.

On-chain data points reveal a distinct market dynamic emerging. Despite recent corrections to a four-month low of $76,600 on March 11, long-term holders—those who have held Bitcoin for at least 155 days—have exhibited a declining selling pressure. Glassnode data indicates that these investors still retain a significant share of their gains, implying strong belief on the long-term direction of Bitcoin.

New Bitcoin whales—addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC with an average acquisition age of less than six months—have also aggressively collected over 1 million BTC since November 2024, so establishing themselves as significant market participants.

 

Rising almost 8% over the past 24 hours, Ethereum ETH/USD broke above $2,000 to peak at $2,064. After producing higher lows and hitting resistance at $1,950 many times, the altcoin showed a successful breakout from an ascending triangle pattern.

On March 12, ETH moves into accumulation addresses and records a one-day total of 345,210 ETH, suggesting notable long-term holding behavior. Suggesting significant holders are using ETH's current pricing, which remains 58.4% below its all-time high, these accumulation addresses have gathered over 5.8 million ETH during a 12-month period in 2024 and already purchased 4.73 million ETH in under three months in 2025.

 

Following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's declaration that the SEC will revoke its appeal against the company, XRP XRP/USD price jumped 15% to $2.55. Comparatively to $5.5 million in long liquidations, the news set over $11.96 million worth of short XRP positions to be sold in just one hour on motion.

Declaring the company engaged in an unregistered securities sale, the SEC started its action against Ripple in December 2020. A federal judge penalized Ripple $125 million—far less than the SEC's $2 billion demand—and decided that XRP itself is not a security for retail sales in August 2024, therefore rendering a partial success for Ripple. With the SEC's appeal dropped, the regulatory scene for cryptocurrencies undergoes a clear change.

 

As investors moved to riskier assets ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments, Solana's native token SOL surged 8% to $ 133.44. Solana's total value locked (TVL) achieved its highest level since July 2022, rising to 53.2 million SOL on March 17—a 10% rise from the month before—despite a 47% reduction in on-chain traffic over two weeks—a trend witnessed across several blockchains.

Still among the top 10 in prices, several Solana DApps beat more established rivals. Leading in fee generating include Pump.fun, Jupiter, Meteora, and Jito; Solana's weekly base layer costs exceed those of Ethereum. SOL/USD seems positioned to maybe recover the $170 level last observed on March 3, with balanced leverage levels between longs and shorts and lowered token unlocks projected in the next months.

 

Cardano's price dropped 32% in February then rose 13.5% in March. Social attitude about ADA/USD has reached its greatest positive level in four months while floating sideways between $0.78 and $0.70 over the past ten days.

The SEC's latest remarks labeling Cardano's use case as “smart contracts for government services” helped ADA investors. Though on a downturn since its 2024 high of $1.32, the altcoin has maintained a position above the 0.50 Fibonacci retracing line, suggesting that its high-time frame chart stays on a technical uptrend.

Supported by the 200-day exponential moving average, a breakout could perhaps set off a 20% surge toward the $0.84-$0.88 region with immediate opposition at $0.78. Cardano has historically shown extended sideways movement, nevertheless, which may restrict quick gains.

Breakthrough could pave the way for next-generation GPS in drones, smartphones and self-driving cars, scientists say.

A new comb-like computer chip could be the key to equipping drones, smartphones and autonomous vehicles with military-grade positioning technology that was previously confined to space agencies and research labs.

Scientists have developed a "microcomb chip" — a 5 millimeter (0.2 inches) wide computer chip equipped with tiny teeth like those on a comb — that could make optical atomic clocks, the most precise timekeeping pieces on the planet, small and practical enough for real-world use.

This could mean GPS-equipped systems a thousand times more accurate than the best we have today, improving everything from smartphone and drone navigation to seismic monitoring and geological surveys, the researchers said in a statement. They published their findings Feb. 19 in the journal Nature Photonics.

"Today's atomic clocks enable GPS systems with a positional accuracy of a few meters [where 1 meter is 3.3 feet]. With an optical atomic clock, you may achieve a precision of just a few centimeters [where 1 centimeter is 0.4 inches]," study co-author Minghao Qi, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, said in the statement.

"This improves the autonomy of vehicles, and all electronic systems based on positioning. An optical atomic clock can also detect minimal changes in latitude on the Earth's surface and can be used for monitoring, for example, volcanic activity."

There are approximately 400 high-precision atomic clocks worldwide, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to keep time.

This typically involves using microwaves to stimulate atoms to shift between energy states. These shifts, called oscillations, happen naturally at an extremely high rate, acting like an ultra-precise ticking clock that keeps timekeeping accurate to within a billionth of a second.

That is why atomic clocks form the backbone of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — which is used to set global time zones — and GPS (global positioning system) satellites, which rely on atomic timekeeping to provide positioning data to cars, smartphones and other devices.

Despite this incredible accuracy, traditional atomic clocks are far less accurate than optical atomic clocks. Where standard atomic clocks use microwave frequencies to excite atoms, optical atomic clocks use laser light, enabling them to measure atomic vibrations at a much finer scale — making them thousands of times more precise.

Until now, optical atomic clocks have been confined to extremely limited scientific and research environments, such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is because they are extremely complex, putting them well out of reach of your standard Casio fan.

Microcomb chips could change this by bridging the gap between high-frequency optical signals (which optical atomic clocks use) and the radio frequencies used in the navigation and communication systems that modern electronics rely on.

"Like the teeth of a comb, a microcomb consists of a spectrum of evenly distributed light frequencies. Optical atomic clocks can be built by locking a microcomb tooth to a ultra-narrow-linewidth laser, which in turn locks to an atomic transition with extremely high frequency stability," the researchers explained in the statement.

—Lost in space? Here's a new method to find your way back home

They likened the new system to a set of gears, where a tiny, fast-spinning gear (the optical frequency) drives a larger, slower one (the radio frequency). Just as gears transfer motion while reducing speed, the microcomb acts as a converter that changes the ultra-fast oscillations of atoms into a stable time signal that electronics can process.

"Moreover, the minimal size of the microcomb makes it possible to shrink the atomic clock system significantly while maintaining its extraordinary precision," study co-author Victor Torres Company, professor of photonics at Chalmers, said in the statement. "We hope that future advances in materials and manufacturing techniques can further streamline the technology, bringing us closer to a world where ultra-precise timekeeping is a standard feature in our mobile phones and computers."

Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an Egyptian army where an Israelite king was killed. The discoveries at Megiddo, which inspired "Armageddon," reinforce biblical stories about King Josiah of Judah.

New archaeological evidence from the ancient city of Megiddo — the location of the final battle "Armageddon" in the Book of Revelation — supports the biblical story of an Israelite king and Egyptian pharaoh clashing there more than 2,600 years ago.

According to the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament (which are slightly different collections of ancient Hebrew writings), the Kingdom of Judah's King Josiah confronted the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II at Megiddo in 609 B.C. Now, an analysis of ancient pottery fragments indicates that Megiddo was indeed occupied by the Egyptians at that time, Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University, told Live Science.

Finkelstein is the lead author of a study describing the finds, which was published Jan. 28 in The Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament. He said in an email that large numbers of Egyptian pottery fragments had been discovered alongside Greek pottery fragments in a layer dating to the late seventh century — a time when Egypt often employed Greek mercenaries alongside Egyptian troops. The researchers determined the origins of the fragments by examining the type of clay and their style.

The fragments support the biblical accounts that Egyptian forces were at Megiddo during Josiah's reign. However, the findings aren't direct evidence that Josiah was at the battle. If he was there, as the Bible says, it's unclear if Josiah died from wounds he'd suffered during a battle against the Egyptians at Megiddo, or if he was executed there as a vassal of the pharaoh. Josiah's death was later said to foretell the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. to the Neo-Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II, whose forces destroyed the First Temple, also known as Solomon's Temple.

Archaeologist Assaf Kleiman of Ben-Gurion University, a study co-author, told Live Science in an email that the confrontation between the two rulers was described differently in two different places in the Bible. "The Josiah-Necho event at Megiddo in 609 BCE is described in the Bible twice: as an execution in a short chronistic verse in Kings and as a decisive battle in Chronicles," he said. The Book of Kings was written close to the time of the reported events, but the Book of Chronicles was composed centuries later, so the account in the Book of Kings was more reliable, he said.

The finds indicate that Egyptian troops were stationed there with a contingent of Greek mercenaries when the biblical King Josiah of Judea was killed in 609 B.C.

Experts say it is not clear whether King Josiah went to Megiddo to do battle as an enemy or as the leader of a vassal state who was executed by Pharaoh Necho. 

The ruins of Megiddo are now in a national park about 18 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Haifa. Megiddo was a strategically important city at a crossroads on trade and military routes, and it was occupied at different times by Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians. Many great battles occurred at Megiddo, and its name inspired the word "Armageddon"—the location of a final battle prophesied in the New Testament's Book of Revelation, which now refers generally to the idea of the end of the world.

Excavations at Megiddo have unearthed more than 20 archaeological layers since the 1920s. The layer with Egyptian and Greek pottery fragments described in the latest study is among several layers that date from after 732 B.C., when records indicate Megiddo was conquered by the Neo-Assyrians under their king Tiglath-Pileser III. According to the Bible, the northern kingdom of Israel fell to the Neo-Assyrians about 10 years later, followed by the expulsion of the "10 tribes" or "lost tribes" of Israel.

The many fragments of Greek pottery found at Megiddo suggest a contingent of Greek mercenaries were stationed there alongside Egyptian troops.

The many Egyptian pottery fragments found in the same place indicate Megiddo was then under the military control of a force of Egyptian troops. 

There is debate among academics whether the encounter between Josiah and Necho at Megiddo in 609 B.C. was actually a battle, or if Necho had merely executed his vassal Josiah there—in other words, whether the southern Israelite kingdom of Judah was subordinate to Egypt at that time. The Bible does not record this, but history and archaeology indicate Egypt took over the region after 630 B.C. as Neo-Assyrian power declined.

Historian Jacob Wright, a professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science that Josiah had probably traveled from Jerusalem to Megiddo to pay homage to Necho but was executed there for an unknown reason.

—2,800-year-old structure unearthed in Israel was likely used for cultic practices and sacrifice, archaeologists say

—2,700-year-old archaeological site in Jordan may be a biblical place visited by King David

Wright and Reinhard Kratz, a historian at the University of Göttingen in Germany who was also not involved in the study, both noted that the relevant verse in the Book of Kings says only that Josiah traveled to Megiddo and was "put to death" there — and that nothing was written about a battle until more than 100 years later in the Book of Chronicles.

The authors of the new study, too, are cautious about the circumstances of Josiah's death.

Finkelstein noted that Josiah was considered an exceptionally pious king, and that the idea of "Armageddon" had only begun after his death. This suggests Josiah's death had led to prophecies that the final battle between the forces of God and the forces of evil would take place where he died, Finkelstein said.

Editor's note: This article was updated at 9:28 a.m. ET to correctly attribute a quote explaining that the Josiah-Necho event at Megiddo is described twice in the Bible. That quote was said by archaeologist Assaf Kleiman of Ben-Gurion University, not by Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University.

Most people exposed to the parasites behind babesiosis don't get sick, but for others, the infection can be deadly.

Disease name: Babesiosis

Affected populations: Babesiosis is a rare and potentially fatal parasitic disease that destroys red blood cells, the cells that supply tissues with oxygen from the lungs. The disease, which is spread by ticks, occurs worldwide, including in the United States and Europe.

Fewer than 3,000 cases of babesiosis are reported annually in the U.S., and they most commonly occur between May and September in the upper Midwest and Northeast, including in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Connecticut and New York. Cases tend to rise in the spring and summer as this is when people are most likely to be in contact with the ticks that spread the disease.

Causes: Babesiosis is caused by microscopic parasites that belong to the genus Babesia. These parasites usually infect cattle and are spread between animals by ticks that eat the blood of different hosts.

Once inside the body, Babesia parasites invade and destroy red blood cells. This severely limits the ability of these cells to supply tissues with oxygen.

While more than 100 species of Babesia parasites have been identified, overall, only a few species are known to infect humans.

In the U.S., most babesiosis infections are caused by a parasite species called Babesia microti and are spread by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also known as deer ticks. These ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy or grassy areas.

In rarer instances, Babesia parasites can be spread from one person to another via contaminated blood transfusions, and they can also spread from mother to fetus across the placenta.

Symptoms: Most people exposed to Babesia parasites don't have any symptoms of babesiosis; this is especially true for young, healthy people.

However, in individuals who have weakened immune systems or who are over the age of 50, the parasites can trigger severe disease. People who have had their spleen removed are also more vulnerable to serious infections than the average person, because the spleen normally helps remove infected red blood cells from the body.



Typical symptoms of babesiosis include fever, chills, sweating, muscle aches and pains, as well as swelling of the liver and spleen and having a low level of red blood cells in the body. Symptoms usually emerge within one to four weeks of a person being infected with Babesia parasites, and they can last for several days after onset.

Serious cases of babesiosis can cause multiorgan failure and death, as tissues are starved of oxygen.

Estimates for death rates from babesiosis vary considerably between studies. However, surveillance data gathered in 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found a 0.57% death rate among patients in the U.S.

Death rates may be closer to 20% in patients who belong to high-risk groups, even when they receive treatment.

Treatments: Patients who don't have symptoms of babesiosis usually don't require treatment, as the immune system will typically clear the parasites away within one to two weeks.

—The rare genetic disorder that causes severe itchiness and liver failure

—The deadly 'black fungus' infection that decimates flesh

In symptomatic patients, the main treatment for babesiosis is a combination of antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics. The latter drugs are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, rather than parasitic infections, but certain kinds of antibiotics, such as clindamycin, can also be effective against parasites.

Patients who are very sick may also require a blood transfusion to replace their damaged and infected red blood cells.

The best way to prevent babesiosis is to avoid areas where ticks live, according to the CDC. If you are in those areas, there are precautions you can take to avoid tick bites.

"What will be new about heat deaths is the extent to which the lived environment will become physically uninhabitable for everyone, old and young, middle-aged, healthy and ill."

In this extract from "The Pocket Guide to Planetary Peril" (WH Allen, 2025), author Jakob Thomä, a professor at the University of London's SOAS Centre for Sustainable Finance, examines an existential threat facing us all: heat. As the impacts of climate change take hold, Thomä argues that heat will become the risk no one can avoid.

We live in places that will be flooded by rising sea levels. We have food production systems dependent on specific climates. And we have built economic structures, trade relationships and social dynamics contingent on certain temperatures.

What's more, we are not alone in this world, and the rapidly changing climate is a threat to the flora and fauna with whom we share this planet. Some of us think this is a problem — although admittedly not all of us.

The key questions then are: How fragile are systems to a changing climate? What are the costs of the impacts or shocks to the system (such as relocating people from places underwater, or victims of extreme weather events that are made more likely by climate change)? What are the costs of adapting to these impacts? How do we negotiate the equity and distributional impacts of these effects? And crucially, what are the costs of preventing these impacts to begin with?

That is the climate discourse in a nutshell. Except for heat. Heat is a different story because we cannot live above a certain heat level.

Of course, the heat story is driven by climate change, so at first glance it may seem I am making an artificial distinction here. Global warming is heat and heat is global warming. But the reason is that it creates an almost unmanageable risk, one incapable of being mitigated by adaptation, at least within the current technological paradigm.

This is different to almost any other effect from climate change. We can maintain habitats below sea level, the Netherlands being a perfect example, through dams and adaptation. Perhaps we would not be able to do this everywhere, and perhaps we would decide that we couldn't be bothered — economically speaking — to do this, but we at least have the means.

We can change food production patterns, our economic activity cycles, we can irrigate, we can create water, we can do all these things. Some have prohibitive price tags and come with dramatic non-financial costs to health, cultural capital and societal welfare. But they can be done.

Heat is the final boss. Heat is a different beast. Heat deaths in and of themselves may not appear as a particularly new or novel phenomenon. They happen everywhere, as the frail, the ill and the old are unable to regulate their body temperatures during hot summers.

And heat deaths can also happen to the young. One of the first "proven" victims of climate change is a 6-year-old boy from Toyota, Japan, who collapsed in a park on a morning field trip, and was dead by the afternoon.

When I think of the heartbreak of our indifference, I think of him. These kinds of deaths will increase in frequency through climate change but, of course, as any self-respecting climate sceptic or denialist will tell you, we can also expect fewer deaths from cold temperatures.

Indeed, there is some reason to believe that from a pure temperature perspective, temperature-related mortality has in fact decreased in the past decades, not just because of improved adaptation, but also because of warmer winters.

—'An existential threat affecting billions': Three-quarters of Earth's land became permanently drier in last 3 decades

—'Dengue is coming': Climate-fueled rise in cases will affect the US, scientists warn

Over time, that pendulum — as we near 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming above pre-industrial levels — will swing in the other direction, with up to 10 million annual climate deaths by the end of the century, according to some estimates (not counting the indirect deaths from climate poverty, conflict and so on).

What will be new about heat deaths is the extent to which the lived environment will become physically uninhabitable for everyone, old and young, middle-aged, healthy and ill.

Julia McDermott in Weather Girl

PAMELA RAITH

Weather Girl, at London's Soho Theatre until 5 April, is a frantic and funny one-woman show about the looming climate apocalypse.

Written by Brian Watkins, it stars Julia McDermott as Stacey, a local weather forecaster in Fresno, California. Sandwiched between segments on dog shows and testicular tanning, her reports on the droughts and wildfires in her state are always delivered with a winning smile – until, one day, she snaps.

Weather Girl is an attack on wilful ignorance – of climate change, naturally, but also of the plight of women like Stacey,…

	Crustaceans exposed to guano moved in zigzags and ate less algae

In lab experiments, Antarctic krill that smelled trouble — in the form of penguin poop — were quick to make a break for it.

The foul stench of penguin poop sets Antarctic krill on edge.

In lab experiments, the mere scent of penguin droppings — or guano — sent krill scrambling for escape, researchers report March 20 in Frontiers in Marine Science. The stink also seemed to suppress krill's appetites.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) form a cornerstone of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. “They're the main food source for all of the big, charismatic fauna,” says Nicole Hellessey, an Antarctic marine scientist at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. Whales, penguins and seals all eat — or eat things that eat — krill. Understanding the critters' movements could help identify key areas for marine conservation.

Krill use their antennae to sniff out food, mates and even pollution. But scientists weren't sure if they could detect predators by scent. To find out, Hellessey and her colleagues netted krill off the Antarctic Peninsula and transported them to nearby Palmer Station.

In the lab, the team let krill loose in a flume filled with flowing seawater, adding either algae for the krill to eat, a bit of Adélie penguin poop or both. Cameras tracked the krill's 3-D movement.

Working with the krill was fun, says oceanographer David Fields of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. “They truly are these cute, charismatic animals.”

Working with penguin poop was another story. “Penguin crap is the most vile thing you can imagine,” Fields says. Just opening guano storage bags “would clear the entire lab space.” 

Krill showed a similar reaction to the smell. In algae-only water, they quickly swam toward the food then lingered near the buffet. But in water with algae and guano, the krill zigzagged, Hellessey says. “They'd sort of dart in, eat and dart out.” Krill swam in frantic zigzags in water containing only penguin poop, too.

A second set of experiments placed krill in seawater buckets with either algae or algae plus guano. Over 22 hours, krill in the algae-only buckets ate about 67 percent of the food. Krill in buckets with penguin poop ate only about 25 percent.

The scientists aren't sure what aromas in penguin feces the krill are reacting to. But since Adélie penguins' diets are over 99 percent krill, “a lot of that guano would have crushed-up krill sort of scents,” Hellessey suspects. Some chemical cue might make the krill go, “‘Oh my god, my buddy's hurt, I shouldn't go over there.'”

London has established itself as a leader in finance and technology, and its iGaming Sector is now thriving. The city is shaping the online gambling market with fast growth, new technologies, and fresh business strategies. From AI tools to blockchain systems and mobile gaming, London's operators are helping to redefine the industry.

Artificial intelligence is at the core of online gaming. Companies use it to capture user habits and provide clear advice to hold players' attention. It also spots risky gambling behavior and supplies tools that support responsible gaming. Firms based in London lead by adopting AI to boost both the user experience and player safety. Equally, utilizing this tech to allow users to start gaming with no verification needed is something that has been driving a lot of new customers to iGaming, in a climate where people are increasingly worried about their privacy.

Chatbots powered by AI are also transforming customer support. They handle queries, process transactions, and verify accounts quickly. Faster responses and automated assistance make gaming platforms more user-friendly.

Blockchain is improving fairness and security in online gambling. London companies are adopting these systems to provide tamper-proof transactions and fair gameplay. Virtual casinos built on blockchain are also becoming popular, offering players a secure and interactive environment.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are another trend that has been around for a while. They allow players to own unique in-game items, join exclusive contests, or access special features. NFTs are helping operators boost engagement and unlock extra revenue.

Many operators are now focusing on mobile gaming, as most users access games through phones or tablets. Companies are investing in apps and mobile-friendly websites to ensure a smooth experience on smaller screens. Better design and faster platforms make gaming more accessible.

The rollout of 5G networks has enhanced mobile gaming. Faster data speeds and low latency allow players to enjoy immersive features like augmented reality or cloud-based games without expensive devices.

Mergers and acquisitions speed up growth in the sector. Big companies buy small ones to reach new markets and gain modern technology. These deals extend business and help them remain competitive in a busy field.

With more pressure to create, companies try to work hard, save money, and offer better features. This plan helps them keep their edge as the market expands.

London companies have been looking overseas since the UK market has been maturing. Areas such as Latin America and Africa now seem favorable because rules have changed, and there is improved internet access available. Firms expanding early into these regions gain a lead before competition arrives.

Governments in these regions are introducing new rules for online gambling. This opens doors for London companies to partner with local businesses and create games tailored to these markets.

Collaborating with influencers has become a key marketing tool. Popular streamers and content creators connect operators with younger audiences. Social media campaigns and themed events also keep players involved and loyal.

Live-streamed gaming events are gaining traction, too. These allow viewers to watch matches, chat with others, and place bets during the action. This interactive approach strengthens player engagement.

Gamification is becoming a standard feature in iGaming. Features like leaderboards, daily challenges, and achievements make games more engaging. Loyalty programs are also on the rise. Players receive personalized rewards that encourage them to stick with specific platforms.

Subscription plans are another growing trend. These give users access to premium games and services while providing operators with steady revenue. Players benefit from exclusive perks, enhancing their overall experience.

London's iGaming future looks promising. Companies plan to use new tools such as AI, blockchain, and 5G to help upgrade their work. Regulatory changes will also shape the industry, with stricter rules ensuring fair and responsible gaming, which puts users at ease and encourages transparency.

Environmental matters get more attention. Businesses choose eco-friendly ways, supporting greener practices and ethical gaming to meet consumer expectations. These steps may help the field keep growing.

London holds its global role for iGaming, but competition remains fierce. Firms need to follow trends, invest in tech, and keep players' interest to do well. By doing so, they secure a spot in this quickly-changing market.

Gemini is getting two new artificial intelligence (AI) features, Google announced on Tuesday. The Mountain View-based tech giant is adding Canvas, an interactive space that lets human users and AI collaborate on projects involving documents and coding-related tasks. Another feature making its way to Gemini is Audio Overview, which was previously exclusive to NotebookLM, and lets users generate an engaging podcast-like audio discussion based on documents, slides, and Deep Research reports. These features are currently being rolled out globally to both Gemini Advanced subscribers and those on the free tier.

In a blog post, the tech giant announced the two new features that are being added to Gemini. This follows the Deep Research feature that can generate a detailed report on complex topics, and the iOS-exclusive lockscreen widgets. The new features — Canvas and Audio Overview — will be available on both Gemini on web and mobile apps.

Canvas is a new interactive space on Gemini, which is aimed at letting users collaborate with the AI over certain projects. Users can now see a new Canvas button next to Deep Research in the text box on Gemini's interface. Selecting the feature and adding a document or lines of code will now open a sandbox where the AI creates a first draft based on the user's prompt, and then the user can take over to make edits and further refine the output with the help of the chatbot.

Currently, Canvas only works with documents and coding-related tasks. For documents, users will have to upload a file, and then write a prompt while the Canvas button is selected. The user can say something like “Create a speech based on these classroom notes” and the AI will open a sandbox-style interface and write the draft. Then users can make manual edits or highlight portions of the text and ask Gemini to change the tone or regenerate content with specific feedback.

Users can ask the AI to write code based on prompts. Then, with Canvas, they can ask Gemini to generate and preview the code and other web app prototypes to see a visual representation. This only works with HTML and React code currently. After the preview, the user can also request changes to input fields or call-to-action buttons, and see the updated preview. Notably, the feature is similar to OpenAI's Canvas feature, although ChatGPT only offers it on the web.

Google said that after witnessing the popularity of the Audio Overview feature in NotebookLM, it is now bringing it to Gemini. The feature works with documents, slides, and even reports created using Deep Research. Whenever a file or response fits the criteria, the Gemini platform will show a floating action button (FAB) about the feature.

Once a user taps the button, Gemini will begin generating a podcast-style audio discussion featuring two AI hosts, a male and a female voice, who will discuss the topic, draw connections between topics, and engage in a dynamic back-and-forth to provide unique perspectives. Notably, it can take a few minutes to generate an AI Overview.

Gadgets 360 staff members spotted both the features on the web interface of Gemini, but not on the apps. Since Google is rolling out the feature globally, it may take a few days before all users gain access to them.

EU Health Regulator Clears Use of AI Tool in Fatty Liver Disease Trials

Reuters

(Reuters) -A European Medicines Agency committee, on Thursday, accepted the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool called AIM-NASH in clinical trials to help identify the severity of a type of fatty liver disease.

The condition, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, is a difficult-to-treat disease that affects around 1.5% to 6.5% of adults in the U.S., according to the American Liver Foundation.

The AI-based AIM-NASH tool employs a machine learning model trained on more than 100,000 annotations from 59 pathologists who assessed over 5,000 liver biopsies across nine large clinical trials.

The EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) said evidence showed the AI tool can reliably determine disease activity from biopsies with less variability than the current standard in trials that rely on a consensus of three pathologists.

On that basis, the CHMP concluded, it can accept evidence generated by the tool as scientifically valid, which will help researchers obtain clearer evidence on the benefits of new treatments in clinical trials.

Currently, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals', Rezdiffra is the only U.S.-approved drug for MASH.

Drugmakers such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also conducting trials with their blockbuster GLP-1 treatments to treat patients with the liver disease.

The AHR Expo is a showcase of innovation and ingenuity, where HVACR manufacturers from around the globe converge to unveil cutting-edge technologies and solutions designed to tackle the industry's most pressing challenges. This year, exhibitors placed a strong emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, highlighting products that not only reduce energy consumption but also align with global decarbonization and electrification goals. 

 

Even though the political winds have changed since the last presidential election, most manufacturers remain confident that electrification will continue to be a key trend. Infinitum, for example, expects to see skyrocketing growth in electrification, said Stephen Mathew, director of product management at Infinitum. 

“AI and data centers are putting enormous pressure on the HVAC world to prioritize energy management and deliver more efficient cooling systems that optimize power consumption in buildings and support electric grid stability,” said Mathew. “Motors play a key role in a building's energy consumption, data centers, and other mission-critical facilities. In fact, 40% of a data center's energy consumption is consumed by motors in HVAC equipment to cool servers. Infinitum's next-gen, sustainable motor systems support decarbonization initiatives by powering cooling equipment with 20% less energy, 20% fewer emissions, and no waste.”

Heat pumps also play a key role in the electrification movement, but for them to have a meaningful impact on decarbonization and electrification, they need to utilize technologies that make them more competitive in colder climates, as this will increase their adoption across more of the country, said Brian Dail, application engineering manager at Danfoss Climate Solutions. 

“Danfoss' vapor injected scroll compressor, EKE110 controller, and economizer products all make it easier for heat pumps to operate in lower ambient conditions, and they also provide efficiency improvements in these same conditions. These are critical for heat pumps to have a wider adoption across climates,” said Dail. 

As new heat pump system technologies continue to support the electrification and decarbonization of space and water heating, Copeland's integrated compression, drives, and controls solutions are helping to meet energy-efficiency and capacity requirements, said John Schneider, president of HVACR technologies at Americas at Copeland. 

“Copeland will soon launch its next-generation, variable-speed scroll compressor platform: a new best-in-class offering designed to deliver excellent performance in the residential heat pump and air conditioning market,” said Schneider. “This solution-based offering combines proven scroll performance with matched inverter drive technology for long life, reliability, and ease of application.” 

 

The advanced technologies needed to support the electrification movement were on display all over the AHR Expo. Danfoss, for example, showed its new line of variable-speed, vapor injection, and scroll compressors, as well as its fixed-speed compressors that have recently been approved for vapor injection. 

“To further aid with vapor injection, our new EKE110 controller controls superheat entering a vapor-injected compressor's vapor injection port,” said Dail. “The EKE110 can also monitor the compressor's discharge temperature. This will allow it to enter ‘wet injection' mode if the scroll compressor's discharge temperature is too high, enabling the scroll compressor to operate with a larger operating envelope and allowing a heat pump to provide higher leaving water/leaving air temperatures at lower outdoor temperatures. The EKE110 is designed to be used with Danfoss scroll compressors but can potentially be used with other manufacturers' compressors as well.”

In addition, Danfoss showcased its vapor injection applications, which included electric expansion valves and brazed plate heat exchangers. The braze plate heat exchangers utilize Danfoss's microplate technology, enabling smaller heat exchangers to deliver the same level of heat transfer, said Dail. 

Copeland demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by showcasing products that support the energy transition and accelerate the adoption of low-GWP refrigerant technologies across heating, cooling, refrigeration, and industrial applications, said Schneider. Among these were advanced cooling solutions specifically designed to improve efficiency in energy- and heat-intensive data centers. 

“The Copeland oil-free centrifugal compressor with Aero-lift bearing technology unlocks new opportunities for air-cooled data center chillers, delivering best-in-class performance and increased efficiencies in part-load and full-load conditions,” said Schneider. “In addition, the Copeland YDV variable-speed scroll platform is optimized explicitly for data center applications and delivers best-in-class efficiency, reliability, and performance across a wide range of outdoor ambient and evaporating temperatures.” 

Copeland also showcased its YAW vapor-injection optimized scroll compressor, which is capable of delivering high supply air temperatures at outdoor temperatures as low as -25°F. This technology enables the creation of reliable, high-efficiency heat pumps that can perform effectively in cold climates, supporting wider adoption across all regions. On the commercial refrigeration side, Copeland highlighted its expanded CO2 solutions and optimized scroll compression platforms for A2L and R-290 refrigerants. 

Infinitum unveiled the Aircore Heavy Duty, a next-generation motor system specifically designed for mission-critical HVAC fan and pump applications. According to Mathew, this sustainable motor reduces energy consumption, emissions, noise, and waste, while delivering reliable performance for the most demanding tasks. 

“The Aircore Heavy Duty features an integrated variable-frequency drive and sustainably powers demanding, energy-intense applications with up to 25% more efficiency, while being 50% lighter and 60% shorter when compared to conventional motor and drive solutions,” said Mathew. “Built with a rugged exterior for protection against dust, dirt, and water, the Aircore Heavy Duty operates reliably in harsh outdoor or wet environments and at high efficiency over a wide range of operating points.” 

Infinitum also showcased new motor system technology that features an integrated Active Front End within the VFD, which reduces total harmonic distortion. This feature improves HVAC equipment efficiency, reliability, and safety, while eliminating the need for bulky, energy-consuming passive filters, said Mathew. By integrating this feature, he added, the technology saves space, energy, and costs, while achieving greater harmonic reduction.

The Sporlan Division of Parker Hannifin strives to be the market leader in energy-efficient and sustainable HVACR solutions that enable a better tomorrow, said John Eric Hoffmann, marketing communications manager at Sporlan. To that end, they introduced several new products, including the multi-purpose gas cooler (GCM) valve. 

“The GCM valve is used in transcritical CO2 applications in supermarket refrigeration, so that our customers can move to natural refrigerants for their cooling systems,” said Hoffmann. “In addition, we showcased products for the new lower-GWP A2L refrigerants in both air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Two of these products are our check shut-off valve (CSOV) and safety shut-off valve (SSOV), which are UL certified for A2L refrigerants and used in walk-in cooler applications to provide safety in a customer's system if a leak emerges.” 

Other products Sporlan displayed included Micro Thermo controls for CO2, which are designed with high-performance algorithms to increase the energy efficiency of CO2 refrigeration systems in supermarkets, as well as new TEVs, which have new charges for both commercial and residential air conditioning. “We are pleased to learn that these have been independently tested by several of our prospective and legacy customers, who are indicating that these units exceed the performance of our direct competitors in new A2L systems,” said Hoffmann. 

As shown here, the AHR Expo once again demonstrated the HVACR industry's commitment to innovation, with manufacturers unveiling groundbreaking solutions that prioritize energy efficiency, sustainability, and the transition to lower-GWP refrigerants.

Rajesh Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025


	Technology is shaping economies more profoundly than ever before, Nasscom President Rajesh Nambiar said on Thursday as he outlined India's strengths as a global talent hub which positions it as a preferred partner in the global technological ecosystem.


	Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025 here.


	"Today, the world is in a bit of an inflection point than ever before. Some of the technologies are actually playing a lot more influence on the economic models that we are seeing in the country," he said.


	Nambiar noted that the world is experiencing a global technological shift, which has created a rising demand for a high-quality talent base to meet the challenges and opportunities of this new landscape.


	There is no industry or country that is growing without technology playing a leading role. All of them have always been driven by technology to some extent, he said.


	"A country like India continues to be a partner of choice for the global technological ecosystem," he said.


	The IT industry is projected to close FY25 with a valuation of approximately $283 billion and is expected to surpass $300 billion in the following year, he stated. He also acknowledged the digital economy's contribution to GDP, which is anticipated to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.


	India's unmatched technology talent pool stands out as one of its key competitive advantages, he remarked.


	"This industry employs roughly about 5.8 million people as of today and it continues to grow. We are 28 per cent of the global STEM talent market worldwide. 23 per cent of the software engineering talent is housed in India," he pointed out.


	Another point that makes India an important partner in the broader global tech ecosystem is its thriving startup and innovation ecosystem, Nambiar further said.


	With over 34,000 technology startups and 3,600 deep tech startups, the nation's fundamentals are strong, and technologies such as AI and quantum computing are well-established, he said.


	"The third one is around the very strong digital infrastructure. It is a critical component of what the digital economy depends on and how the economy grows over a period of time," Nambiar said.


	GCCs, which are growing rapidly, are another positive aspect, he noted.

The Llama Nemotron models are available as an API on Nvidia's platform and on Hugging Face

Nvidia released a new family of artificial intelligence (AI) models on Tuesday at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2025. Dubbed Llama Nemotron, these are the company's latest reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) that are designed to offer a foundation for agentic AI workflows. The Santa Clara-based tech giant said these models were aimed at developers and enterprises to enable them to make advanced AI agents that can either work independently or as connected teams to perform complex tasks. The Llama Nemotron models are currently available via Nvidia's platform and Hugging Face.

In a newsroom post, the tech giant detailed the new AI models. The Llama Nemotron reasoning models are based on Meta's Llama 3 series models, with post-training enhancements added by Nvidia. The company highlighted that the family of AI models display improved capabilities in multistep mathematics, coding, reasoning, and complex decision-making.

The company highlighted that the process improved the accuracy of the models by up to 20 percent compared to the based models. The inference speed is also said to have been improved by five times compared to similar-sized open-source reasoning models. Nvidia claimed that “the models can handle more complex reasoning tasks, enhance decision-making capabilities, and reduce operational costs for enterprises.” With these advancements, the LLM can be used to build and power AI agents.

Llama Nemotron reasoning models are available in three parameter sizes — Nano, Super, and Ultra. The Nano model is best suited for on-device and edge-based tasks that require high accuracy. The Super variant is placed in the middle to offer high accuracy and throughput on a single GPU. Finally, the Ultra model is meant to be run on multi-GPU servers and offers agentic accuracy.

The post-training of the reasoning models was done on the Nvidia DGX Cloud using curated synthetic data generated using the Nemotron platform as well as other open models. The tech giant is also making the tools, datasets, and post-training optimisation techniques used to develop the Llama Nemotron models available to the open-source community.

Nvidia is also working with enterprise partners to bring the models to developers and businesses. These reasoning models and the NIM microservices can be accessed via Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry as well as an option via the Azure AI Agent Services. SAP is also using the models for its Business AI solutions and the AI copilot dubbed Joule, the company said. Other enterprises using Llama Nemotron models include ServiceNow, Accenture, and Deloitte.

The Llama Nemotron Nano and Super models and NIM microservices are available for businesses and developers as an application programming interface (API) via Nvidia's platform as well as its Hugging Face listing. It is available with the permissive Nvidia Open Model License Agreement which allows both research and commercial usage.

Data privacy and security are leading concerns in highly regulated industries

CARY, N.C., March 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Generative AI is at the forefront of global innovation in both health care and life sciences. To better understand how technology is being used, data and AI leader SAS and Coleman Parkes Research conducted a global, cross-industry survey of 237 life sciences and pharma leaders and 240 health care leaders who are decision makers on their organization's GenAI, data and analytics strategy.

New study reports how the health care and life sciences industries are implementing GenAI to improve business outcomes.


The study offers a deep dive into how these sectors are implementing GenAI, what their biggest challenges are and how health care and life sciences compares to industries like insurance, the public sector, banking, manufacturing and more.


The study offers a deep dive into how these sectors are implementing GenAI, what their biggest challenges are and how health care and life sciences compares to industries like insurance, the public sector, banking, manufacturing and more.

Health care leans into GenAI innovation

The GenAI research for the health care sector revealed that leaders can envision the technology's transformative ability and are optimistic about the potential for GenAI to support and complement the work of doctors, researchers and other health care professionals. More specifically:

"The unique challenges and diverse functions of the health care sector demand special consideration to regulatory and compliance issues, data sensitivity, interoperability and bias in AI algorithms," said Alyssa Farrell, Global Health and Life Sciences Industry Marketing Director at SAS. "The adoption of GenAI in health care is projected to rapidly catch up as the industry addresses these concerns."

Life sciences on the brink of GenAI-driven transformation

The GenAI research for life sciences and pharma found the industry is steadily embracing the technology. Leaders use the technology more regularly, are better prepared when it comes to GenAI usage policies, and an overwhelming majority plan to invest in it the next financial year. Specific findings include:

"The life sciences sector is looking toward a GenAI future with strong rates of organizational use – and the budgets to back it up," said Farrell. "The technology's strengths in prediction and modeling suggest incredible potential to accelerate initiatives across the entire value chain, from R&D through clinical trials and commercialization. Leaders are feeling positive about what GenAI can do, particularly when it comes to innovating and maintaining a competitive advantage."

Data privacy and security ranked as top concerns 

As GenAI technology expands, issues of data privacy and security uniquely affect leaders in health care and life sciences. These industries deal with sensitive and high-stakes outcomes and face particularly significant ethical and regulatory considerations. The research revealed:

Synthetic data embraced for data challenges 

Synthetic data is increasingly being used in the health care and life sciences industries to train and test AI systems in place of or in addition to real-world data. It also can augment data used to simulate patient workflows or supply chains. Synthetic data addresses data scarcity challenges by generating synthetic tabular data that statistically represents original training data without compromising sensitive patient health information.

The GenAI study revealed heightened openness to addressing data challenges – like data quality, scarcity and privacy scenarios – through synthetic data in both health care and pharma. Currently, 56% of life sciences organizations and 46% of health care entities are already using synthetic data or actively considering doing so. 

"Data is the lifeblood of the digital health ecosystem. Continued investment in interoperability and data governance is key to provide the fuel for a GenAI future," said Farrell. "Incorporating synthetic data and technology, such as digital twins, is yet another way to derive more value from data for the benefit of patients and population health outcomes."

Farmers just want to farm.

"We very much believe in that we feed the soil, to feed the plants, to feed the animal, to feed people," Sean Cornelius, a Caldwell County, Missouri, dairy farmer, said.

He's a third-generation dairy farmer, running a barn and parlor located at the site where his grandfather was born.

"We have a good family history here of being dairy farmers," Cornelius said.

Farming operations across the country are threatened each day by fluctuating markets, high input costs, and diminishing farm income.

The USDA's September farm income forecast, a key projection of farm profitability, projects $140 billion for 2024, which is a $6.5 billion decline from 2023.

"Feed costs are about 60% of our cost of production for making milk," Cornelius said. "Anything that it goes to changing the cost to grow that crop, be it land prices, be it fertilizer prices, fuel costs, labor costs, same problems all other small businesses have, we see right here on the dairy farm as well.”

Those factors play into the operation's profitability.

Cornelius Farms sells its cows' milk directly to Hiland Dairy in Kansas City.

Another lesser thought of cost is health insurance.

"if you're self-employed or work a part-time job, or you're doing something that you don't have work available health insurance, then you gotta go to the marketplace," he added.

Each year, Cornelius searches for medical insurance plans for him and his wife. 

The two navigate limited options that are available to their needs in Caldwell County, Missouri.

"When I sat down to look at my options, I found plans ranging from $1,700 a month, up to $3,400 a month. That's entirely my contribution," Cornelius told KSHB 41. "...that's almost $20,000 a year... That plan had almost a $10,000 per person deductible. Maximum out-of-pocket of $18,000.”

According to Cornelius, the options available to him must coordinate with St. Luke's Health System or not at all. 

He said his plans are not always competitive on the market because his options are limited.

Each year, Cornelius submits his taxable income to his accountant to project the next year's profit. If his operation's projected profit hits below a certain mark he can qualify for a subsidized plan that helps lower his healthcare costs.

"As I put my taxes in for 2024, I've got a higher level of income than I had for 2023," he said. "Milk prices were really good in 2024, so that kind of helped the income out. It was a pleasant surprise until the tax person looked at those numbers and was like, ouch."

Cornelius is advocating for Missouri House Bill 366, a piece of legislation that would allow the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health care plans to its members.

“7.5% of Missourians are without health coverage. That is the issue that affects many of Missouri's farm and ranch families who are self-employed," Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins said. "Those who don't qualify for subsidized plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, that go to the marketplace that find the coverage to be unaffordable.”

In 2019, KSHB 41 reported on the Kansas Legislature passing similar legislation to permit organizations like the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health care.

"Kansas has seen great success," Hawkins told KSHB 41. "Our Farm Bureau members are asking their organization to be able to offer this product, that they not only want but are demanding from us... it won't cost the state government a dime. Because we will use our own money as a Farm Bureau to stand up and be able to offer these plans to our members, which our own members will use their own money to cover the premiums on a monthly basis."

Cornelius told KSHB 41 that a persistent medical emergency with his current plans and their price could put their farm in peril.

“Early in my career I had no idea that I needed to be an expert on health care," he added. “We're limited, we're stuck with what we have. All we're asking for is another option.”

Missouri HB 366 is awaiting referral to the House floor for debate.

Considering the lack of high quality data, companies that excel in compiling and managing data effectively are attracting interest from industry partners and distinguishing themselves from their rivals. Here are some of the ways emerging AI applications are fueling and redefining the need for RWD across HCLS.

The last half decade has brought about change, innovation and overall disruption across healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) that normally transpires over the course of decades. At the forefront of this rapid change has been the ascendency of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). If one takes a step back it is remarkable to reflect on how the discourse surrounding emerging technologies has evolved in just the past two to three years. Conversations that once focused on the ‘what' now center exclusively on the ‘how'. How can we harness this technology effectively and responsibly? How do we go about upskilling and training medical professionals to use the technology responsibly? How can we ensure we're maximizing the full capabilities of these tools? Against this backdrop, the rise of these technologies has concurrently shed light to another central need in HCLS: the need for high quality, comprehensive real world data (RWD).

Considering the lack of high quality data, companies that excel in compiling and managing data effectively are attracting interest from industry partners and distinguishing themselves from their rivals. 

While there a myriad of factors at play, here are just some of the ways emerging AI applications are fueling and redefining the need for RWD across HCLS,


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

Elevating healthcare delivery

In many ways, the growth of AI applications and the need for high quality RWD is similar to a relay race. The chain of information clinicians use to diagnose, treat and monitor patients is dependent on the baton of historical data. That data not only needs to be passed effectively but also in a manner that doesn't overlook critical details. AI presents that critical link in the chain but ultimately the quality of the RWD and the value it can provide is foundational to the success of AI applications.  

Reshaping life sciences    

Similar to healthcare, AI in life sciences continues to emerge and with it pharmaceutical manufacturers and biotech companies have their own independent initiatives to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutic assets leveraging the technology. Whether seeking out and identifying new therapeutic targets or stratifying patients that are more or less likely to respond to a drug, RWD serves as an anchoring factor. Simply put, biopharma and biotech companies require high quality RWD to power their AI driven innovations.

It begins with data 

We've heard the old adage that knowledge is power and when it comes to AI applications for healthcare, biopharma and medical device applications, data is that power. In particular authentic, well curated patient data. Yet such  data often presents challenges. For example, data might be in silos or exist in different systems. But in order to arrive at clinical grade conclusions, the foundation of such models needs to be patient data. For this reason, the rise of GenAI applications in HCLS makes the need for RWD even greater than existed previously. Gen AI models often produce hallucinations or outcomes that do not exist in the actual data. Such inaccuracies render AI applications unusable, further emphasizing the indispensable role of quality RWD in developing functional and reliable healthcare AI applications.

The path ahead

As applications across HCLS accelerate and in turn the need for RWD to continue to fuel that advancement, the focus will increasingly shift to maximizing value of the data for HCLS organizations. We are already beginning to see healthcare organizations for example that manage patient interactions, ranging from hospitals to home health providers, implementing steps to better organize and prepare their data for downstream uses. This is the case both within their care centers and externally. Investing in data infrastructure, governance processes and strategies to effectively handle RWD is going to be critical for HCLS organizations as they continue on their AI journeys. Those that do so well will be best positioned to derive value from their data while enhancing patient outcomes.

GE Healthcare, Synchron and robotics companies were among the medtech firms that used Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference to share updates on their work with the AI computing leader.

Medtech companies used GTC 2025 this week to share updates on their work with AI computing leader Nvidia. The event is Nvidia's annual artificial intelligence developer conference.

Here, we look at AI projects device and diagnostic developers have started with Nvidia and one of the computing company's partners, Google Cloud. 

Quest Diagnostics is working with Google Cloud to streamline its data systems and personalize customer experiences using generative AI, the companies said Tuesday.

The partnership positions Quest to deploy platforms such as Google Agentspace, which uses generative AI to help employees and customers find information and create agents to automate tasks. Quest said AI could help patients “glean personalized health insights from their laboratory data” and give physicians insights to inform their care of individuals.

Quest, which competes with Labcorp, said the collaboration is “one of the first by a national laboratory provider to use these technologies across a range of operations and administrative areas like R&D, customer experience and operations.”

Other goals include streamlining Quest's systems to improve data quality, management and security. The company fulfilled more than 200 million orders for tests and managed over 80 billion data points in 2024.

GE Healthcare has expanded its relationship with Nvidia to cover autonomous X-ray and ultrasound systems, the companies said Tuesday. 

The partners plan to use AI-enabled software to capture and analyze medical images. GE Healthcare framed the autonomous systems as a way to alleviate the radiology staff shortages that have emerged as demand for imaging has increased in aging societies. AI-enabled systems “could minimize the burden on technicians and radiologists,” GE Healthcare said.

GE Healthcare plans to use the Nvidia Cosmos platform to train, test and tune autonomous ultrasound and X-ray devices in a virtual environment. By using synthetic data generation to simulate various scenarios, the company plans to automate repetitive tasks performed by X-ray technologists. The partners will also look at machine-to-patient interactions to more fully automate the scanning process. 

The ultrasound part of the project is focused on streamlining workflows and reducing the physical strains sonographers experience as they perform repetitive motions. GE Healthcare also sees opportunities to use AI in image understanding and robotic navigation.

Synchron has shown how its AI-enabled brain-computer interface could be displayed on the Apple Vision Pro to allow people to control digital and physical environments with their thoughts.

The company, which shared the news Wednesday, used Nvidia's Holoscan AI sensor processing platform to power the technology. Synchron said Holoscan enables faster, more precise motor inference in its BCI technology to empower users to control digital environments using their thoughts. 

Synchron's use of Holoscan for real-time neural decoding is the first step on its roadmap. The company plans to use other Nvidia technologies to create simulations of domestic environments. By interpreting neural signals in real-world simulations, the company aims to make interactions more intuitive.

Cognitive AI is the final part of Synchron's three-step roadmap. The company called cognitive AI the next step beyond generative and agentic AI. Synchron aims to create a “self-learning model of cognition.” The project will train the AI “directly on human neural activity” that the company has collected through the development and use of its BCI device.

Moon Surgical and Virtual Incision also shared details of their work with Nvidia this week. Moon Surgical is using the Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare platform to try to develop a robot that can “actively interpret, adapt and enhance surgical workflows in real time.” The company's Maestro System already uses the Nvidia Holoscan platform for real-time sensor processing.

Virtual Incision is exploring the use of the Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare platform in its next-generation robots, leveraging its ability to create virtual environments to simulate surgical details and physiologic processes.

Correction: The story was updated to reflect which company announcements were made as part of Nvidia's conference. Quest Diagnostics' announcement was not part of the conference.

Questions raised about whether Jitesh Gadhia's attendance at discussion between Accord Healthcare and government was within Lords rules

A peer attended a meeting where a healthcare company of which he is a director lobbied a government minister, raising questions about whether this was within the rules of the House of Lords.

Jitesh Gadhia, an investment banker and City financier, is a non-executive director of Accord Healthcare. He attended the online meeting along with two Accord executives, according to official records, in 2021, when he was already on the board of the company.

An email shows Accord Healthcare, which sells a substantial amount of medicines to the NHS, wanted to use the meeting to get an update on a change in official policy. It also wanted to discuss potentially securing millions of pounds in taxpayer grants for a manufacturing facility, assisting with the design of services and procurement contracts, and to ask if it could “contribute” to official working groups.

While there are grey areas in the rules of the House of Lords, they stated at the time that peers must not seek to profit from being a member of the chamber by accepting money in return for providing parliamentary advice or services. The rules also stated that peers who had paid roles were not permitted to “assist outside organisations or persons in influencing members of either house, ministers or officials”, and that they were banned from “making use of their position to lobby, or to help others to lobby” the government.

Those who did have paid roles had a “responsibility to maintain a clear distinction between their outside interests and their parliamentary work”, the code of conduct stated. Later versions of the code reinforce these principles.

Tom Brake, the director of the campaign group Unlock Democracy and a former deputy leader of the House of Commons, said an investigation was needed to determine whether Lord Gadhia's attendance at the meeting was within the rules.

He added: “If the code is ambiguous as to whether peers with commercial interests can attend these kind of meetings, then that should be resolved.”

Lawyers for Gadhia said he was not paid to provide parliamentary advice or services. They said his involvement with the group predated his appointment to parliament and that he “believes that he has acted at all times in accordance with the rules and associated guidance”. They said the suggestion he had engaged in lobbying was “misconceived”.

Accord said the meeting was not lobbying and should be seen as a “vital engagement that serves the public interest”.

Details of Gadhia's activities are being published as part of a project by the Guardian, the Lords debate, which is examining the role of the House of Lords and the conduct of its members at a time when the government is proposing to overhaul the upper chamber.

An investment banker for more than two decades, Gadhia is currently a non-executive director of the Bank of England's governing body, helping to oversee its strategy and budget. He has held a series of directorships in big companies such as Rolls-Royce and Barclays.

He received his peerage from David Cameron as part of the former prime minister's resignation honours in 2016. The Cambridge graduate had by that time donated £214,000 to the Conservative party as well as £25,000 to the Liberal Democrats.

He has been an unaffiliated peer since 2017 after sitting on the Conservative benches during his first year in parliament.

Gadhia has been a non-executive director of Accord Healthcare for seven years. Since 2010, he has been an adviser on strategic matters to Intas Pharmaceuticals, the Indian multinational that owns Accord.

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in January 2021 a senior Accord executive initiated the meeting with James Bethell, then a junior health minister. The executive requested the meeting in an email copied to Gadhia at his House of Lords account.

The day before the meeting in February, an Accord executive emailed the government summarising the issues the company wanted to raise.

One was to “explore UK government appetite to explore building with us a resilient national supply chain for plasma fractionation on a toll basis”. The process of fractionation separates blood plasma into its different components, which can be used to produce medicines. The company was seeking an update on a change to policy restricting the use of blood plasma from UK donors.

Another concerned its request for £15m of taxpayers' money in grants and tax credits to help its manufacturing plant in Newcastle.

In its email, Accord said it “would be happy to assist with the government's thoughts on tendering, procurement or designing services. Are there any working groups being set up that we can contribute to?” Bethell later offered to “connect” Accord with two official taskforces.

In response to questions from the Guardian, Accord said the meeting “should not be seen as lobbying; rather, it is a vital engagement that serves the public interest”. It said that at the time of the meeting, it “did not receive research and development grants or tax credits”, adding that “Accord does not have any representatives on government taskforces”.

Gadhia's lawyers said the meeting “was part of the dialogue between government and industry, the purpose of which was to discuss how to respond to government healthcare objectives and NHS needs. This dialogue followed standard department procedures for engagement with the life sciences industry.” They said it was the only ministerial meeting he had attended as a non-executive director of Accord, adding that his attendance was declared in official transparency registers.

Accord said it had sought to engage with the Department of Health and Social Care to discuss the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for greater resilience in the medical supply chain.

L'installation dispose du système de gestion de la qualité de Flex pour le secteur de la santé et devrait obtenir la certification ISO13485 d'ici le deuxième trimestre 2025. Ce nouveau centre rejoint le réseau de Flex d'environ 100 sites dans le monde, permettant une intégration fluide entre les installations de conception et de fabrication à travers les régions.

Flex (NASDAQ: FLEX) hat die Eröffnung eines neuen Produkt-Einführungszentrums (NPI) in der Nähe von Boston, Massachusetts, bekannt gegeben, das sich der Bedienung von Kunden im Gesundheitswesen widmet. Die Einrichtung fungiert als Fertigungsgateway und bietet umfassende Unterstützung bei der Produktentwicklung, vom Prototyp bis zur Produktion.

Das Zentrum umfasst ein 8.000 Quadratfuß großes NPI-Labor, das mehrere Produktionslinien gleichzeitig betreiben kann, sowie ein 2.000 Quadratfuß großes Labor für Qualitäts- und Designvalidierungstests. Es wird verschiedene Gesundheitsprodukte unterstützen, darunter chirurgische Robotik, medizinische Geräte, Medizintechnologiesysteme, Bildgebungsgeräte und Labor-Diagnosetechnik.

Die Einrichtung verfügt über das Qualitätsmanagementsystem von Flex für das Gesundheitswesen und wird voraussichtlich bis zum 2. Quartal 2025 die ISO13485-Zertifizierung erhalten. Dieses neue Zentrum reiht sich in das Netzwerk von Flex mit etwa 100 globalen Standorten ein und ermöglicht eine nahtlose Integration zwischen Design- und Fertigungseinrichtungen in verschiedenen Regionen.

Flex's new Boston-area NPI center represents a strategic capability expansion in the high-value healthcare manufacturing sector. The 8,000 sq. ft. NPI lab and 2,000 sq. ft. quality testing facility are specifically designed to support complex medical product development across surgical robotics, medical devices, and diagnostic equipment categories.

The facility's location near Boston's medical technology hub is particularly significant, positioning Flex to capture business from innovative healthcare startups and established medical technology companies concentrated in this innovation ecosystem. This proximity advantage could accelerate customer acquisition in a sector known for high margins and long-term relationships.

From an operational perspective, this center bridges a critical gap between prototype development and full-scale production - often a pain point for medical device manufacturers. By offering end-to-end services from design through manufacturing transfer, Flex is targeting the higher-margin early development phases while creating a seamless pathway to volume production across its global network.

The pending ISO13485 certification (targeted for Q2 2025) is essential for handling regulated medical products and signals Flex's commitment to the stringent quality standards required in this sector. The capability to run several development lines simultaneously indicates meaningful capacity for concurrent customer projects.

While the announcement lacks financial projections or investment figures, this expansion should be viewed as a capability enhancement that strengthens Flex's competitive position in medical manufacturing services, potentially yielding benefits over the medium to long term rather than generating immediate material financial impact.

Oops, something went wrong

Tenet Healthcare (THC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this hospital operator have returned -5.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.5% change. The Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, to which Tenet belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Tenet is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.03 points to a change of +1.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.40 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Tenet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tenet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Tenet, the consensus sales estimate of $5.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.5%. The $20.84 billion and $21.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +5%, respectively.

Tenet reported revenues of $5.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.7%. EPS of $3.44 for the same period compares with $2.68 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.75%. The EPS surprise was +17.41%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tenet is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tenet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

CenterWell Bringing Convenient, Personalized Health Care to Seniors at Gladstone Walmart

CenterWell Senior Primary Care in Gladstone, Mo., will celebrate its grand opening March 26. This is the first event for the 23 locations across four states where Humana's primary care brands, CenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva Senior Primary Care, are opening centers conveniently located next to Walmart stores. CenterWell Gladstone has been open and seeing patients since December 2024. Centers in Florida, Georgia and Texas will also host grand opening events later this spring.

GLADSTONE, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CenterWell Senior Primary Care® is celebrating the grand opening of its new center located next to the Walmart in Gladstone, Missouri, March 26, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. This is the first grand opening event of the 23 centers at Walmart locations across four states scheduled to open by the middle of this year.


CenterWell Gladstone opened and began accepting new patients late last year. The grand opening is a free community event that will include tours of the center, food, live music, bingo and more.




CenterWell Senior Primary Care and its sister brand, Conviva Senior Primary Care, make up Humana's Primary Care Organization (PCO), the nation's largest, fastest-growing senior primary care provider. Together they deliver care to approximately 390,000 seniors in more than 340 centers as of Dec. 31, 2024. The organization focuses on bringing quality, affordable, personalized care to seniors primarily in underserved communities.




“We're so excited to bring CenterWell to Gladstone seniors,” said Drew Hare, Market President for Missouri and Kansas. “We work to help eliminate barriers to care by making a visit to the doctor's office convenient for the community, and it doesn't get more convenient than next to a Walmart. Like our other centers, this center is specifically designed for seniors, including dedicated entrances and easy parking. We're committed to helping our patients lead happier, healthier lives.”




Stephanie Ikeme, M.D., CenterWell's Chief Medical Officer for Missouri and Kansas, emphasized CenterWell's focus on whole-person health in a value-based care model has shown positive health outcomes for seniors.




“The newest data show that patients in value-based care models, like ours at CenterWell, see their primary care clinicians 10% more than non-value-based care patients, and this means more preventive care and better health maintenance for our seniors,” Dr. Ikeme said. “Additionally, those Medicare Advantage patients had 278,000 fewer inpatient admissions in 2023 versus those enrolled in Original Medicare. This holistic care is what we want for our seniors, and we're so thrilled to have another center open to expand access to our unique care model.”




CenterWell Senior Primary Care centers are staffed by board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, medical assistants and operational support staff, and patients will have access to nurse care coordinators, behavioral health specialists, social workers, a clinical pharmacist and referral specialists. The entire team has been specially trained to treat the senior population. In addition to its healthcare offerings, CenterWell facilities include activity centers open to the entire community, not just patients.




CenterWell locations in Missouri and Kansas accept Original Medicare and a wide range of Medicare Advantage health plans. CenterWell Gladstone joins seven other senior primary care centers in the Kansas City metropolitan area.




Other CenterWell and Conviva centers located next to Walmart stores will celebrate grand opening events this year in these metropolitan areas:

Diese Karten ermöglichen es autorisiertem Personal, Verfahren und Transaktionen auf der Circular-Blockchain über eine einfache Tap-to-Computer-Oberfläche digital zu signieren.

Durch die Partnerschaft mit IT Lab werden über 8.000 italienische Apotheken medizinische Untersuchungen über die White-Label-Plattform 'Smart Share' on-chain aufzeichnen. Das System soll im Q2 2025 sowohl in Italien als auch auf dem US-Markt eingeführt werden, ohne dass eine Kryptowährung oder der Besitz einer Wallet erforderlich ist. Die Initiative zielt darauf ab, ein dezentrales, sicheres Gesundheitssystem zu schaffen und gleichzeitig die Standardkosten für klinische Untersuchungen beizubehalten.

CompoSecure's strategic partnership with Circular Protocol and IT Lab represents a significant expansion of the company's Arculus Authentication technology into the healthcare vertical. This integration creates a blockchain-based security solution that addresses critical healthcare needs while opening a substantial new market for CMPO.

What's technically innovative here is the implementation approach. By using CompoSecure's physical security card as the interface for blockchain interaction, they've created a solution that's both highly secure and user-friendly - eliminating the need for healthcare providers to understand cryptocurrency or maintain digital wallets. This addresses one of the primary adoption barriers that has historically  blockchain's penetration in traditional sectors.

The partnership's commercial scope is substantial, with the initial deployment targeting 8,000 Italian pharmacies through IT Lab's established platform. The promised Q2 2025 rollout for both Italian pharmacies and the US market provides a clear timeline for potential revenue growth.

While the article doesn't disclose financial terms, this partnership represents exactly the type of commercial application that could drive meaningful revenue growth for CMPO beyond its core financial services market. The healthcare industry's strict requirements around data security, privacy, and fraud prevention align perfectly with the capabilities of CompoSecure's technology.

This partnership positions CompoSecure to capitalize on an underserved aspect of healthcare digitization: the authentication and verification of clinical procedures. By integrating their Arculus technology into Circular's MedTech devices, CMPO is addressing a genuine pain point in the industry - creating immutable, secure records without disrupting existing workflows.

The implementation in 8,000 Italian pharmacies is particularly strategic. European pharmacies are increasingly serving as frontline healthcare providers, performing basic exams and procedures. This partnership enables these transactions to be recorded securely on-chain while maintaining the same cost structure as standard exams - creating adoption incentives through added security rather than price increases.

What's most compelling is how this solution distributes the healthcare burden to appropriate access points while maintaining security. Pharmacies can offer proximity and convenience while hospitals handle more complex cases - all using the same secure authentication system. For CompoSecure, this represents not just a new market but a potential industry-wide ecosystem where their technology becomes the standard verification mechanism.

The Q2 2025 US market entry timing is ideal as American healthcare continues to seek solutions that improve security without adding complexity. By establishing their system in European pharmacies first, CompoSecure and partners can refine the implementation before tackling the more fragmented US healthcare market.

The Circular blockchain delivers infrastructure to build the first digital network for on-chain verification and authentication of medical records and transactions

BOSTON, Mass, and SOMERSET, N.J., March  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Circular Protocol today announced a new commercial initiative with two leaders in the security and software space, Arculus by CompoSecure, and IT Lab to step up digital transparency and protection in the global healthcare industry.

As healthcare becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, verification and authentication of patient records and healthcare data are essential for ensuring data accuracy, protecting patient privacy, and preventing fraud.

Today's announcement delivers an advanced solution that will integrate into clinical networks and serve as the secure passkey for recording, managing, and safeguarding critical healthcare data within facilities using the MedTech device.

The Circular blockchain is building the first digital network for on-chain verification and authentication of medical records and transactions. Integrating Arculus Authentication, by CompoSecure, into the company's MedTech device, healthcare providers will create a physical card (which holds a private key) for hospitals and healthcare centers, to allow authorized administrators, operators, and patients to digitally sign off procedures, exams and other transactions, directly on the Circular blockchain, simply by tapping the card to their computer. The card can be used in clinical networks, as the key to record, own and protect all data regarding programs and activities of the facilities utilizing the MedTech device.

“Tech needs to be invisible and easy to use while delivering the benefits of secure and immutable records on a public registry, so the rights of medical institutions and patients are protected, and their data safely stored,” said Dr. Gianluca De Novi, Founder and CEO at Circular Protocol.

“We are excited about this partnership and where blockchain and healthcare converge to set a new standard for data protection,” said Dr. Adam Lowe, Chief Product Officer at CompoSecure. “This is an exciting future where patients have true ownership and seamless and secure access to their medical information.”

Circular is also partnering with IT Lab, an Italian software powerhouse specialized in the healthcare sector. More than 8,000 pharmacies in Italy will record on-chain the exams they are allowed to perform on-premises, becoming safe and transparent providers of medical procedures. The recording takes place via their ‘Smart Share' white label platform, already available in all pharmacies running the proof-of-concept (POC) for the first few months, with no need to own cryptocurrencies or a wallet. The rollout is expected in Q2 2025. The launch is designed to be the first truly decentralized, secure and transparent healthcare system of its kind. Costs are the same as a standard clinical exam, but with the added value of proximity, and all the blockchain-generated benefits.

“We are evolving healthcare towards a future where each touchpoint is monitored and where the burden of exams and treatments will be redistributed and performed where it makes the most sense, from a cost, proximity and competence perspective, empowering pharmacies, as well as hospitals, in full transparency and security for operators and patients”, said Anthony D'Angelo, CEO of ITLab “This will all be accessible via the current interfaces, but certifying patient data becomes, for the first time, the key for tremendous value for the whole healthcare and medical network, and Circular is leading this transformation.”

This ecosystem is expected to launch in the U.S. market in Q2 2025, providing healthcare institutions with seamless blockchain integration. To learn more, visit:  https://www.circularprotocol.org

Hallmark Launches Bold New Brand Campaign to Transform Healthcare Staffing



Innovative AI-generated ads showcase common nursing executive dilemmas, highlighting how Hallmark's unique internal-first staffing solutions can solve healthcare's toughest challenges



Hallmark, a leading healthcare workforce management technology company, today unveiled a groundbreaking brand campaign that creatively addresses one of healthcare's most pressing challenges—clinical staffing shortages and the downstream impacts of clinician engagement, patient safety, and unsustainable costs.


This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320628495/en/

“Hair on Fire" is one of Hallmark's AI-generated ads that humorously capture the stress and pressures nursing executives experience when struggling to fill shifts.


Leveraging humor and cutting-edge generative AI technology, Hallmark's innovative campaign vividly illustrates the dilemmas nursing executives face and demonstrates how hospitals can build stronger, more sustainable staffing strategies. The centerpiece is a series of AI-generated commercials featuring memorable visual metaphors—such as “In a Pickle,” “Hair on Fire,” and “Between a Rock and a Hard Place.” The ads humorously capture the stress and pressures nursing executives experience when struggling to fill shifts.



The campaign's tagline, “Don't just outsource—insource,” highlights Hallmark's unique internal-first staffing methodology, emphasizing the importance of empowering hospitals to build their own flexible internal workforce pools instead of relying on costly external contract labor.



“These lighthearted, yet impactful, ads make a powerful statement: hospitals are stuck in a frustrating, unsustainable cycle of clinical staffing, and it's time for a smarter solution that provides the flexibility clinicians want and the internal-first prioritization healthcare leaders desperately need,” said Matt Resteghini, Chief Marketing Officer at Hallmark.



Hallmark's Einstein II contingent labor platform seamlessly combines an Internal Resource Pool (IRP) with a Vendor Management Solution (VMS), enabling hospitals to staff internally as a priority, deploying their own flexible clinicians before turning to external agencies. By reducing reliance on expensive contract labor, hospitals achieve better cost optimization while offering their staff greater autonomy and satisfaction.



Hallmark's 2025 Workforce Trends Survey underscores the critical need for flexible staffing solutions. The results show of 1,200 senior healthcare executives, flexibility ranked equal to, or higher than, pay in importance for attracting and retaining nurses. Additionally, 98% of executives plan to expand contingent labor options, and 92% intend to invest further in flexible staffing technologies.



Hallmark's innovative campaign will be showcased at the AONL Conference in Boston later this month. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage through interactive experiences, such as a “Pickle Booth” photo station and CNO confession booths for nursing executives to share their most challenging staffing dilemmas.



The campaign creative was developed in conjunction with Boston-based shops Ideasicle X and Strategy by Sheehan. Explore more at: https://info.hallmarkhcs.com/insource.

GE HealthCare launches AI-driven, patient-friendly Invenia ABUS Premium to accelerate scanning and drive early cancer detection in dense breasts

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC) announced the launch of Invenia™ Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) Premium, the latest 3D ultrasound offering advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative features to drive faster*, reproducible supplemental screening and streamline exam readings on patients with dense breasts.


Approximately 71% of cancers occur in dense breasts.1 According to studies across the U.S. and Europe, 40% of women2 and 70% of Asian women3 have dense breast tissue, making them four to six times more likely to receive a breast cancer diagnosis.4 Early detection of breast cancer is critical, yet about one-third5 of cancers in dense breasts may go undetected by a mammogram, as the cancer can be masked within the dense tissue. There is rapidly growing evidence supporting ABUS as a valuable tool for detecting cancer in dense breasts because it provides clearer and more detailed images and has been shown to improve the sensitivity of detecting invasive cancer in dense breasts when added to mammography.6,7,8,9



“Women with dense breasts often face poorer outcomes due to malignancies detected at later, more advanced stages. Invenia ABUS Premium equipped with AI has the potential to optimize clinicians' screening capabilities, enabling them to detect even small, early-stage cancers with a high degree of confidence in women with dense breasts,” said Karley Yoder, CEO of Comprehensive Care Ultrasound, GE HealthCare. “Invenia ABUS Premium is designed to help deliver the best possible outcomes for patients while also prioritizing the patient experience with features to improve scan speed and enhance comfort during an exam.”




Invenia ABUS Premium is designed to manage high patient volumes along the breast care pathway, while delivering extraordinary image quality and boosting clinical confidence. The new Verisound™ AI tools can help clinicians work smarter and more efficiently, featuring Scan Quality Assessment for immediate qualitative evaluation during the exam for proper breast coverage and positioning, and Auto Nipple Detection for consistent nipple marker positions. The new Fast Scan tool increases scan speed by up to 40%*, while cSound™ Imageformer capabilities automatically create focus at every pixel, ensuring consistent, high-resolution image quality and reproducibility.




For fast, streamlined reading, physicians can use Invenia ABUS Viewer with AI Assistant** to quickly review and interpret patient exams either from their practice or remotely. The integration of AI tools** for enhanced review of ABUS 3D datasets harness intelligent algorithms to assist in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. These tools can help improve clinical confidence and reading efficiency, addressing staff shortages.




The ABUS Premium's non-invasive design significantly enhances the patient experience, with a patient experience study showing that 100% of women would recommend an ABUS exam to their best friend.10 This advanced ABUS technology also has the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies by providing specific image features to distinguish and detect malignant tumors, enabling clinicians to escalate care sooner.9 Additionally, it reduces patient exposure to radiation or contrast injection as it doesn't use any iodinated contrast agent or ionizing radiation. The new Reverse Curve™ transducer follows the contour of a woman's breast anatomy, while selectable compression levels provide personalized comfort during the exam.




"As an early adopter of ABUS, I've experienced the entire evolution of this technology. The Invenia ABUS Premium is superior* with its special AI features, which ensure the breast volume is captured and offer automatic nipple annotation, reducing scanning time and streamlining clinical workflow," said Athina Vourtsis, MD, PhD, Chief Director and Founder of Athena Medical, Athens, Greece; Founding President of the Hellenic Breast Imaging Society; European Liaison and Member of the Medical Advisory Board of DenseBreast-Info. "The new Reverse Curve transducer makes the examination more patient friendly, and it is much more comfortable. There has been great improvement in image quality with less shadowing, and the structures behind the area of the nipple are seen more clearly, providing radiologists with greater diagnostic confidence."




Invenia ABUS Premium will be launching in key countries throughout 2025 and received Premarket Approval (PMA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Invenia ABUS Premium was featured at the 2025 European Congress of Radiology (ECR) and will also be showcased at the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCoBC) 2025 and 2025 Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) Symposium.

In most cases, your health insurance must cover a list of certain services such as cancer screenings even if you get it from your employer. The proposed Texas House Bill 139 could remove that requirement and let a company provide an "Employer Choice of Benefits Plan" that does not provide all those state-mandated services.

The bill was filed by Rep. Jay Dean, R-Longview, who is the chair of the House Committee on Insurance. Dean's office did not respond to questions from the American-Statesman on the bill.

State-mandated services include:

The health benefit plan would have to share with employees this disclaimer: "This Employer Choice of Benefits Plan, either wholly or partly, does not provide state-mandated health benefits normally required in health benefit plans in Texas. This employer health benefit plan may provide a more affordable health benefit plan for you, although, at the same time, it may provide you with fewer health benefits than those normally included as state-mandated health benefits in health benefit plans in Texas. Please consult with your insurance agent to discover which state-mandated health benefits are excluded from this health benefit plan."

The plan then has to give a list of mandated health benefits it is not providing.

If this bill becomes law on Sept. 1, "it would allow insurers to offer plans that fail to meet basic expectations that most Texas patients have," said Katherine McLane, spokesperson of Texas Coalition for Patients. She said the coalition believes this legislation would "throw away" 35 bills of protection from the past five legislative sessions.

The employer choice of benefits plan still would have to follow federal rules set by the Affordable Care Act, which does include preventative cancer screenings, newborn screenings and vaccines, for example.

The coalition worries that as the ACA continues to be attacked at the federal level, Texans can't rely on federal law to continue to uphold health care insurance protections, said the coalition's Talan Tyminski. "Mental health, children's health care, those would all be gone," she said.

Dean has another bill that also has the coalition frustrated. HB 138 would create the Health Impact, Cost and Coverage Analysis Program that would create a report of any added cost that mandated health legislation would have on insurance providers or the state, as well as individuals. That report also would analyze if the legislation would increase or decrease the use of health services.

The Center for Health Care Data at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston would create the report, but McLane worries patients and providers would be left out of the decision-making.

"This has the stink of big insurance all over it," she said. "We can't exclude patients and Texans from it and (from) taking a wholistic view of health care."

Despite healthcare price transparency regulations being in effect for the last four years, there's been little impact on the overall cost of care in the U.S. But the Trump administration seems determined to give the regulation teeth. 

President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring the Departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services to implement regulations that would further enforce the Hospital Price Transparency Rule and the Transparency in Coverage Rule by late May. The rules first came into effect during Trump's first administration, which mandated hospitals and insurers to share the costs of all services in machine-readable files. President Joe Biden signed another executive order in 2021, placing fines on uncompliant hospitals. 

Yet, just 21% of hospitals actually meet federal requirements, according to non-profit Patient Rights Advocate. A majority of hospitals are either completely ignoring the mandate or submitting illegible data, making it hard for consumers — including employers — to shop for quality, cost-effective care.

"The data itself is very much imperfect," says Mairin Mancino, senior adviser of policy at Peterson Center on Healthcare. "It's hard to manipulate, and it takes data scientists months and months to make it into something useful. We're hopeful the administration will get these files cleaned up so that employers have the information they need when purchasing [plans] in the future."

Ideally, access to this data would enable employers to pinpoint which hospitals and providers offer the best services for the best prices, explains Mancino. If one hospital is charging four times as much as the hospital down the road for the same procedure, it's worth exploring why there are added costs. More often than not, it's an arbitrary upcharge that has less to do with the provider's performance and more to do with the lack of transparency.

"We know from the data that we do have that there are massive price differentials even within hospitals that don't seem to be supported by anything other than pricing power by incumbents like hospitals," says Mancino. "So that has done a lot to galvanize employers to say, 'Hey, we're not getting a good deal.'"

Mancino is confident that more pricing information will push employers to change their health plans, whether or not they're self-insured. Given that Aon predicts health benefit costs will go up 9% this year, most employers won't have a choice. However, instead of cutting down their employees' access to care, employers can opt for stronger, if not smaller, provider networks.

"Spending has been increasing across all of healthcare, but it's been particularly prominent in the employer market," says Mancino. "Better pricing data can help employers make novel benefit design decisions that are going to hold down costs and increase quality."

While no one knows what shape Trump's executive order will take in May, Mancino is optimistic that more hospital and insurer data will come to light. In the meantime, she encourages employers to call their members o

 Congress and voice their need for clean, readable care data. 

"Get in touch and get involved," says Mancino. "This is your opportunity to express your desire for more information so you can make better decisions with your healthcare dollars."

If the Trump administration successfully ups price transparency compliance, employers will have vital data at their fingertips.

The Trump administration's crackdown on DEI programs could exacerbate an unexpectedly steep drop in diversity among medical school students, even in states like California, where public universities have been navigating bans on affirmative action for decades. Education and health experts warn that, ultimately, this could harm patient care.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued a handful of executive orders aimed at terminating all diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in federally funded programs. And in his March 4 address to Congress, he described the Supreme Court's 2023 decision banning the consideration of race in college and university admissions as "brave and very powerful."

Last month, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights — which lost about 50% of its staff in mid-March — directed schools, including postsecondary institutions, to end race-based programs or risk losing federal funding. The "Dear Colleague" letter cited the Supreme Court's decision.

Paulette Granberry Russell, president and CEO of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, said that "every utterance of 'diversity' is now being viewed as a violation or considered unlawful or illegal." Her organization filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.

While California and eight other states — Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Washington — had already implemented bans of varying degrees on race-based admissions policies well before the Supreme Court decision, schools bolstered diversity in their ranks with equity initiatives such as targeted scholarships, trainings, and recruitment programs.

But the court's decision and the subsequent state-level backlash — 29 states have since introduced bills to curb diversity initiatives, according to data published by the Chronicle of Higher Education — have tamped down these efforts and led to the recent declines in diversity numbers, education experts said.

After the Supreme Court's ruling, the numbers of Black and Hispanic medical school enrollees fell by double-digit percentages in the 2024-25 school year compared with the previous year, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Black enrollees declined 11.6%, while the number of new students of Hispanic origin fell 10.8%. The decline in enrollment of American Indian or Alaska Native students was even more dramatic, at 22.1%. New Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander enrollment declined 4.3%.

"We knew this would happen," said Norma Poll-Hunter, AAMC's senior director of workforce diversity. "But it was double digits — much larger than what we anticipated."

The fear among educators is the numbers will decline even more under the new administration.

At the end of February, the Education Department launched an online portal encouraging people to "report illegal discriminatory practices at institutions of learning," stating that students should have "learning free of divisive ideologies and indoctrination." The agency later issued a "Frequently Asked Questions" document about its new policies, clarifying that it was acceptable to observe events like Black History Month but warning schools that they "must consider whether any school programming discourages members of all races from attending."

"It definitely has a chilling effect," Poll-Hunter said. "There is a lot of fear that could cause institutions to limit their efforts."

Numerous requests for comment from medical schools about the impact of the anti-DEI actions went unreturned. University presidents are staying mum on the issue to protect their institutions, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Utibe Essien, a physician and UCLA assistant professor, said he has heard from some students who fear they won't be considered for admission under the new policies. Essien, who co-authored a study on the effect of affirmative action bans on medical schools, also said students are worried medical schools will not be as supportive toward students of color as in the past.

"Both of these fears have the risk of limiting the options of schools folks apply to and potentially those who consider medicine as an option at all," Essien said, adding that the "lawsuits around equity policies and just the climate of anti-diversity have brought institutions to this place where they feel uncomfortable."

In early February, the Pacific Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit against the University of California-San Francisco's Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland over an internship program designed to introduce "underrepresented minority high school students to health professions."

Attorney Andrew Quinio filed the suit, which argues that its plaintiff, a white teenager, was not accepted to the program after disclosing in an interview that she identified as white.

"From a legal standpoint, the issue that comes about from all this is: How do you choose diversity without running afoul of the Constitution?" Quinio said. "For those who want diversity as a goal, it cannot be a goal that is achieved with discrimination."

UC Health spokesperson Heather Harper declined to comment on the suit on behalf of the hospital system.

Another lawsuit filed in February accuses the University of California of favoring Black and Latino students over Asian American and white applicants in its undergraduate admissions. Specifically, the complaint states that UC officials pushed campuses to use a "holistic" approach to admissions and "move away from objective criteria towards more subjective assessments of the overall appeal of individual candidates."

The scrutiny of that approach to admissions could threaten diversity at the UC-Davis School of Medicine, which for years has employed a "race-neutral, holistic admissions model" that reportedly tripled enrollment of Black, Latino, and Native American students.

"How do you define diversity? Does it now include the way we consider how someone's lived experience may be influenced by how they grew up? The type of school, the income of their family? All of those are diversity," said Granberry Russell, of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. "What might they view as an unlawful proxy for diversity equity and inclusion? That's what we're confronted with."

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, recently joined other state attorneys general to issue guidance urging that schools continue their DEI programs despite the federal messaging, saying that legal precedent allows for the activities. California is also among several states suing the administration over its deep cuts to the Education Department.

If the recent decline in diversity among newly enrolled students holds or gets worse, it could have long-term consequences for patient care, academic experts said, pointing toward the vast racial disparities in health outcomes in the U.S., particularly for Black people.

A higher proportion of Black primary care doctors is associated with longer life expectancy and lower mortality rates among Black people, according to a 2023 study published by the JAMA Network.

Physicians of color are also more likely to build their careers in medically underserved communities, studies have shown, which is increasingly important as the AAMC projects a shortage of up to 40,400 primary care doctors by 2036.

"The physician shortage persists, and it's dire in rural communities," Poll-Hunter said. "We know that diversity efforts are really about improving access for everyone. More diversity leads to greater access to care — everyone is benefiting from it."

    Fifteen organisations from Ghana's healthcare sector will be participating in a UK roadshow from 17-21 March 2025.


The UK's Department for Business and Trade has today welcomed a delegation of 15 organisations from Ghana's healthcare sector for a four-city roadshow aimed at strengthening trade partnerships and development opportunities.

The delegation, visiting the UK from 17-21 March 2025, includes representatives from the Ghanaian government, private health facilities, pharmaceutical and medical equipment distributors, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

The visit will strengthen the existing healthcare collaboration between the UK and Ghana, which already spans research and training, knowledge and expertise transfer, investment, and healthcare systems strengthening.

His Majesty's Trade Commissioner (HMTC) for Africa, John Humphrey, who is leading the UK delegation, said:

The UK is committed to strengthening its economic ties with Africa, and Ghana is a key partner in this effort as we partner together to unlock growth, jobs, trade, investment, and opportunities in our economies.

The UK is committed to strengthening its economic ties with Africa, and Ghana is a key partner in this effort as we partner together to unlock growth, jobs, trade, investment, and opportunities in our economies.

The roadshow begins in London before continuing to Birmingham, Leeds, and Cardiff. Throughout the tour, Ghanaian delegates will meet with UK companies offering solutions and expertise that match Ghana's healthcare needs. This initiative aligns with the UK's commitment to strengthening economic ties with African nations and building capacity to address issues around supply chain disruption over the past years. By working together – we can get ahead of global shocks, mitigate their impact, and unlock new opportunities for growth between our two countries.

British High Commissioner to Ghana, H.E. Harriet Thompson said:

The UK and Ghana have enjoyed a long and consistent partnership on healthcare, enhancing the health services available to citizens as well as supporting opportunities for both British and Ghanaian businesses. This roadshow is an opportunity to deepen that partnership, harnessing our nations' collective expertise, innovation, experience and dynamism. I am confident that the visit will foster productive connections, paving the way for growth and prosperity between Ghana and the UK.

This visit presents a valuable opportunity for UK businesses to explore Ghana's growing healthcare market, while enabling Ghana to access the UK's expertise, products, and services in the sector.

The Department for Business and Trade looks forward to productive engagement between the delegations, leading to increased trade and collaboration in healthcare.

WASHINGTON — A small government agency responsible for putting medical products and services to practical use and making health care safe is feared to be the latest target for mass layoffs by the Trump administration. 

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has about 300 employees and a budget of $369 million, which is about 0.02% of what the government spends on health care. But AHRQ hasn't escaped the notice of the U.S. DOGE Service, which has been slashing agency payrolls and budgets across the government. Insiders say that DOGE aims to reduce AHRQ staff by 80% to 90%. That's based on what agency leaders were told by DOGE representatives at an in-person meeting on March 11, one current employee and one former employee said.

AHRQ does the kind of research that fits well with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to fight chronic disease, often by improving Americans' diets. During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he would be “working with AHRQ to hear their proposals on how they will make Americans healthy again.”

HONOLULU (Island News) -- "I'm originally from New Jersey. I've been on island for about six and a half years," said Keri Anacker.

Anacker is a school psychologist, who spent years in grad school for her specialist degree.

Now she works at a number of public schools assessing students for special education, then comes up with plans to help them.

Local lawmakers want to spend millions to attract and keep new healthcare professionals in Hawaii through a bill that forgives loans used when studying for their profession.

In her move to the islands, she brought more than just her belongings.

"I accumulated I want to say about a little under $30,000 in student loans," stated Anacker.

She said she would pay a little each month, but planned on paying for ten years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Instead, she signed up for a Hawaii program that nearly wiped it all away.

"I got awarded the money 2024. I had about $26,000 in student loan debt and they sent a check to my loan servicer for $25,500," said Anacker.

She is one of the nearly 900 healthcare workers, who took part in the loan repayment program over the past two years.

Now lawmakers want to set more money aside to help hundreds more Hawaii healthcare professionals.

"$30 million, that is $15 million in each of the next two years, which pays for the loans that people take out when they study to become doctors, nurses, physician assistants, social workers. This pays back the amount of money they took out in loans up to $50,000," said Rep. Gregg Takayama.

The program is a popular one, with more than 1,300 people on the wait list, but it does come with an important requirement.

"As part of forgiving of their student loans, they have to agree to serve at least two years in a rural area, which in Hawaii is almost all of Hawaii. So we get back committed healthcare workers to serve in our community. That meets a real shortage we have of healthcare workers all across the board," added Takayama.

The House bill survived crossing over to the other side of the State Legislature, but now will be heard by the Senate Ways and Means committee, which reviews all bills with a financial impact.

For new healthcare workers like Anacker, the program has made a difference in her Hawaii career.

"Although this program didn't help bring me here, it's definitely helped to retain and keep me here," stated Anacker.

She is a such a fan of the program. She's also reached out to other current and former students, to let them know about the loan repayment program and encourage them to come to Hawaii.

"I'm hoping to bring more people to the island because of it. So I'm hoping to even recruit, more healthcare workers and mental health workers like myself," added Anacker.

With the shuttering of some services at East Ohio Regional Hospital, Southeast Healthcare Services has announced it will accept patients that may no longer have a new medical facility to go to.

TOPICS:

BELMONT COUNTY, Ohio — With the shuttering of some services at East Ohio Regional Hospital, Southeast Healthcare Services has announced it will accept patients that may no longer have a new medical facility to go to.

A Southeast representative also said it can provide transportation to and from appointments for these patients.

Assistant Medical Director Lance Littell said they've already seen an influx of patients and they are willing to take more.

"With the loss of East Ohio Regional Hospital and losing primary care there, we have one of our mobile voaches at our Martins Ferry office that sees patients three times a week,” he said. “We have plenty of openings in our St. Clairsville office, and even in Bellaire we can get anyone in that has lost their primary care position.”

If you have additional questions you're urged to contact the main office in St. Clairsville.

At a roundtable on Wednesday at Mott's Children's Hospital executives and medical professionals explained what this would mean for the people they serve and their hospital systems. There's disagreement among Senate Republicans over how far cuts should go.

(FOX 2) - A political fight is brewing in Washington over Medicaid and millions of Americans rely on it, but Republicans in Congress say cuts are needed. Democrats warn everyone will feel the pain.

Big picture view:

Senate Republicans are locked in closed-door discussions about potentially deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance lifeline relied on by millions of low-income Americans.

At stake: 

"He's just closed a thousand social security offices, he's firing 7,000 people working social security, making it harder for a senior who has no transportation, to get to a social security office. Now we are talking Medicaid. We're gonna fight like hell in the Congress," said Representative Debbie Dingell.

What they're saying:

At a roundtable on Wednesday at Mott's Children's Hospital, executives and medical professionals explained what this would mean for the people they serve and their hospital systems.

There's disagreement among Senate Republicans over how far cuts should go. 

The budget passed by House Republicans in February sets ambitious targets more than $800 billion in spending cuts. The Congressional Budget Office warns that protecting Medicare means Medicaid would face severe reductions.

By the numbers:

Medicare and Medicaid account for over 97% of the spending overseen by Congress's Energy and Commerce Committee. Nonpartisan budget analysis confirms that deep, damaging cuts to Medicaid are inevitable, unless Medicare is put on the chopping block. 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer says she is fighting hard for Medicaid.

"If cuts of this magnitude come out of the Republican controlled Congress, everyone of us will suffer. Everyone of us will pay a price for that," said Whitmer.

SAN DIEGO — Healthcare providers and parents raised concerns Wednesday about potential cuts to the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal.

They met with U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and U.S. Congresswoman Sara Jacobs at Rady Children's Hospital for a roundtable discussion. They vowed to fight back against potential cuts to Medicaid.

"As a health system, we see over 1.6 million pediatric visits a year," Patrick Frias, the CEO of Rady Children's Health, said. "When you think 50 percent of kids we serve are Medicaid beneficiaries, that's a significant proportion of our patients. We're talking about a lot of families and children that could be impacted by this."

The Trump administration has promised to slice $880 billion out of the next budget. Experts say that will mean major cuts to Medicaid, which funds Medi-Cal.

"It's not just a dollar figure, a percentage, a statistic when it comes to Medicaid, it's families. It's children," Senator Padilla said.

According to his office, 15 million Californians are enrolled in the program, which covers almost 40 percent of the state. It provides healthcare for low-income and disabled people.

Adelia Aguilar brought her 5-year-old daughter Delilah to Wednesday's discussion. Delilah was born with special needs. She is one of the more than 5 million kids enrolled in the state's Medi-Cal program. Her mom says being able to bring her daughter to Rady's for treatment has made a big difference in her life.

"If we wouldn't have this [enrollment in the Medi-Cal program], we wouldn't have this much progress with her right now," Aguilar said. "She knows how to use her words."

Opponents of the proposed cuts say they would have devastating effects on the healthcare system, straining services and raising healthcare costs for millions of Californians.

“Republicans are laying the groundwork to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid in order to pay for President Trump's tax cuts for billionaires,” Padilla said.

However, Republicans argue that one of the reasons the state's program is so expensive is due to a high enrollment of undocumented immigrants. 

"Our Republican colleagues like to talk about efficiency and cost savings," said Congresswoman Jacobs. "The fact of the matter is, you save $12 for every dollar you invest in preventative healthcare. That's exactly what we want to be doing because when people show up in the ER, we will be paying for it either way. This way we can assure it is the most efficient use of resources."

Senator Padilla said California isn't the only state dealing with budget issues when it comes to its Medicaid programs. He said it is due to a number of factors, including the rising cost of healthcare.

			Saudi restrictions on women's rights makes nation's financial support for mothers on tour deeply uncomfortable

When the Women's Tennis Association unveiled its maternity policy earlier this month, it was billed as a breakthrough moment for women's sport.

Under the scheme, players who pause their careers to have children will be able to access maternity leave for up to a year, while grants for fertility treatments, including egg-freezing and IVF, will also be made available. Those who become a parent via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption will also be entitled to two months of paid leave. Never before has such a comprehensive maternity policy been packaged together for female athletes.

The WTA estimates that the world's top 320 players will be eligible for the scheme, which those on the lower rungs of tennis's ranking ladder will no doubt welcome. It also claims it is an example of female empowerment.

Pioneering? Groundbreaking? Trailblazing? If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. The less celebratory fact is that the WTA's maternity scheme will be bankrolled entirely by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), marking a significant development in the multi-year partnership the organisation signed with the country's sovereign wealth fund in May last year. Forget the Saudi Pro League, LIV Golf and Fifa awarding the 2034 men's World Cup to the kingdom – this is the grossest example of sportswashing yet.

Nobody is disputing the WTA's intention here. No sportswoman should be disadvantaged for wanting to start a family and the organisation rightly wants to support mothers who compete on the tour. Victoria Azarenka, a representative on the WTA Players' Council who gave birth to her son Leo in 2016, described the news as “incredible” and claimed it would help normalise motherhood in sport. But there are also uncomfortable questions.

Any notion of progress is completely undermined by the WTA's dependence on a country that jails and tortures those who campaign for women's rights. On The Tennis Podcast (listen below), sports commentator Catherine Whitaker went as far as to claim the situation would not look out of place in The Handmaid's Tale, claiming female tennis players are now being used as “pawns” by the Saudi state.

When asked about the disconnect between employment benefits for women being so closely tied to a nation whose human-rights record for women and LGBTQ+ people has been heavily criticised by human rights groups, Portia Archer, the WTA's chief executive, was quick to swat away any controversy. “Questions about Saudi society are really not questions for me or the WTA,” was the pointed response she gave in a video interview. “They're questions for the Saudis to answer.”

Any element of truth to this was dwarfed by her ignorance. Saudi Arabia might have advanced women's rights in recent years – women in the country are eligible for 10 weeks of paid maternity leave – but by using Saudi Arabia's public money to position itself as a bastion of female empowerment, the WTA is complicit in the country's ongoing persecution of women. It is complicit in the kidnapping of women such as Manahel al-Otaibi, a 30-year-old fitness instructor and women's rights activist. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison for “terrorist offences” after posting photos of herself in a shopping mall without wearing an abaya, a traditional Saudi dress, on Snapchat.

Manahel's sister, Fawzia, who has been campaigning for her sister's release since she forcibly disappeared between November 2023 and January last year, expressed her indignation at the WTA's maternity scheme on social media.

While Saudi Arabia funds paid maternity leave for WTA players, my sister, a fitness trainer, Manahel remains imprisoned and tortured simply for being a woman who chose to live freely.Saudi Arabia doesn't support women—it buys global silence on its crimes against them… https://t.co/dMfDmqf4Tt pic.twitter.com/S3Rezjt8Y9

While official figures have not been disclosed, it is thought players who compete in 15 events a year on the WTA tour will be entitled to monthly maternity payments of up to $7,000 (£5,395). When you consider Saudi's PIF is valued at £712 billion – and at present around 20 mothers are competing on the circuit – the total sum of the scheme will hardly make a dent in the fund.

And where does this leave players such as Daria Kasatkina, currently ranked just outside the world's top 10, who came out publicly in July 2022? Given same-sex relationships in Mohammed bin Salman's nation are punishable by the death penalty under a system of Sharia law, it is a significant grey area. The WTA would not comment directly on the issue to Telegraph Sport, clarifying that the scheme would simply be available to “any eligible players”.

Tennis can skirt around the subject as much as it likes, but the jarring reality is this: the Saudi state stumping up the cash to fund players' maternity leave in an attempt to sanitise its public image and distract from its own human-rights abuses is deeply uncomfortable.

Tennis star Francisco Comesana was so desperate to light a cigarette, he did so courtside at the Miami Open. The Argentine had been competing against Michael Mmoh in a qualifying match when he was spotted taking a drag mid-match.

Comesana won the first set against the American, with the 24-year-old retiring to his seat in Miami for a quick cigarette break. What's more, Comesana even had the cheek to ask the umpire if he could light it for him.

Speaking to the official, Comesana asked: “Excuse me, do you have a light.” Unsurprisingly, the umpire remained unmoved by the request.

It proved a good luck charm for Comesana, who went on to beat Mmoh in straight sets, securing a 6-3, 6-4 victory. As a result, he progressed into the second qualifying match, which he also won, this time against Shintaro Mochizuki. Comesana beat the Japanese ace 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 to move into the main draw.

However, the cigarette-wielding tennis star would see his tournament come to an end in the first round proper when he was paired up against teenage sensation Federico Cina. It wasn't for a lack of trying on Comesana's part, as Cina needed deciders in both sets, eventually winning the match 6-7 (4-7), 6-7 (2-7).

With the win, Cina became the first player born in 2007 to win an ATP 1000 tournament, with the Italian reflecting on his epic victory by saying: “I'm very happy. It was very difficult. But I'm very happy to win. I started the match very good, played a very good tie-break. Then in the second set, I was [ahead] 5-2, then I got cramps. But it was very good to stay there every point.”

The 17-year-old comes from a tennis-loving family and is coached by his father Francesco - an ex-coach to Italian tennis star Roberta Vinci. Francesco, who also runs a tennis academy in Palermo, said of his son: “Federico really likes this life and doesn't feel the pressure at the moment; he enjoys doing what he loves.

“Federico feels better on clay and hard courts, but overall he prefers to play on hard court. He needs to improve his serve, and this will happen with physical growth. During preparation, we worked well on this fundamental, and I am sure that in the coming months he will be able to serve even better. His forehand is showing great improvements, while his two-handed backhand remains his best shot."

Cina faces the biggest game of his fledgling career against Grigor Dimitrov in Miami on Friday.

Something went wrong

Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz insists he does not support legal action taken against the ATP and WTA Tours by Novak Djokovic's Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA).

The PTPA this week brought lawsuits “on behalf of the entire player population” against tennis chiefs, alleging that they abused their dominant position to the detriment of players' welfare.

Comments made by Alcaraz to the media appear in documents supporting the legal action but the Spaniard says he wasn't aware of it and doesn't endorse it.

“It was surprising for me, because no one had told me about it,” said the four-time Grand Slam winner.

“There are things I agree with and there are other things I don't agree with. The main thing is I don't support what was done.

“Yesterday I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn't aware of it. I honestly don't support that letter, because I wasn't aware of it.”

The PTPA, which was founded by Djokovic, hopes to force reform by suing the men's and women's elite tours, the International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency, which manages anti-doping efforts in the game.

Djokovic is not named as one of the 12 plaintiffs, which include co-founder and former player Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios, but is “certainly very involved”, PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar has said. Alcaraz is not among the dozen.

It wants more prize money, which it says is suppressed by collusion between the tours and tournament organisers, and a shorter season to replace the “unsustainable” current 11-month calendar.

The PTPA also takes issue with the methods employed by the ITIA, including “invasive searches of personal devices and random middle-of-the-night drug tests”.

It says it has brought the legal action in the US, EU and UK after becoming frustrated with attempts to achieve change through talks.

The tours have vowed to defend themselves, with the ATP calling the action “entirely without merit” and the WTA labelling it “both regrettable and misguided”.

Venus Williams is a five-time Wimbledon singles champion and won the US Open singles twice

At the end of March, Venus Williams will lose her world ranking and her page on the WTA Tour website will turn from purple to grey.

The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion will be considered an inactive player, having gone a whole year without competing.

But that status may not last long. The feeling persists that the American icon is not yet ready for retirement.

A wildcard for Indian Wells was announced but then swiftly declined. A "miscommunication" was the reason given.

Sources say Williams was then offered a wildcard for the Miami Open, which began on Tuesday and was the venue of her last match.

The 44-year-old thought about it for a couple of days - although it was no great surprise when she turned it down.

However, the Florida resident did take to the practice court there on Wednesday for a session with Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.

Indian Wells and Miami were the only two tournaments Williams played last year. 

Her last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that.

The last time Williams played a full schedule was 2019. 

It was some achievement to do so in the year she turned 39, having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, external - an autoimmune condition which can cause fatigue and joint pain - a few years earlier.

But turning 45 - which she will do just two weeks before Wimbledon on 17 June - is historically not a barrier to competing on tour. After all, Martina Navratilova won a singles match at the All England Club aged 47. 

Should Williams request a wildcard for either Wimbledon, where she is a five-time singles champion, or for the US Open, where she won the singles title twice, it seems unlikely it would be rejected.

Fashion is a big part of Williams' life and she was at Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago - one of the reasons she did not play in Indian Wells.

She owns the interior design company V Starr but, even though more than 30 years have passed since her professional debut, many feel she will attempt a final foray into professional tennis.

It is possible Williams, who is ranked number 1,151, will never retire. 

Former US Open and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has not played since Wimbledon 2021, but is yet formally to call it a day. 

Venus' sister Serena, meanwhile, did not like the word retirement, preferring instead  to "evolve away from the sport" in September 2022.

Serena's name does, however, appear on the International Tennis Integrity Agency's retired players list. 

Joining that list is a strong commitment to retiring, as any player who later changes their mind must make themselves available for drug testing for six months before returning to play.

It means Venus could still expect a visit from out-of-competition testers. But she no longer needs to submit details of her daily whereabouts as she was removed from the international registered testing pool last June - a usual process for singles players who drop out of the world's top 100.

Williams has not played frequently enough to qualify as either a full or associate member of the WTA Tour this year, but she has also not completed a WTA retirement form. 

To play again she would need to fill out an annual player form and find a $250 administration fee from the nearly $43m of prize money she has earned. 

Her management team did not respond to a request for information about her plans and it seems Williams will keep us guessing a little longer. Any ideas she might have for the summer have not been widely shared within the sport.

Many retirement tributes have been written and signed off a long time ago.

They may still need updating.

Alcaraz says he was unaware of the lawsuit before seeing the statements on social media

World number three Carlos Alcaraz said he does not support the legal action being taken against tennis' governing bodies by the players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic.

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) filed papers on Tuesday criticising the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights.

The lawsuit seeks an end to what it describes as "monopolistic control" of the tennis tour, as well as financial compensation from the ATP, the WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

"It was surprising for me, because no one had told me about it," Alcaraz, 21, told reporters at the Miami Open.

"There are things I agree with and there are other things I don't agree with. The main thing is I don't support what was done."

The ATP Tour, the men's professional body, has been critical of the advocacy group, saying it was guilty of "division and distraction" while the WTA, which oversees the women's tour, called the lawsuit "regrettable and misguided".

Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing

The complaint is being brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Djokovic's co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios. They say the action is acting "on behalf of the entire player population".

The lawsuit has accused governing bodies of disregarding player welfare and included a quote from four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz, who criticised the hectic calendar last September.

"Yesterday I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn't aware of it. I honestly don't support that letter, because I wasn't aware of it," Alcaraz said.

Formed in 2020, the PTPA wants to increase the amount of control players to run the game and reduce the role of the governing bodies.

It says the governing bodies act as a "cartel" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money. It has also described the ranking points system as "draconian".

 This marks their second consecutive championship win for Team America

Team America emerged victorious in the 2025 Rainbow Nations Challenge, successfully defending their title in a thrilling competition at the Accra Lawn Tennis Club.

This marks their second consecutive championship win in the prestigious tournament.

"It's a great feeling. This is the second time we have won this tournament—two in a row—and it took a lot of effort on our part," a member of Team America said after their victory.

The team endured a demanding schedule, playing nine matches over two days. Adverse weather conditions on Thursday, March 13, 2025, forced delays, compressing the schedule into a single intense day of competition.

"We played a total of nine matches, which is a lot to fit into two days. Unfortunately, we got rained out on Thursday and had to play everything today. But we had a lot of fun—it's a great tournament and a fantastic way to network," the player added.

The Rainbow Nations Tennis Tournament, now in its fourth edition, continues to foster sportsmanship, unity, and community development.

This year's event featured 56 players from 23 countries, reflecting the tournament's growing reputation as a global sporting spectacle.

With another thrilling edition in the books, teams will now look ahead to 2026, hoping to challenge Team America's dominance and etch their names into the tournament's history.

Stassi Schroeder‘s return to reality TV is one of the highlights in the Vanderpump Villa trailer — but we also have questions about Marciano Brunette‘s flirty moments with a MomToker.

Hulu released the first look at season 2 on Thursday, March 20, where Stassi, 36, was seen reuniting with Lisa Vanderpump nearly five years after Stassi's time on Vanderpump Rules.

“Remember when I used to tell you don't get involved in other people's business? Well now, I want you to do the exact opposite,” Lisa, 64, tells Stassi about being her “eyes and ears” at the castle, to which she replied, “I'm excited to stick my nose in business where it doesn't belong.”

Luckily there is plenty for Stassi to keep track of — including a flirtationship between Marciano Brunette and Demi Engemann. The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star makes an appearance in Italy alongside Jen Affleck, Jessi Ngatikaura, Layla Taylor and Mikayla Matthews.



The teaser shows Demi asking Marciano if he was allowed to make a move on the guests. In one scene, Marciano acknowledges the “an instant connection” between them — despite her being married to Bret Engemann.

Demi and Marciano later share an intimate hug. “There's still so much unresolved. It's been up and down, up and down,” Demi tells Marciano, who replies, “Are you living with regret?”

Outside of keeping track of the cast of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,. Stassi is seen arguing with husband Beau Clark. “You feel safe with me, I can make you feel unsafe,” Stassi tells Beau after one of the staff members at the château found himself stuck in the middle.

Stassi joined Vanderpump Villa as part of a larger deal with Hulu that includes her own show, Stassi Says. The half-hour docu-comedy is currently in development.

“Endlessly relatable, utterly hysterical and questionably sane, Stassi is the anchor of a fresh ensemble of comedic and chaotic characters who are dealing with identity crises and major life crossroads of their own — and Stassi's the one who has to keep them all afloat,” read the synopsis for the series, which was announced in August 2024.

Vanderpump Villa, meanwhile, is a Hulu reality series set in Lisa's luxury French villa, Château Rosabelle. The show, which originally debuted in 2024, highlights the staff as they live and work together while catering to their high-profile guests.

Despite their similarities, Lisa previously told Us Weekly that the series was not a copy of Vanderpump Rules.

“It is not Vanderpump Rules because it's more immersive and it's got guests and it's kind of more decadent in a way,” she explained in March 2024. “It is a little bit of Below Deck [with] that upstairs, downstairs feel. But it doesn't feel as tight as Below Deck.”

The restaurateur also discussed the challenges that came with filming, telling Us, “When you are in the middle of the French countryside, you've got people that have filled positions. If they get it wrong, you can't say, ‘OK, go home. You are out, you're suspended.' Because there are 12 jobs and I need 12 people to do them. So there was a lot of push and pull. It is a lot of fun. There's definitely a real feel-good factor to [the show], but it is complicated.”

Vanderpump Villa returns to Hulu on Thursday, April 24.

Netflix is hosting a Willy Wonka-inspired competition TV show!

The streamer announced The Golden Ticket, inspired by the Wonka universe, and casting is now underway.

Here's a synopsis: "Lucky contestants will have the chance to enter Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but there's a catch—only players who find a coveted golden ticket will gain entry to the factory. But a golden ticket doesn't guarantee a sweet ride once the gates open; only those who can adapt, strategize, and withstand the unknown will make it through. Set inside a retro-futuristic dreamscape, this high-stakes social experiment will challenge players not just physically, but mentally as they navigate games, tests, and temptations designed to probe their instincts, resilience, and ability to thrive in chaos."

Stephen Collins is the latest subject of an Investigation Discovery special — but which of his former 7th Heaven costars were willing to address his child sexual abuse?

The actor became a household name after booking the role of Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven, which ran from 1996 to 2007. The ensemble cast also included Jessica Biel, Barry Watson, Beverley Mitchell, David Gallagher, Mackenzie Rosman and Catherine Hicks.

Seven years after the show ended, Collins made headlines when TMZ published an audio recording from a marriage counseling session with his then-wife, Faye Grant, where he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls.

“I'm a flawed person,” Collins said in an interview with Katie Couric at the time. “In the church, it's actually one of the things I love about the church … It's really one of the main things about the Christian faith. Christ said in so many ways, ‘Bring me that … which about you is broken, bring it,' and most people are broken in some way.”



He continued: “Most people get to, or have to, or choose to hide it. This came out. I didn't choose this to come out. I didn't want to have to deal with these things publicly. … I had dealt with them very, very strongly, and committedly, in my private life, but I think I'm a human being with flaws and I've done everything I can to address it.”

Investigation Discovery's six-part Hollywood Demons special, which airs on Monday, March 24, reached out to “more than 100 contacts” of Collins' and “nearly everyone declined to participate or did not respond.” (A producer in a voiceover stated that only men agreed to speak with them about their experience with Collins.)

In the doc, the Founding President of Programming at the WB Network Garth Ancier was asked whether any allegations were brought up against Collins by his 7th Heaven costars, to which he replied, “No. There was nothing and it just didn't happen. I would see it.”

Ancier noted that the show prioritized keeping the children on set safe.”There are lots of safety rails when you have kids on a show,” he added. “For minors there are always people on set who are teachers, I got the sense this was a really protected set.”

Collins didn't participate in the doc. “Stephen Collins now lives with a woman who is 40 years younger than him. She was a super fan,” Dr. Drew Pinsky claimed in the special. “The age difference — given what we know about his history — certainly raises an eyebrow. Let's hope he can commit to this woman and not perpetrate on others.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of which 7th Heaven stars addressed their history with Collins before Hollywood Demons premieres on Monday, March 24, on ID at 9 p.m. EST:

London, who played Chandler for 37 episodes, described Collins as “not only one of the finest actors but one of the finest human beings in Hollywood.” In addition to addressing his own legal problems, London and his fellow costar Kyle Searles watched Collins' interview with Couric after they both admitted to not having seen it at the time.

“What I noticed about Stephen Collins working with young girls and extra is I didn't notice a damn thing,” London told the cameras after being asked about his experience with Collins on set. “It never crossed any lines of any kind.”

For 27 episodes of 7th Heaven, Searles played the role of Mac. He admitted in the ID special that he originally admired Collins as a mentor, saying, “He showed me what I wanted to be as a professional actor and how you treat people and how you present yourself. That is why it was even more of a shock to hear what ended up happening.”

Searles noted that he potentially put Collins “on a professional pedestal a bit too much” after seeing the disgraced actor's comments about his child abuse scandal.

“This is the first time that I've ever thought that he is full of s—t. No, I am not satisfied with this,” Searles explained to producers. “I have like a knot in my stomach. My whole world changed when I had kids of my own — my whole world view changed and certainly my tolerance for this.”

Hollywood Demons featured some insight into Mitchell's alleged perspective on the scandal through her “personal friend” Dr. Drew.

“She never reported any issues to me,” he shared. “He was a nice guy. He is a smart dude. He is engaging and interesting and charming. He is all of those things and he was engaged in some monstrous behavior.”

Six months before the ID special, Mitchell, Gallagher and Rosman addressed Collins' legal drama ahead of a new episode of their “Catching Up with the Camdens” podcast.

“Before we get into this episode, we want you to know that we see all of your comments and we know how excited you all are for the rewatch, so that's exactly what we're going to do,” said Mitchell, who played Lucy Camden, said at the start of the September 2024 episode. “But before we get into that, we do think it's important that we say something about Stephen Collins.”

Gallagher, who played Simon Camden, added: “All forms of abuse, sexual abuse of any kind, it's inexcusable. And victims of abuse need to be shown compassion and they should be given support.”

Mitchell assured fans that Collins “will not be joining us on this podcast” before Rosman added, “As we rewatch these episodes, it would be impossible not to talk about Stephen because he was such a big part of the show and our lives. But we want to be clear, we did not have any inappropriate experiences with Stephen.”

Amaal Malik has shared a long post on Instagram revealing the dark side of his family life. 'I have changed the story of being called xyz's nephew or son, combined with my brother's singing ability, to whatever we are today! This journey has been amazing for both of us, but my parents' actions have distanced us brothers from each other. All this has forced me to take steps for myself, as it has left a very deep scar in my heart,' his note read. 

The singer-composer further added, 'Today I stand at a point where my peace has been taken away. I am emotionally and probably financially broken, but that is the least of my worries. What really matters is that I am clinically depressed due to these events. Yes, I can only blame myself, but my self-esteem has been lowered countless times by the actions of people close to me who have stolen pieces of my soul.'





Amaal breaks ties with his family

'Today with a heavy heart I announce that I am moving away from these personal relationships. From now on my interaction with my family will be purely professional. This is not a decision taken in anger, but it has arisen from the need to fix my life. I will not let the past rob my future now. I will rebuild my life with honesty and strength,' read Amaal's note. 

Amal's brother got married two months ago

It is known that Amal's brother Armaan Malik married Aashna Shroff in January this year. Both dated each other for 6 years before tying the knot. Amaal presence at the wedding was a positive one. But just after two months, such a note has a shocked the internet.

The Last of Us is making sure season 2 will be accessible to as many fans as possible.

The drama series will be available to stream in American Sign Language, Max announced on Wednesday.

The first season of the show will also be made available to stream in ASL starting on March 31. This will make it possible for interested fans to catch up on season 1 in time for the season 2 premiere on April 13.

The ASL versions of The Last of Us will be performed by CODA star Daniel Durant and Leila Hanaumi.

This makes Max the first streaming service to offer ASL versions of a major series alongside its premiere episode. It is also the first time original HBO programming will be available to stream in ASL on the platform.

Max previously offered ASL versions of several Warner Bros. movies, including Barbie, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.

“We are thrilled to expand our ASL program and debut our first HBO Original series in ASL with The Last of Us,” Naomi Waibel, SVP of global product management at Warner Bros. Discovery, said. “This debut brings the show to life in an authentic and fully accessible way for Deaf audiences and is another meaningful step towards our goal of offering an inclusive streaming experience.”

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey return as Joel and Ellie in season 2 of The Last of Us. Set five years after the first season, "Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind," according to season 2's official logline.

Season 2 also stars Gabriel Luna, Rutina Wesley, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, Young Mazino, Ariela Barer, Tati Gabrielle, Spencer Lord, Danny Ramirez, Jeffrey Wright and Catherine O'Hara.

The Handmaid's Tale cast and fans alike are preparing to say goodbye to the show during its sixth and final season.

Based on Margaret Atwood's novel of the same name, The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a dystopian future where low fertility rates have led women to be assigned to men for bearing children. Elisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski, Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd, O-T Fagbenle, Max Minghella, Samira Wiley and Amanda Brugel have led the cast since the show premiered in 2017.

The series also became a critical success with multiple award nominations over the years. The Handmaid's Tale notably was the first show produced by Hulu to win a major award and the first series on a streaming network to win an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.

Despite The Handmaid's Tale coming to an end, the universe is expanding with Atwood's 2019 novel The Testaments. It was previously announced that Hulu and MGM were developing the sequel series but there hasn't been any more news yet.



Keep scrolling for everything we know so far about season 6 of The Handmaid's Tale:

The Handmaid's Tale was renewed in 2022 shortly before season 5 premiered. Filming, however, got delayed due to the dual SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and Moss' real-life pregnancy.

Disney TV boss Craig Erwich told Deadline in 2024 that production would start over the summer, and the final season will premiere one year later. Hulu confirmed that the show would return with three episodes on April 8th and continue to release new episodes leading up to the May 27th finale.

The main cast mentioned above are expected to return alongside recurring actors Bradley Whitford, Sam Jaeger and Ever Carradine. Ahead of season 6, Josh Charles was cast as a series regular while Timothy Simons andD'Arcy Carden joined as a guest star but details about their characters was not immediately released.

Alexis Bledel is not expected to return after she left ahead of season 5.

The fifth season ended with June (Moss) and Serena Joy (Strahovski) both fleeing Toronto for Vancouver.

Amid the growing anti-refugee movement in Toronto, June was targeted by a hit-and-run driver and her husband, Luke (Fagbenle), brutally attacked the assailant. The Gilead supporter, a native Canadian, didn't survive his injuries, and June and Luke knew that the attention and threats to their safety would only get worse. They decide to leave for Vancouver, but authorities at the train station were already looking for Luke. He convinced June to get on the train without him, taking baby Nichole with her. June is surprised to find Serena (with baby Noah) asking her for a diaper.

It isn't clear what happens next — and the book that served as inspiration hasn't been a big help with predicting the show's ending. Atwood's novel wrapped up with the protagonist Offred — whose real name was never revealed — being taken away in a van.

After the first season adapted the entire book, Hulu's version went beyond what was on the page. Where Serena and June go from here is anyone's guess.

“June is going to figure out who she is and who she's going to be for the rest of her life,” Moss told Elle in November 2022 about her character's potential story lines for the final season.

Moss teased that the final season centers on a fight that “is not just about one individual.” According to Moss, fans shouldn't expect a happy ending, adding, “I don't think we feel an obligation to tie up the entire story of Gilead.”

Showrunner Bruce Miller has been with The Handmaid's Tale since it debuted in 2017. Before season 6, Miller offered a glimpse at his vision for the show's ending.

“We are ending our show on our own creative terms,” he told Entertainment Weekly in 2022. “Do I know what happens in season 6? Yes, I did think about the stuff that happens in season 6 for a while.”

However, Miller stepped down as showrunner in 2023. He is expected to remain a writer and executive producer but passed on his duties to executive producers Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang.

Hulu released the first look at the sixth and final season of the beloved series in March 2025 where June was seen returning to Gilead.”For years, we have been afraid of them,” June said. “Now it is time for them to be afraid of us.”

Elsewhere in the trailer, Serena seemed to play a big role as she switched from the signature dark blue to a light periwinkle ensemble — and it seems like she's walking down the aisle in a wedding dress. The other surprising moments included Luke Bankole going into Gilead, June and Nick kissing and Aunt Lydia trying to save Janine (Madeline Brewer), who seems to be working as a Jezebel.

Nashville came out in full force to honor Dolly Parton at the Opry 100 celebration.

NBC aired the live special on Wednesday, March 19. It featured a rousing performance of the Parton hit “I Will Always Love You” by Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Lady A and around 50 members of the Opry's choir. 

Earlier this month, Parton's husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean, died at the age of 82.

“Everybody here at the Opry and around the world wants to send you our thoughts and prayers,” McEntire, 69, said from the stage. “And you gotta know, we will always love you.”



In addition to the star-studded group tribute, Carly Pearce performed “Jolene” in homage to Parton, telling the crowd, “Dolly Parton is my hero, and it means so much to me that she invited me to join the Opry. Dolly, I just want you to know that my heart goes out to you and your family, and it is my great honor to sing my favorite Dolly song tonight.”

Meanwhile, Parton appeared in a taped message.

“Well hello, I am Dolly Parton and I am a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry,” she said. “And I am so sorry that I can't be there with everybody in person, but of course you know my heart is with you and my spirit is with you.”

Us Weekly caught up with Pearce, 34, ahead of the event, where she exclusively recalled the day that Parton invited her to become an Opry member.

“That was probably the most surprised I've ever been in my life,” the country singer told Us. “When you think of the Opry and you think of invitations to be a member, they usually happen on stage at the Opry.”

On June 17, 2021, Pearce thought she was participating in a commercial for Dollywood after previously working at the theme park. When Parton walked around the corner and introduced herself, everything changed for Pearce.

“I was, of course, shocked, but I thought that we were doing this Dollywood commercial together,” she joked. “And I heard her say the word ‘Opry' several times in 30 seconds. I can only equate it to how a girl feels when she thinks she's getting engaged — of just like, ‘Can you just say it? Is this what's happening?'”

“I had this moment of just, ‘Oh, my goodness,'” Pearce continued. “And when she said it, I just fell to the floor, literally.”

Gina Gershon had no hesitation reuniting with John Travolta for their new film High Rollers — especially after the pair had such an incredible time working together on the cult classic Face/Off.

“[John] was just as easy and professional and kind and fun to work with as he was when I was doing Face/Off,” Gershon, 62, exclusively told Us Weekly. “[But] I think in Face/Off we sang a little bit more. We had more time during setup, so I really liked it when we'd sing whatever musicals …There was a lot of time to kill.”

Gershon portrayed Sasha in John Woo's 1997 sci-fi flick, the ex-girlfriend of terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). While Gershon told Us much of her screen time was spent with Cage, 61, she still got to know Travolta behind the scenes — and their mutual love of music brought them closer together.

“I just remember singing [with him],” Gershon recalled. “We were just goofing around and then we started riffing on something and I thought, ‘Oh my God, I'm singing with John Travolta. This is heaven.' You know what I mean? It was really fun.”



Her role on screen, of course, was just as fulfilling. Gershon noted that she “loved” working with Woo because he was open to hearing her ideas, making the experience ultimately feel more “collaborative.”

“My part wasn't really completely what it turned out to be, and I kept adding stuff here and there with the writer's permission,” she explained. “I said, ‘Guys, can I just throw some stuff out?' And I would go [and] work on [it] a little bit, and I would show it to John and he would like it, or he didn't like a couple ideas, but at least I felt comfortable enough to throw it out there, and he would say yes or no. So it felt very collaborative.”

With all the fond memories of the cast and crew, would she return for a Face/Off sequel? Paramount did, after all, previously tap Adam Wingard to direct a follow up film in 2022. The answer is a resounding “yes” from Gershon, despite her character seemingly being killed off in the OG film's final moments.

“I mean, we see her kind of dead, [but if] she miraculously didn't die, I would love to. I would join, are you kidding?” she told Us. “John Woo, one of my favorite directors to work with, Nic and John and Joan [Allen] and everyone again? In two seconds.”

Outside the Face/Off universe, Gershon has yet to reunite with Woo — but she and Cage teamed up again for 2017's Inconceivable. Now, she and Travolta are back together for High Rollers, a sequel to 2024's Cash Out.

“My manager, who actually happens to be John's manager as well, she told me … ‘I talked to John about you and John loves you,” Gershon recalled about how the project came about. “He would love you to do this [movie with him]. … We hadn't seen each other in a long time, and it felt like we were old pals.”

Gershon portrays Travolta's wife, Ameila, in the film, a former FBI informant who is kidnapped and used as leverage in a high stakes casino heist. Travolta, meanwhile, reprises his role as Mason Goddard, a master thief on a mission to save the love of his life. Although separated from Mason and the rest of his crew for the majority of the film, Amelia is a key figure in the story — and a character that allowed Gershon to dive into her love for stunt work.

“I love doing as many stunts myself as I can, just because I enjoy the physicality of it,” Gershon told Us. “I always probably want to do way more stunts than they actually let me, and I'm always like, ‘No, no, really, I'm really good at this. Let me.' I have to convince them to be in the middle of all the mayhem.”

Gershon's love for living on the edge certainly translates to the characters she plays on screen, as the actress is known for her portrayal of “strong women.”  While Gershon is proud of that fact, she would be interested in exploring a new facet of her typical archetype.

“I would love to play a completely fragile, meek person trying to survive,” she told Us. “I think I enjoy playing survivors more than victims just because I don't like to watch that. I mean, [my High Rollers] character, [Amelia], she was strong to begin with. She's been training and that's been her job, but … It would be fun to play someone who's really not strong in that same way, but yet they have to survive and they do.”

High Rollers is now playing in theaters, on demand and digital.

The Masked Singer is back!

A new episode of season 13 of the hit FOX singing competition series aired on Wednesday night (March 19).

The show, which began in South Korea, features celebrities singing songs while wearing costumes and face masks concealing their identities until they're eliminated. Throughout the season, the contestants provide clues to try and help the judges and fans figure out who is under the mask.

This season includes the new costumed character Detective Lucky Duck, who will help panelists "uncover who's behind each mask."

During the episode, Group B contestants Boogie Woogie, Griffin, and Pearl gave their latest performances of the season.

While on stage, Boogie Woogie performed "Something in the Water" by Carrie Underwood.

OUR GUESS: Andy Grammer

Over the years, Andy has shared several videos of himself showing off his juggling skills and all of the magician clues can be a reference to his song "Magic." Andy's dad is folk singer best known for his music for kids, whose album Teaching Peace is considered one of the top children's recordings of all time. The heads up a quarter can also be a reference to Andy's song "Keep Your Head Up." He previously shared that his song "Saved My Life" saved his godmother while she was going through a very difficult time in her life. Andy's mom died of breast cancer in 2009. His mom co-wrote Teaching Peace with his dad and she was also a special education teacher. Andy performed the national anthem before Game 1 of the 2015 World Series, and again before Game 6 of the 2022 World Series, which would connect with the World Series clue.

The Shifting Gears season finale was teasing a romantic moment between Kat Dennings and Seann William Scott — so imagine our surprise when it was Tim Allen and Jenna Elfman who ended up sharing a kiss.

During the Wednesday, March 19, episode titled “Kiss,” Gabriel (Scott) prepared for Riley (Dennings) to potentially reconcile with her ex. Riley didn't, but she wasn't ready for something new either so Gabriel didn't make a move. Instead, in the final moments of the finale, Eve (Elfman) surprised Matt (Allen) after an entire episode of banter by kissing him.

“I thought it was a really fun twist because it seems like of course it's going to be Riley and Gabriel,” Dennings, 38, exclusively told Us Weekly. “But it was a real surprise.”

Dennings and Scott, 48, agreed that the romantic finale moment made more sense for Eve and Matt‘s relationship, with her adding, “It's a surprise kiss for Tim Allen's character. But I feel like Eve got a little liquid courage in that moment to do that — maybe she wasn't planning on it. I think it's a great moment.”



Earlier this season, Elfman, 53, joined the cast in a recurring role as a potential love interest for Allen, 71. The actress told Us that she was excited to see how the hit ABC sitcom would approach a show where Allen wasn't married on screen after his past projects, including Home Improvement and Last Man Standing, paired the actor with a wife.

“You're going to see more of the dynamic between Matt and Eve,” Elfman teased in February. “Just more forthright communication, opinions and exchange. You get to see people being their full selves in each other's face. It's really fun.”

Elfman went on to praise Allen for being a perfect scene partner. “He's so confident as a comedic actor. He's just confident and I'm confident and we don't care if something [doesn't land],” she noted to Us at the time. “When you've been doing it long enough, you're not paranoid about a joke not working and you don't care. There's no preciousness and there's enough confidence to support the exploration of the scene of humor.”

While viewers got an idea of what is to come for Eve and Matt, Riley and Gabriel's future is a bit more unclear for now.

“Riley is literally hours out of her marriage. She should really pull it back a little bit,” Dennings joked to Us about how long it could take for Riley and Gabriel to get together. “She's been separated for a long time and she hasn't been emotionally in this relationship. But still, she just got out of a very long relationship.”

She continued: “She also really loves Gabriel as a friend. So I think there's lots of reasons for the slow burn.”

Riley and Gabriel might not be a couple anytime soon — but Dennings and Scott have been having a blast as scene partners.

“We get along. We instantly really hit it off and got along and we have a lot of things in common and I really help you with your phone a lot,” she quipped, to which Scott added, “When we were shooting, it's one thing. When we're not shooting, we became friends right away and I immediately was like, ‘Oh wow, this is a huge gift.' Not only do I get to do this show but it came with just a really important dear friend for life. I don't think I've ever experienced it before where I was like, ‘Oh wow, we do have chemistry.'”

Shifting Gears is currently streaming on Hulu.

New Jersey Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald is making changes on the rink after his son's neck was sliced by an ice skate during a hockey game.

“They rushed him right into the locker room. All we got was, ‘The bleeding is under control and he's on his way to the hospital,'” Fitzgerald, 56, said in an interview with ESPN published on Tuesday, March 18. “And they had a team of 12 or 14 people waiting for him when he got there. My wife was a mess. But I was cautiously optimistic because he had stayed on the ice. I don't wish that on any parent.”

Tom's son Casey Fitzgerald is the captain of the Hartford Wolf Pack which is an NHL developmental team for the New York Rangers. During a December 2024 game, Casey got tied up in a play. While the injury wasn't apparent at first, when Casey was getting off the ice an opposing player pointed out his neck was bleeding.

“They were showing [the play] and there was another angle I was told. I didn't want to see that angle,” Tom recalled. “The only angle I saw was the one I [previously] watched and you couldn't really see [the cutting]. The more I talked, the more I started getting choked up a bit just thinking how lucky we are. I'm getting choked up now. It's tough. I don't want any parent to go through it. You just don't understand. You can't understand.”



Casey ended up getting 25 stitches and made a full recovery. He returned to the rink three days later. While Casey is fine now, Tom has a new perspective. The hockey executive doesn't want any other parent to go through what his family did.

“We're very lucky,” Tom shared. “But why the players don't think big picture versus just, it's about [their] career today? If they ever thought of their parents watching what we watched, they'd think differently.”

Since the incident, Tom has taken action to help prevent the safety issue. Tom is the sole hockey GM on the NHL's cut resistant committee. In addition to Tom, the group includes NHL's Senior VP of Hockey Operations Kris King, VP of Hockey Operations Rod Pasma, members of the NHL Players' Association and team equipment managers.

As a member of the committee, Tom has helped come up with ideas on how to protect players.

“The first thing I thought about was the chin guard,” Tom explained. “If you can mandate players to at least have the two-finger rule [of coverage below their chins], would a Kevlar chin guard have stopped [the worst of it for Casey]? I don't know if it would have prevented all of it, but just ideas like that. And there's a prototype being made as we speak.”

“My message was just, ‘Tell the players you don't want your parents potentially going through something like this,'” he told the outlet. “[It's] scary. Put as much protection on as you possibly can because you're going to stop playing at some point, and you're going to have to live the rest of your life. So live it.”
