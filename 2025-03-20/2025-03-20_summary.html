Senate and House committee chairs warn against plan for US to relinquish command of Nato forces in Europe “Therefore, we are very concerned about reports that claim DoD is considering unilateral changes on major strategic issues, including significant reductions to US forces stationed abroad, absent coordination with the White House and Congress. Such moves risk undermining American deterrence around the globe and detracting from our negotiating positions with America's adversaries.” Trump has already floated the idea of refusing to defend any Nato member that is attacked – an obligation enshrined under Nato's article five – if it is deemed to have fallen short of its defence spending commitments. It represents a jarring departure from Republicans' meek acceptance of White House encroachment on congressional prerogatives over spending in the two months since Trump returned to office, which has seen Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” impose brutal cuts on government.</p>

So there is no rule of law,” her mother said, breaking off to join in chants demanding the government resign. İmamoğlu and more than 100 others were ordered to be detained in two separate cases brought by the Istanbul prosecutor's office. The justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, rebuffed suggestions that İmamoğlu's arrest was politicised, and labelled calls for street protests as “disinformation”. The 53-year-old mayor, who swept into office on a wave of popular support in 2019, defying efforts to annul his first victory and later a political ban, is widely seen as Erdoğan's nemesis and his only true challenger. On Thursday, hundreds of university students held a peaceful march in Istanbul to protest against the detentions.</p>

An officer separately told Agence France-Presse its forces were about 20 miles (30km) away in the town of Mubi. The town has large deposits of tin and many significant goldmines. It also puts them within 250 miles of Kisangani, the country's fourth-largest city. Gunfire rang out from near Nyabangi neighbourhood on Wednesday, according to Janvier Kabutwa, who lives in Walikale. The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola after Tshisekedi's government went back on its longstanding refusal to speak to the rebels, but M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, citing EU sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials.</p>

Negotiators from Moscow and the U.S. will meet Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Sergei Ushakov told Russian news agencies. Despite the negotiations, hundreds of drone attacks were launched overnight by both sides, injuring several people and damaging buildings. The U.K. Defense Ministry estimated that 900,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. We're talking about protection in air, at sea, and all the operational planning that is needed,” Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said European plans for raising military spending conflicted with Putin and Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal.</p>

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's efforts to promote the tech CEO on Fox News backfired amid national protests This week, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush and a major Tesla backer, said brand damage caused by Musk's work for Trump “has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterize as a brand tornado crisis moment”. Lutnick urged viewers to “buy Tesla” and expressed disbelief about the shares' performance. Lutnick and Watters then engaged in cheerful promotion of $30,000 robots for domestic chores that the commerce secretary said Musk would soon bring to market. This week, as Musk's Starlink internet service was installed at the White House, senior Democrats called for investigations.</p>

Others beat drums and chanted “hostages deal now” as they marched in from other parts of Israel. New suspects in the “Qatargate” affair were interviewed by Israeli police on Wednesday, local media reported. Netanyahu is also facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. Analysts said previously fragmented opposition groups had been brought together in recent days, though there are still no political leaders who look likely to threaten Netanyahu. There is still no alternative or vision to Netanyahu being put forward,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israeli society and politics at the International Crisis Group.</p>

Here's what we know about the mega-prison called Cecot, an acronym for Terrorism Confinement Centre in Spanish. In February 2023, El Salvador opened what it claims is Latin America's biggest prison with capacity for 40,000 inmates. This includes alleged members of El Salvador's Mara Salvatrucha gan, also known as MS-13, and its rival, Barrio 18. Those people along with 101 additional Venezuelans were sent to Cecot for a one-year term that can be renewed, Bukele said.

It came as protesters announced on Wednesday they were planning what they described as their biggest day of action yet against the EV maker, with 500 demonstrations expected at Tesla showrooms around the world on 29 March. It also emerged that the Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla from its event hours, citing security concerns. “The brand damage started off as limited in our view based on our initial survey work … but now has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterise as a brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. Organisers said they were expecting a similar turnout for this year's lineup of 200 or so vehicles. In an interview this week Musk called Tesla protesters “deranged” and blamed the protests on his involvement with Doge.</p>

Regional tensions over the South China Sea have tanked the sales of a popular children's doll in Vietnam after it was put under investigation and accused of being unpatriotic because a design marking appeared to resemble China's “nine-dash line”. Between September, when it first gained popularity, and December the dolls reportedly generated US$1.6m in sales. An international tribunal in The Hague has ruled China's territorial claim invalid and it is disputed by countries including Vietnam. According to data cited by state media from YouNet ECI, an e-commerce data analysis platform, the average price of Baby Three on Shopee and TikTok Shop halved in the first 10 weeks of 2025. “Almost all children started to boycott [the dolls] because they saw it as a nationalistic issue, thinking that buying Baby Three was unpatriotic,” one vendor told AFP.</p>

It was not clear when authorities would begin questioning the mayor, who can be detained without charges for up to four days.

Before his detention, Imamoglu already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban.</p>

And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.” But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China's territorial designs on its neighbour. Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they've engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei's continued success. The Taiwanese semiconductor firm's investment means that Nvidia's Blackwell chips – its top-of-the-line graphics processing unit – are being produced in the US, providing for “a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience”.</p>

Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday that the US could own and run Ukrainian nuclear power plants as part of a ceasefire. “We are now focused on a long-term peace agreement,” said White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. Zelenskyy indicated he did not yet consider a ceasefire to be in place, instead saying it could be established quickly, and his team would present the Americans with a list of the kind of facilities it should include. Such actions put Putin's words about ceasing attacks “at odds with reality”, Zelenskyy said.

The new regulations stipulate that infant and primary students “will not be allowed to work individually with digital devices, and that their teachers will not be able to set homework or other academic tasks that involve the use of tablets, computers, mobile or similar devices outside the school timetable”. The plans, however, allow some pupils a small amount of supervised screen time each week. Babies and toddlers from birth to three years old will be banned from using screens, while infant school students aged three to six will be allowed one supervised hour of computer time a week. Pupils in years three and four of Spanish primary school will be allowed a maximum of 90 minutes a week, rising to two hours for those in years five and six.

Based on Census Bureau data from 2016 through 2019, Migration Policy Institute researchers found that participation in Snap, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tanf) and Medicaid declined twice as fast among noncitizens as citizens during the first three years of the first Trump administration. “Though their plans to restrict any policy requirements are currently vague, my concern is that even an announcement of an intent to target these programs could have a chilling effect amongst immigrant families, like what happened with Snap and the 2019 public charge rule,” she said. “They're pivoting their concerns to an ideological attack on immigrants, which isn't even based in fact or reality.”</p>

India's space programme is limited only by the ambition of its people, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told NDTV Friday, in a free-wheeling interview that began with American astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's return from a nine-month stay in space. There is a role, Mr Tyson said, explaining that the private sector's involvement is necessary and natural, and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to him about this. The real value of private enterprises is that once they see what needs to be done... they have the latitude to go out there and do it for less or more efficiently," he said. On India's space dreams, Mr Tyson would not be drawn beyond saying, "I think what matters are your ambitions and then, depending on your resources, you can achieve it slowly or quickly." "When China was not allowed to participate in the ISS (this was after the US objected to technology transfer), they said, 'okay, we will go into space on our own'."</p>

The review, led by Alice Sullivan, a professor of sociology and research specialist at University College London, said guidance should be updated to make sure both sets of data were recorded in a clear and distinct way. The study, based on a review of evidence and practices, as well as interviews with organisations including government departments, regulators and other bodies, concluded that “the meaning of sex is no longer stable in administrative or major survey data”. It went on: “This instability is evident across key policy areas including health and justice. Among a series of recommendations, it said the “default target” for any such question should be biological sex at birth, without any combining of gender identity, including for people who have a gender recognition certificate. “We are grateful to Prof Sullivan for her work, which has been shared with relevant government departments and public organisations, including the ONS.”</p>

Nearly half of female entrepreneurs surveyed by Cherie Blair Foundation for Women do not have regular internet access While social media marketing is reported to be crucial by female business owners who have access to it, 45% of women in business in low- and middle-income countries said they did not have regular internet access because of the expense and connection issues. “Internet connectivity is fundamental to digital inclusion and business success, as being online allows women to reach customers, streamline operations, increase sales and access financial services,” said Dhivya O'Connor, CEO of the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. Privacy concerns, security risks and online harassment remain major barriers … as the digital landscape evolves, those who are not supported to adapt risk being left behind.” Many said they feared aggressive negotiating by men, potential violence, unwanted advances and being sent unsolicited explicit pictures.</p>

Mr Tyson also played down any talk of Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore's mental status being affected, pointing out NASA selects its astronauts based on both strength of body and mind. Ms Williams, and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore, were flown back from the ISS late Tuesday/early Wednesday. At the crux of these issues is the different levels of gravity on Earth and in space; for example, muscles activated by our everyday tasks here weaker because they don't need to work as hard in space. "If I were NASA, or any other space agency, given how many rockets are available to us today, I'd put a rocket on reserve just for this occasion," Mr Tyson said.</p>

Smoke rises from a location reportedly struck by U.S. airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, Wednesday, March 19, 2025. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Yemen's Houthi rebels on Wednesday that they'll be “completely annihilated” as American airstrikes pounded locations under their control, while further pressuring the group's main benefactor Iran. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others. Iran has long armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam's minority Shiite Zaydi sect that ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.</p>

So when Russia was booted from international hockey competition after it invaded Ukraine, that hurt Putin even more: the latest insult from a west that would never truly respect it. In case you missed the significance, it inspired a Hollywood film starring Kurt Russell. For him it has only ever been the Two Nations, and you can imagine he and Putin watching it together from the Kremlin press box at Moscow's CSKA arena, not discussing Ukraine at all.</p>

Indian partner Tribeca Developers announced on Wednesday that it would develop a new "Trump World Center" in the western Indian city of Pune in partnership with real estate firm Kundan Spaces. The project, expected to generate sales exceeding $289.6 million, will span more than 1.6 million square feet and feature "two iconic glass towers with over 27 floors of office space", a statement said. Eldest son Donald Trump Junior visited India in 2018, when the Trump Organization's local partners promised dinner with him to anyone who bought into a luxury development outside the capital New Delhi. India's office market saw robust growth in 2024, with leasing activity across the top seven cities seeing a nearly 23 percent year-on-year increase, according to estimates by real estate management firm JLL.

Indonesia has ratified controversial changes to its military law allowing armed forces personnel to hold more civilian posts, a move that analysts fear could usher in a resurgence of the military in government affairs. The country is now led by President Prabowo Subianto, an ex-special forces general and former Suharto son-in-law, who was inaugurated in October. “President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,” said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. Kennedy Muslim, a political analyst from Indonesian pollster Indikator, said: “We've seen this creeping militarisation for quite some time, that's why civil society is right to be alarmed by this trend. Students organisations have said they plan to protest outside the parliament in Jakarta on Thursday, with one student group, describing the law as “democracy killing”.</p>

The DHS statement to Fox News, which was reposted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, did not cite evidence. Trump's measures have sparked outcry from civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups who accuse his administration of unfairly targeting political critics.

About 70 pages of director's handwritten notes for the New Wave classic were found after more than 60 years The only known script for Jean-Luc Godard's seminal New Wave film Breathless (À Bout de Souffle) will be auctioned later this year after coming to light for the first time in more than 60 years. Breathless, which follows the doomed affair between an American student in Paris (Jean Seberg) and her hoodlum boyfriend who is wanted for gunning down a police officer (Jean-Paul Belmondo), is a keystone of France's Nouvelle Vague movement that shook the cinema world, including Hollywood. De Beauregard, another of the movement's key figures, had met Godard through Truffaut, and made a leap of faith in agreeing to produce Breathless, the then unknown director's first full-length film. Sotheby's says it is describing the manuscript as “partial”, not because anything is missing but because Godard did not submit a full synopsis and script to the ministry of culture's National Centre of Cinematography and Animated Pictures, as would have been normal at the time, and made much of it up as he went along.</p>

Adding fuel to those flames is what many observers see as a calamitous lack of official or institutional transparency. Whatever the outcome, Georgescu's campaign has been “an absolute wake-up call”, said Victoria Stoiciu, a Social Democrat senator and former progressive activist.

Ms Gabbard's remarks, which linked Bangladesh to aspirations of an "Islamist caliphate," have sparked diplomatic tensions between the two nations. Ms Bruce said the US condemns such acts and acknowledged efforts by Bangladesh's interim government to address these issues. "We condemn any instances of violence or intolerance directed toward members of minority communities in any country and have welcomed measures taken by Bangladesh's interim government to ensure safety and security for all in Bangladesh.

The aim was also to create a partial buffer zone between northern and southern Gaza. The IDF accuses him of promoting anti-Israel activities and being closely affiliated with senior Hamas leaders like Yahya Sinwar. His minister for justice, Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata was also eliminated alongside Bahajat Hassan Mohammed Abu-Sultan, who headed the Palestinian outfit's internal security forces. Israel issued a "last warning" before launching its deadly airstrikes, urging residents to return their hostages held by the Hamas. At least 58 Israeli citizens are believed to be in Hamas custody even after dozens were released as part of ceasefires.</p>

Calls to militarize the southern border are not new, but so far they have existed more in the realm of political rhetoric than reality. In 2022, Blake Masters, an Arizona Senate candidate enthusiastically backed by Peter Thiel, the same tech billionaire who bankrolled JD Vance's campaign that year, ran a campaign ad promising to do just that. In 2018, Trump abruptly announced during a White House meeting with then defense secretary Jim Mattis: “We are going to be guarding our border with our military. “Can't you just shoot them?” Trump asked, in an Oval Office meeting. “Just shoot them in the legs or something?” Esper declined to do so.</p>

Trump described his conversation with Zelensky as “very good” and noted that it came a day after Putin agreed to temporarily stop attacks on Kyiv's power plants. Trump said he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for about an hour, marking their first conversation since a heated televised argument in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago. "Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. He also insisted that Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm and should stop its mandatory mobilisation. "These attacks are countering our common efforts," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to ongoing U.S.-Russian discussions.</p>

Trump suggested “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,” according to White House officials. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue. The White House described Tuesday's call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a “movement to peace.” But there was no indication that Putin is ready to back away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. Shortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter. Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said.</p>

After speaking to U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday for the first time since disastrous Oval Office talks last month, Zelenskiy said Kyiv would draw up a list of facilities that could be subject to a partial ceasefire brokered by Washington. That list, he said, could include not only energy infrastructure but also rail and port facilities. "But I understand that until we agree (with Russia), until there is a corresponding document on even a partial ceasefire, I think that everything will fly," Zelenskiy told reporters at an online briefing, meaning drones and missiles. He added that he told Trump that Kyiv would be ready to discuss U.S. involvement in modernising and investing in the nuclear plant if it is returned to Ukraine.

Investigation uncovered eight adverts that portrayed women in a harmful or degrading way, says ASA An investigation by the UK advertising watchdog has found a number of shocking ads in mobile gaming apps that depict women as sexual objects, use pornographic tropes, and feature non-consensual sexual scenarios involving “violent and coercive control”. The ad moved on to animated content featuring text conversations with three manga-style young men. The ASA also identified three ads for Love Sparks: Dating Sim, which were shown to its female child and adult male avatars. The third ad featured an animated clothed woman with her bottom pulsating with the options “next girl” and “slap”, as well as text reading “punish me … please”.</p>

Organisations including energy and transport firms told to guard systems against powerful new computers As a result, quantum computers can in theory compute their way through vast numbers of different outcomes and carry out far bigger calculations than previously thought possible. However, qubits are extremely vulnerable to the slightest interference including minor temperature changes and cosmic rays, a key reason why a large-scale quantum computer has yet to be developed despite significant investment from tech firms. The NCSC is hoping its new advice will give organisations plenty of time to be ready for when quantum computers come onstream. “Now that there are new methods for public key encryption, it makes sense to migrate now rather than wait for the threat to becoming real,” said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University.</p>

Trump fired Dellinger early on in Term 2 —and it is settled law that it is Trump's right to do just that— but Dellinger made a play for a district court order preventing the firing…and got one from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C.! Now President Trump is jumping on that trampoline — just as FDR did early in his presidency — to see how high presidential power can go. Trump will lose some cases, however, including, I think, his attempt to curtail "birthright citizenship" via executive order. Boasberg isn't likely to get the final word here whether he stomps his feet or not. Students of history will recall the ill-conceived partisan attempt to impeach Justice Chase by Jefferson's hyper-supporters in 1804-5.</p>

KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Police have arrested a civil servant suspected of posting comments insulting Prophet Muhammad SAW on Facebook recently. According to national news agency Bernama, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said the arrest was made after a 35-year-old man lodged a report last Tuesday. He said the suspect, along with two other individuals, allegedly posted derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad on a news post regarding Malaysia's strong condemnation of the deadly airstrike in Gaza that killed eight humanitarian workers from the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organization (Mapim) last Saturday. He said the police viewed religious insults seriously, as such acts can threaten national harmony and public order. Aaron stated that insulting any religion not only violates the principles of national harmony and unity but could also have severe consequences for peace and public security.</p>

In his article Starmer heaps praise on “entrepreneurs who work day and night to build a business from scratch” and the “family companies that have passed know-how across the generations.” Those entrepreneurs are currently braced for a spike in the cost of employing people in their fledgling businesses while the family firms that Starmer celebrates have been knocked for six by potentially ruinous changes to the inheritance tax system. On the day that the PM's article ran in City AM, the Resolution Foundation – a think tank with close links to Downing Street – warned that the UK was entering recession territory as firms adapt to a wave of cost and tax increases coming into effect next month, alongside the imposition of new employment legislation that makes a mockery of Starmer's claim to be slashing regulations that hold businesses back. It isn't actually that radical at all, it should have happened years ago and we can slam the Tories for not lifting a finger in this area but we shouldn't confuse this government's regulatory housekeeping with a Bing Bang style revolution, because it isn't. And it will take more than a punchy op-ed in our newspaper to make up for all that.</p>

Powell did not shy away from the impact of Trump's tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday. Powell then called a transitory effect on prices "kind of the base case but we really can't know that" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda. "Tariffs are a one-time price adjustment," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in another recent example. Trump's pointed comments on rates follow a period when Trump has softened his criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy decisions and even made it clear he doesn't intend to fire Powell, someone he criticized repeatedly during his first term. But it's clear the White House does want a closer relationship with the central bank — and other independent agencies — after issuing a new executive order last week that gives Trump's appointees more power over such agencies.</p>

These parasites usually infect cattle and are spread between animals by ticks that eat the blood of different hosts. Symptoms usually emerge within one to four weeks of a person being infected with Babesia parasites, and they can last for several days after onset. In symptomatic patients, the main treatment for babesiosis is a combination of antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics.

That's due to a rare three-game losing streak by Cleveland, while the Thunder keep powering along despite the absence of key players virtually every night. Another deep team in the mold of the Thunder, the Rockets survived without Fred VanVleet for a month and now have been making do without Amen Thompson, thanks in large part to Tari Eason, who's been excellent as a fill-in starter. He's expected to be out at least through March, and the Knicks have gone 3-3 without him so far, including a bad loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday. It's no secret that the Knicks rely heavily on Bruson and the rest of their starters, so it will be interesting to see how they fare over the next couple of weeks.</p>

If there was an early NFL offseason loser, it may be the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers' defensive line will also look very different, as Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins and Leonard Floyd are no longer on roster. General manager John Lynch says the team has a plan, and "some big things coming our way." Ultimately, this 49ers roster was due for a reset after "doubling down" last year following San Francisco's overtime Super Bowl loss. So guys like Leonard Floyd and Maliek — believe me, their impact was felt.</p>

Dozens of accomplished free agents are still waiting for the right opportunity to surface, either before, during or after April's NFL Draft. And that's not accounting for surprise trades or cuts, which could trickle in even after all 32 teams kick off their offseason programs. Yet Denver could use additional safety valves for young quarterback Bo Nix, and Cooper's long been a solid technician. Released in a cost-cutting move by the Seahawks, Lockett is no spring chicken going on 33, and his numbers have dipped for three straight seasons. Jenkins' best attribute might be versatility, as he improved by going from tackle to guard during his time with the Chicago Bears.</p>

Cunningham finished with 25 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, two blocks and a steal for his ninth triple-double of the season. The win was a big one for the Pistons, who have now won two straight against two tanking teams -- whether by design or not -- in New Orleans and Miami to get back on track after losing four of six. Oh and by the way, Detroit closes its season with consecutive games against Milwaukee. Of course, both teams are still aiming higher for a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round.

Four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Stefon Diggs is making his first team visit in free agency, meeting with the New England Patriots in Foxboro, according to The Athletic. Another piece of sour news for Diggs is that his receiving yards per game and yards per catch have steadily declined lately. However, none of that may matter for a Patriots squad desperate to surround quarterback Drake Maye, the third overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft, with pass-catching talent. Tight end Hunter Henry and wide receiver Demario Douglas co-led the Patriots in catches (66) while Hunter led the team in yards receiving (674). He helped 2024 NFL MVP and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen take a leap in his development after coming over in a trade from the Minnesota Vikings in 2020, and if the Patriots decide to sign him, that would indicate New England feels Diggs can perhaps do something similar for Maye.</p>

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued a handful of executive orders aimed at terminating all diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in federally funded programs. Last month, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights — which lost about 50% of its staff in mid-March — directed schools, including postsecondary institutions, to end race-based programs or risk losing federal funding. Utibe Essien, a physician and UCLA assistant professor, said he has heard from some students who fear they won't be considered for admission under the new policies.
