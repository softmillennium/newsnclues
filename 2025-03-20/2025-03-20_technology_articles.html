Analyst flags troubling trends with Vision Pro and Siri</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 21:56:28 <p>
Technology analyst Benedict Evans has raised questions about Apple’s recent product execution, suggesting the company may be experiencing a shift in its ability to deliver new features and innovations smoothly. In a recent blog post, Evans pointed to the launch of the Vision Pro headset and delays in personalised Siri updates as examples of this trend. He compared these challenges to “Microsoft’s Windows Vista era”, which was known for software issues and design changes that were not well received. Evans argued that the Vision Pro may have been released too early, serving more as a concept than a fully developed product. "Apple doesn’t usually release unfinished products, so why did it ship the Vision Pro? He noted that even within Apple, there seems to be some uncertainty about the device’s role in the market. Another key concern is the delay of Apple’s AI-powered Siri features, first showcased at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last year. "It now appears that what was shown at WWDC was more of a concept than a working feature," he said. Evans also noted that Apple’s software release cycle has historically been predictable, with announcements in the summer and product rollouts in September. However, he suggested that this pattern may be changing, with more delays becoming apparent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The security provider Zimperium warns of interventions in mobile operating systems via rooting and jailbreaking. Geroted smartphones and tablets with Android are affected 3.5 times more often by mobile malware attacks-and safety incidents due to compromised systems increase 250 times in comparison to non-stated devices. According to the Zimperium, cybercriminals pass into a mobile-first attack strategy. The root and jailbreak functions on mobile devices originally used for adaptation and app installation therefore remain a frequently used attack vector. Business users who deal with critical security protocols and usage rights increased the threats and vulnerability in the company - from mobile malware and data protection violations to the complete compromising of entire systems. "Modified mobile devices prove to be frequently used entry points for threats who can take advantage of security gaps and compromise a company network as a whole with complex attacks," said the specialist for real -time protection on mobile devices. Tools such as Magisk, Apatch, Kernelsu, Dopamine and Checkra1n are constantly being developed and have new stealth mechanisms Avoidance of conventional security measures. " The threat for companies remains high because cybercriminals further adapted their attack techniques, Zimperium continues.

A French researcher was denied entry to the U.S. over text messages on his phone that were critical of President Donald Trump, according to several reports from media outlets in France. France’s minister of higher education and research, Philippe Baptiste, only identified the researcher as someone working for the French National Center for Scientific Research. Reached for comment by email, an FBI spokesperson would only refer Gizmodo to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP, who reportedly seized the researcher’s devices, gave a vague emailed statement to Gizmodo that started by referring to individuals who “violate the terms of a lawful immigration status and attempt to re-enter the country” but didn’t elaborate any further on that suggestion. “If an individual has material discovered on their electronic media that raises flags during an inspection, it can result in further analysis,” the statement continued. Other high-profile cases of people stopped at the border recently suggest a more aggressive posture by American authorities than before Trump came into office. Previously, someone traveling to the U.S. without a valid visa might be denied entry, but there are more and more stories of people instead being thrown into ICE detention facilities for weeks at a time. Schmidt had been visiting Luxembourg and was stopped by U.S. authorities in Boston on his flight home. Schmidt, who got his green card in 2008, was reportedly “flagged” and transferred to the Donald W. Wyatt detention facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to WGBH. That man was “violently interrogated,” stripped naked, and put in a cold shower, according to the news outlet. The man was also subjected to sleep deprivation and other forms of torture. But these aren’t even “deportations” in the traditional sense, given the fact that these people were Venezuelan and were being sent to a country they never lived in. The U.S. government claims these people were all gang members, though it’s impossible to say for sure given the fact that you simply have to take Trump’s word for it. 2) A picture from social media of him throwing the horns. Needless to say, these cases will make researchers think long and hard about whether it’s safe to visit the U.S. with Trump now in power. Trump’s fascist movement has been ransacking the U.S. government and purging anyone who’s not loyal to his perverse worldview; an ideology built on greed, corruption, and racism.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Honda and its luxury brand Acura are getting access to more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers in North America starting in June for their Prologue and ZDX EVs. Both brands will also sell their own EV charging adapters for an undisclosed price through dealerships.

The new Honda and Acura branded adapters that convert their vehicles’ existing CCS1 port to Tesla’s NACS connector have a design identical to Ford’s Lectron-built offering. But unlike Hyundai and Ford, Honda hasn’t said it will provide the adapters for free. Without one, you can still charge at some Tesla Supercharger stations as long as they have built-in Magic Dock adapters.

Both the Honda and Acura adapters are the same except for the small logo printed on top. Image: Honda

Honda, like every other automaker, agreed last year to adopt Tesla’s now standardized connector for EV charging in the US. However, they still have to wait until Tesla flips the switch for their vehicles to link up with Tesla’s vast fast-charging network.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The problem is as it does. Today public administrations can decide whether to collaborate with the secret services, providing information or opposing to balance the request with other rights.

Mike Rockwell, the man behind Vision Pro, is taking over from John Giannandrea Following reports from earlier this week that Apple Intelligence would be a focal point of Apple's off-site Top 100 exec meeting, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is now reporting that AI head John Giannandrea is no longer going to be overseeing Siri's overhaul. With Giannandrea no longer in charge of Siri, he'll now be working on other AI projects. Apple had advertised its flagship iPhone 16 Pro as the best device for Apple Intelligence, yet nearly seven months after its launch, customers have yet to see the real benefits of AI. With Apple's Siri delay a public disaster, this shift in leadership could be the catalyst for success that's needed to make the personal context-capable Siri a reality. At WWDC 2024 in June, we got to hear directly from Giannandrea about his vision for the then-newly-announced Siri. He said Siri with Apple Intelligence has a "rich understanding of what’s on your device," and that the voice assistant's knowledge base would "only get richer over time." Nearly a year later, Siri still can't tell you what month of the year it is and definitely doesn't understand what's on your device. While the mixed reality headset hasn't necessarily been a commercial success it does achieve some incredible feats. And, if he does, then all the naysayers will have to accept that Apple truly is back on track.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Microsoft has released a new feature in its latest 26120.3576 and 22635.5090 Insider builds that helps users understand their PC's capabilities (via phantomofearth on X). From its looks, this feature isn't cutting-edge by any means, as a simple search on the internet will likely land you with many more detailed and fine-tuned answers. While this number wasn't definitive, it let people know where their PC stood. WinSAT also benchmarked individual components such as the CPU, memory, graphics, and disk enabling users to identify potential bottlenecks. Release notes for both releases mention the inclusion of a new "Frequently Asked Questions" list within "Device specifications" under System > About. Has some questions related to the Windows version and device specs. Known FAQs (non-exhaustive) detailing your Windows version, followed by how much RAM you have and your system's graphical capabilities have been compiled in a GitHub Gist. The first question allows users to check if their Windows is up-to-date but confusingly asks them to verify again within the Windows Update section. Given Microsoft’s strong push for AI, an AI-driven hardware analysis utility would have been a significant overhaul to WinSAT.

Katie Drummond: Right, available to the public, as opposed to DOGE, despite the claims that Musk and even President Trump have made, that this is a maximally transparent group of people doing this work. We don't actually know that much about what they're doing, what they're finding, and the changes that they're making, short of journalists like you and so many of your WIRED colleagues and other news organizations obtaining that information and publishing it. Now, from what you've reported over the last several months and in your role, how valid is that claim to begin with? So it's like, it's not this made up thing, but in the context of a $7 trillion federal budget, that is not what's breaking the bank. They could go look at the current outstanding investigations. But from what the auditors I spoke to said, they said that doesn't really seem to be what DOGE is doing. And one of the other things they said was a lot of auditors would probably be really happy to help them, to offer advice. They'd be happy to work with them, they'd be happy to bring young talent into their teams to sort of make the auditing system more robust. But DOGE is really kind of siloed, it doesn't seem like they're really interested in that. Now, speaking of DOGE and the auditors that you spoke to for this story, they certainly didn't have kind words to say about how DOGE is going about its work. Tell us a little bit more about their impressions of DOGE and their commentary on sort of what is happening under the auspices of this idea that Musk and DOGE are essentially auditing the federal government. What do the actual auditors think about that? Vittoria Elliott: Yeah, so to give some context, first off, a regular audit, which involves like five different steps, so there are five steps to an audit. One is where you plan it, you sit down, you say, "This is what we're looking at, this is the kind of information we're going to need to go after." You sort of map out who the stakeholders are, who you're going to have to interview, because a lot of times they're going into programs or systems that maybe they don't fully understand. What does this mean inside your system?" In the case of, for instance, the hurricane stuff, they actually sent auditors, I believe, to Puerto Rico to see what was going on. Once you've done that, they sort of pull all this information together into a report, they sort of do this analysis. You have the opportunity to correct these. They get to come back and be like, "Hey, we recommended this thing. There's a level of accountability for trying to fix that thing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Thought it was hard to get an Nvidia RTX 50-series Blackwell GPU? Things are potentially going to get even more difficult, as Nvidia has now revealed its Blackwell RTX Pro series of graphics cards. These will target both laptops and desktops, as well as standalone PCs and data center products. We've heard from some people at GDC/GTC that Nvidia is working to improve the supply of all of its Blackwell GPUs, and some even suggested we "might" see supply finally start to catch up to demand by May/June — meaning we could see MSRP-priced models on sale and readily available. We expected the Blackwell professional announcement, and certainly Nvidia would know it was incoming and would plan for the increased production required. Nvidia should have known demand would be high, and yet the supply has been woefully insufficient. And given the choice between shipping GB202/GB203/GB205 GPUs as consumer parts with an ostensible $550~$2,000 MSRP, or shipping professional and data center parts that can cost five times as much (or more), we suspect the latter category will be served first whenever possible.

But that's only part of the potential upgrade. As we've traditionally seen with professional and data center solutions, Nvidia will ship some products with memory chips in "clamshell" mode — with GDDR7 chips on both sides of the PCB. Nvidia has stated that it will have a Blackwell RTX Pro GPU with 96GB of GDDR7 memory, with ECC enabled. It also has the full complement of four NVDEC/NVENC units for video encoding/decoding. Nvidia didn't disclose clocks or theoretical TFLOPS on the other three RTX Pro GPUs, so we've just estimated 2.5GHz for now. The step-down RTX Pro 5000 still uses GB202, just trimmed down quite a lot. It has 110 SMs enabled, which is only 57% of the computational elements. Nvidia sticks with the more readily available 16Gb (2GB) GDDR7 chips as well, with 12 on each side of the PCB yielding 48GB of total VRAM — with no mention of the L2 cache size, though we suspect it will have 96MB. It's also a nearly complete solution, with 82 of the potential 84 SMs enabled alongside all eight memory channels. Like the RTX Pro 5000, it uses 2GB GDDR7 modules in clamshell mode, for 32GB of total VRAM. It also features two NVENC/NVDEC units, and a power limit of just 200W — surprisingly low, considering it's otherwise similar to the RTX 5080 that has a 360W TGP. Last up, the RTX Pro 4000 also uses the GB203 chip, with some severe trimmings in some areas. Nvidia sticks with the 2GB GDDR7 modules as well, which in clamshell mode gives the GPU 24GB total VRAM. Dual NVENC/NVDEC are again present, and the power limit gets slashed to just 140W. All of the models feature a full PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, with 16-pin 12V-2x6 connectors. Nvidia had the RTX Pro 6000 variants on display, which appear to be launching first. Nvidia also announced a change in branding, if you didn't notice. for Ada), the new Blackwell generation of professional and data center GPUs will use RTX Pro nomenclature. Nvidia already listed the RTX Pro 6000/5000/4500/4000 series GPU names for desktops. For laptops, there will be RTX Pro 5000/4000/3000/2000/1000/500 models, and for data center so far there's only an RTX Pro 6000. That last will, naturally, be the full-fat model with 96GB of GDDR7 ECC memory, taking over from the Nvidia L40. We're glad to see the change in naming, as things were becoming a bit obfuscated after Nvidia killed off its Quadro branding several generations back. Now, RTX Pro will very clearly indicate that something is different from the standard GeForce RTX lineup. There's still the matter of those numbers, however. RTX Pro 6000 quite obviously implies a Blackwell GPU for now, but what will happen with the next generation Rubin (or whatever the codename ends up being for the non-DC parts) GPUs? This is where the Ampere RTX A6000 branding made sense, but Ada parts dropped the "A" and things became a little fuzzy. Hopefully, that's something Nvidia addresses when those future products finally arrive.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Release dates are some of Hollywood’s most valuable natural resources. Often the window when a movie is set for release, or if it’s delayed or advanced, can tell you a lot about what to expect when you sit down in the theater. Warner Bros. just gave its schedule a huge shake-up—and while you don’t have to worry about Superman, it’s safe in July, a few other films are not so lucky. This is the Bride of Frankenstein movie that may also be a musical and despite that sounding like a huge, huge, swing, we were excited, especially given its original September 26 release date. It’s a window Warner Bros. has had success with—Dune, Godzilla x Kong, etc.—so we’ve still got our fingers crossed. It’ll open against a new Pixar movie called Hoppers. With that September date open, it shifted a few things. One, the studio moved Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest, now officially titled One Battle After Another and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, from its original August 8 release date to September 26. Flowervale Street, the new film from It Follows director David Robert Mitchell, was originally set for release this summer. It was then moved to March 2026 and now, with The Bride! in that window, it’s been pushed again to August 14, 2026. Ewan McGregor and Anne Hathaway star and it may or may not have dinosaurs, so we’re hoping the extra time is just to make sure it’s right, and not to bury it in any way. Well, he’s been lending his voice to a new animated version of Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat along with Quinta Brunson, Bowen Yang, Xochitl Gomez, Matt Berry, and Paula Pell. Originally set for release March 6, 2026, now it’s out a week later: February 27, 2026.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A Florida man’s hankering for feral pig landed him in the hospital. The man endured multiple trips to the hospital and needed his chest implant removed before doctors identified what was making him sick: pig-derived bacteria called Brucella suis. According to the report, the man was a pastor in his 70s who had a history of heart failure—a condition that necessitated an automated implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) device to keep his heartbeat steady. Starting in spring 2019, he developed chest issues that led to multiple hospital stays. Four species are known to sicken people, and infections are usually caught from drinking raw milk and cheese or from direct exposure to infected animals. The man lived on a farm with plenty of potential animal vectors, but he reported never coming into contact with them nor was he a hunter. While other possibilities exist, the doctors believe this gift “likely served as his exposure to B. suis.” These bacteria were once formally designated as potential bioterror threats, since they can be easily aerosolized, which then makes them very contagious (they were recently removed from this list to make research into them easier). Indeed, the man’s infection was misidentified as a different bacteria prior to his last hospital visit. Fortunately, the risk of aerosolization was low, proper precautions appeared to have been followed, and no other cases among staff were found. And three years later, he had no signs of an active infection. Brucellosis is very rare in the U.S., with only around 100 cases reported annually, most of which are from other species besides B. suis. But feral pigs are a persistent and growing presence in parts of the U.S., Florida included. “Feral swine hunters are at risk of contracting B. suis, and measures to reduce that risk include the use of personal protective equipment and thoroughly cooking animal products before consumption,” they wrote.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Choosing European is not a taboo for Clara Chappaz Turning to a non-European solution, "it's not bad in itself", recognizes the minister. "But I think you have to realize that the money we spend does not support economic development in our country," she said. Clara Chappaz here referred to the cloud market. This orientation of the order "should no longer be a taboo today," she said on March 18. On the On-premise, a long way remains obviously to be traveled. A previous contract concluded 10 years earlier between the ministry and Microsoft triggered controversy, trampling on the Ayrault circular on free software in administration.

Solidigm, a US-based subsidiary of SK hynix specializing in storage solutions for data centers has introduced what it claims to be the world's first liquid-cooled eSSD (Enterprise SSD) solution for AI servers. SSDs are an extremely vital component of servers designed for AI due to their fast data access requirements. In an attempt to foster fanless server designs, Solidigm has pioneered the world's first liquid-cooled eSSD solution. Traditional DLC (Direct Liquid Cooling) solutions for eSSDs fail to adequately cool both sides of drives. Additionally, the design is not hot-swappable, incurring downtime during replacements. Solidigm's D7-PS1010 E1.S eSSD overcomes these limitations as its cold plates have been engineered to keep temperatures at both sides under check. Solidigm says these eSSDs can eliminate fan-based 1U rack designs, decreasing HVAC and air-cooling costs for data centers. Just a few days back, CoolIT revealed a single-phase DLC cold plate, advertised to dissipate 4kW of heat for next-gen AI accelerations, like Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra B300 chips. The Solidigm D7-PS1010 E1.S will also launch in a 15mm form factor for already-existing air-cooled servers and other storage solutions. While they have several advantages of traditional DLC solutions, existing infrastructure cannot be easily molded to suit their requirements.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The ugly and embattled Cybetruck took another blow this week after the federal regulators issued a recall. Despite claims from Elon Musk that the Cybetruck is a bulletproof beast, it’s actually a shoddily manufactured vehicle. Drivers and people who test the durability of cars have known this for a long time. This recall, which covers every single Cybetruck since it went on sale, is the 8th one for the vehicle. In June last year, the company issued a similar recall because “the trunk bed trim sail applique could have been improperly adhered and can loosen.” In a video published in August 2024, YouTuber WhistlinDiesel put the Cybetruck through various durability tests and compared it to the more popular F-150. The clip of the trim being peeled away got a second life when WhistlinDiesel took to TikTok. A cut from the longer video has been viewed more than 20 million times online. He only needs to use his hands to disassemble the car and you can see it’s held together with glue. Long-time Tesla owners are selling the cars in massive numbers. Major Tesla investor Ross Gerber has made multiple television appearances in the past few days calling on Musk to step down as CEO. “If Elon came back to Tesla, that would be great. And he’s gonna stay at DOGE and he’s one of the most powerful people in the world now it’s definitely gotten to his head and I just don’t see him changing and going back. I actually think he’s completely neglecting Tesla at this point,” Gerber told Bloomberg TV. “I think Elon should appoint a new CEO to run Tesla so he can focus on what he’s doing in the government and also separate himself from Tesla,” he continued. “Which is the great company that’s trying to solve climate change. It’s now associated with Elon in such a negative fashion that it’s destroying the sales of their main product, which is selling EVs. Somethings gotta change and I think it’s gonna happen this year.” On March 19, Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick went on Fox News and pushed people to buy the stock. “I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,” Lutnick said. It’ll never be this cheap again.” The stock got cheaper on Thursday morning after his appearance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, is an international effort involving more than 900 researchers. Dark matter is the catch-all term for about 27% of the universe that is only known to exist because of its gravitational effects on other matter. The stuff is so infinitesimally small or otherwise elusive that it cannot be observed with telescopes, which take in wavelengths of light emitted by objects to better understand those sources. “Results from the first batch of data gave a hint that dark energy might not behave like a simple cosmological constant—but it wasn’t strong enough to draw firm conclusions,” Ruggeri said in The Conversation. “Now, the second batch of data has made this evidence stronger.” According to the new DESI numbers, dark energy may be changing over time—either causing the universe’s expansion to accelerate or driving an inward collapse, which would theoretically cause everything we know to collapse into a singularity in a “Big Crunch.” It contains information about 18.7 million objects deep in space, including the distances to some extremely remote galaxies, covering 11 billion years of the universe’s history. The instrument works rapidly; with clear observing conditions, it can collect data on more than 100,000 objects in a single night. DESI collects its data from its perch atop the National Science Foundation’s Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter telescope, an NSF NOIRLab program at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. DESI is currently in its fourth year of a five-year data collection period, and the team intends to record spectra for more than 50 million galaxies and quasars (active galactic cores) before it ends. Thereafter, there will be a lot of data processing and analysis to do. But once it’s done, scientists may have a revised theory of dark energy’s exact machinations in our universe, and how its inexorable role in the universe’s grand scale changes over time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Those ads offer Discord users rewards for PC games if they play certain games or get people to watch a stream of their gameplay through Discord. Discord followed up with Video Quests, which let developers show Discord users video ads, like trailers and announcements of new seasons and downloadable content. Discord users see prompts for both types of ads on the bottom-left side of their screen and can choose to expand or ignore them. Discord users can also opt out of personalized promotions and “hide an in-app promotion for a specific Quest or game you’re not interested in,” Discord said.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/tesla-cybertrucks-made-with-the-wrong-glue-hit-with-yet-another-sticky-recall/'>Nearly All Cybertrucks Have Been Recalled Because Tesla Used the Wrong Glue</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 16:12:08 <p>
Tesla said Thursday it would recall nearly all the Cybertrucks it has produced to repair a stainless steel trim panel that the carmaker said could become detached from the vehicle while driving. It’s the eighth recall for the distinctive all-electric pickup, which hit US roads just over two years ago. Unlike many other Tesla-related recalls, though, this one cannot be fixed with an over-the-air software update, and must be brought into a service center for repairs. The recall affects more than 46,000 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025. Complaints about the trim first bubbled up in social media posts; Tesla reportedly halted Cybertruck production last week. “Glues are used a lot more than people think in car body construction these days,” he says. Jaguar, Lexus, Audi, they'll use glues at some point. There are numerous glues the auto industry uses to bond panels and parts together, Harrow says, adding that different adhesives are used depending on strength of bond needed, particular circumstances, and materials involved. However, what is different with the Cybertruck to other vehicles is its highly unconventional use of stainless steel for its panels. “Stainless steel is the big difference," Harrow says. Harrow points out this fault appears to be happening in cold weather, and that it might be that the stainless steel is conducting cold better, possibly just enough to make a difference in the curing process. But it would need quite a bit of investigation, I think, to find out the real cause of it.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Separately, Paul Liu, a TSMC board member and the head of Taiwan's National Development Council, denied claims that the company is considering purchasing Intel's struggling foundry unit, reports DigiTimes. Maybe other people are involved, but I do not know. While speaking to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan Economic Committee on March 19, Paul Liu stated that the acquisition of Intel Foundry has never been discussed at the board level and compared it to mixing two incompatible substances, something that one in the semiconductor industry can consider both figuratively as Intel and TSMC have vastly different corporate cultures and literally as the two companies use different chemical substances for manufacturing. As a result, industry experts believe such an acquisition would be more harmful than beneficial to TSMC. Liu explained that stabilizing the company's most advanced production technologies already takes between 18 and 24 months. Earlier this year there were rumors that the U.S. government pushed TSMC to take over Intel Foundry and operate it. The list of industry partners included AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, according to Reuters.

For Nvidia, which produces billions of dollars worth wafers every year, a dual sourcing supply strategy could make sense. However, designing large AI/HPC GPUs for different process technologies used by Intel and TSMC would significantly affect Nvidia's costs. The talks reportedly started before TSMC's March 3 announcement of its $100 billion U.S. investment.

A mother suing Character.AI after her son died by suicide—allegedly manipulated by chatbots posing as adult lovers and therapists—was horrified when she recently discovered that the platform is allowing random chatbots to pose as her son. According to Megan Garcia's litigation team, at least four chatbots bearing Sewell Setzer III's name and likeness were flagged. Ars reviewed chat logs showing the bots used Setzer's real photo as a profile picture, attempted to imitate his real personality by referencing Setzer's favorite Game of Thrones chatbot, and even offered "a two-way call feature with his cloned voice," Garcia's lawyers said. The bots could also be self-deprecating, saying things like "I'm very stupid." The Tech Justice Law Project (TJLP), which is helping Garcia with litigation, told Ars that "this is not the first time Character.AI has turned a blind eye to chatbots modeled off of dead teenagers to entice users, and without better legal protections, it may not be the last." For Garcia and her family, Character.AI chatbots using Setzer's likeness felt not just cruel but also exploitative. TJLP told Ars that "businesses have taken ordinary peoples’ pictures and used them—without consent—for their own gain" since the "advent of mass photography." Tech companies using chatbots and facial recognition products "exploiting peoples’ pictures and digital identities" is the latest wave of these harms, TJLP said. A Character.AI spokesperson told Ars that the flagged chatbots violate their terms of service and have been removed. The spokesperson also suggested they would monitor for more bots posing as Setzer, noting that "as part of our ongoing safety work, we are constantly adding to our Character blocklist with the goal of preventing this type of Character from being created by a user in the first place."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia will procure “several hundred billion” dollars’ worth of chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, CEO Jensen Huang said. The chip designer will source these products from suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn, which can manufacture its latest systems in the U.S., Huang told the Financial Times (FT) in a report posted Thursday (March 20). By doing so, Nvidia will avoid tariffs and will improve the resiliency of its supply chain, according to the report. Nvidia has been highly dependent on TSMC’s manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, which are subject to the risks of threats from China, earthquakes and potential U.S. tariffs, the report said. Huang also said that the Trump administration’s policies will give a boost to Nvidia’s efforts to build data centers, which require vast amounts of energy, per the report. Huang’s remarks follow announcements from some other tech companies that are increasing their investment in the U.S. The company’s plan includes hiring 20,000 workers and opening a manufacturing facility in Houston to make servers to support its artificial intelligence (AI) system, Apple Intelligence. The company also said it plans to keep expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, while opening the “Apple Manufacturing Academy” in Detroit to help companies pivot to advanced manufacturing. The company’s latest investment plans include three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and design (R&D) team center. The investment is expected to support 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years and create tens of thousands of tech jobs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The app began piloting the feature in Texas last year, and said the AMBER Alerts on the platform were viewed more than 20 million times. Despite facing an uncertain future in the US, TikTok has continued to add features geared toward child safety, such as telling teen users to “wind down” after 10PM.



In addition to the automatic AMBER Alert notifications sent to phones in the US, other apps have also added AMBER Alerts over the years, with both Uber and Waze bringing them to their platforms in 2015.

The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin swear there’s no secret “kill switch” that they can flip to remotely disable the F-35 fighter jet. Rumors of a magic button the U.S. can use to turn off one of its most advanced and expensive weapons exports have circulated widely online over the past month. While the F-35 has no easy “off” button it is a complicated machine that requires constant American support and fears of a kill-switch reflect real anxieties in its allies and customers. Sure the aircraft gets into a lot of accidents but that hasn’t stopped manufacturer Lockheed Martin from selling them all over the planet. Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Israel, and several other countries have purchased the jet. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that he is reviewing its current contract to acquire the fighters and might reconsider, given the “geopolitical environment.” Carney is following the lead of Portugal’s defense minister who said something similar earlier this month. Neither of them mentioned a kill switch, but the rumor began to circulate online in defense circles. “The program operates under well-established agreements that ensure all F-35 operators have the necessary capabilities to sustain and operate their aircraft effectively. Lockheed Martin posted a copy of the statement on X. “After weeks of speculation, the Pentagon formally denies having the ability to remotely disable @LockheedMartin’s F-35 fighter jets.” — F-35 Lightning II (@thef35) March 18, 2025 In its own words, the jet “operates under well-established agreements,” its strength “lies in its global partnership,” and JPO “[remains] committed to providing all users with the full functionality and support they require.” In other words, the F-35 doesn’t fly unless JPO helps you, but don’t worry because it’s committed to helping. Weapons this advanced require a lot of maintenance and support. As The War Zone put it: you don’t need a kill switch to hobble exported F-35s. Pieces of the jet are made in Texas, Italy, and Japan. Lockheed Martin designed and sold the F-35 in an environment where many of these international relationships were rock solid. The jet relies on a proprietary system called Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) and the forthcoming successor Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN), a cloud-based networking system that manages a lot of the jet’s systems. “It’s not just a matter of ‘updating software,’” OSINT analyst Bill Sweetman said in a post on X. It provides known target characteristics for the fusion engine that IDs targets with minimal emissions. It runs comms, hosts the electronic order of battle.” Only one country has escaped the F-35 software and logistics trap while still being able to fly the jet: Israel. The IDF’s contract for the jet allows it to operate its own software systems without ALIS/ ODIN and conduct its own maintenance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Consumer advocates and the families of Tesla crash victims both called on Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy this week not to weaken oversight of the automotive industry. As with other government agencies, since the change of administrations in January, much of the messaging from the Department of Transportation has been on overturning regulations on industry and weakening oversight and consumer protection to create a "level... playing field."

On Tuesday, seven family members of people killed or seriously injured as a result of Tesla's Autopilot driver assist wrote to Sec. Duffy with a particular concern: that he not overturn the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Standing General Order that requires automakers or operators to report vehicle crashes that occurred while using a partially automated driving system (like Tesla Autopilot or FSD) or an autonomous driving system (like Waymo's robotaxis).

In particular, the families are concerned that Duffy will give special treatment to Tesla's Elon Musk, who these days is busier poking his fingers into all corners of the federal government than he is running Tesla or SpaceX.

"We fear this important measure is under threat given recent media reports and the influence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose company operates the most widely used Level 2 ADAS [advanced driver assistance] systems in America," the families wrote.

NHTSA has logged more than 1,800 crashes involving Autopilot and FSD since 2019, and at least 54 people have been killed as a result of using the systems. This has led the families to ask Sec.

is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid. Unlike those digital notebooks, which are appealing because they lack traditional displays, the XP-Pen Magic Note Pad uses a full-color LCD instead of E Ink. The tablet attempts to emulate the E Ink experience with three quick-access color modes, including a black-and-white option. XP-Pen says the Magic Note Pad’s nano-etched surface reduces reflection and glare while also simulating the feel of a pen on paper. It has a “Light Color Mode” that reduces the screen’s saturation to create an experience that sounds closer to how colors might appear on E Ink devices like the Kindle Colorsoft. The “Ink Paper Mode” discards color altogether. All three modes are accessible using a dedicated button on the side of the tablet. The Magic Note Pad includes a magnetic dock for its stylus built into the screen bezel. The included X3 Pro Pencil 2 stylus, which magnetically attaches to a dock on the side of the Magic Note Pad, uses the same electromagnetic resonance technology as Wacom’s pens, so it never needs to be charged. The Magic Note Pad is available through XP-Pen’s online store for $439.99 but is discounted for a limited time to $359.99.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

You were relaxed, at ease, when, without warning, your smartphone has been overflowed with notifications. And this is what led me to pass my phone in silent mode 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. Learn more about the use of personal data Yes, this new feature is designed specifically to prevent applications from submerging users with too many notifications at the same time. What I appreciate in limitation of notifications is that it helps me not to miss important notifications because my smartphone was in silent mode (which happened to me quite often). Once activated, this function automatically drops the volume and minimize the alerts (up to 2 minutes) when several notifications arrive in a short time. For example, one of your friends discovers a new restaurant that you absolutely have to try. If the notification limitation function is activated, this avalanche of texts will be in silence. The drawback, however, is that this reduction in notifications cannot be personalized (so far). In addition, this feature appeared for the first time on Pixel devices. But it should be extended to other devices over time. The limitation of notifications does not apply either to alarms, emergency alerts and priority conversations. What you need: to use the limitation of notifications, you will need a Pixel operating device operating (at least) with the March 2025 update. Hopefully the functionality will soon arrive on other Android devices. Under the general category, you will see limitation of notifications. You may find that the function is activated by default. It was originally believed that the limitation of notifications would not happen before Android 16. I suppose that this is another reason why I chose to continue using Pixel smartphones: they generally have the trendy early. And now, my friends in love with Android, everything there is to know about the limitation of notifications.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

March Madness is upon us yet again as the NCAA basketball tournament kicks off in earnest: 68 teams facing off in a series of matchups until only one champion is left standing. Millions of sports fans take part by creating their own bracket predictions. Online advice abounds, from amateur enthusiasts to professional sports analysts at media giants. But what if you're just looking to, say, beat the office pool, or you don't want to simply blindly follow the seedings or predictions of those elaborate models? What simpler strategies might one employ to gain an edge in a crowded field? Albert Cohen of Michigan State University, who specializes in statistics and actuarial science, including sports analytics, isn't a gambler himself. (Someone who "looks at life based on risk" is understandably rather risk-averse when it comes to gambling.) But he did offer Ars some insight into the science of "bracketology," along with a few handy general tips.

Plex, the self-serve streaming service that has been powering up millennial nerd home libraries for what seems like ages, announced upcoming price changes for later next month in an astonishingly bashful fashion. The company laid out its plans in a remorseful blog post about what would soon befall longtime users. Plex is increasing the price of everything, including now charging for what will soon be its former best free feature: remote playback. “This price increase will ensure that we can keep investing dedicated resources in developing new features, while supporting and growing your favorites,” swears Plex. Plex is letting new users lock into that fee before the deadline. The company laid out a roadmap to show that all this change is for growth. Plex plans to bring more parent-focused content through the pipeline as part of its cooperation with Common Sense Media. (I’m sure Plex noticed most millennial parents’ libraries turning into living shrines dedicated to Disney, PBS, and Nickelodeon’s cast of characters.) Plex also plans to introduce a new app for desktop and mobile users, and it’s working on an open API that pulls in more metadata about what you’re watching. Plex doesn’t even mention the upcoming changes to remote playback until it gets through all this—about two complete scrolls through the webpage on a computer monitor. Soon if you’re not at home and want to play your Plex library and don’t already pay for a subscription you’ll have to pay for remote playback. Plex will offer a Remote Watch Pass tier for $2/month or $20/year. Apparently Plex isn’t immune to the price increases happening industry-wide. Other streaming services have also raised subscription prices, which is only easier to swallow because there’s a big corporation gatekeeping all that content. Plex libraries are personally curated by the people who put them together. This change with Plex comes at a less than convenient time in my life.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/handmaids-tale-season-1-2025-politics-trump-2000578392'>Handmaid's Tale's First Season Still Feels Uncomfortably Timely in 2025</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 14:45:05 <p>
For all the show’s initial acclaim, many fans had sort of forgotten about it; not entirely surprising, since season five wrapped up all the way back in 2022. With its final installment on the way, we decided to look back at that fiery first season—and realized just how chillingly believable its bleak alt-reality has become. When The Handmaid’s Tale first arrived on Hulu in April 2017, at least half of America was primed and ready for a dystopian series depicting a worst-case-scenario for the country. President Donald Trump had been inaugurated into his first term a few months prior, and everyone who’d voted for Hillary Clinton (or worse, apathetically sat out the election) had already started to contort into the cringe-ball posture they’d frequently find themselves in over the next four years. The Handmaid’s Tale, with its themes of feminist rage in the face of extreme oppression, tapped into frustrations that many politically progressive people felt that spring. The show provided a shiver-inducing but often cathartic viewing experience; week to week, June—or “Offred,” as Elisabeth Moss’ character is first introduced, having been forced to take the name of the man who has enslaved her as a breeding vessel—adapted to her grim new normal while silently plotting revenge or psyching herself up to survive. In the world of The Handmaid’s Tale, the United States is now called “Gilead.” It’s a society ruled by far-right Christian conservatives, where paranoia and suspicion guide every conversation, and men with machine guns and black vans roam the streets looking for dissidents… or really, anyone who dares to stick a toe out of line. The linguistic tics of Gilead—”Under his eye,” “Praise be,” “May the Lord open,” and so on—and the red dresses and white caps worn by June and her fellow handmaids immediately took their place in pop culture, with the distinctive costumes popping up at women’s rights protests, particularly when reproductive rights were involved, but also in more lighthearted contexts, including among cosplayers at San Diego Comic-Con. The Handmaid’s Tale, in other words, was an immediate hit; at the 2017 Emmys, it became the first streaming release to be named Outstanding Drama Series, alongside wins for Moss and her co-stars Ann Dowd and Alexis Bledel, as well as for the show’s writing, directing, cinematography, and production design. Eight years later, the culture has again shifted—much farther to the right than it perhaps ever has been, and that includes Ronald Reagan’s 1980s, when Margaret Atwood’s source-material novel was first published. In 2022, Roe vs. Wade was overruled by a Supreme Court that had scuttled far-right during Trump’s first presidency; just a few months ago, Trump took office for his second term and the mood out of Washington, D.C. has rarely felt so extreme as it does now… at least outside of dystopian fiction, that is. “What did they do?” is the natural audience reaction, until it becomes clear that they’re being hunted because in a world where fertility rates have nearly bottomed out, children are seen as rare prizes, and women who’ve given birth to healthy kids are imprisoned as handmaidens, raped over and over until they conceive again. Once this initial horror sinks in, viewers realize The Handmaid’s Tale is in fact a parade of horrors, with rights ripped away from everyone who doesn’t conform to Gilead’s strict moral standards. Some of these memories are happy—time spent with her family and friends, including Moira (Samira Wiley), who loses her own partner in the “dyke purges” and ends up in handmaid training camp alongside June. We learn that some people, including the wife and child of another lesbian handmaid, Alexis Bledel’s Emily, managed to escape to Canada when things started getting bad, and Canada emerges as an important second location through the series. We learn she was a powerful conservative leader and author in the “before,” but was swiftly shunted into a subservient role in the culture she helped create. Gradually, things that felt like well-entrenched parts of everyday life began to change. One day, June’s debit card was declined at the local coffee shop, and she learned women were no longer allowed to have bank accounts or own property.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

IBM is cutting thousands of jobs across multiple locations in the U.S., and its Cloud Classic unit hit especially hard, reports The Register. Employees from several departments, including consulting, cloud infrastructure, corporate social responsibility, internal IT, and sales, have been affected. Some learned of their termination through individual notifications, while others heard about it in internal meetings. This platform provides a range of services, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking solutions, all operating within a traditional cloud environment. This platform offers improved hardware, increased network performance (200 Gbps vs 25 Gbps), greater flexibility in resource management, and enhanced security features compared to the Classic. For example, IBM has significantly more open roles in India than in the U.S., which reinforces suggestions that much of the work is being outsourced. It also cut some 10% of staff in the Cloud group, as noted above. One such policy is a new requirement for workers to be physically present in offices at least three days a week, with badge swipes being tracked. Also, instead of laying workers off, IBM asks them to sign a separation agreement, which reduces the company's risks. The Register's sources suggest that IBM's restructuring is far from over. The company is expected to continue layoffs as it chases acquisitions and phases out roles deemed obsolete or better suited for offshore teams. Employees remaining after this round of cuts are bracing for further reductions as IBM shifts its workforce strategy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"We live in a supernovae cemetery," he commented during his presentation. The scenario in which what remains of a supernova comes into contact with the earth's surface does not necessarily imply a planetary catastrophe. Some of these debris have reached the earth. The Fields team has sought effective methods for decades to detect them. For researchers, these still active exotic elements are the supernovae test that occurred in recent history and near the earth. One of the most recent studies of Fields, published in September 2024 in the Astrophysical Journal magazine, suggests that at least two supernovaes have occurred near the Earth: the first three million years ago at a distance between 50 and 65 Parsec and the second seven million years ago at 100 Parsec (a Parsec equivalent to 3.26 light years). In this case, the Kilonova who produced Plutonio isotopes is prior to the two supernovae already under study. The Fields working group advances a hypothesis to explain the presence this "cocktail" of space isotopes on earth. The next shipments to our natural satellite will bring back champions of this material, which in part could be used to look for iron isotopes and plutonium.

Footage of Haro’s death has since been removed from the platform, but the incident was briefly listed in its trending tab. In the hours after Haro’s death, people created dozens of memecoins—a type of highly volatile crypto coin used as a vector for financial speculation—modeled after him. Sensing an opportunity to profit, traders piled into one of the coins in particular, driving its value to $2.1 million in aggregate. (The coin has since lost 96 percent of its value.) On X, some tried to argue that whoever was behind the MistaFuccYou coin had duly granted Haro’s final wish. Speculation ran rampant on X that Haro had ended his life because he had lost money to a memecoin rugpull—a maneuver whereby somebody creates a new coin, promotes it online, then sells off their holdings in one swoop, devaluing everyone else’s stake. “It had nothing to do with crypto … It’s not what all these crypto nerds seem to think,” one of Haro’s friends, who goes by j nova on social media, told WIRED. “We’ve reached the point where the most potentially exciting launch that people are looking at is Kanye trying to launch a swastika coin,” says Khan, in reference to now-deleted X posts made by an account associated with the artist Kanye West. Until last year, launching a memecoin was relatively expensive and technically burdensome, which meant few came to market.

These will use the same GB202 die that goes into Nvidia's RTX 5090 graphics card, but with some significant changes in some of the other aspects. There will be three variants of the RTX Pro 6000: the Blackwell Workstation Edition, Max-Q Workstation Edition, and Blackwell Server Edition. You get 188 SMs enabled, out of a potential 192 maximum from GB202. Clock speeds weren't given, but Nvidia does list up to 125 TFLOPS of FP32 compute via the shaders, and 4000 AI TOPS from the tensor cores. That works out to a boost clock of around 2.6 GHz, but that won't be the same for all three variants. The RTX Pro 6000 features the full 128MB L2 cache of GB202, along with four NVENC and four NVDEC video blocks. RTX 5090 only has 96MB of L2 cache and three each for NVENC/NVDEC. It's very close to a fully enabled chip, with only 2% of the SMs disabled. As discussed in the initial RTX Pro 6000 announcement, Nvidia uses 24Gb (3GB) GDDR7 chips rather than the 2GB chips used on the consumer GeForce RTX 50-series cards. That increases the memory capacity to 48GB per PCB side, and with chips on both sides of the PCB in 'clamshell' mode, there's 96GB total.

The Blackwell Workstation Edition looks basically the same as the RTX 5090, except with a glossy black finish in places rather than a matte black. You also get four DisplayPort 2.1b outputs, whereas the 5090 typically offers at least one HDMI 2.1b output. Half the power will naturally mean lower typical boost clocks for a lot of workloads, though there will undoubtedly be cases where it will still run nearly as fast as the 600W card. It also has a standard FHFL (full-height, full-length) dual-slot form factor with dual-blower fans at the back of the card. Finally, the Blackwell Server Edition has a similar form factor to the Max-Q card but ditches the fans, instead relying on the server fans to provide airflow and cooling. That's usually in ample supply for servers, and noise levels are usually less of a concern — you get high RPM fans moving lots of air in a regulated environment to make everything run sufficiently cool. The power on the Server Edition is configurable up to 600W, so some installations might opt for lower power to optimize the efficiency if they're power-limited. All three models use the same 16-pin connector found on desktop RTX cards. Servers and workstations tend to be built to much tighter specifications, and so far there haven't been any widespread reports of servers or workstations with melting connectors. That suggests perhaps that the biggest issues with 16-pin connectors are component quality and proper installation — companies are less likely to cheap out on the cables in a server or workstation, so there aren't impurities causing hot spots and melting. Pricing hasn't been discussed, but we typically see professional and server solutions like the RTX Pro 6000 selling for 4X~5X more than the equivalent consumer GPUs. It wouldn't be surprising if the various RTX Pro 6000 cards cost $10,000 or more. We'll find out exactly where they fall in the coming days.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Digital Foundry found playing the game on “Performance” settings for regular PS5 results in what may be the worst way to experience Ubisoft’s beautiful but awkward stealth action title. For PS5 consoles, Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers three main graphics options: “Performance,” “Balanced,” and “Fidelity” modes. What setting you chose can have a drastic impact on how your game looks. This is down to whether Performance mode on either console supports ray traced global illumination, or RTGI. This setting is available in Shadows’ Performance mode on the PS5 Pro, but not Sony’s base $500 console. Without those lighting settings Shadows can look flat and drab. I can’t emphasize enough how important the visuals are to whether you’ll fully enjoy Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Invariably, those who spent more money on their PlayStation are getting a far better experience at 60 FPS. It’s far more dramatic a change than on other games, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. I’ve played games on both consoles, like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and while there are subtle difference in lighting, the game still maintains its overall look across both consoles at 4K resolution. We expect future games will make better PlayStation 5 Pro’s updated GPU architecture. Now, console gamers can feel the same FOMO pressure PC gamers have whenever they stare longingly at ray tracing toggles in a games’ options menu wondering “how much do I really need 60 FPS?”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Unfortunately, the answer isn’t what most Apple fans want to hear. According to Ookla’s benchmarks, the Apple C1 did not exactly beat out Qualcomm. This is because Speedtest data found that the C1 performed better on some networks than others. For instance, the iPhone 16e achieved faster speeds on AT&T and Verizon’s networks but was noticeably slower on T-Mobile’s network. The company says, “Performance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.” To be fair, the C1 is Apple’s first attempt at creating its own modems. Apple bought Intel’s smartphone modem business years ago, so for its acquisition to finally bear fruit is good progress. We’re hearing reports that Apple is working on an update to the C1, which will support mmWave. Either way, it’s still kind of impressive that Apple got this close to Qualcomm’s results despite it being its first modem. Hopefully, we’ll see more improvements in future iterations. Apple will continue using Qualcomm’s modems until 2027, which is when its licensing deal runs out. This means that Apple will use a mix of its own modems and Qualcomm’s modems in its upcoming iPhones.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After a year of regulatory blocking, Meta AI is now accessible in Europe on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Meta's AI assistant must help user exchanges in its products. All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data Consequently, the European version of Meta AI has been adapted. It is currently limited to textual conversations and therefore does not offer certain features available in the United States. Best for customer service via the Messenger or Instagram canal? The fact remains that this type of AI functionality in messaging applications is eagerly awaited by companies that use Facebook or Instagram as their customer service. This deployment could allow, for example, an actor in e-commerce to better automate his first-level responses on Messenger, including the availability of products or order monitoring. According to an Opinionway survey for Esker in December 2024, more than half (56 %) of customer service managers sees AI as an opportunity on the French customer service market. But due to European regulations, Meta AI in Europe does not currently offer the generation and editing of images, and does not allow questions to be asked from photos.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Enriching lithium has been an environmental catastrophe, but researchers in Texas believe they’ve found a way to do it cheaply and at scale without poisoning the world. Tritium is rare and radioactive so reactors currently “breed” it on demand to generate energy. They breed the tritium by bombarding lithium isotopes with neutrons. Most lithium on the planet, more than 90% of it, is lithium-7. “As such, modern reactor designs are based on breeding blankets with enriched 6Li isotope that has to be specifically extracted from natural lithium.” You can turn naturally abundant mixtures of lithium isotopes into Lithium-6, “enriching” it, but the process is a toxic nightmare. Mercury is a toxic nightmare substance that’s difficult to clean up. The team decided to see if it could harvest Lithium-6 from mixtures of Lithium isotopes without mercury. “Our approach uses the essential working principles of lithium-ion batteries and desalination technologies,” Banerjee said. “We insert Li-ions from flowing water streams within the one-dimensional tunnels of zeta-V2O5…our selective Li sponge has a subtle but important preference for 6Li over 7Li that affords a much safer process to extract lithium from water with isotopic selectivity.” Banerjee this could lead to a massive change in how fuel is developed for fusion generators. It also doesn’t require a massive re-design of the existing reactors. However, to be clear we are not redesigning the actual reactors—tokamaks or stellarators—although there is tremendous recent excitement about new innovations and designs in plasma physics,” he said. A lot of people are banking on fusion being the path towards cheap and abundant energy. “Despite the incredible challenges, fusion is too big of a prize to give up on,” he said. “The transformative potential has been clear but there have been critical gaps in engineering designs, materials science for extreme environments, and understanding of the complexity of plasma processes to enumerate just a few gaps. There is an intensifying global competition and billions of dollars in private and public investments—while still not imminent, there are promising signs of realistic fusion energy in about two or three decades.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Today we’re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have said that any violence aimed at Tesla vehicles or property would be prosecuted as domestic terrorism. This is very Trump, in that there is not actually a specific federal domestic terrorism law, but you know… Trump. In any case, these protests seem like they’re working; Tesla’s stock price has been sinking, new car registrations are down, and merely owning one has become uncomfortably political for a lot of people. We’re also seeing the hype around the company fading in ways that are frankly surprising — popular YouTubers are pointing out that vehicles like the Cybertruck simply aren’t very good and that Tesla’s missed ship dates and big claims about the capabilities of its self-driving tech don’t really hold up. And if the hype fades enough, it’s possible to break Tesla itself — it’s sky-high stock price is entirely based on hype, after all. Niedermeyer published a book about Tesla in 2019 called Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, and he hosts a podcast called Autonocast, about autonomous vehicle technology. His sizable following on Bluesky has also made him one of the leading organizers of the Tesla protests in Portland, Oregon, where he lives.

The new feature is part of a recent BIOS firmware update for Asus AMD 800 Series motherboards. This increase in FCLK enhances the bandwidth of data transfers within the CPU architecture, which Asus says facilitates more efficient processing of large datasets commonly associated with LLMs. This feature is tailored for AI enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals who utilize AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors, specifically those with AMD 3D V-Cache Technology, like the recently launched Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Asus says it is particularly beneficial for users engaged in AI workloads that involve processing massive datasets, such as training and deploying large language models. While the feature can technically be enabled alongside other BIOS settings like GPU Boost, doing so may compromise overall system stability without delivering any noticeable benefit in gaming scenarios. By activating both Game Turbo and AI Cache Boost modes, disabling simultaneous multi-threading, and deactivating one CCD (Core Complex Die) on Ryzen processors, Asus says AI performance can be pushed even further. Asus conducted internal testing using a system equipped with ROG Crosshair X870E Hero motherboards, Nvidia RTX 5090 or 4090 GPUs, and Ryzen CPUs with AMD 3D V-Cache, showing performance uplifts in various AI benchmarks. The uplift was similarly positive when tested with previous-gen RTX 4090 GPUs, showing a boost of up to 7.57%. As mentioned earlier, Asus says combining AI Cache Boost with Turbo Game Mode can yield even higher gains. This combination is particularly beneficial for AI users whose tasks don’t fully utilize the CPU's multithreading capabilities.

Or have a private conversation in public without other people hearing you? Our newly published research introduces a way to create audible enclaves – localized pockets of sound that are isolated from their surroundings. In other words, we’ve developed a technology that could create sound exactly where it needs to be. The ability to send sound that becomes audible only at a specific location could transform entertainment, communication and spatial audio experiences. Certain audio technologies, such as parametric array loudspeakers, can create focused sound beams aimed in a specific direction. However, these technologies will still emit sound that is audible along its entire path as it travels through space. Because ultrasound can penetrate through many materials and interact with objects in unique ways, it’s widely used for medical imaging and many industrial applications. In our work, we used ultrasound as a carrier for audible sound. It can transport sound through space silently – becoming audible only when desired. Normally, sound waves combine linearly, meaning they just proportionally add up into a bigger wave. However, when sound waves are intense enough, they can interact nonlinearly, generating new frequencies that were not present before. This is the key to our technique: We use two ultrasound beams at different frequencies that are completely silent on their own. But when they intersect in space, nonlinear effects cause them to generate a new sound wave at an audible frequency that would be heard only in that specific region. Crucially, we designed ultrasonic beams that can bend on their own. Normally, sound waves travel in straight lines unless something blocks or reflects them. However, by using acoustic metasurfaces – specialized materials that manipulate sound waves – we can shape ultrasound beams to bend as they travel. By precisely controlling the phase of the ultrasound waves, we create curved sound paths that can navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location. The key phenomenon at play is what’s called difference frequency generation. This means you can deliver audio to a specific location or person without disturbing other people as the sound travels. For example, museums could provide different audio guides to visitors without headphones, and libraries could allow students to study with audio lessons without disturbing others. In a car, passengers could listen to music without distracting the driver from hearing navigation instructions. Offices and military settings could also benefit from localized speech zones for confidential conversations. Despite these hurdles, audio enclaves present a fundamental shift in sound control. By redefining how sound interacts with space, we open up new possibilities for immersive, efficient and personalized audio experiences.

It’s hard to picture the universe in its infancy. The middle-aged cosmos now stretches across 93 billion light-years, holding up to two trillion galaxies and more than 200 billion trillion stars. As a baby, the universe was essentially a hot, dense soup of particles, which has been expanding and cooling over billions of years. “By looking back to that time when things were much simpler, we can piece together the story of how our universe evolved to the rich and complex place we find ourselves in today,” Jo Dunkley, physics and astrophysical sciences professor at Princeton University, and the ACT analysis leader, said in a statement. This is the earliest cosmic time accessible to our viewing. That’s because light would frequently scatter off of free electrons, making the universe opaque. It wasn’t until 380,000 years after the Big Bang when particles began to combine, allowing light to travel freely and ending the cosmic dark ages. This allowed scientists to estimate the temperature, density, and velocity of the swirling material that occupied the baby universe, gauging just how much of it was there before it began forming galaxies and stars. “We are seeing the first steps towards making the earliest stars and galaxies,” Suzanne Staggs, director of ACT and professor of physics at Princeton University, said in a statement. “A younger universe would have had to expand more quickly to reach its current size, and the images we measure would appear to be reaching us from closer by,” Mark Devlin, professor of astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, and ACT’s deputy director, said in a statement. The team was also able to measure more precisely that the universe extends out to about 50 billion light-years in all directions away from us, and contains as much mass as 1,900 zetta-suns, or the equivalent of almost two trillion trillion Suns. Rather than coming up with new theories, the measurements confirm that it’s business as usual for our surrounding cosmos. The results are in and it looks very healthy,” David Spergel, professor of astronomy at Princeton University, said in a statement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/nvidia-dati-sintetici-acquisizione-gretel/'>Nvidia, the synthetic data are the new frontier</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 13:27:03 <p>
Nvidia acquired the Gretel synthetic data company for a figure in the order of billions of dollars, according to two people directly aware of the agreement. Gretel and its team of about 80 employees will become part of Nvidia, which will insert the company's technology in its growing suite of generative artificial intelligence services based on cloud and aimed at developers. Nvidia has already started developing and putting tools on the market for the generation of synthetic data, which allow developers to train their AI models and develop them for specific applications. In theory, synthetic data could create an almost infinite reserve of data for training and help to solve the problem of the scarcity of data that has looked in the sector since Chatgpt has become a commonly used system in 2022. The spokesperson of Nvidia and Gretel did not want to provide comments for this article. Gretel was founded in 2019 by Alex Watson, John Myers and Ali Goldhan, who still plays the role of CEO. The startup offers a synthetic data platform and a suite of bees to developers who want to build models of generative but do not have access to a sufficient number of training data or would meet privacy problems using information from real people. Gretel does not build or licensed border models, but perfects existing open source systems by adding privacy and safety functions. According to its supporters, this approach makes the generation of the data necessary to build models of the most scalable, less demanding and more accessible to smaller developers or with less resources. Among the strengths there is also the protection of privacy, which makes synthetic data an interesting option for those who provide health services, banks and government agencies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There's nothing like retro gaming on the Raspberry Pi but we haven't quite seen a gaming rig like this. This project, created by maker and developer John Park is using our favorite SBC — the Raspberry Pi 5 — to drive a cool wall arcade featuring RGB LED matrix panels as the main display. According to Park, this setup doesn't just look the part. You can actually play games on the system like a real arcade using wired USB controllers. It can run demos with cool retro-style animations but also play a few homebrew games that are created using the PICO-8 Fantasy console. The hardware is housed inside of an Ikea Sannahed picture frame which has been fitted with some custom 3D-printed components to mount everything together. It's connected to four 64 x 64px HUB75 RGB LED matrix panels via an Adafruit RGB matrix bonnet that makes short work of proving power and data to the display. For user input, it relies on a couple of USB controllers. It's compatible not only with the Raspberry Pi but also Mac and Windows machines.

An Asus exec at GTC 2025 has shown off what might be both the ultimate PC collector's item and the most valuable consumer graphics card on Earth. We think this lavish gold graphics card sample is probably worth over $16,000 after looking at previous auctions. As Cheng points out above, this 'Golden ROG RTX 5090 Astral' is now one of its kind, bearing Jensen's autograph and his "RTX ON!" As a reminder of the calibre of product we have in the photo, you can check back through our extensive RTX 5090 review, and recap the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 Dhahab OC Edition story we ran in February (linked top). The ROG Astral line is a new quad-fan flagship family from Asus, and an RTX 5090 OC model carries an official MSRP of $3,099, which is over 50% more expensive than a reference design. This Middle Eastern exclusive will obviously carry a further price premium to the $3,099. Add in Jensen's autograph, and the sample graphics card in our picture will surely be worth a king's ransom. Jensen seems to be pretty open to signing things from fans willy-nilly, which is nice but could limit future collector valuations.

Lately, Valnet has been seeking credibility in Hollywood, such as with a March 11 screening Q&A and red carpet event at The Grove in Los Angeles, featuring Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer in honor of “the launch of music divisions on Collider and ScreenRant,” as a press release noted. When Valnet takes over a fan site, the playbook is well established: employees are replaced by contractors, compensation plummets and writers who complain land on a blacklist that blocks them from working for Valnet sites altogether. TheWrap spoke to 15 current and former contributors who said Valnet routinely exploits and discards writers while prioritizing mass quantity over quality to churn out mind-numbing SEO bait. “Everyone is underpaid, overworked and really pretty — extremely — exploited,” a former Collider contributor told TheWrap. “They are a company without clear objectives or morals who present themselves as a safe haven for young and experienced writers, but they end up paying bargain-basement rates and forcing contractors to create junky clickbait,” a former Valnet contributor told TheWrap on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Now one of those freelancers has filed a lawsuit claiming oppressive work conditions, and is seeking to establish a class action against Valnet. Daniel Quintiliano’s suit seeks $40,000 for violations including failing to pay minimum wage, overtime, provide meal or rest breaks and reimburse business expenses. Valnet may find it has few allies in the writing pool, because another operating tactic of the company is blacklisting those who are perceived as difficult. TheWrap has obtained a spreadsheet of more than 400 “2025 Blacklisted Freelancers,” as the document is titled. The list is a remarkable catalogue of criticism or perceived misconduct tracked meticulously. Another freelancer was blacklisted for “creating drama” by “discouraging a past writer from returning,” while others faced a Valnet ban for calling rates “abysmal” or requesting transparency. One freelancer who suggested Valnet include payment information in job listings was permanently banned. We support journalism and would gladly welcome your questions.” He did not respond to further emails or phone calls. “Valnet doesn’t care about exclusivity or quality,” said an insider familiar with digital publishing. They flood the market with stories optimized for clicks rather than insight or originality.” Hassan Youssef may be little-known in the clubby world of entertainment, and there’s a good reason for that. A civil engineer by training, he ventured into content creation after exiting an online porn business that he successfully built with his brother Sam and others, but that ended with a $6 million seizure of their funds by the Secret Service for alleged money laundering in 2009 before paying a $2.2 million fine. The origins of Valnet can be traced back to Montreal’s competitive foosball circuit, according to a 2011 New York Magazine investigative report titled, “The Geek-Kings of Smut.” In 2003, while still students, foosball players Matt Keezer, Stephane Manos, Sam Youssef and his brother Hassan decided to get into the world of online porn. Together, they started their first websites, with names like Jugg World, Ass Listing, KeezMovies and XXX Rated Chicks. The group rapidly expanded, creating their own affiliate network (Jugg Cash) and their own paysite, Brazzers — named after a private joke, a “throaty immigrant-Arabonics version of ‘brothers,’” according to the report. Sam Youssef emerged as the business visionary, while Manos handled sales and motivation. It was their mastery of SEO that would help them later, as they expanded to more outwardly legitimate fan sites, helping their sites consistently rank at the top of Google searches. In January 2007, Keezer bought the domain name pornhub.com for $2,750 and went online through a separate company called Interhub. But Interhub ran into trouble in 2009 when British teenager Rose Kalemba discovered her rape as a 14-year-old broadcast on Pornhub. Kalemba pleaded to have the content removed for over six months, but was ignored. Seeing myself being attacked where I wasn’t even conscious was the worst.” The video was finally removed after Kalemba set up a new email address posing as a lawyer and sent Pornhub an email threatening legal action. Their success in adult entertainment would ultimately provide the capital and the SEO playbook that Hassan Youssef would eventually apply a few years later in his pivot into mainstream digital media publishing. In October 2009, the U.S. Secret Service’s Organized Fraud Task Force seized $6.4 million from two Mansef bank accounts, according to New York magazine. Federal investigators uncovered over $9 million in wire transfers from Israel, and the feds said that had been wired into the two accounts over a three-month period from banks in Israel and other countries on financial-fraud watch lists. After selling Mansef in 2010, Hassan and Sam Youssef took some time off before launching new ventures. The Valnet sites serve passionate fans of film, television, video games and comics and need major scale traffic to make money off programmatic advertising. Hassan Youssef speaks onstage at Valnet’s 10th anniversary in Montreal , Canada. Remnants of the movie blog heydays of the late 2000s and 2010s when sites like Ain’t It Cool News made a mark, these Valnet-owned websites largely serve as fan-focused aggregation, commentary and listicle repositories focused on movies, TV, comic books and gaming. Many articles are designed to maximize consumer engagement (and fervent agreement or disagreement) with purposefully inflammatory headlines like “Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Perfect Replacement as the Terminator Is So Obvious, I Can’t Believe It Hasn’t Happened Yet.” The current state of these websites reflect a Valnet playbook to maximize clicks and revenue. The current rate for reviews is now even lower at $30. “But soon after Valnet got involved, that rate dropped to $40.” According to another former contributor, Collider maintains “a content mill, borderline like almost sweatshop-level” where hundreds of writers are “constantly being pushed to write more, to do it quicker,” while editors face “pretty high level of quotas” despite being understaffed. The former contributor also alleged a pattern of firing employees who questioned company practices and recalled being called into a meeting where the individual was told “you should quit if you think it’s so bad here.” She received no response from editors for six hours before getting an email announcing the termination of her contract. When her first paycheck failed to arrive on Nov. 1, Grant says her emails went unanswered for days until she received excuses that “it didn’t go through.” “I checked my PayPal account settings to make sure it wasn’t a problem on my end, and as a freelance writer, this was the only time I’ve ever had someone having a ‘problem’ paying me,” Grant said. According to the legal complaint filed by former MovieWeb writer Daniel Quintiliano, writers must submit to “Valnet’s complete and total discretion as to approval or revision of the work product” — a level of oversight that the lawsuit argues is inconsistent with independent contractor status under California law. Despite the intensive workload, he was paid only $15 per article with no additional compensation. Valnet continues to aggressively expand its portfolio of consumer-facing websites, sending acquisition inquiries and seeking legal releases from freelancers while CEO Hassan Youssef remains largely behind the scenes. The former Collider contributor said: “In journalism, there are really bad jobs. And then there is a place like Valnet,” adding it’s “one of the worst places that I’ve ever worked and is probably one of the worst journalism publications I’ve ever seen.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Its lack of mmWave support might be the only thing holding it back One interesting aspect of the iPhone 16e is that it uses Apple’s C1 modem. This is Apple’s first in-house 5G modem, and so far the iPhone 16e is the only device you’ll find it in. For median download speeds the iPhone 16e also comes out on top, at 217.64Mbps compared to 210.55Mbps on the iPhone 16. Notably though those upper speeds could be skewed by the fact that the iPhone 16e doesn’t support faster mmWave 5G, while Ookla suspects future versions of the C1 modem will support this. The iPhone 16e and its C1 modem are similarly impressive when looking at median upload speeds, having the iPhone 16 comfortably beat across all three tested carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T). This all is good news for Apple, since it suggests the company could switch to its in-house modem across all new iPhones without sacrificing speeds, and it’s all the more impressive as Apple claims the C1 is also more efficient than other iPhone modems, meaning it shouldn’t impact battery life as much.

YouTube is looking into an issue causing “lower than usual video quality” on iOS, desktop, and smart TVs. The platform says the apparent bug could make YouTube videos and shorts stream at 144p or 360p even with a strong internet connection.

Over the past week or so, many users on Reddit have reported having YouTube automatically set their video quality to low resolution. One user notes, “Every video I click on YouTube the quality automatically sets to 144p even if I try to manually change it higher, it just reverts back to 144p.”

Others found that when trying to switch to a higher video quality, the stream will start buffering. Trying to reset the device, changing the connection, or reinstalling the YouTube app doesn’t seem to help, either.

Though YouTube currently doesn’t have a fix, the company says it’s “actively looking into” the issue and will update its support thread with new information.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Demand for Nvidia's latest GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 — some of the best graphics cards money can buy these days — is so high that it is nearly impossible to get them at their recommended prices in the U.S. However, Nvidia seems to have a solution for attendees at its GPU Technology Conference: buy them on site. Nvidia has limited quantities of its enthusiast-grade GeForce RTX 5080 and flagship GeForce RTX 5090 add-in-boards (AIBs) available for purchase at their $999 and $1,999 recommended prices from its Nvidia gear van at GTC park. The graphics boards are available to conference pass ($1,145 for one day, or $2,295 for five days) and exhibit pass holders only, with a limit of one card per person. Finally, even Nvidia itself says that the boards are available spontaneously, in a kind of flash sale manner. On the one hand, Nvidia can sell more ultra-expensive B100/B200 GPUs for AI at circa $50,000 a piece. On the other hand, there are not enough graphics cards for enthusiasts (who generate positive buzz around the brand) and software developers (who work on next-generation software that will drive demand for Nvidia's products in the future). Selling 2,000 advanced GeForce RTX 50-series boards at GTC to some degree solves this problem and lays the cards in the hands to software developers. Of course, software makers with deep pockets are certainly looking forward to get Nvidia's DGX Station with GB300 Blackwell Ultra inside or the miniature GB10-based DGX Spark. The majority of developers will still use something more down-to-earth, which are GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards for desktops.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

During World War I, navies painted their ships in “dazzle” camouflage, also known as “razzle dazzle.” Unlike traditional camouflage, which helps objects blend into their surroundings, dazzle camouflage used stark geometric patterns to try to confuse German U-boat captains’ perception of a ship’s direction and speed, making it harder to target. Aston University researchers have investigated the efficacy of dazzle camouflage on WWI battleships by re-analyzing a 106-year-old study. In 1919, MIT naval architecture and marine engineering student Leo Blodgett conducted a study on dazzle camouflage for his thesis. Blodgett ultimately concluded that dazzle camouflage achieved its aim. More than a century later, however, researchers Timothy Meese and Samantha Strong expressed significant concerns about Blodgett’s methods. “It’s necessary to have a control condition to draw firm conclusions, and Blodgett’s report of his own control was too vague to be useful,” Strong, a senior lecturer in optometry, said in a university statement. More broadly, viewers underestimate this angle, even when it’s greater than 25 degrees. This indicates that another factor, beyond dazzle camouflage, was influencing the illusion. They identified the horizon effect and concluded it played a greater role in deceiving viewers than dazzle camouflage. The researchers “knew already about the twist and horizon effects” from a previous study that Meese, a professor of vision science, co-authored in 2024. However, “the remarkable finding here is that these same two effects, in similar proportions, are clearly evident in participants [from the 1919 study] familiar with the art of camouflage deception, including a lieutenant in a European navy,” Meese explained. In other words, the horizon effect hoodwinked even experienced individuals.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/space/629948/space-science-dei-diversity-nasa-trump'>Space science is under threat from the anti-DEI purge</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 12:00:00 <p>
The space science community has long prided itself on its ability to inspire and move people of all backgrounds, but President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders demanding the end of diversity programs have thrown that optimism into chaos. Those who remain at NASA are hiding symbols of LGBTQIA pride and removing pronouns from their email signatures. “Executive orders are not optional,” said Charles Webb, acting director of NASA’s planetary science division, at a conference on Monday, describing NASA as “racing to comply” with the orders. These changes demanded by the Trump administration are rolling back decades of evidence-supported work in diversity and outreach. Experts warn that these actions will impede scientific discovery; create a smaller, less creative, and more generic agency; and could even lead to more accidents and loss of life as people working on space missions don’t feel that they can speak out about problems that they see. Taking an axe to diversity programs isn’t making NASA a more efficient agency — it’s undermining the values of science. Those working within NASA are bound by the government’s whims, but the chilling impact of these changes is being felt far beyond civil service. The legality of Trump’s executive orders is up for debate, leaving individual federal grant recipients grappling with how to handle them. The Verge spoke to nine people working in space science (others declined to speak to the media out of concern for their positions), several of whom described receiving conflicting emails from their university employers on what work is or is not allowed, and on what initiatives are being supported, with guidance changing daily. Taking an axe to diversity programs isn’t making NASA a more efficient agency — it’s undermining the values of science. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has been widely seen as mishandling its response to the crisis by preemptively deleting content from its website related to diversity and then restoring it after criticism. Other groups like the Space Science Institute (SSI) have also removed pages about a commitment to diversity from its website. With NASA under threat of deep cuts, universities in damage control mode, and most professional organizations floundering, scientists are having to look outside their typical organizational structures to resist Trump’s executive meddling. It’ll have to come from the bottom up,” says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University. While they supported wider access to science for ethical and human reasons, they also emphasized that, in purely pragmatic terms, greater diversity among scientists leads to better science. “Scientific evidence for years has said diverse groups do better science,” she says. NASA previously embraced diversity because it was following the evidence, Rathbun says, and it adopted policies that enabled a range of voices in the room to question and challenge each other. That attitude has been largely embraced by space scientists of all backgrounds, who see the practical and ethical values in diversity. The 1986 Challenger disaster — in which seven crew members were killed when their Space Shuttle broke apart shortly after launch — was directly linked to a homogeneity of thought among NASA personnel. The agency’s lack of diverse perspectives fed into the tendency toward groupthink that contributed to the disaster, while research has shown that more cultural and ethnic diversity in groups leads to more creative and higher quality ideas — and lower risks for space missions. Diversity initiatives are necessary if the field is to accurately represent the US population, supporters say, noting that they have been making progress toward that goal. In planetary science, for example, a 2011 demographic survey found that only 25 percent of US researchers were women and just 1 percent were Black or Latinx. It’s actually trying to make a level playing field,” Byrne says. Bridenstine also issued a policy statement affirming commitment to equal opportunities within NASA and its partner institutions. NASA’s interest in diversity is neither new nor a purely left-wing phenomenon. In such circumstances, space scientists are finding their own ways to band together and resist. Sykes says he is committed to promoting diversity as a key value of the PSI. If that means federal funding dries up then they will look for other sources of money, perhaps even crowdfunding. He sees outreach and providing input on DEIA topics to be crucial work that they will keep doing, saying, “If NASA wants, or the government wants to go after us for doing that, then, well, the hell with them.” For Rathbun, who was active in programs like NASA’s now-suspended Here to Observe initiative that provided outreach for underrepresented students, she says she and her fellow scientists will be continuing their mentoring and support of these students, even if the official program is closed, and inviting them to meetings and workshops to let them know that there are still avenues open to them. Scientists are even taking it upon themselves to support their colleagues through mutual aid funding. The largely early career researchers who make up the Choir Collaboration, a group dedicated to studying galaxy evolution and promoting intersectionality in science, have started a mutual aid initiative and are collecting financial donations to be distributed to space scientists who have been affected by the cuts, especially those working in DEIA. “We view caring and enabling and fostering and uplifting DEIA initiatives, equity, diversity in science, as well as the people who are doing the science, as a part of our job description,” says Choir member Erini Lambrides of NASA Goddard. NASA’s interest in diversity is neither new nor a purely left-wing phenomenon. They described embarking on postdoc positions and having just a few hundred dollars in the bank, or hearing from colleagues who were told with less than a week’s notice that they might not be getting paid that month. No one becomes a space scientist for the money, but neither scientists can’t be expected to do good work when they can’t afford to pay their rent. That’s particularly true of those who come from marginalized backgrounds or who work in DEIA initiatives, which are often unfunded and are frequently considered by employers as not as worthwhile work for a scientist as, say, producing a highly cited paper. “Science is never done in isolation, right?” says Choir member Taylor Hutchison, also of NASA Goddard. There is a sense that workers at NASA and other federal agencies are being thrown under the bus in the name of a culture war, with their work being denigrated in a way that they don’t have the ability to refute. “Every time you talk to someone who actually works with career civil servants, you realize that overwhelmingly, they’re super motivated, well-meaning, passionate people,” said Byrne. “Many of us work in fields where we’re trying to challenge and break existing paradigms within our science,” Lambrides says. Because these are brand new problems we’re working on.” This isn’t the first time that scientists have seen their work disregarded, and researchers see a clear through-line in right wing attacks on scientific principles. “If you look at these executive orders in total, it’s an attack on science as a whole,” Rathbun says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data This survey, carried out with 4,066 people representative of the French population aged 12 and over, even reveals increased use compared to the previous edition. On average, the French spend about 4 hours a day in front of their screens, a quarter of the waking time. For one in four people, exposure to screens even exceeds 5 hours. The number one screen remains, of course, mobile. Notable fact, the elderly gradually fill their delay with a strong increase, ten points in one year in the 60-69 year olds (90 %) and hui points among 70s and over (70 %). The computer equipment rate is also increasing slightly (89 %, + 2 points), as well as that of the tablet (54 %, + 1 point). Connected speakers finally find their audience, with a third of the equipped population, a gain of 4 points in one year. More broadly, 40% of French people have at least one connected object linked to health, safety, home automation or household appliances. If many homes, executives and young people remain the most equipped, the proportion of non-graduates with a smartphone increased by 6 points in 2024 to 63 %. This multiplication of digital uses leads to abuse. On average, each household has around ten equipment with screen, two of which are unused and could be recycled or sold. If the lifespan of smartphones is lighter - more than a quarter of respondents keep their mobile more than 3 years against 16 % in 2020 -, the purchase of new phones remains the norm. Only 22 % of smartphones are bought second -hand or reconditioned. Likewise, we observe an inflation of the mobile packages swollen with data. And if the average consumption of data on mobile networks (16.5 GB per month and by SIM card) continues its progression, it is less sustained. Growth exceeded 10 % in 2024, against around 25 % per year between 2020 and 2023. The generalization of fiber optics accompanies this movement. Social networks monopolize their attention and relate to 75 % of Internet users, three points in one year. 62 % of users read the content published by others every day, but only 29 % share or comment daily, and 19 % publish personal content. 75 % of French people go on the internet to search for routes, 67 % to make a medical appointment, 31 % defend causes in the form of a petition, and 29 % look for accommodation or a job. After a decline in 2023, online purchases of non -food goods increased again in 2024 and concern 77 % of the population (+ 4 points). The second hand is a significant success: 53 % of French people have made at least one purchase or a sale on specialized sites, such as Le Bon Coin or Vinted, during the past year. Chatgpt phenomenon obliges, the use of artificial intelligence is progressing strongly. 33 % of French people used AI tools in 2024, compared to 20 % a year earlier. Uses in privacy dominate (26 %, +10 points in one year) and slightly exceed those related to professional life (22 %, also +10 points). Overall, two thirds of French people believe that digital technology facilitates their daily lives (+ 4 points). Almost 60 % of them consider that digital complicates or has no effect on their daily lives.

SoftBank Group today said it would acquire Ampere Computing, a developer of Arm-based datacenter CPUs, for $6.5 billion in cash. The company's roadmap includes launch of AmpereOne CPUs with up to 256 cores produced on TSMC's N3 fabrication process in 2025 and then moves to something more advanced in 2026. Also, Ampere Computing has to compete with Intel's Xeon CPUs — such as Sierra Forest with up to 144 cores and its successor Clearwater Forest in 2026 — and this is something particularly hard given the ample ecosystem available for x86 CPUs. However, as a statement from Ampere reads, the company "is expected to play a key role in future Softbank growth markets, including recently announced AI infrastructure investments like Stargate." Also, if other Stargate partners — OpenAI and Oracle — adopt Ampere's CPUs as a default choice for their datacenters, this could be a breakthrough for the company. "The future of Artificial Super Intelligence requires breakthrough computing power," said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. "Ampere's expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision, and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States." As part of the agreement, SoftBank will purchase Ampere for $6.5 billion in cash. Ampere’s major investors — Carlyle and Oracle — are divesting their stakes in the company. "With a shared vision for advancing AI, we are excited to join SoftBank Group and partner with its portfolio of leading technology companies," said Renée J. James, Founder and CEO of Ampere. "This is a fantastic outcome for our team, and we are excited to drive forward our AmpereOne roadmap for high performance Arm processors and AI."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data Mr. Zemlin began his intervention by declaring: "Open Source is now a fundamental element of modern IT, and IT pirates pay attention. In addition, we have seen a whole series of new regulations around open source appear, such as the Cyber-resilience law (CRA) of the European Union. Confidence not only means ensuring that software is secure, but also to verify the identity and intentions of contributors. The factors that could be taken into account in this evaluation are: Thus, for example, using such a system of confidence, by comparing Jia Tan to Greg Kroah-Hartman, the famous stable nucleus of Linux, we would see that Jia Tan would barely reach level 1. To build such a system, the Linux Foundation explores the First Person project, which aims to establish a decentralized accreditation system using blockchain technology.

A group, those responsible for the Linux kernel, already use this system. However, this system does not work so well that it told me Kroah-Hartman. Kroah-Hartman and Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, therefore plan to use another system. However, any system of this type must have a "low friction" so that it is easy to integrate new people. To achieve this, Mr. Zemlin called for the collaboration of large companies and free software communities to develop and implement these confidence mechanisms.

When Samsung dropped the Galaxy Watch Ultra last July, it was instantly compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 which had come out several months earlier. In fact, we compared them directly, and basically ruled this clash of flagship smartwatches to be a draw in terms of quality and performance. But when Samsung decides to make the Galaxy Watch Ultra available for as little as $325 with trade-in credit or $420 without (down from $649), suddenly the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is looking very pricey indeed. Either way, Samsung’s further sweetening the pot with great discounts on accessories, like 61% off a pair of Galaxy Buds3 or 41% off the Galaxy Buds3 Pro. The Galaxy AI-powered heart-rate monitor eliminates inaccuracies caused by motion, providing exceptionally precise readings. This is the watch for you if you’re a hardcore adventurer and/or watersports enthusiast, because it can take anything dished out by your active lifestyle. With 10 atmospheres of water resistance, it’s ideal for swimmers, divers, and kayakers, while hikers and climbers will appreciate enhanced GPS tracking and turn-by-turn navigation that ensures you never lose your way. You won’t have to worry about the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery running out at inopportune times — it has the longest battery life of any Samsung smartwatch to date. That means after it tracks your toughest workout, you’ll be ready for bed and the Galaxy Watch Ultra will still be up and running to monitor your sleep quality. Unless you have extreme brand loyalty to the Apple Watch or other fitness-oriented wearable, the option to buy Samsung’s newest flagship smartwatch for well under half the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when you max out the $325 trade-in credit offer is hard to pass up on, especially when you consider they are basically neck-and-neck in terms of performance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Yet there’s a corner of high culture where AI is taking on a starring role as hero, not displacing the traditional protagonists—art experts and conservators—but adding a powerful, compelling weapon to their arsenal when it comes to fighting forgeries and misattributions. AI is already exceptionally good at recognizing and authenticating an artist’s work, based on the analysis of a digital image of a painting alone. AI’s objective analysis has thrown a wrench into this traditional hierarchy. If an algorithm can determine the authorship of an artwork with statistical probability, where does that leave the old-guard art historians whose reputations have been built on their subjective expertise? In truth, AI will never replace connoisseurs, just as the use of x-rays and carbon dating decades ago did not. It is simply the latest in a line of high-tech tools to assist with authentication. A good AI must be “fed” a curated dataset by human art historians to build up its knowledge of an artist’s style, and human art historians must interpret the results. Such was the case in November 2024, when a leading AI firm, Art Recognition, published its analysis of Rembrandt’s The Polish Rider—a painting that famously confounded scholars and led to many arguments as to how much, if any of it, had actually been painted by Rembrandt himself. The so-called “CSI effect” describes how jurors perceive DNA evidence as more persuasive than even eyewitness testimony. But what happens when the owner of a work that, at first glance, looks totally inauthentic to the point of being laughable, recruits a slick firm with the task of gathering forensic evidence to support a preferable attribution? And yet, this dubious painting has become the center of a high-stakes battle for authenticity, one in which scientific analysis, market forces, and wishful thinking collide. The owners of the “Elimar Van Gogh,” as it has come to be derisively known in art circles, are now an art consultancy group called LMI International. The world of art authentication is not a straightforward affair. Unlike the hard sciences, art history deals in probabilities, connoisseurship, and competing expert opinions. It is also, crucially, an industry driven by financial incentives. If it’s deemed a fake, or rather in this case a derivative work by someone named Elimar who daubed a bit on canvas, distantly inspired by Van Gogh perhaps, but with none of his talents, it's virtually worthless—about as valuable as you might expect to find at a flea market in Minnesota for under 50 bucks.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia’s investment over the next four years is expected to reach nearly $500bn. Nvidia is reportedly planning a significant investment in semiconductor production and electronic components within the US. Huang, in an interview with the publication, indicated that a substantial portion of this investment could be directed towards domestic chip production. Nvidia has been addressing investor concerns about continued demand for its high-cost AI chips, particularly amid increased competition. Huang has confirmed that Nvidia’s latest AI systems can now be manufactured in the US through partnerships with major suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn. He noted that TSMC’s investment in US-based manufacturing represents a significant step towards strengthening supply chain resilience, reducing dependency on overseas production, and ensuring steady access to critical semiconductor components. He noted that orders for 3.6 million units from four major cloud firms underestimated overall market demand, as they did not account for purchases from Meta Platforms, smaller cloud providers, or AI-focused startups. Initially, AIP plans to unlock $30bn in capital, with total investment potential reaching $100bn when including debt financing. The initiative is expected to foster collaboration across a diverse network of investors, corporations, and technology firms, focusing on scalable AI solutions. The company expects gross margins to be around 70.6%, with operating expenses estimated at $5.2bn on a GAAP basis. It also anticipates additional income of approximately $400m, excluding gains and losses from equity securities.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Commercial quadcopters have been on the mainstream gadget scene for 15 years, proliferating across industries and among hobbyists. So when researchers at the embedded-device security firm Red Balloon started seeing surprising quadcopter accessories on Chinese shopping platforms like Temu and AliExpress, they didn't think much of it at first. As with any popular gadget type, there's a whole ecosystem of niche, wacky, and comical add-ons available for drones. But the more Red Balloon CEO Ang Cui thought about it, the more unsettled he and his colleagues became about how cheap and easy it would be for anyone to buy seemingly disparate add-ons that could easily turn a mainstream quadcopter into a war machine. The researchers recognized them from battlefield footage and other reports that such tethers—not to mention AI guidance modules—are being used by both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war to drop explosives or autopilot crash entire drones themselves into tracked objects without requiring operator control. The Red Balloon researchers found that long-range quadcopters are readily available on marketplaces like AliExpress for under $300, with many priced at around $200 each. And the unit price of a long-range drone can drop even lower when purchased in bulk. Meanwhile, the researchers also purchased an AI guidance module from a different AliExpress seller for $325. Cui and his colleagues also purchased cargo holders that strap to drones and can be used to transport beer cans or water bottles, but could also be loaded with mortar bombs. “This equipment is mainstream, but it does not just cost a few dollars to make, so I think this stuff is being sold either at or below cost,” Cui says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After years of simultaneously competing with Qualcomm and slugging it out in court, Apple has launched its long-awaited C1 modem in its new iPhone 16e handset. On Wednesday, a benchmark test released by Ookla revealed that the C1 beat Qualcomm’s 5G modem in some areas, complete with surprising results. The full data offers a nuanced picture of how each device fares against the other, but there were a number of key takeaways. This means that when analyzing those situations when connectivity is a struggle, and download speeds suffer, the C1 offered a better experience than Qualcomm’s modem. Qualcomm’s modem fared better in the 90th percentile, wherein the iPhone 16 with Qualcomm had better top download speeds across AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. “Performance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.” Still, T-Mobile users got faster median speeds with Qualcomm’s hardware as opposed to than C1. Finally, upload speeds were consistently faster for iPhone 16e—across all major carriers. For T-Mobile customers, the C1 was able to edge out Qualcomm’s modem, but just barely. As such, Apple has assembled a good modem, especially for its first-generation hardware, and is said to be readily developing future versions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The conclusions are clear: AI becomes a real purchasing assistant for many users. "Our data show that consumers have great confidence in the recommendations of generative AI platforms," ​​said Vivek Pandya, head of Adobe Digital Insights and the study, in an interview with ZDNET. Among those questioned, 39 % have already used the generative AI for their online purchases. During the holiday season, Adobe observed an unprecedented increase in traffic generated by generative AI to American merchant sites. Between November 1 and December 31, 2024, this traffic jumped 1,300 % compared to the previous year, with a spectacular increase of 1,950 % just for Cyber ​​Monday.

ジャーナリズムの世界には昔から、「愛していると母親に言われても、裏を取れ」という格言がある。つまり、誰よりも信頼できる相手にさえ懐疑的にならなければいけないということだ。では、話している相手が母親ではなく、OpenAIの「ChatGPT」のような生成人工知能（AI）モデルだったらどうだろう。コンピューターは、信頼できるのだろうか。

先頃開催された、映画、音楽、インタラクティブメディアのカンファレンスである「South by Southwest」で、カーネギーメロン大学（CMU）の2人のコンピューター科学者が語った話については、どうだろう。これも同じことだ。自分で確かめよう。

テキサス州オースティンで開かれたこのカンファレンスでも、話題が集中したのはAIだった。信頼性の問題、人間の仕事の変化といったテーマについて、AIの将来の展望と全体像が専門家の間で論じられた。CMUの助教を務めるSherry Wu氏とMaarten Sap氏は、とりわけAIの現在の状況に焦点を当て、大規模言語モデル（LLM）でトレーニングされたAIチャットボットなど、現在出回っている一般的な生成AIツールを、誤ることなく適切に使うヒントを示した。

「生成AIは、実のところ完璧にはほど遠く、人々が使いたいと考えている用途のすべてに適しているとは言いがたい」。Sap氏はこう話している。

AIより賢くあるにはどうすればいいのか、そのための5つのヒントをご紹介しよう。

指示は明確に、「察して」はNG

「Twitter」（現「X」）や「Bluesky」などのSNSでジョークを投稿して不発に終わった経験がある人なら、文字で皮肉を伝えることの難しさを十分に承知しているだろう。そうしたSNSのユーザーは（少なくとも人間であれば）、文字どおりの発言でないことを対話上の手がかりから理解する。LLMには、それができない。

現在のLLMは、文字どおりではない発言でも文字どおりに解釈してしまうことが多く、社会的な状況や関係性からの推論が不得手だとSap氏は説明する。

Wu氏によると、プロンプトはできるだけ具体的に、かつ体系化するとよいという。重要なのは、自分がどんなことを聞き出そうとしているのかをモデルに理解させることだ。求めている内容を厳密に絞り込むべきであり、LLMが質問の真意を察してくれるなどと期待してはならない。

チャットボットは堂々とウソをつく

生成AIツールで最大の問題は、おそらくハルシネーションを起こす、つまり虚偽の情報を作り上げることだろう。Sap氏によれば、ハルシネーションは多ければ4回に1回は起こるもので、法律や医学など専門性が上がるとその確率は上がるという。

問題は、間違った内容を答えることだけではない。チャットボットは、完全に間違っていても自信たっぷりにそうに回答する、とSap氏は指摘する。

「間違った答えに、さも確実そうな表現を使うので、人はついそれを信じてしまう」（Sap氏）

これについての対策は単純で、LLMの回答を確認すればよい。同じ質問を何度か繰り返したり、同じ質問でも聞き方を変えたりすれば、AIの一貫性を確かめることができる、とWu氏は説明する。違う答えが返ってくる場合もある。「ときには、自分が答えている内容を実際には分かっていないことさえある」（Wu氏）

最も重要なのは、別の情報源を使って検証することだ。自分が答えを知らない疑問を尋ねるときは、要注意ということでもある。生成AIの回答が最も有用なのは、質問者がよく知っているテーマを尋ねたときだとWu氏は言う。何が正しく、何が正しくないかを質問者自身が判断できるからだ。

「AIモデルを信頼するときと信頼しないときを意識的に峻別し、自信たっぷりな回答は疑うようにすべきだ」（Wu氏）

AIは秘密を守れない

LLMについては、プライバシーの問題も多い。LLMにサプライズパーティーの企画を手伝わせるというテストでは、秘密にしておきたい当のサプライズ相手への連絡にパーティーのことを含めてしまう結果になった、とSap氏は話している。

「LLMは、誰がいつ何を知るべきか、どんな情報を隠しておくべきかといった類推が不得意だ」、とSap氏。

機密データや個人情報はLLMに共有しないように、とWu氏も警告する。

「自分が作ったものをAIモデルと共有する場合は、LLMに公開したくない情報が含まれていないかどうか常に再確認すべきだ」

相手は機械だと肝に銘じる

AIチャットボットが人気を博している理由の1つは、人間の話し方をまねるのがうまいことだ。しかし、それはあくまでも物まねであってリアルな人間ではない、とSap氏は釘を刺す。AIモデルが「こうではないかと思います」とか「こう想像します」といった言葉を使うのは、そういう語句を含む言葉づかいを学習したからであって、実際に思ったり想像したりするわけではない。「われわれが言語を使うとき、こうした語句には必ず暗黙的に認知が伴っている。そのために、LLMが何か想像するかのように、内面世界を持っているかのように感じてしまうのだ」、とSap氏は解説している。

AIモデルを人間のようにとらえると、誤った信頼感を生む危険性がある。LLMは人間と同じように動くわけではなく、人間のように扱っていると、社会的な固定観念を強めてしまうおそれがある、とSap氏は言う。

「人は、AIシステムが人間に似ている、意識を持っていると実際以上に考えてしまう傾向がある」

LLMの利用が妥当ではない場面もある

LLMは高度な調査や類推の機能を備えているとうたわれてはいるものの、実際にはまだそこまでではないとSap氏は話している。AIモデルは博士号を取得した人間並みの能力を発揮できるというベンチマークはあるが、それはあくまでもベンチマークにすぎない。その分析の裏でどんなテストが実施されていようと、個々人が使いたい用途と同じ水準でその性能が発揮されるとは限らないのである。

「AIは何でもできるという幻想が先行しすぎたために、自分のタスクに使うべきだと人々が早計に判断するようになっている」、とSap氏は語る。

生成AIモデルを、あるタスクに使うかどうかを判断するときには、使った場合のメリットと潜在的なリスクは何か、使わない場合のメリットと潜在的なリスクは何かをそれぞれ考慮すべきだ、とWu氏も指摘している。

Googleが新型スマートフォン「Pixel 9a」を発表した。米国や英国、豪州で4月に発売予定。日本でも時期は不明だが発売予定だ。

米国での価格は499ドル（税別約7万4000円）で、iPhone 16eの599ドル（税別約8万9000円）より約1万5000円も安い。それでいて120HzディスプレイやPixel 9 Proと同じプロセッサ、そしてミドルレンジ最強のカメラを備える。

Amazonで現在開催中のセールを見る



●Pixel 9aとは

新たに発表されたPixel 9aは、大きな期待を背負っている。なぜなら、昨年のPixel 8aが機能やバッテリー駆動時間、長期的なソフトウェアサポートなど、総合的なバランスに優れ、筆者の2024年のお気に入りの1台だったからだ。幸いにも、スペック上では本機は8aをほぼすべての面で上回っているように見受けられる。

ただ、Pixel 9aのリリース時期は、Appleが「手頃な価格」とうたう599ドルの「iPhone 16e」を発表した直後にあたり、比較されやすい状況でもある。一方で、iPhone 16eはAppleの中では安価とはいえ、500ドル以下という「お手頃スマホ」の価格帯からは外れているのが現実だ。

その点、GoogleはAppleのように価格を上げず、Pixel 9aを499ドル（約7万4000円）に据え置いている。予算を抑えたい人には有力な選択肢になりそうだ。

筆者は実機に約30分ほど触れたが、その堅牢な作りや新デザインのいくつかの要素に好印象を受けた。特に背面がほぼフラットになった点は気に入っている。一方で、ほかのPixel 9シリーズにある特徴的なカメラバーが省かれたため、見た目の面では「Pixelらしさ」がやや薄れた印象だ。とはいえ、ディスプレイや内部仕様については、まさに「Pixelらしさ」が詰まっている。

Pixel 9aはGoogleストアや米国、英国、豪州では各小売店で4月に発売される予定だ。

Pixel 9aは、従来のPixel aシリーズとは外観が大きく異なる。Pixel 9や9 Proと同様、エッジがフラット化され、8a以前のように丸みを帯びた形状ではなくなった。Googleは極限までミニマリズムを追求しているようで、背面はほぼ完全にフラットだ。カメラの突起もわずかに出っ張っている程度で、指でなぞると少し引っかかるぐらいである。

2025年現在、Pixel 9aのように机の上に置いてもほとんどガタつかず、平らに安定して置けるスマホは珍しい。カメラバーを備えるPixel 9や9 Proも実はそれほどグラつかないが、9aはさらにフラットさが際立っている印象だ。個人的には、この平らなデザインがとても気に入っている。

●Pixel 9aのデザイン

カメラバーがなくなったことを少し残念に思う人もいるかもしれない。以前のGoogleスマホでは、あのカメラバーがデザイン上のアクセントになっていたためだ。実際にはケースを付ける人が多いとはいえ、個性がやや薄れたと感じる可能性はある。

フォームと機能のせめぎ合いの中で、Googleは機能を優先したようだ。その結果、Pixel 9aはaシリーズの中で最も耐久性が高い機種だと同社は主張している。背面には81％再生プラスチックが使われており、人によっては「プラスチック製か」と気にする向きもあるだろうが、見た目は悪くなく、持った感触もしっかりしていた。コストダウンにも貢献しているはずだ。さらにIP68の防水防塵性能を備え（先代Pixel 8aはIP67）、水深1.5mで30分の耐久性があるとされる。

Pixel 9aは4色展開で、オブシディアン、ポーセリン、ピオニー、そしてアイリスが用意される。実物を見た限りでは、個人的にアイリスが最も好みだった。

本体サイズはPixel 8aとほぼ同じ（わずかに縦長）だが、ディスプレイは6.3インチ（Pixel 8aは6.1インチ）に拡大された。最大輝度は2700ニトへと大幅に向上（8aは2000ニット）しており、カリフォルニアの強い日差しの下でもどの程度見やすいのか試してみたいところだ。スペック上は、ディスプレイの品質が無印のPixel 9と同等という点も注目に値する。

●Pixel 9aのカメラ

カメラはメインが4800万画素、超広角が1300万画素という2眼構成だ。メインカメラではGoogleの「Macro Focus」が使え、接写撮影が可能になっている。多くのスマホは超広角カメラをマクロ代わりに利用するが、本機はメインカメラでマクロを実現している点が興味深い。

画素数だけを見ると、8aの6400万画素から減少しているようにも見えるが、Googleは長年ソフトウェアの力で高画素相当の写真を実現してきた。単純に数字が下がったからといって、一概に性能ダウンとは言えないだろう。

さらにPixel 9や9 Proと同様、AIを活用したさまざまな機能が搭載されている。たとえば、より良いポートレートを作成するBest Take、Photo Unblur、不要な要素を消せるMagic Editor、夜景撮影に強いNight Sightなど。また、Add MeというAR/AI機能を使えば、集団写真にあとから撮影者本人を合成できる。筆者はPixel 9 ProでAdd Meを何度か試したが、その仕上がりには毎回驚かされる。

これまでのPixel Aシリーズ同様に、9aも「価格以上」のカメラ性能を期待させる。本機が新たに採用した4800万画素センサーでどこまで撮れるのか、早く試してみたい。

●Pixel 9aの性能とバッテリー

Pixel 9aには、Pixel 9や9 Proと同じTensor G4チップが搭載されており、GoogleのAI機能やGeminiに対応している。RAMはPixel 9の12GB、9 Proの16GBより少ない8GBだが、発売時点でAndroid 15を搭載し、以後7年間の主要OSアップデートとセキュリティ更新が保証されるのは大きな強みだ。

Tensor G4はベンチマーク上で特別高い数値を叩き出すわけではないが、Pixel 9や9 Proの使用感から推測するに、日常使い（ゲーム、SNS、写真編集など）では十分に快適なパフォーマンスを期待できるだろう。

バッテリー容量は5100mAhと、Pixel aシリーズ史上最大だという。初めてスペックを見たときは、まるでSamsungのGalaxy Aシリーズかと思うほどで驚いた。実際、1300ドルのGalaxy S25 Ultraよりも大容量を備えている点は興味深い。

●Pixel 9aの現時点でのまとめ

その他にも、盗難防止機能や家族向けに利用制限・共有が管理できるFamily Link、GmailやGoogleマップなどの定番サービスまで、いわゆる「Pixelらしさ」をしっかり備えている。ただし、Pixel 9シリーズにある衛星を利用したSOS機能は9aには非搭載だ。コストを抑えるためには何らかの機能を省略せざるを得なかったのだろう。

ストレージは128GBと256GBの2種類から選択可能。購入時には3カ月間のGoogle One、3カ月間のYouTube Premium、そして6カ月間のFitbit Premiumが付いてくる。今後、実際にPixel 9aを入手し次第、カメラ性能やバッテリーの持ちなどを詳しく検証する予定だ。実際に手元に届くのが待ち遠しい。

●Pixel 9aとは

新たに発表されたPixel 9aは、大きな期待を背負っている。なぜなら、昨年のPixel 8aが機能やバッテリー駆動時間、長期的なソフトウェアサポートなど、総合的なバランスに優れ、筆者の2024年のお気に入りの1台だったからだ。幸いにも、スペック上では本機は8aをほぼすべての面で上回っているように見受けられる。

ただ、Pixel 9aのリリース時期は、Appleが「手頃な価格」とうたう599ドルの「iPhone 16e」を発表した直後にあたり、比較されやすい状況でもある。一方で、iPhone 16eはAppleの中では安価とはいえ、500ドル以下という「お手頃スマホ」の価格帯からは外れているのが現実だ。

その点、GoogleはAppleのように価格を上げず、Pixel 9aを499ドル（約7万4000円）に据え置いている。予算を抑えたい人には有力な選択肢になりそうだ。

筆者は実機に約30分ほど触れたが、その堅牢な作りや新デザインのいくつかの要素に好印象を受けた。特に背面がほぼフラットになった点は気に入っている。一方で、ほかのPixel 9シリーズにある特徴的なカメラバーが省かれたため、見た目の面では「Pixelらしさ」がやや薄れた印象だ。とはいえ、ディスプレイや内部仕様については、まさに「Pixelらしさ」が詰まっている。

Pixel 9aはGoogleストアや米国、英国、豪州では各小売店で4月に発売される予定だ。

Pixel 9aは、従来のPixel aシリーズとは外観が大きく異なる。Pixel 9や9 Proと同様、エッジがフラット化され、8a以前のように丸みを帯びた形状ではなくなった。Googleは極限までミニマリズムを追求しているようで、背面はほぼ完全にフラットだ。カメラの突起もわずかに出っ張っている程度で、指でなぞると少し引っかかるぐらいである。

2025年現在、Pixel 9aのように机の上に置いてもほとんどガタつかず、平らに安定して置けるスマホは珍しい。カメラバーを備えるPixel 9や9 Proも実はそれほどグラつかないが、9aはさらにフラットさが際立っている印象だ。個人的には、この平らなデザインがとても気に入っている。

●Pixel 9aのデザイン

カメラバーがなくなったことを少し残念に思う人もいるかもしれない。以前のGoogleスマホでは、あのカメラバーがデザイン上のアクセントになっていたためだ。実際にはケースを付ける人が多いとはいえ、個性がやや薄れたと感じる可能性はある。

フォームと機能のせめぎ合いの中で、Googleは機能を優先したようだ。その結果、Pixel 9aはaシリーズの中で最も耐久性が高い機種だと同社は主張している。背面には81％再生プラスチックが使われており、人によっては「プラスチック製か」と気にする向きもあるだろうが、見た目は悪くなく、持った感触もしっかりしていた。コストダウンにも貢献しているはずだ。さらにIP68の防水防塵性能を備え（先代Pixel 8aはIP67）、水深1.5mで30分の耐久性があるとされる。

Pixel 9aは4色展開で、オブシディアン、ポーセリン、ピオニー、そしてアイリスが用意される。実物を見た限りでは、個人的にアイリスが最も好みだった。

本体サイズはPixel 8aとほぼ同じ（わずかに縦長）だが、ディスプレイは6.3インチ（Pixel 8aは6.1インチ）に拡大された。最大輝度は2700ニトへと大幅に向上（8aは2000ニット）しており、カリフォルニアの強い日差しの下でもどの程度見やすいのか試してみたいところだ。スペック上は、ディスプレイの品質が無印のPixel 9と同等という点も注目に値する。

●Pixel 9aのカメラ

カメラはメインが4800万画素、超広角が1300万画素という2眼構成だ。メインカメラではGoogleの「Macro Focus」が使え、接写撮影が可能になっている。多くのスマホは超広角カメラをマクロ代わりに利用するが、本機はメインカメラでマクロを実現している点が興味深い。

A Norwegian man said he was horrified to discover that ChatGPT outputs had falsely accused him of murdering his own children.

According to a complaint filed Thursday by European Union digital rights advocates Noyb, Arve Hjalmar Holmen decided to see what information ChatGPT might provide if a user searched his name. He was shocked when ChatGPT responded with outputs falsely claiming that he was sentenced to 21 years in prison as "a convicted criminal who murdered two of his children and attempted to murder his third son," a Noyb press release said.

ChatGPT's "made-up horror story" not only hallucinated events that never happened, but it also mixed "clearly identifiable personal data"—such as the actual number and gender of Holmen's children and the name of his hometown—with the "fake information," Noyb's press release said.

ChatGPT hallucinating a "fake murderer and imprisonment" while including "real elements" of the Norwegian man's "personal life" allegedly violated "data accuracy" requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), because Holmen allegedly could not easily correct the information, as the GDPR requires.

As Holmen saw it, his reputation remained on the line the longer the information was there, and—despite "tiny" disclaimers reminding ChatGPT users to verify outputs—there was no way to know how many people might have been exposed to the fake story and believed the information was accurate.

"Some think that ‘there is no smoke without fire,’" Holmen said in the press release. "The fact that someone could read this output and believe it is true, is what scares me the most."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla protesters are planning their “biggest day of action” yet, aiming for 500 demonstrations at Tesla showrooms across the world on March 29th, organizers said during a mobilizing call Wednesday. There have also been an uptick in incidents of arson, vandalism, and violence against Tesla showrooms that, while unrelated to the protests, have led to Musk and President Donald Trump labeling them “domestic terrorism.” Other members of the Trump administration have signaled the protesters could come under scrutiny as well. Alice Hu, executive director of Planet Over Profit, said that protesters were aiming for 500 events across the world on March 29th, with demonstrations at all 277 Tesla showrooms in the US, as well as hundreds more overseas. Protesters should even feel free to demonstrate at Supercharger stations, she said. “We need to show Elon that he can throw a tantrum online because his stocks are tanking,” Hu said. “He can get Trump to put on a humiliating used car show in front of the White House. With Trump promising domestic terrorism charges for violence against Tesla, organizers advised that protesters consult attorneys to better understand the laws in their states. Some states have statutes that could be used to intimidate protesters, so its worthwhile to know what you’re up against, said Lauren Regan, executive director and senior staff attorney at the Civil Liberties Defense Center. She said in her experience, states are often hesitant to prosecute activists because there’s a strong likelihood those statutes will be found unconstitutional. Several speakers spoke of Tesla’s collapse as not only possible, but likely. Micah Lee, an investigative journalist who was among a group of Twitter users to have their accounts banned by Musk shortly after his acquisition of the social platform, said that going after Tesla’s value was a “solid strategy.” But it’s not clear that hurting Tesla will actually matter much to Musk. He remains in Trump’s good graces, and is wielding vast amounts of control within the federal government. Even if these protests can seriously affect Tesla, Musk has consolidated so much political power that, after a certain point, it’s not clear whether market forces still apply as strongly. Musk’s love of memes — he recently quipped “I am become meme” at CPAC — is a sign that the world’s richest man is living in a different reality than most people, which could be an advantage, said Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University who studies media manipulation, disinformation, and online political movements. “But he believes he’s living in a meme, and so we need to be very clear about what our demands are, about what our bright lines are, and that we’re not gonna stop until Tesla is done with Musk.” In simplest terms, the protesters said they were not backing down.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A multi-billion yen project has begun to take action to operate vehicles such as battery-replaceable electric trucks and other delivery vehicles by Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks and Buses and Mitsubishi Motors at fully automatic battery replacement stations installed in Tokyo. Ample, a US company that handles battery replacement systems for electric vehicles (EVs), will provide the technology and install multiple exchange stations in various locations in Tokyo. Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks and Bus have already begun demonstration experiments in Kyoto City in September 2024 using the eCanter, a small battery-replaceable electric truck. Amplé's fully automatic battery replacement station has already been installed in Kyoto City, and Yamato Transport uses the eCanter battery replacement model for collection and delivery services. Ample's fully automatic battery replacement station was installed in Kyoto city. The same applies to the demonstration experiment in Tokyo, with Ample battery replacement stations being installed in various locations in Tokyo, and delivery companies plan to operate eCanter battery replacement models and other models starting from the first half of this year. The battery replacement time is approximately five minutes, and one station can accommodate more than 100 vehicles. "Overall costs are about 10-20% cheaper than traditional gasoline or diesel. With the amount of energy consumed and the installation costs lower, we expect it to be 3-1 times cheaper than fast charging over time," explained John de Souza, Ample co-founder and president. Ample is planning to use this project as an opportunity to accelerate its business expansion in urban areas in Japan and Asia, and will begin expanding its target vehicles, starting with the logistics field.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.jp/article/the-us-army-is-using-camogpt-to-purge-dei-from-training-materials/'>US Army's AI "CamoGPT" is used to eliminate DEI mentions in training materials</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 02:00:00 <p>
The US Army is using CamoGPT, a test-stage generation AI tool, for new uses. The purpose is to identify and remove statements relating to diversity, equity, inclusiveness and accessibility (DEIA) from training materials in accordance with the latest executive order issued by President Donald Trump. According to an internal document confirmed by WIRED, the US Army Training Doctrine Command (TRADOC), an important command division responsible for training soldiers, training executives, and formulating military activity guidelines, strategies and initiatives, uses AI tools called "CamoGPT" on a daily basis, with the aim of "reviewing the various policies, plans, public relations and initiatives relating to DEIA and reporting on the facts we have learned." The internal document was prepared after President Trump signed an executive order on January 27, 2025, entitled "Restoring America's Fighting Force." The executive order that ordered Secretary of Defense Pete Hegses to eliminate any references of the Pentagon's policies on race and gender that could encourage "non-American, division-inducing discriminatory, radical, extremist and irrational logic," extends to past social media posts sent from official US military accounts. In an email to WIRED, Army Major Chris Robinson, who serves as TRADOC's spokesman, acknowledged that the CamoGPT's purpose was a review of materials that referenced the DEIA. We will use all the professionalism and efficiency to implement these directives in line with national security policies," Robinson said. "We will not disclose any details about our internal policies or methods, but TRADOC aims to increase productivity in all respects by utilizing all of our hand-held tools, including CamoGPT. Doyle avoids specific mentions about how TRADOC officials use CamoGPT when checking DEIA-related statements, but states that they are not using any particularly unusual techniques for document searches. The actual procedure is that TRADOC staff will load a large number of documents into CamoGPT and order the Large-Scale Language Model (LLM) to search for keywords such as "dignity" and "respect" to be searched for.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, CEO Tim Cook has lost confidence in John Giannandrea, Apple’s longtime AI chief, and is bringing in a new leader to fix Siri. Mike Rockwell, the exec behind Apple’s Vision Pro headset, is now taking over Siri development and will report directly to software chief Craig Federighi. This move effectively removes Siri from Giannandrea’s control. Sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple’s AI efforts have been falling behind, and internal discussions at a recent secretive company summit focused on how to turn things around. The biggest concern is Siri, which has failed to deliver promised AI features for iPhone 16 users. Apple has advertised a more powerful Siri with deeper access to user data, but so far these updates aren’t even available yet six months later. Siri’s outgoing manager, Robby Walker, recently called the delays “ugly” and “embarrassing” in a team meeting. He also admitted that Apple doesn’t have a firm timeline for when the AI upgrades will actually be released, which is pretty shocking. The decision to put Rockwell in charge of Siri is a sign that Apple wants someone with a track record of shipping complex products.

Is Apple experiencing a "Vista-like drift into systemically poor execution?" That was a question posed by well-known technology analyst Benedict Evans, in a recent blog post covering Apple's innovation and execution, or seemingly lack thereof as of late. He is referring to Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system, which was widely criticized when it launched in 2007 due to software bugs, performance issues, frequent warning dialogs, polarizing design changes, and several other problems. Evans said Apple stumbled with the Vision Pro headset, which he believes was not ready to launch. Then, it previewed personalized Siri features at WWDC last year that were merely conceptual, and are now delayed. A lot of people even at Apple are puzzled. And now we find that we didn't really see a demo, only a mock-up of a great concept, and that this product won't ship until maybe late 2025, and possibly (going by the rumour-mill) 2026, or even 2027. The failure of Siri 2 is by far the most dramatic instance of a growing trend for Apple to launch stuff late. The software release cycle used to be a metronome: announcement at WWDC in the summer, OS release in September with everything you'd seen. Nevertheless, Evans acknowledged that critics have been claiming that Apple is no longer innovative since at least the 1980s, and that the company has historically continued to deliver more innovative and category-defining products over the years. Evans' full blog post, highlighted by Techmeme today, is worth a read.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

No AI involved which could be good or bad depending on one’s point of view. I read a very polite essay with some almost unreadable graphs. People have been claiming that Apple has forgotten how to innovate since the early 1980s, or longer – it’s a standing joke in talking about the company. Slap on your Apple goggles and look at the world from the fan boy perspective. The endless requests to log in to use Facetime and other Apple services are from an objective point of view a bit stupid. Er, yeah, now what are the functional differences again? One possibility is that innovation worm is quite happy making an exit and looking for a better orchard. And ‘Apple Intelligence’ certainly isn’t going to drive a ‘super-cycle’ of iPhone upgrades any time soon. Indeed, a better iPhone feature by itself was never going to drive fundamentally different growth for Apple So why do something which makes the company look stupid? And the failure of Siri 2 is by far the most dramatic instance of a growing trend for Apple to launch stuff late. The software release cycle used to be a metronome: announcement at WWDC in the summer, OS release in September with everything you’d seen. There were plenty of delays and failed projects under the hood, and centres of notorious dysfunction (Apple Music, say), and Apple has always had a tendency to appear to forget about products for years (most Apple Watch faces don’t support the key new feature in the new Apple Watch) but public promise were always kept. Now that seems to be slipping. Some innovation worms are probably gnawing away inside the Apple. Tough to convert marketing baloney crafted by art history majors into software of value to users in my opinion.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Once again, a new report has suggested that Apple's iPhone 18 series will feature the C2 modem, Apple's custom cellular chip. According to a 9to5Mac report, Jeff Pu of GF Securities has mentioned in his latest note to investors that he expects Apple to pack the “C2” modem in the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max in 2026. Apple debuted the C1 chip in the recently launched iPhone 16e, after years of featuring Qualcomm's cellular modems in its iPhones. This is because the C1 lacks support for ultra-fast mmWave 5G, meaning users miss out on the extreme speeds available in locations like stadiums, airports, and dense urban areas. Apple has acknowledged this limitation, stating that the C1 is only the beginning and that future iterations will improve. This most likely means that Apple isn't going to put this modem chip inside their flagship handsets. Instead, the iPhone 17 series will most likely feature Qualcomm's modems. Apple's current agreement with Qualcomm runs till March 2027, allowing Apple time to refine its modem technology while still using Qualcomm’s hardware in premium iPhone models. Notably, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had earlier suggested that the iPhone 17 Air will also use the C1 modem. Earlier, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had mentioned how Qualcomm's newly launched X85 modem was miles ahead of Apple's C1 chip, and it would create a "huge delta" in performance between premium Android devices and Apple’s iPhones.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rockwell will report to Apple’s software boss, Craig Fderighi. According to the report, Giannanndrea “long considered Rockwell a potential successor.” In the past several days, Apple started moving over another senior manager from Rockwell’s team — Aimee Nugent — to the Siri group. Like Vorrath, she has a reputation for fixing challenging projects. Inside Apple, Rockwell hasn’t been shy about criticizing Siri, according to people familiar with the matter.

Apple Inc. is undergoing a rare shake-up of its executive ranks, aiming to get its artificial intelligence efforts back on track after months of delays and stumbles, according to people familiar with the situation. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development, so he’s moving over another top executive to help: Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea’s command. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit, Bloomberg News has reported. How Gurman got this scoop before Apple had announced the changes — even internally — is rather unbelievable. And trust me, Apple PR did not leak this to him deliberately. I’m sure they’re now accelerating an announcement, at least internally, framing it on their own terms. I don’t find it surprising at all that Rockwell was given this task. Giannandrea will remain at the company, even with Rockwell taking over Siri. An abrupt departure would signal publicly that the AI efforts have been tumultuous — something Apple is reluctant to acknowledge. Giannandrea’s other responsibilities include oversight of research, testing and technologies related to AI.

Although 2024 has seen political and regulatory turmoil, Europe’s talent pool of startups continues to increase, even if funding shortages kicked in last year, per global law firm Orrick’s new “Deal Flow” report, which covers 2024. An analysis of more than 375 VC and growth equity investments in Europe last year reveals a handful of key takeaways. Compared to previous years, Europe’s startup market stabilized, with a modest rebalancing of investment terms compared to the extreme highs and lows of the pandemic hype and post-pandemic slowdown. There was also a lot more adoption of the British Venture Capital Association’s new model form documents in European deals, which tend to more closely align with U.S. practices. With this de facto standard emerging, this trend is likely to accelerate future deal-making because it’s a lot easier to push through deals where everyone is familiar with the structure. European companies also appeared to expand option pools, with over 70% of equity financings including a top-up, highlighting a stronger European talent pool and focus on scaling companies rather than selling early. There were signs of an improvement to deal volume and size, too, with the average size of deals Orrick did with investor clients growing by 66%, while deals initiated by startups saw a slight decline, even though company-side deals still represented the majority. The two most common types of equity-based deals emerging in this instance are ASAs (Advanced Subscription Agreement) and SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). Founders tended to access secondary transactions earlier in the funding stage, with some occurring as early as Series A. Startups with some kind of SaaS or platform-based business model represented 21% of financings, deep tech increased to 23%, deals with an AI and ML (machine learning) component maintained a 33% share, and fintech rose to 16% of European deals.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The comments from Jensen Huang illustrate how the California-headquartered AI chipmaker is remodelling its supply chain away from Asia amid unpredictable tariff threats by Donald Trump. And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.” The remarks are the latest example of how Trump’s “America First” policy is having an impact on business investment, even forcing groups such as Nvidia – which is among the world’s most valuable companies – to rethink their global footprint. But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China’s territorial designs on its neighbour. He added that the Trump administration could be in a position to bolster the US AI industry at a time of growing competition from China. Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they’ve engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei’s continued success. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nvidia is making a major move to fortify its supply chain, committing billions of dollars over the next four years to expand U.S.-based semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. The decision comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions, surging demand for AI infrastructure, and increased competition from rival chipmakers. TSMC itself is investing $100 billion in Arizona, though it has acknowledged production delays that could impact supply chains. For years, Nvidia has depended on TSMC and Samsung to fabricate its GPUs. The CHIPS Act provides billions in incentives for domestic production, aligning with Nvidia’s new investment strategy. CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized the importance of securing a stable, U.S.-based supply chain. Additionally, U.S.-made chips may carry a higher price tag compared to those produced in Taiwan or South Korea. This infrastructure includes the GB300 NVL72, which integrates 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs, delivering a 1.5× increase in performance over previous models. Major cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and Oracle, have already committed to integrating Blackwell Ultra-powered instances into their services. Additionally, Nebius has announced it will be an early adopter, offering Nvidia-powered AI compute capabilities. This aligns with Meta’s ongoing strategy to develop in-house AI chips, reducing its dependence on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Nvidia might face growing competition from China-based firms in the future, which are ramping up their AI chip efforts. If successful, Nvidia’s expansion could set a precedent for other semiconductor firms considering similar moves. However, the challenges of domestic chip production—including supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and high production costs—must be addressed for long-term sustainability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

QDriver acts as a hardware abstraction layer and is responsible for converting a general-purpose quantum instruction set (NetQASM) into instructions that rely on specific quantum hardware. The research team has developed two completely different types of quantum processors, the ion trap method (a method in which ions trapped by an electromagnetic field are manipulated to use as qubits) and the diamond spin method (a method in which lattice defects that occur in the crystal structure of a diamond are used as qubits), and demonstrated its versatility. It can be used without knowing how the hardware works," explains Maria Grazia Iuriano, a doctoral researcher at Delft Institute of Technology. Another feature of QNodeOS is its multitasking function that allows multiple quantum applications to be run simultaneously. This multitasking function greatly improves the efficiency of quantum hardware utilization. For example, while one program is waiting for a response from the network, another program may make use of the quantum processor. Experiments showed that increasing the number of applications significantly improved device utilization. While QNodeOS makes practical use of quantum networks more realistic, challenges still remain. *Click here for related articles on quantum computers by WIRED. If traditional classical computers are "defining calculations" through "the logic and circuits designed by humans," then quantum computers can be seen as an approach to "derive calculations" by taking the "the rhythm of information processing that nature itself possesses" - the flow in which multiple possibilities coexist and intervene in a way that interferes and entangles together, converges to an optimal solution.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

An analyst who is one of the biggest boosters of Tesla on Wall Street says Elon Musk is facing a “moment of truth” at his EV company because of a “crisis” he’s created by spending so much in the Trump administration.

The analyst, Wedbush’s Dan Ives, pleaded with Musk in a note published Thursday to reduce his role working with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

“If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol…. and this is a bad thing,” Ives wrote. This has led to what Ives described as a “brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.”

Ives’ plea comes as Tesla’s stock price has fallen to around $230 — less than half its all-time peak in late December of around $480, and lower than it was before Trump got elected. Protests against the company are growing worldwide, an the level of vandalism against Tesla’s vehicles and stores has increased so much that it prompted the new administration to label the actions as “domestic terrorism.”

Ives used similar language in a note published earlier in March, but couched it in a more optimistic tone, saying he believed the company was at the “start of the biggest innovation and technology cycle in Tesla’s history.”

Thursday’s note was more somber. While he wrote on X that Wedbush has “never been more bullish on Tesla’s future,” he specifically called on Musk and Tesla’s board of directors to “step up, stop being silent, and help resolve this crisis.”

Ives didn’t call on Musk to step down — although another high-profile Tesla investor who once tried to get on Tesla’s board in 2023, Ross Gerber, is calling for just that. Instead, Ives urged the CEO to announce he will “balance” his roles at DOGE and Tesla.

He also wants Musk to offer a more concrete roadmap for the mysterious “more affordable models” that are supposed to debut at some point this year, as well as more detail on its attempt to launch a robotaxi service.

If the Tesla CEO does those things, Ives wrote, the “heat from Musk around DOGE will start to dissipate among most of the critics and this will leave a scar,” but won’t lead to “permanent brand damage.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Quick to install, inexpensive, and modular, it’s a perfect fit for tech companies that need electricity now. In February, it contracted 389 megawatts from three solar projects across Illinois and Texas. And late last year, the company announced it was anchoring a $9 billion renewable power coalition that’s organized by Acadia. The Redmond-based company’s own renewable portfolio already includes over 34 GW of capacity. Though renewable power on its own doesn’t have the same consistency as nuclear or natural gas, developers are increasingly pairing it with battery storage to provide around-the-clock electricity. The combination is more expensive than solar or wind on its own, but given the rapid declines in cost for both solar and batteries, so-called hybrid power plants are beginning to encroach on prices for a new natural gas generating capacity. So far, new nuclear prices have remained significantly higher than either renewables or natural gas power plants. Most new natural gas and nuclear power plants aren’t scheduled to come online until several years after that. But renewables can start supplying power quickly, with utility-scale solar projects starting to produce electrons in about 18 months. That speed has proven attractive, leading to some massive deals: Microsoft, for example, signed a deal with Brookfield Asset Management last summer for 10.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity in the U.S. and Europe, all of which will be delivered by 2030.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is suing the Indian government, accusing the country’s IT ministry of unlawfully expanding its powers to remove online content, Reuters reported Thursday.

X has long chaffed at government orders to remove or block content in the country, such as during the farmers’ protests last year. Though it ended up complying with those executive orders, citing the risk of substantial penalties, it did also file a legal challenge. Now it’s further stepping up opposition to state censorship efforts via fresh litigation.

According to a court filing X made earlier this month, the company has accused the Indian government of creating an unlawful mechanism through which “countless” public officials can execute content takedown or blocking orders via a website that social media companies should regularly check.

Per Reuters, X’s lawsuit alleges that this mechanism fails to meet Indian legal safeguards on content removal that require such orders “to be issued in cases such as harm to sovereignty or public order, and … with strict oversight of top officials”.

X claims the website creates “an impermissible parallel mechanism” that causes “unrestrained censorship of information in India”, according to the news agency’s report of its filing. The company is hoping to use a legal route to quash the directive, it said.

A brief hearing on the case was held earlier this month, Reuters also reported, but no ruling has been made. Another hearing is expected to take place in the High Court of southern Karnataka state next week.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tesla is issuing a recall for around 46,000 Cybertrucks sold to date because of an exterior steel trim panel on the side of the windshield that can peel off. The filing states that Tesla became aware of the problem in early January and has identified 151 warranty claims related to this panel coming off since then. The new recall is the eighth for Tesla’s Cybertruck — a vehicle which is outselling other electric trucks but has underperformed Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s hopes for its success. Many of its past problems have been fixed using an over-the-air software update, but some have required owners to bring their EVs in for service. The first, in April 2024, happened when owners noticed the cover of the throttle pedal was coming loose and sliding up, potentially causing a situation where it could get stuck at full throttle. The second, in June 2024, had to do with a trim piece on the truck’s bed that was prone to coming loose because of insufficient adhesive. That history with adhesive failures did not seem to raise a ton of red flags at Tesla this time around, though, according to the filing. On February 6, the company closed the study after an “inspection and pull test” found “no detections of separation.” It was only after NHTSA reached out to Tesla on February 21 with a customer complaint about the problem that Tesla dug deeper into social media posts and service records, according to the filing. It agreed to recall the Cybertrucks on March 11.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hackers are ramping up their attempts to exploit a trio of year-old ServiceNow vulnerabilities to break into unpatched company instances, security researchers warned this week.

Threat intelligence startup GreyNoise said in a blog post on Tuesday that it had observed a “notable resurgence of in-the-wild activity” targeting the three ServiceNow vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-4879, CVE-2024-5178, and CVE-2024-5217.

The vulnerabilities were first disclosed by researchers at Assetnote in May 2024 and patched by ServiceNow months later in July 2024.

GreyNoise said that all three flaws have seen a resurgence in targeted exploitation attempts in the past week. It’s not known exactly who is behind this latest wave of targeting, but GreyNoise said that 70% of the malicious activity it observed in the past week targeted systems based in Israel, with activity also seen in Germany, Japan, and Lithuania.

As first noted by Assetnote last year, GreyNoise also confirms that the vulnerabilities can be chained together for “full database access” of affected ServiceNow instances. Organizations often use the ServiceNow platform to host sensitive data about their employees, including their personally identifiable information and HR records related to their employment.

ServiceNow spokesperson Erica Faltous told TechCrunch that the company first learned of the vulnerabilities “nearly a year ago”, and, “to date, we have not observed any customer impact from an attack campaign.”

Following Assetnote’s disclosure of the flaws last year, U.S. security firm Resecurity warned that foreign threat actors had attempted to exploit the three ServiceNow vulnerabilities to target both private sector companies and government agencies around the world.

Resecurity said it saw targeted attempts at an energy company, a data center organization, a Middle Eastern government agency, and a software developer.

Cybersecurity company Imperva released another report in July 2024 warning that it had also observed exploitation attempts across 6,000 sites across various industries, with a focus on the financial services sector.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia announced Thursday it’s partnering with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to use AI to solve problems facing the the electrical grid. Perhaps ironically, the issues are largely caused by rising power demand from AI itself. The Open Power AI Consortium, which includes a number of electrical utilities and tech companies, says it will use what are known as domain-specific AI models to devise new ways to tackle problems that the power industry is predicted to face in the coming years. On the tech side, Microsoft and Oracle are both members. Over the last year or so, tech companies have been consistently inking new contracts. They’ve largely been spread across renewable energy projects, spurred mostly by solar’s low cost, modularity, and the speed at which it can be deployed. Microsoft, for example, recently added 475 megawatts of solar power to its sizable renewable portfolio. Last year, it became an anchor investor in a $9 billion renewable development project run by Acadia, and earlier in the year it said it was working with Brookfield asset management to deploy 10.5 gigawatts of renewable power in the U.S. and Europe, all of which is expected to come online by 2030. One recent study found that by curtailing use when demand on the grid peaks, including shifting tasks that aren’t time sensitive to periods when demand is low, an additional 76 GB of capacity could be unlocked in the U.S. It’s a not insignificant amount, making up approximately 10% of peak demand in the U.S. It’s likely those are the sorts of solutions, among others, that this new consortium will be exploring.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Google is rolling out a new Gmail update that is designed to help you find the email you’re looking for more quickly. The company announced on Thursday that it will now use AI to consider factors like recency, most-clicked emails, and frequent contacts when surfacing emails based on your search query. Up until now, Gmail has simply displayed emails in chronological order based on keywords. “With this update, the emails you’re looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily,” the company wrote in a blog post. Google is also introducing a new toggle so people can switch between “Most relevant” or “Most recent” emails on a search results page. The toggle is aimed at users who prefer seeing search results displayed in chronological order, rather than the new “Most relevant” default option. The launch of the new search functionality comes as Google has been building out its email offering to better compete with Apple’s Mail app, which got a slew of Gmail-like features with iOS 18 last year. For instance, Gmail recently gained a Gemini-powered feature that lets users add events to a Google Calendar directly from an email. A few months ago, Gmail rolled out “Summary cards” that allow users to take actions in their inbox, like tracking packages, checking in for flights, setting reminders, marking bills as paid, and more. Gmail also introduced the ability for users to chat with Gemini about their inbox directly within the app on both iOS and Android.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

CoreWeave said on Wednesday that it hopes to sell its initial public shares between $47 and $55 per share, putting the money it may raise between about $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion.

Word on the street is that CoreWeave wanted to raise at least $3 billion and possibly over $4 billion.

But price range announcements are always a bit of a game. The announced range is often lower than the bankers think the company can really get. Then the company officially sets a higher price. Doing that helps build excitement for the first day of trading, saying to retail investors that big institutions were so interested that they were willing to pay more.

Anthropic’s AI-powered chatbot, Claude, can now search the web — a capability that had long eluded it. Web search is available now in preview for paid Claude users in the U.S., Anthropic said on its blog, with support for free users and additional countries coming soon. Users can toggle on web search in their profile settings from the Claude web app, and Claude will automatically search across sites to inform certain responses. “When Claude incorporates information from the web into its responses, it provides direct citations so you can easily fact-check sources,” the company wrote in its blog post. “Instead of finding search results yourself, Claude processes and delivers relevant sources in a conversational format. This enhancement expands Claude’s extensive knowledge base with real-time insights, providing answers based on more current information.” In my brief testing of the feature, web search didn’t consistently trigger for current events-related questions. But when it did, Claude indeed delivered an answer with inline citations, pulling from sources including social media (e.g. X) and new sources like NPR and Reuters. Anthropic’s argument against it, previously, was that Claude was “designed to be self-contained.” No doubt competitive pressure had something to do with the reversal in course. Of course, the risk is that Claude hallucinates or miscites web sources.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For OpenAI, the models fit into its broader “agentic” vision: building automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users. “In different contexts, you don’t just want a flat, monotonous voice,” Harris continued. “If you’re in a customer support experience and you want the voice to be apologetic because it’s made a mistake, you can actually have the voice have that emotion in it […] Our big belief, here, is that developers and users want to really control not just what is spoken, but how things are spoken.” Trained on “diverse, high-quality audio datasets,” the new models can better capture accented and varied speech, OpenAI claims, even in chaotic environments. “[T]hese models are much improved versus Whisper on that front,” Harris said. According to OpenAI’s internal benchmarks, gpt-4o-transcribe, the more accurate of the two transcription models, has a “word error rate” approaching 30% for Indic and Dravidian languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada. In a break from tradition, OpenAI doesn’t plan to make its new transcription models openly available. The company historically released new versions of Whisper for commercial use under an MIT license. “[T]hey’re not the kind of model that you can just run locally on your laptop, like Whisper,” he continued. And we think that end-user devices are one of the most interesting cases for open-source models.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Meta’s social network Threads, an X competitor with more than 320 million monthly active users, is now rolling out new features related to topics, reply controls, and video playback in the app, among other things. Today, Meta faces the rise of alternative networks like Bluesky, which now has over 33 million users and a platform that’s inspiring rivals to Instagram, as well. Tapping on those topics will then show you related posts, which makes it easier to engage with others on the social network who share your same interests. The feature is still being described as a “test” with its broader launch today. These topic tag suggestions aim to help posts reach an audience who’s also interested in that subject, Meta explains. Threads is also introducing a redesigned topic tag, which looks like a pill and is found next to the posts on the For You feed. Meta claims posts with tagged topics “generally receive more views” than those without, but didn’t share any specific data to back up that statement. Now, Threads will allow users to shuffle the order of their custom feeds. That means you can even make a custom feed the default that displays when you first open the app — a feature users have been asking for. Along with the other changes, Meta is launching a redesigned video player that has easy-to-access pause/play and skip controls along with a pinned progress bar to easily scrub through the video. Notably, Meta also said that it’s started phasing back civic and political content into the Threads in a more personalized way. The company controversially decided in 2024 to stop proactively recommending political content to users on Instagram and Threads, ahead of a critical U.S. presidential election. After the election wrapped, with President Trump in power, Meta announced it would then begin to phase back in political content on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also dismantled the company’s fact-checking program after the election, choosing to rely only on community moderation efforts going forward.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rerun, a Stockholm-based dev tools startup, which builds a data stack for this emergent kind of “Physical AI”, has secured $17 million in seed funding to help AI developers smooth out the bumps from code to road, as it were. The seed round was led by Point Nine capital out of Germany, bringing the 2022-founded startup’s total funding to date to $20.2 million. Nikolaus West, Co-Founder and CEO of Rerun, told TechCrunch that AI which operates in the physical world is already booming. Per West, Rerun’s database and cloud data platform is built from the ground-up for Physical AI data and workflows, managing multimodal data such as video streams, 3D scenes, and tensors. The startup’s multimodal data stack supports visual debugging, helping developers to track back through their bots’ movements to better understand where things might be going wrong — importing data from real world sensors to power spatial visualization and analytics. And old-school robotics tools are not built for the machine learning world, so the data breaks, and trying to use both these things together creates a huge amount of friction for the teams,” West explained. He suggests there is a potential “data flywheel” effect in creating AI geared to the physical world. But to get there the startup’s conviction is that AI developers need dedicated tools to help their models move smoothly through the real world. Visualizations of Physical AI data created by Rerun’s open source platform have been incorporated into other open source projects by companies such as Meta, Google, Hugging Face, and Unitree. Sunflower Capital also participated in Rerun’s seed round, along with existing investors Costanoa Ventures and Seedcamp.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Social network Bluesky, an open source X rival, has made a change that will allow publishers to better track the referral traffic originating from posts on its platform. This allows publishers’ analytics systems to determine that the visitor came from Bluesky. Liu notes in a post on Bluesky that the change came about because newsrooms were seeing engagement from likes and reposts in the app but had a harder time determining how that was translating into “actual website traffic.” A number of news outlets already have been reporting increases in Bluesky referral traffic, with some even finding that Bluesky surpassed referrals from other platforms, like Meta’s Threads and Elon Musk’s X. For instance, The Boston Globe reported in November 2024 that it was seeing 3x more traffic from Bluesky, compared with Threads, and 4.5x higher conversions to paid subscriptions. Bluesky COO Rose Wang explained at the time that referrals from Bluesky were up because “unlike other platforms, we don’t de-promote your links.” Market intelligence provider Similarweb noted that Bluesky generated 38.6 million outgoing visits in November 2024, spread across a variety of news websites, while Threads generated 24.5 million referrals. However, the firm pointed out that 42% of Threads’ traffic was directing users to its sister app, Instagram, not publishers’ websites. TechCrunch asked Bluesky when exactly it made the change to shift links through its “go” subdomain, as it’s not clear based on Liu’s post. The company has not responded to our request for comment at this time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The San Francisco-based startup announced on Thursday that it’s releasing a host of new capabilities designed to enable customers to securely move corporate data without tapping SaaS applications. The new features include support for transferring unstructured data out of applications like Google Drive and SharePoint and compatibility with Apache Iceberg, an open-source format for large analytic tables. Michel Tricot, the co-founder and CEO of Airbyte, said that the beauty of these new features is that they give enterprises additional ways to extract and utilize their internal data, including for AI applications on-premise. No one else can look at the pipes beside[s] them.” Tricot added that because Airbyte customers have full visibility into these data pipelines, they can go in and remove sensitive knowledge, like employee compensation information, from the data before it reaches its final destination. “One thing I like to say is, don’t give away your first-party data for intelligence,” Tricot said. There is so much noise about, oh, I don’t want this [AI model] to have access to my data when I’m chatting with the [model], and it makes sense, because now people are just putting their most sensitive data into this system. So we want to make sure that it’s kept protected within […] their infrastructure.” Airbyte was founded in 2020 by Tricot and Jean Lafleur, the company’s COO. The startup has raised more than $181 million in venture capital from firms such as Coatue, Accel, and Benchmark, among many others.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pruna AI has been creating a framework that applies several efficiency methods, such as caching, pruning, quantization, and distillation, to a given AI model. In particular, Pruna AI’s framework can evaluate if there’s significant quality loss after compressing a model and the performance gains that you get. We are doing the same, but for efficiency methods,” he added. For instance, OpenAI has been relying on distillation to create faster versions of its flagship models. This is likely how OpenAI developed GPT-4 Turbo, a faster version of GPT-4. Developers send requests to a teacher model and record the outputs. And what you can find in the open source world is usually based on single methods. Left to right: Rayan Nait Mazi, Bertrand Charpentier, John Rachwan, Stephan Günnemann Image Credits:Pruna AI Some of Pruna AI’s existing users include Scenario and PhotoRoom. “The most exciting feature that we are releasing soon will be a compression agent,” Rachwan said. “Basically, you give it your model, you say: ‘I want more speed but don’t drop my accuracy by more than 2%.’ And then, the agent will just do its magic. You don’t have to do anything as a developer.” Pruna AI charges by the hour for its pro version. “It’s similar to how you would think of a GPU when you rent a GPU on AWS or any cloud service,” Rachwan said. And if your model is a critical part of your AI infrastructure, you’ll end up saving a lot of money on inference with the optimized model. For example, Pruna AI has made a Llama model eight times smaller without too much loss using its compression framework.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/'>Vision Pro Creator Taking Over Siri After Apple Intelligence Setbacks</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 00:00:00 <p>
Apple is reportedly shaking up its executive ranks, shortly after it delayed the personalized Siri features that it previewed at WWDC last year. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today said that Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell will be taking over the Siri team at Apple, which until now was led by Apple's artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea. Apple CEO Tim Cook has apparently "lost confidence" in Giannandrea's ability to "execute on product development," but he will remain at the company for now to oversee artificial intelligence research and development in general. Vision Pro hardware engineer Paul Meade will be succeeding Rockwell as the head of Apple's spatial computing efforts, allowing Rockwell to focus entirely on Siri, according to the report. In his new role overseeing the Siri team, Rockwell will report to Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi, the report added. Apple has been facing a lot of criticism after delaying its more personalized version of Siri, with some people upset that the company chose to preview new features that were merely conceptual, rather than fully functional. It is a widely held belief that Apple is lagging behind competitors like OpenAI in the generative artificial intelligence space, and it looks like Apple is attempting to right the ship with this executive shakeup. Apple appointing Rockwell as its new Siri head is an interesting choice, as the Vision Pro has been described as a "commercial flop" and has faced criticism of its own. Nevertheless, the Vision Pro is certainly a technological feat, so Rockwell has proven experience and could be instrumental in improving Siri's underlying technologies. Even the current version of Siri has attracted a lot of criticism, including from some of the most devoted Apple fans, as it sometimes struggles to answer even the most basic questions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On Wednesday, Spotify launched a new personalized playlist designed to help listeners discover upcoming concerts in their area.

The playlist, titled “Concerts Near You,” is updated every Wednesday with 30 songs from artists performing nearby, along with full event details and ticket links. Spotify partners with ticketing platforms like AXS, DICE, Eventbrite, and Ticketmaster.

Like other personalized playlists on Spotify, such as “Daylist” and various “Mixes,” “Concerts Near You” is tailored to users’ listening habits, allowing them to discover artists they love.

To receive the latest show updates, listeners should ensure they’re sharing their location through the “Live Events” section, found under the Search tab in the Spotify app. Spotify also recommends enabling push notifications and following favorite artists to receive personalized reminders.

The launch of the new playlist signals the company’s ambition to make event discovery a more significant aspect of the overall Spotify listening experience while also providing artists more visibility.

The announcement follows Spotify’s publication of its yearly Loud & Clear report, which provides detailed figures regarding its payments to counter claims that the platform doesn’t adequately compensate artists. For the first time, an artist who received one in every million streams on the platform earned an average of over $10,000 in 2024.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Over the last few years, developers have increasingly complained about paying fees to Apple or Google for App Store or Play Store distributions. App makers have often said that both companies make it difficult for them to earn money outside of their systems. New York-based app revenue management platform Adapty wants to change that with its new offering called FunnelFox, which helps acquire customers through websites or web apps. The idea behind FunnelFox is simple: It helps app makers create quizzes or experiences on the web to acquire or onboard customers. “A year ago, I had a chat with our top customers of the revenue tracking product and realized that they acquire a big chunk of customers through the web by building acquisition funnels internally. We thought that this is a big opportunity and decided to build FunnelFox to make web funnels easier for everyone,” Adapty CEO Vitaly Davydov told TechCrunch over a call. It also has an AI component, which can suggest different questions based on the App Store or Play Store link of the app. The startup has two core parts of the business: an SDK that helps app makers with subscriptions and a platform for marketers to target audiences and understand the lifetime value of a customer. Customers can use FunnelFox separately from Adapty while using another app revenue tracking solution, such as RevenueCat. Adapty plans tiered pricing for FunnelFox, but didn’t specify exact details. The company serves 10,000 applications and has tracked $1.2 billion in revenue per year. For Adapty, it wants to use AI to help app makers create payment screens that will give them better conversion rate by suggesting design and rates.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
