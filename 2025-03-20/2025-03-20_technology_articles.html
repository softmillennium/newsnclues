London has established itself as a leader in finance and technology, and its iGaming Sector is now thriving. The city is shaping the online gambling market with fast growth, new technologies, and fresh business strategies. From AI tools to blockchain systems and mobile gaming, London's operators are helping to redefine the industry.

Artificial intelligence is at the core of online gaming. Companies use it to capture user habits and provide clear advice to hold players' attention. It also spots risky gambling behavior and supplies tools that support responsible gaming. Firms based in London lead by adopting AI to boost both the user experience and player safety. Equally, utilizing this tech to allow users to start gaming with no verification needed is something that has been driving a lot of new customers to iGaming, in a climate where people are increasingly worried about their privacy.

Chatbots powered by AI are also transforming customer support. They handle queries, process transactions, and verify accounts quickly. Faster responses and automated assistance make gaming platforms more user-friendly.

Blockchain is improving fairness and security in online gambling. London companies are adopting these systems to provide tamper-proof transactions and fair gameplay. Virtual casinos built on blockchain are also becoming popular, offering players a secure and interactive environment.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are another trend that has been around for a while. They allow players to own unique in-game items, join exclusive contests, or access special features. NFTs are helping operators boost engagement and unlock extra revenue.

Many operators are now focusing on mobile gaming, as most users access games through phones or tablets. Companies are investing in apps and mobile-friendly websites to ensure a smooth experience on smaller screens. Better design and faster platforms make gaming more accessible.

The rollout of 5G networks has enhanced mobile gaming. Faster data speeds and low latency allow players to enjoy immersive features like augmented reality or cloud-based games without expensive devices.

Mergers and acquisitions speed up growth in the sector. Big companies buy small ones to reach new markets and gain modern technology. These deals extend business and help them remain competitive in a busy field.

With more pressure to create, companies try to work hard, save money, and offer better features. This plan helps them keep their edge as the market expands.

London companies have been looking overseas since the UK market has been maturing. Areas such as Latin America and Africa now seem favorable because rules have changed, and there is improved internet access available. Firms expanding early into these regions gain a lead before competition arrives.

Governments in these regions are introducing new rules for online gambling. This opens doors for London companies to partner with local businesses and create games tailored to these markets.

Collaborating with influencers has become a key marketing tool. Popular streamers and content creators connect operators with younger audiences. Social media campaigns and themed events also keep players involved and loyal.

Live-streamed gaming events are gaining traction, too. These allow viewers to watch matches, chat with others, and place bets during the action. This interactive approach strengthens player engagement.

Gamification is becoming a standard feature in iGaming. Features like leaderboards, daily challenges, and achievements make games more engaging. Loyalty programs are also on the rise. Players receive personalized rewards that encourage them to stick with specific platforms.

Subscription plans are another growing trend. These give users access to premium games and services while providing operators with steady revenue. Players benefit from exclusive perks, enhancing their overall experience.

London's iGaming future looks promising. Companies plan to use new tools such as AI, blockchain, and 5G to help upgrade their work. Regulatory changes will also shape the industry, with stricter rules ensuring fair and responsible gaming, which puts users at ease and encourages transparency.

Environmental matters get more attention. Businesses choose eco-friendly ways, supporting greener practices and ethical gaming to meet consumer expectations. These steps may help the field keep growing.

London holds its global role for iGaming, but competition remains fierce. Firms need to follow trends, invest in tech, and keep players' interest to do well. By doing so, they secure a spot in this quickly-changing market.

A new Canvas button is being added to the Gemini text box, next to the Deep Research button

Gemini is getting two new artificial intelligence (AI) features, Google announced on Tuesday. The Mountain View-based tech giant is adding Canvas, an interactive space that lets human users and AI collaborate on projects involving documents and coding-related tasks. Another feature making its way to Gemini is Audio Overview, which was previously exclusive to NotebookLM, and lets users generate an engaging podcast-like audio discussion based on documents, slides, and Deep Research reports. These features are currently being rolled out globally to both Gemini Advanced subscribers and those on the free tier.

In a blog post, the tech giant announced the two new features that are being added to Gemini. This follows the Deep Research feature that can generate a detailed report on complex topics, and the iOS-exclusive lockscreen widgets. The new features — Canvas and Audio Overview — will be available on both Gemini on web and mobile apps.

Canvas is a new interactive space on Gemini, which is aimed at letting users collaborate with the AI over certain projects. Users can now see a new Canvas button next to Deep Research in the text box on Gemini's interface. Selecting the feature and adding a document or lines of code will now open a sandbox where the AI creates a first draft based on the user's prompt, and then the user can take over to make edits and further refine the output with the help of the chatbot.

Currently, Canvas only works with documents and coding-related tasks. For documents, users will have to upload a file, and then write a prompt while the Canvas button is selected. The user can say something like “Create a speech based on these classroom notes” and the AI will open a sandbox-style interface and write the draft. Then users can make manual edits or highlight portions of the text and ask Gemini to change the tone or regenerate content with specific feedback.

Users can ask the AI to write code based on prompts. Then, with Canvas, they can ask Gemini to generate and preview the code and other web app prototypes to see a visual representation. This only works with HTML and React code currently. After the preview, the user can also request changes to input fields or call-to-action buttons, and see the updated preview. Notably, the feature is similar to OpenAI's Canvas feature, although ChatGPT only offers it on the web.

Google said that after witnessing the popularity of the Audio Overview feature in NotebookLM, it is now bringing it to Gemini. The feature works with documents, slides, and even reports created using Deep Research. Whenever a file or response fits the criteria, the Gemini platform will show a floating action button (FAB) about the feature.

Once a user taps the button, Gemini will begin generating a podcast-style audio discussion featuring two AI hosts, a male and a female voice, who will discuss the topic, draw connections between topics, and engage in a dynamic back-and-forth to provide unique perspectives. Notably, it can take a few minutes to generate an AI Overview.

Gadgets 360 staff members spotted both the features on the web interface of Gemini, but not on the apps. Since Google is rolling out the feature globally, it may take a few days before all users gain access to them.

EU Health Regulator Clears Use of AI Tool in Fatty Liver Disease Trials

Reuters

FILE PHOTO: A message reading "AI artificial intelligence", a keyboard, and robot hands are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025.

(Reuters) -A European Medicines Agency committee, on Thursday, accepted the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool called AIM-NASH in clinical trials to help identify the severity of a type of fatty liver disease.

The condition, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, is a difficult-to-treat disease that affects around 1.5% to 6.5% of adults in the U.S., according to the American Liver Foundation.

The AI-based AIM-NASH tool employs a machine learning model trained on more than 100,000 annotations from 59 pathologists who assessed over 5,000 liver biopsies across nine large clinical trials.

The EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) said evidence showed the AI tool can reliably determine disease activity from biopsies with less variability than the current standard in trials that rely on a consensus of three pathologists.

On that basis, the CHMP concluded, it can accept evidence generated by the tool as scientifically valid, which will help researchers obtain clearer evidence on the benefits of new treatments in clinical trials.

Currently, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals', Rezdiffra is the only U.S.-approved drug for MASH.

Drugmakers such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also conducting trials with their blockbuster GLP-1 treatments to treat patients with the liver disease.

The AHR Expo is a showcase of innovation and ingenuity, where HVACR manufacturers from around the globe converge to unveil cutting-edge technologies and solutions designed to tackle the industry's most pressing challenges. This year, exhibitors placed a strong emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, highlighting products that not only reduce energy consumption but also align with global decarbonization and electrification goals. 

 

Even though the political winds have changed since the last presidential election, most manufacturers remain confident that electrification will continue to be a key trend. Infinitum, for example, expects to see skyrocketing growth in electrification, said Stephen Mathew, director of product management at Infinitum. 

“AI and data centers are putting enormous pressure on the HVAC world to prioritize energy management and deliver more efficient cooling systems that optimize power consumption in buildings and support electric grid stability,” said Mathew. “Motors play a key role in a building's energy consumption, data centers, and other mission-critical facilities. In fact, 40% of a data center's energy consumption is consumed by motors in HVAC equipment to cool servers. Infinitum's next-gen, sustainable motor systems support decarbonization initiatives by powering cooling equipment with 20% less energy, 20% fewer emissions, and no waste.”

Heat pumps also play a key role in the electrification movement, but for them to have a meaningful impact on decarbonization and electrification, they need to utilize technologies that make them more competitive in colder climates, as this will increase their adoption across more of the country, said Brian Dail, application engineering manager at Danfoss Climate Solutions. 

“Danfoss' vapor injected scroll compressor, EKE110 controller, and economizer products all make it easier for heat pumps to operate in lower ambient conditions, and they also provide efficiency improvements in these same conditions. These are critical for heat pumps to have a wider adoption across climates,” said Dail. 

As new heat pump system technologies continue to support the electrification and decarbonization of space and water heating, Copeland's integrated compression, drives, and controls solutions are helping to meet energy-efficiency and capacity requirements, said John Schneider, president of HVACR technologies at Americas at Copeland. 

“Copeland will soon launch its next-generation, variable-speed scroll compressor platform: a new best-in-class offering designed to deliver excellent performance in the residential heat pump and air conditioning market,” said Schneider. “This solution-based offering combines proven scroll performance with matched inverter drive technology for long life, reliability, and ease of application.” 

 

The advanced technologies needed to support the electrification movement were on display all over the AHR Expo. Danfoss, for example, showed its new line of variable-speed, vapor injection, and scroll compressors, as well as its fixed-speed compressors that have recently been approved for vapor injection. 

“To further aid with vapor injection, our new EKE110 controller controls superheat entering a vapor-injected compressor's vapor injection port,” said Dail. “The EKE110 can also monitor the compressor's discharge temperature. This will allow it to enter ‘wet injection' mode if the scroll compressor's discharge temperature is too high, enabling the scroll compressor to operate with a larger operating envelope and allowing a heat pump to provide higher leaving water/leaving air temperatures at lower outdoor temperatures. The EKE110 is designed to be used with Danfoss scroll compressors but can potentially be used with other manufacturers' compressors as well.”

In addition, Danfoss showcased its vapor injection applications, which included electric expansion valves and brazed plate heat exchangers. The braze plate heat exchangers utilize Danfoss's microplate technology, enabling smaller heat exchangers to deliver the same level of heat transfer, said Dail. 

Copeland demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by showcasing products that support the energy transition and accelerate the adoption of low-GWP refrigerant technologies across heating, cooling, refrigeration, and industrial applications, said Schneider. Among these were advanced cooling solutions specifically designed to improve efficiency in energy- and heat-intensive data centers. 

“The Copeland oil-free centrifugal compressor with Aero-lift bearing technology unlocks new opportunities for air-cooled data center chillers, delivering best-in-class performance and increased efficiencies in part-load and full-load conditions,” said Schneider. “In addition, the Copeland YDV variable-speed scroll platform is optimized explicitly for data center applications and delivers best-in-class efficiency, reliability, and performance across a wide range of outdoor ambient and evaporating temperatures.” 

Copeland also showcased its YAW vapor-injection optimized scroll compressor, which is capable of delivering high supply air temperatures at outdoor temperatures as low as -25°F. This technology enables the creation of reliable, high-efficiency heat pumps that can perform effectively in cold climates, supporting wider adoption across all regions. On the commercial refrigeration side, Copeland highlighted its expanded CO2 solutions and optimized scroll compression platforms for A2L and R-290 refrigerants. 

Infinitum unveiled the Aircore Heavy Duty, a next-generation motor system specifically designed for mission-critical HVAC fan and pump applications. According to Mathew, this sustainable motor reduces energy consumption, emissions, noise, and waste, while delivering reliable performance for the most demanding tasks. 

“The Aircore Heavy Duty features an integrated variable-frequency drive and sustainably powers demanding, energy-intense applications with up to 25% more efficiency, while being 50% lighter and 60% shorter when compared to conventional motor and drive solutions,” said Mathew. “Built with a rugged exterior for protection against dust, dirt, and water, the Aircore Heavy Duty operates reliably in harsh outdoor or wet environments and at high efficiency over a wide range of operating points.” 

Infinitum also showcased new motor system technology that features an integrated Active Front End within the VFD, which reduces total harmonic distortion. This feature improves HVAC equipment efficiency, reliability, and safety, while eliminating the need for bulky, energy-consuming passive filters, said Mathew. By integrating this feature, he added, the technology saves space, energy, and costs, while achieving greater harmonic reduction.

The Sporlan Division of Parker Hannifin strives to be the market leader in energy-efficient and sustainable HVACR solutions that enable a better tomorrow, said John Eric Hoffmann, marketing communications manager at Sporlan. To that end, they introduced several new products, including the multi-purpose gas cooler (GCM) valve. 

“The GCM valve is used in transcritical CO2 applications in supermarket refrigeration, so that our customers can move to natural refrigerants for their cooling systems,” said Hoffmann. “In addition, we showcased products for the new lower-GWP A2L refrigerants in both air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Two of these products are our check shut-off valve (CSOV) and safety shut-off valve (SSOV), which are UL certified for A2L refrigerants and used in walk-in cooler applications to provide safety in a customer's system if a leak emerges.” 

Other products Sporlan displayed included Micro Thermo controls for CO2, which are designed with high-performance algorithms to increase the energy efficiency of CO2 refrigeration systems in supermarkets, as well as new TEVs, which have new charges for both commercial and residential air conditioning. “We are pleased to learn that these have been independently tested by several of our prospective and legacy customers, who are indicating that these units exceed the performance of our direct competitors in new A2L systems,” said Hoffmann. 

As shown here, the AHR Expo once again demonstrated the HVACR industry's commitment to innovation, with manufacturers unveiling groundbreaking solutions that prioritize energy efficiency, sustainability, and the transition to lower-GWP refrigerants.

Rajesh Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025


	Technology is shaping economies more profoundly than ever before, Nasscom President Rajesh Nambiar said on Thursday as he outlined India's strengths as a global talent hub which positions it as a preferred partner in the global technological ecosystem.


	Nambiar was speaking at the IT industry body's Global Confluence 2025 here.


	"Today, the world is in a bit of an inflection point than ever before. Some of the technologies are actually playing a lot more influence on the economic models that we are seeing in the country," he said.


	Nambiar noted that the world is experiencing a global technological shift, which has created a rising demand for a high-quality talent base to meet the challenges and opportunities of this new landscape.


	There is no industry or country that is growing without technology playing a leading role. All of them have always been driven by technology to some extent, he said.


	"A country like India continues to be a partner of choice for the global technological ecosystem," he said.


	The IT industry is projected to close FY25 with a valuation of approximately $283 billion and is expected to surpass $300 billion in the following year, he stated. He also acknowledged the digital economy's contribution to GDP, which is anticipated to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.


	India's unmatched technology talent pool stands out as one of its key competitive advantages, he remarked.


	"This industry employs roughly about 5.8 million people as of today and it continues to grow. We are 28 per cent of the global STEM talent market worldwide. 23 per cent of the software engineering talent is housed in India," he pointed out.


	Another point that makes India an important partner in the broader global tech ecosystem is its thriving startup and innovation ecosystem, Nambiar further said.


	With over 34,000 technology startups and 3,600 deep tech startups, the nation's fundamentals are strong, and technologies such as AI and quantum computing are well-established, he said.


	"The third one is around the very strong digital infrastructure. It is a critical component of what the digital economy depends on and how the economy grows over a period of time," Nambiar said.


	GCCs, which are growing rapidly, are another positive aspect, he noted.
