                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Beatle argues use of terms for meat-free products ‘encourages attitudes essential to our health' Paul McCartney has joined calls for the EU to reject efforts to ban the use of terms such as “sausage” and “burger” for vegetarian foods. The former Beatle has joined eight British MPs who have written to the European Commission arguing that a ban approved in October by the European parliament would address a nonexistent problem while slowing progress on climate goals. McCartney said: “To stipulate that burgers and sausages are ‘plant-based', ‘vegetarian' or ‘vegan' should be enough for sensible people to understand what they are eating. This also encourages attitudes which are essential to our health and that of the planet.” Linda McCartney sausages and burgers have been part of a global trend of increased interest in products to replace meat, even if investment has waned since a bubble during the coronavirus pandemic. The European parliament voted 355–247 to ban “meat-related” names from being used on plant-based products. The EU has a longstanding “geographical indication” system of preventing businesses from trading off the names of products associated with specific places, such as champagne (north-east France), Kalamata olives (southern Greece) or Parma ham (northern Italy). Many of the terms that would be banned have malleable meanings. For instance, the Collins dictionary defines a sausage firstly in relation to meat but secondly as “an object shaped like a sausage”. Even more problematically for a ban, the primary definition of “burger” is given as a “flat round mass of minced meat or vegetables”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement leaders have put out a petition calling for Donald Trump to fire Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin, who, since being appointed in late January, has quickly moved to undo toxic chemical regulations and fast-track pesticide approvals. Maha leaders have voiced a litany of grievances with Zeldin and the EPA as it enacted policies that they say has put public health at risk and benefited the chemical industry. “Rather than supporting your initiative to ‘Make America Healthy Again', which millions of Republicans and independents alike embraced, Administrator Zeldin has prioritized the interests of chemical corporations over the wellbeing of American families and children,” the petition reads. It was supported by about a dozen Maha influencers, including Zen Honeycutt, Kelly Ryerson, and Vani Hari. In a statement, an EPA spokesperson defended the agency, saying: “Administrator Zeldin has been working closely with President Trump and Secretary Kennedy to implement policies to Make America Healthy Again.” “I hold hope that the president is still committed to making America healthy again,” Ryerson said. “I do think if he had the real story of why these things that Zeldin is doing are incredibly damaging to human health, then he would be sympathetic to that.” The agency also drew outrage in recent weeks when it announced it would approve and propose more Pfas “forever chemicals” to be used in pesticides. Meanwhile, the administration and industry are working to undo some of the Pfas limits for drinking water put in place under Joe Biden. Ryerson also noted that Zeldin has repeatedly claimed criticism over the EPA's controversial moves are coming from the left, or are “Dem fake news”. “In fact, they are also coming from within his own party,” Ryerson added. Hari, a Maha influencer, told the Guardian that Zeldin could “put an end to this” by reversing a Biden-era EPA decision to change how it defines Pfas. However, the EPA in 2023 started considering on a “case by case” basis whether a chemical, like those used in pesticides, are Pfas. “If Zeldin truly believes in Maha, then he would reverse that rule immediately, and show the country that he stands with families, not with corporations,” Hari said. “Maha's long-term success depends on rigorous, transparent science,” a spokesperson said. The petition states that Zeldin's approach will lead to higher rates of chronic disease, higher medical costs, and “tremendous strain” on the healthcare system. “For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to remove Lee Zeldin from his position as EPA administrator and appoint a leader who will genuinely defend public health and truly put America first,” the petition language concludes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities say strain of virus that has killed wild boars in Catalonia is one often used for experiments in secure facilities Spanish authorities investigating the African swine fever outbreak in Catalonia are looking into the possibility that the disease may have leaked from a research facility and are focusing on five nearby laboratories as potential sources. Thirteen cases of the fever have been confirmed in wild boars in the countryside outside Barcelona since 28 November, prompting Spain to scramble to contain the outbreak before it becomes a serious threat to its pork export industry, which is worth €8.8bn (£7.7bn) a year. The regional authorities initially believed the disease may have begun to circulate after a wild boar ate contaminated food that had been brought in from outside Spain, perhaps in the form of a meat sandwich discarded by a haulier. “The ‘Georgia 2007' virus strain is a ‘reference' virus frequently used in experimental infections in containment facilities to study the virus or to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines, which are currently under development. Catalonia's regional president, Salvador Illa, said on Saturday that he had ordered the Catalan agrifood research institute to conduct an audit of five facilities within 20km (12 miles) of the outbreak site that work with the African swine fever virus. “The regional government isn't ruling out any possibilities when it comes to the origin of the outbreak of African swine fever, but neither is it confirming any,” he said. First and foremost, we need to know what happened.” It has said the corpses of 37 more wild animals found in the zone had been analysed, and that all had tested negative for swine fever. More than 100 personnel from Spain's military emergencies unit have also been deployed to the area to work alongside police and wildlife rangers. Spain, which is the EU's biggest pork producer, exported pig meat products worth €5.1bn to other EU countries last year, and almost €3.7bn of pork products to markets outside the bloc. Spain slaughtered 58 million pigs in 2021, up 40% from a decade earlier.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>25,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community — thank you. A Russian mass missile and drone attack overnight on Dec. 6 has once again hammered Ukraine's energy infrastructure, hitting substations, generation facilities, and disconnecting one of the power lines that supplies the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. "The main targets of these strikes are once again energy infrastructure," President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram. "The Russians' goal is to hurt millions of Ukrainians, and they have already fallen so low that they launch missiles at peaceful cities on St. Nicholas Day." Explosions were reported in Poltava, Lutsk, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, and Bila Tserkva during the attacks. Russian strikes damaged electricity generation, distribution, and transmission facilities in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Lviv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, and Kharkiv oblasts, the Energy Ministry reported. In Chernihiv Oblast, Russian drones hit a residential area as well as critical infrastructure in both the region and Chernihiv city, the State Emergency Services reported. The attack was "quite severe" for Ukraine's power system, Vitaliy Zaichenko, head of Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo, told the Kyiv Independent. Strikes hit Ukrenergo's substations and generation facilities, and disconnected one of the two power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. "Other nuclear power plants are now operating below their full capacity for safety reasons," he added.The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant lost all off-site power for half an hour, the 11th time during Russia's full-scale invasion, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wrote on X. Russian strikes also hit thermal power plants owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, in the sixth mass attack since October. "As of the morning, there are power outages in Odesa, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Mykolaiv oblasts. There were also civilian casualties, with at least eight people injured, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram. Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that a 42-year-old man suffered shrapnel wounds in the city of Fastiv, located about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Kyiv's center. An 11-year-old boy was also injured in Nikopol during the attack. In the western city of Lutsk, Mayor Ihor Polishchuk reported that several food warehouses had caught fire.Warehouses with food and medicine were also burning in the cities of Dnipro and Bila Tserkva in Kyiv Oblast, Klymenko reported. Poland's Air Force said on social media that it had scrambled fighter jets to protect Polish airspace amid reports of the hours-long attack on western Ukraine. Russian forces have regularly attacked Kyiv and its surrounding regions in recent months amid U.S. efforts to negotiate the end of Russia's war in Ukraine. In the latest mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv on Nov. 13-14, seven people were killed and 29 others were injured. China says recent joint anti-missile drills with Russia on Russian territory were routine and not aimed at any third party. Czech President Petr Pavel warned that repeated Russian airspace violations may eventually force Europe to shoot down Russian aircraft and drones, and said European countries must be ready to fight and win a war on their own if the U.S. is tied up elsewhere. Amid an ongoing Russian offensive, Ukraine has liberated a village in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState and Ukraine's military reported. Russia launched five ballistic missiles and 241 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on another failed round of U.S.-Russia diplomacy over a controversial peace plan, as Moscow presses ahead on the battlefield and advances in and near Pokrovsk. Trump envoy Keith Kellogg says a Ukraine peace deal is in its “final stretch” as talks focus on territorial concessions and security guarantees. Locals reported explosions near the Engels airfield and an oil depot amid overnight drone attacks in Russia's Saratov and Rostov oblasts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem cut the central bank's rate in Oct., 2025, and indicated this would likely be the last in an easing cycle.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press The central bank cut its benchmark policy rate to 2.25 per cent in October, but indicated that this would likely be the last cut in an easing cycle that began a year-and-half earlier. Since then, inflation, economic growth and employment data have all surprised to the upside, suggesting the Canadian economy has weathered U.S. tariffs better than expected in recent months. After four rate cuts this year – and nine since the summer of 2024 – markets now believe the central bank will remain on hold though most of next year, with the next move more likely to be a hike than a cut, according to Bloomberg data. Investors are betting the U.S. central bank will cut by another quarter-point this week, taking the federal funds target range to 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. Rob Carrick: Want to make people more anxious about their finances? But it was always going to be a close call, Mr. Janzen and Ms. Fan wrote, and recent communication from Fed committee members suggests a cut is coming. Looking further ahead, the trajectory for U.S. monetary policy is complicated by questions around who will succeed Mr. Powell as Fed chair when his term ends next spring. The leading candidate is widely believed to be Kevin Hassett, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump and director of the National Economic Council. He is seen by many analysts as a dovish choice who would pursue Mr. Trump's desire for lower interest rates. U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's term ends in 2026, and Trump ally Kevin Hassett is expected to take the reigns.CAROLINE GUTMAN/The New York Times News Service The situation in Canada, by comparison, appears relatively clear cut. He didn't rule out further cuts if the Canadian economy takes a nose dive. That hold-steady stance seems to be supported by recent data. Much of the 2.6 per cent annualized GDP growth was a statistical quirk, caused by falling imports. But the number was still notably stronger than Bay Street and central bank forecasts, and means the country avoided two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which analysts sometimes call a “technical recession.” Opinion: What to do in this trade war when inflation and recession strike at once? There was also a major upward revision to past GDP growth numbers for 2022, 2023 and 2024, suggesting the Canadian economy was on a stronger footing than previously appreciated heading into the current period of trade tensions. The firmer economic backdrop could also help explain why core CPI has been stickier than expected,” Benjamin Reitzes, head of Canadian rates strategy at Bank of Montreal wrote in a note to clients. “Monetary policy… can't target the hard-hit sectors: aluminum, steel and autos. It can't help companies reconfigure their supply chains,” Mr. Macklem said in October. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

Trudeau reshared the post, saying he is thankful to Kishida for his friendship. When the two were spotted together earlier this year at Le Violon in Montreal, Perry had recently ended a nearly nine-year relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The concert sighting took over social media with one video posted online showing Trudeau clapping and nodding his head as the “Firework” singer performed on stage.

MOSCOW, December 7. /TASS/. Russia stands "shoulder to shoulder" with the Venezuelan leadership and calls on the administration of US President Donald Trump to avoid escalating the situation with Caracas into a full-scale conflict, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS.

The senior diplomat noted that Moscow views the situation around Venezuela with great alarm and concern, as "tensions are not easing" and "escalation continues." "This is primarily due to the desire to establish the unquestionable US dominance in the region, which is the ‘trademark' of the Trump administration," Ryabkov explained.

"We express our solidarity with Venezuela, with whom we recently signed a strategic partnership and cooperation agreement," the deputy foreign minister noted. "We support Venezuela, as it supports us, in many areas. In this hour of trial, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Caracas and the Venezuelan leadership. We hope that the Trump administration will refrain from further escalating the situation toward a full-scale conflict. We urge it to do so," Ryabkov emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has released its predecessor KGB's archives on 12 Nazi collaborators who fled to Canada to escape prosecution, according to the agency's website. The documents reveal that the war criminals were from the Belarusian, Ukrainian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as the Kirov and Smolensk Regions. Theodor Adamtau, an Estonian national, served in the German army in 1944 and then joined the ranks of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), a punitive police unit, and participated in the shooting of Soviet prisoners of war. According to 1956 data, he lived in the Canadian city of Feliston. Aijinas Vladas, a Lithuanian native who led the execution of more than 7,500 Soviet citizens near the city of Panevezys, lived in Ontario in 1962 and kept in touch with relatives under the name Pivoriunas. Anatoly Aksyonov was born in the village of Shirokobokov in the Kirov Region. In August 1943, he supervised the shooting of more than 700 Soviet Jews in the town of Vishnevo. In 1957, he lived in the Canadian city of Edmonton, from where he sent letters to relatives under the surname Nalyvaiko. On November 29, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) launched a new project called "The Red Book of the KGB of the USSR" to publish information about Nazi collaborators who had fled to Western countries. The FSB press office noted that the archives in this section on its website will be updated weekly.</p>

MOSCOW, December 7. /TASS/. The change of the US national security strategy by the administration of President Donald Trump, where Russia is not mentioned as a "direct threat," is a positive step, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.

"We consider this is a positive step," Peskov said.

The messages for Russia-US relations sent by the administration of US President Donald Trump differs from approaches of previous administrations, the Kremlin spokesman noted. "Overall, these messages are certainly in contrast with approaches of previous administrations," the presidential press secretary said.

The Kremlin is going to review the updated US national security strategy in more detail and to analyze its provisions, the press secretary of the Russian President stressed. "Certainly, it should be considered, analyzed in more detail," Peskov noted.

The Kremlin Spokesman made his comment on the update of the key US document in the national security sphere. It does not contain the mentioning of Russia as the "direct threat" and contains the call to cooperate with Moscow in the strategic stability sphere.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A nightclub fire in the popular Indian resort region of Goa has killed at least 25 people including four tourists, officials said. The blaze is suspected to have broken out after a cylinder exploded in the kitchen area of the club in Arpora village around midnight on Saturday local time, CNN affiliate News18 reported. Seven people are being treated for injuries, including one person with 60% burns, it added. Four managers of the nightclub have been arrested, local police said, according to News18. “There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,” Shaikh said. A temporary structure covered in palm leaves quickly caught fire, she added. “Today is a very painful day for all of us in Goa,” the state's Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said Sunday morning in a post on X. Videos on social media showed fire trucks and ambulances lining up to help the injured. Goa's Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said on X that the injured were taken to Goa Medical College and Hospital, and are receiving “the best possible medical care,” with teams working through the night. “In this moment of profound grief, we stand firmly with the affected families, assuring them of our unwavering support in every possible way,” Rane added. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the fire was “deeply saddening” and pledged that his office would offer compensation of up to 200,000 rupees ($2,200) to each family of those killed and 50,000 rupees ($556) to the injured. “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones,” he said on X. An inquiry has been ordered to “examine the exact cause of the fire and whether fire safety norms and building rules were followed,” Sawant said. “In half an hour we extinguished the fire. The state's Chief Minister said the owners did not have permission to construct the club, and it had been issued with a demolition notice which was stayed by officials, News18 reported. This story has been updated with additional developments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan said on Sunday that Chinese fighter jets had directed fire-control radar at Japanese military aircraft in two “dangerous” incidents near Japan's Okinawa islands, an account Beijing denied. “These radar illuminations went beyond what is necessary for the safe flight of aircraft,” Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi posted on X, adding that Japan had lodged a protest with China over Saturday's “regrettable” incident. Meeting with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles in Tokyo, Koizumi said Japan would respond “resolutely and calmly” to China's conduct to maintain regional peace and stability. A Chinese navy spokesperson, Colonel Wang Xuemeng, said Japanese aircraft had repeatedly approached and disrupted the Chinese navy as it was conducting previously announced carrier-based flight training east of the Miyako Strait. Relations have soured in the past month since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warned that Japan could respond to any Chinese military action against Taiwan if it also threatened Japan's security. Directing fire-control radar at another aircraft is a threatening step because it signals a potential attack and may force the targeted plane to take evasive action. Wang, in a statement on official social media channels, countered that Japan's statement was erroneous and its actions had seriously endangered flight safety. “The Chinese Navy will take necessary measures in accordance with the law to resolutely safeguard its own security and legitimate rights and interests.” Australia's Marles, at a press conference with Koizumi after discussions on deepening defense cooperation, said, “We are deeply concerned by the actions of China in the last 24 hours. Taiwan lies just 110 km (70 miles) from Japan's westernmost island, Yonaguni. The US State Department and the US Embassy in Tokyo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Japan's claims about China's use of its fire-control radar. US Ambassador to Japan George Glass has publicly expressed support for Japan in several social media posts since the diplomatic dispute began, but President Donald Trump and other senior US officials have remained silent. Trump, who plans to visit Beijing next year for trade talks, telephoned Takaichi last month, urging her not to escalate the dispute, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. That call followed a conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who told Trump that Taiwan's return to China was central to Beijing's vision for the world order, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Japan said it scrambled F-15 fighters in response to flight operations from the Chinese carrier. Three years later, Beijing accused Japanese jets of directing fire-control radar at Chinese fighters. In June, Japan said Chinese jets flew dangerously close to one of its patrol aircraft near Okinawa. On Thursday, China had more than 100 naval and coast guard vessels deployed across East Asian waters at one point, Reuters reported, citing sources and intelligence reports. Taiwan's government described that build-up as posing a threat to the Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan's coast guard said China was using “misleading and false wording” about what it was doing, with the aim of harassing Taiwan and carrying out psychological warfare. China says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait, a major trade route for about half of global container ships.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The marathon Miami meeting began on Thursday between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Ukrainian officials Rustem Umerov and Andriy Hnatov. After three days of talks, “difficult issues remain,” Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna said Saturday, “but both sides continue working to shape realistic and acceptable solutions.” “The main challenges at this stage concern questions of territory and guarantees, and we are actively seeking optimal formats for addressing them,” Stefanishyna said. “More details will be provided once all information is compiled.” Territory and security guarantees are long-standing sticking points for any possible deal. As the meetings kicked off earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters in India that his country intends to seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas region by any means. In a social media post on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he had a “long” and “constructive” phone conversation with Witkoff and Kushner, as well as his Ukrainian delegation in Miami. “We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full-scale invasion,” Zelensky said. Zelensky said that Hnatov and Umerov are expected to deliver him a “detailed in person report” on the negotiations. “Not everything can be discussed over the phone,” Zelensky said. “So we need to work closely with our teams on ideas and proposals.” Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Trump administration's document has dropped language describing Russia as a threat, state-owned news agency TASS reported. “We considered this a positive step,” Peskov told the news agency. “Overall, these messages are certainly in contrast with approaches of previous administrations.” The strategy document says European nations regard Russia as “an existential threat,” but paints the US as having a significant role in diplomacy to re-establish “conditions of stability within Europe and strategic stability with Russia.”</p>

Gavin Newsom, considered by some to be the frontrunner to be the next Democratic presidential nominee, said during a panel on Wednesday that he wants his party to be a “big tent” that welcomes large numbers of people into the fold. But he's “adamantly against” one of the most popular proposals Democrats have to offer: a wealth tax. In October, progressive economists Emmanuel Saez and Robert Reich joined forces with one of California's most powerful unions, the Service Employees International Union's (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers West, to propose that California put the nation's first-ever wealth tax on the ballot in November 2026. Among those beneficiaries were the approximately 200 billionaires living in California, whose average annual income, Saez pointed out, has risen by 7.5% per year, compared with 1.5% for median-income residents. Under the proposal, they would pay a one-time 5% tax on their total net worth, which is estimated to raise $100 billion. @GavinNewsom says he disagrees with Mayor @ZohranKMamdani about the need for a wealth tax on billionaires, which he is “adamantly against” – says Dems are a “big tent party” with both views. The proposal in California has strong support from unions and healthcare groups. But Newsom has called it “bad policy” and “another attempt to grab money for special purposes.” At Wednesday's New York Times DealBook Summit, Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Newsom about his opposition to the wealth tax idea, comparing it to a proposal by recent New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who pledged to increase the income taxes of New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year by 2% in order to fund his city-wide free buses, universal childcare, and city-owned grocery store programs. Mamdani's proposal was met with a litany of similar warnings from Big Apple bigwigs who threatened to flee the city and others around the country who said they'd never move in. Wealthy individuals and their income move at lower rates than other income brackets, even in response to an increase of personal income tax.” Many of those who sulked about Mamdani's victory have notably begun making amends with the incoming mayor. As Harold Meyerson explained, also for the Prospect: “It is a one-time-only tax, to be levied exclusively on billionaires' current (i.e., 2025) net worth. Nevertheless, Sorkin framed Newsom as being in an existential battle of ideas with Mamdani, asking how the two could both represent the Democratic Party when they are so “diametrically opposed.” “Well, I want to be a big-tent party,” Newsom replied. Polling is scarce so far on the likelihood of such a measure passing in California. A billionaire income tax garnered the most support across party identification. In national polls, a wealth tax had similarly high levels of support. That sentiment only seems to have grown since the return of President Donald Trump. Across the board, just 15% said they should not be raised. Support remains high when the proposal is more specific as well. Many observers were perplexed by how Newsom proposes to maintain a “big tent” while opposing policies supported by most of the people inside it. “Gavin Newsom — estimated net worth between $20 and $30 million — says he's opposed to a billionaire wealth tax. Color me shocked,” wrote the Columbia University lecturer Anthony Zenkus.

It demanded that states share their voter rolls with federal officials; mandated onerous proof-of-citizenship rules for people registering to vote (rules which didn't include drivers' licenses as valid forms of ID for this purpose); threatened local and state officials who didn't cooperate with this power grab with legal sanctions; and ostensibly outlawed the counting of any mail-in ballots received after Election Day. More recently, the White House announced it would soon be delivering another executive order going after mail-in voting more generally, and, in particular, that it would be targeting California's voting system which, it alleged without evidence, was rife with fraud. And when the administration pushes new restrictions on voting, California and other states have already made it clear they will head straight to court. In January 2021, Trump and his acolytes attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, alleging that the election which he lost by millions of votes to Joe Biden was riddled with fraud. That process has lasted all year, has resulted in wholesale purges, and, if Trump has his way, will lead to a slew of prosecutions against the officials who backed Jack Smith's special investigation. Many of the people who peddled outlandish election conspiracies five years ago are now in positions overseeing election integrity in the United States. A New York Times investigative report found that Honey has, in private conversations with hard-right activists, proposed declaring a “national emergency” to allow federal official to bypass states and seize control over voting processes. And most of the senior personnel in the voting rights section of the Department of Justice have been dismissed, as have most active cases involving allegations against locales for creating racially discriminatory barriers to voting. Trump came into office determined to undermine the independence of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) — and promptly proceeded to fire board members who had been nominated by Democratic presidents. He has issued executive orders attempting to place independent executive branch agencies, including the FEC, under his direct control. In other words, there is now a systematic effort afoot to break down, or render impotent, key institutional players that could serve to limit Trump's efforts to manipulate the outcome of the 2026 elections. Making a bad situation worse, during the DOGE purges, the new administration slashed spending on cyber security and other security measures that warn states of threats to election systems, leaving elections officials largely floundering in the face of risks they no longer were receiving adequate briefings on. This is a historically unprecedented rollback of election security safeguards. And at a state level, too, the rot is also accelerating. In key swing states such as Pennsylvania, the GOP has elevated election denying legislators to control the committees charged with setting election policy. Add into the mix Trump's order to GOP state legislators in Texas and many other states to engage in mid-decade gerrymandering, so as to secure more than a dozen additional seats in the House of Representatives, as well as the likely Supreme Court ruling undermining Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and thus allowing southern states to legislate out of existence Black-majority districts, and the stage has been set for a massive onslaught on the concept of a level playing field for elections. Republicans could, in consequence, lose the popular vote by several percent and still end up in control of Congress. None of this is to say that the Democrats won't win control of the House next year — recent polls suggest Republicans are in deep electoral trouble. Thus, even with the GOP's head start guaranteed by all of these shenanigans, it's entirely possible Democratic candidates will overcome Republican advantages in dozens of districts around the country. But Trump's actions this past year do not give confidence that he will easily accept such an election defeat. He is maneuvering key agencies to be utilized to challenge results that don't go his way, and his executive orders suggest a willingness to use federal muscle — even that of the military — to seize control both of election processes and of ballot boxes if things head too far south for the Republicans. High-profile Democratic governors such as Illinois's Jay Pritzker and California's Gavin Newsom have warned that the deployment of National Guard troops into cities this year is likely a precursor for a concerted effort to send federal agents into Democratic cities and states during the 2026 elections.

If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Herrera-Cruz says a passerby stopped, began harassing him, and called the police. When local sheriff's deputies arrived, instead of helping with the flat tire, they arrested Herrera-Cruz. According to a Department of Justice press release, Herrera-Cruz was picked up on March 18, 2025, and charged with illegal reentry. He had previously been deported in March 2022 and made his way back to the country. He was arrested in Camden County, Missouri, best known for the Lake of the Ozarks, a scenic stretch of waterways surrounded by mountains. The state governor and local officials have eagerly collaborated with federal immigration agents to carry out the new administration's mass deportation plans. Despite its deep-red reputation, Missouri is also home to a growing movement of local community members organizing to fight back against mass deportation. Mike Kehoe signed an executive order entering into a 287(g) agreement for collaboration between the Missouri State Highway Patrol and ICE. The 287(g) program authorizes state and local police to carry out immigration enforcement duties, with Trump going so far as to offer financial incentives for training officers. In Missouri, 287(g) agreements have been rapidly expanding among law enforcement agencies across the state. In September 2025, the governor activated 15 members of the Missouri National Guard to provide “logistical support” to federal immigration agents. In January 2025, the county completed a jail expansion project that doubled its capacity to 400 beds. As Trump has shifted the U.S. deportation machine into high gear, the Phelps County jail has served as a holding facility, keeping between 50 to 70 immigrants on any given day. An expanding detention network is being built out across the Midwest. Since Illinois banned immigrant detention, ICE sends people to county jails in nearby states. In a red state like Missouri, many of the sheriffs are Republican and support Trump's anti-immigrant policies. Three counties in central Missouri have opened their jail doors to ICE for immigrants arrested in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and elsewhere across the Midwest. Jails exist in part to hide people away from society. But in central Missouri, a growing number of community organizations are sprouting up to make sure immigrants in local jails aren't forgotten. The Phelps County jail is located in Rolla, Missouri, a small college town with a population of around 20,000 that is home to the Missouri University of Science and Technology. They pay for phone calls so immigrants at the jail can talk to their families. Despite being a university town, “Rolla, like most of Missouri, is pretty red,” said Lucy Behrendt, current president of Abide in Love. “A lot of us followed the rhetoric of this administration during the campaign and knew this was what was going to happen,” Behrendt told Truthout. “So when this group formed, it's like, okay, something that I can do, besides just post stuff on Facebook, go to protests or whatever, something I can actually do, on the ground.” While members of Abide in Love may oppose immigrant detention, they must rely on the cooperation of Phelps County Sheriff Mike Kirn to get access to immigrants in the jail. The group's name is inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and they use his philosophy to navigate the conservative political landscape. “We use the six principles [of nonviolence] at every meeting. We read them and use the strategies to help bring about a beloved community,” Abide in Love's founder Amy Beechner-McCarthy told St. Louis Public Radio. “That helps us focus on working within the system.” Abide in Love is a “great help for everyone,” said Herrera-Cruz. Everyone in the organization is very kind, and they support us, whether with money or an encouraging text message. Abide in Love chapters are spreading across Missouri to other county jails holding immigrants for ICE. Genevieve County, along the Mississippi River bordering Illinois. Board member Susie Johnson told Truthout they filed for nonprofit status, trained volunteers, reached out to immigrants in the jail, and provided support. Genevieve is doing by helping those detained and offering support,” Johnson said, “that's a form of protest. Marshals Service is used to hold ICE detainees. In November, the arrest by ICE of Ismael Ayuzo Sandoval, beloved owner of a Mexican restaurant in Staunton, Illinois, sparked community outrage. Sandoval is currently being held in the Ste. Abide in Love has been working to mobilize around these high-profile cases. The Immigrant Justice Collaborative is advocating for legislative change, including the repeal of a ban on sanctuary cities in Missouri. Others have founded the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance (SMIA) which is more vocal in pressuring Sheriff Jim Arnott to stop holding immigrants at the county jail in Greene County, located in Springfield. By monitoring the sheriff's online data, the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance has been reporting statistics about detention on social media. According to SMIA, there have been more than 1,400 people held for ICE detention since May 14, 2025. In mid-November, daily population had grown to 295 people currently being held. Of those, 219 are listed as “Hispanic.” The contract with U.S. Asked to respond to whether he will keep the contract, Sheriff Arnott told Truthout, “Yes, we will,” but did not provide any reasoning. They called on Sheriff Arnott and Greene County Commissioners to release Dadfar, an asylum seeker who served in the army in Afghanistan and was forced to flee the county with his family after the Taliban took over. Dadfar is a long-haul truck driver who lives in Colorado, but was arrested driving through Indiana when he stopped at the Chesterton Weigh Station on Interstate 94. He was one more than 140 truck drivers rounded up in “Operation Midway Blitz” as part of a crackdown on immigrant drivers issued commercial driver's licenses by sanctuary states in New York and elsewhere. After he was waved aside at the weigh station in Indiana, Dadfar was held for five hours before ICE showed up to arrest him. He was taken to a holding facility in Chicago for two days, then transferred to the Greene County jail in Missouri. There, SMIA members got in contact with Dadfar who asked that they reach out to Marissa Seuc-Hester, a friend through a local church in Boulder County, Colorado. “We met Ali's family when they arrived in Colorado,” Seuc-Hester told Truthout. “We were matched up with them to provide community connection and allyship as they built their new life here.” Her church ministry helps to resettle new immigrants by assisting with paperwork, building resumes, and registering children for school. Public pressure recently helped to free Dadfar who was ordered released by a court order on December 1, 2025. He had spent nearly two months in the Greene County jail.

Russian forces launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Dec. 7, targeting the central city of Kremenchuk and Chernihiv and Kyiv oblasts, killing at least one man, officials reported. Explosions were heard in Kremenchuk, Poltava Oblast, beginning around 1:30 a.m. local time, monitoring groups reported, as Ukraine's Air Force warned of approaching Kinzhal missiles and dozens of drones. Kremenchuk's mayor, Vitaliy Maletsky, reported that there were disruptions to electricity, water and heating in parts of the city, with crews working to restore critical services. Governor Volodymyr Kohut reported that several energy enterprises in the Kremenchuk district were hit, with direct hits and falling debris causing fires and damaging technical equipment. During the attack, Russian drones also targeted an enterprise, critical infrastructure, and energy facilities in Chernihiv Oblast, Governor Viacheslav Chaus said on Dec. 7. According to Chaus, Russian Geran drones killed a 50-year-old man in his house and injured a police officer in Novhorod-Siverskyi, Chernihiv Oblast. A police station, medical college, and houses were also damaged. In the city of Chernihiv, Russian drones attacked a thermal power facility. There were no reports of damages by publication time. The city has been tareted recently: On Dec. 5,  Russian forces targeted Fastiv as part of a  mass missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Fastiv's main train station was struck in the attack, which President Volodymyr Zelensky described as "militarily senseless." China says recent joint anti-missile drills with Russia on Russian territory were routine and not aimed at any third party. Czech President Petr Pavel warned that repeated Russian airspace violations may eventually force Europe to shoot down Russian aircraft and drones, and said European countries must be ready to fight and win a war on their own if the U.S. is tied up elsewhere. Amid an ongoing Russian offensive, Ukraine has liberated a village in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState and Ukraine's military reported. Russia launched five ballistic missiles and 241 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on another failed round of U.S.-Russia diplomacy over a controversial peace plan, as Moscow presses ahead on the battlefield and advances in and near Pokrovsk. Trump envoy Keith Kellogg says a Ukraine peace deal is in its “final stretch” as talks focus on territorial concessions and security guarantees.
