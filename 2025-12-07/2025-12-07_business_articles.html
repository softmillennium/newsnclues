                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proportion of volume from suppliers in China, Hong Kong, and Korea has declined from 90% to 50% over the past decade, reflecting a long-term diversification of supply chains that picked up steam during the first Trump administration and trade war, according to an analysis from Wells Fargo Supply Chain Finance. "From 2018 to 2020, the supplier diversification away from China nearly doubled after the first tariff actions," said Jeremy Jansen, head of global originations at Wells Fargo Supply Chain Finance. He said since the first trade war, the gradual increase in supply chain diversification away from China to the South Asia Pacific region has steadily grown. "Based on our supplier counts, diversification is now 50/50 between the northern Asia Pacific region and the Southern," Jansen said. "The migration of midsize suppliers can be tracked into Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Malaysia," he added. Imports from China to the U.S. have dropped by 26 percent year-over-year, according to data from freight intelligence firm SONAR, but trade volumes from China to the South Asia Pacific region have significantly increased. While it remains unclear what will happen to President Donald Trump's tariffs plan with the U.S. Supreme Court decision pending and major companies already suing for refunds, in the short-term, the impact of Trump's tariffs can be seen increasingly on business balance sheets, as U.S. importers are turning more to financial arrangements in an effort to preserve cash. "We have seen an increase in working capital needs post-Liberation Day due to higher tariffs," said Ajit Menon, head of HSBC's U.S. trade finance business. "The average tariff increased from 1.5 percent to double digits," he said. For example, generic pharmaceuticals and retail/apparel lack negotiating power due to thin margins. "This is why trading counterparties are negotiating payment terms as an alternative, which is where the need for financing emerges," said Menon. HSBC, which finances more than $850 billion in global trade flows annually, introduced its Trade Pay platform earlier this year, which helps clients monetize receivables, payables, and inventory. Since Trump's initial April rollout of sweeping global tariffs, Menon says the bank has seen a roughly 20 percent increase in financing flows across all client segments, and use is increasing as the inventory brought into the U.S. in early 2025 as part of a trade frontloading winds down. "The surplus inventory brought in to offset tariffs is now nearly exhausted," Menon said. "That means companies will need more working capital moving forward as terms get renegotiated." In a recent survey of 1,000 U.S. companies conducted by HSBC, more than 70 percent of respondents said they were facing increasing working capital requirements year over year, and Menon said this is prompting many to reexamine their supply chain strategy and their payment terms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When workers retire, a key decision they may face concerns their 401(k) savings — do they leave the money in their employer plan, or roll it over to an individual retirement account? These changes are intended to accommodate better the needs of retired workers, who shift from accumulating assets as an employee to spending them as a retiree. It's also generally in the company's interest to keep retirees with large balances in its 401(k) plan, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research for the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "Keeping high-balance accounts in their plan [means] they can spread the costs among more assets," Copeland said. The slow but steady changes are coming as roughly 11,000 people turn age 65 every day, in what's called "peak 65" — the biggest number of Americans hitting that age in history, according to the Alliance for Lifetime Income. An estimated 4.1 million are expected to reach that age from 2024 through 2027. Additionally, more workers are reaching retirement with a 401(k) and need to figure out how to stretch it across their lifetime. That's in contrast to decades ago, when it was more common to retire with a company-sponsored pension that delivered steady income throughout retirement. Older workers — those at least age 55 — are more likely than younger workers to self-direct their retirement investments versus use professional guidance, according to Vanguard's 2025 How America Retires study. One-half of them are do-it-yourself investors, and they tend to have higher balances, averaging $420,000. The fear of not having enough income is prevalent among savers: 66% worry they'll run out of money in retirement, according to Blackrock's 2025 Read on Retirement survey. The majority — 93% — want guaranteed income in their golden years. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. While ex-workers can roll over their 401(k) money to an IRA, it also means managing their own assets or paying a professional to do it. There also are a host of factors that should be considered before moving the money, including available investment options and fees, experts say. Of course, it may not occur to retirees that they can leave their assets in their 401(k): More than half — 53% — of 401(k) participants are unaware that they don't have to move their money, according to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office. The other exception: Small accounts, which are often kicked out of the 401(k) plan when an employee retires or otherwise leaves. If the money is not put into another qualified retirement account (i.e., an IRA), it is considered a distribution that may be subject to income taxes and, potentially, a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Employers also may roll over balances of under $7,000 to an IRA. Last year, 68% of plans let retirees establish installment payments from their accounts, and 43% of plans allowed them to take partial ad hoc cash distributions — up from 59% and 16%, respectively, in 2015, Vanguard's research shows. If a plan doesn't have those options, any retiree seeking to use part of their retirement savings has to withdraw the entire balance or roll it over. However, be aware that even with installment payments or occasional withdrawals, you may face some limitations. "Many plans are rigid when it comes to withdrawals, not only in the frequency that is allowed but in selecting what to sell to fund a withdrawal," said certified financial planner Daniel Galli, principal with Daniel J. Galli & Associates in Norwell, Massachusetts. "Many plans require withdrawals to be pro-rata from all holdings," Galli said. In contrast, in an IRA, "you can select which funds to sell, and this can allow you to sell investments that are doing well or better than others, potentially prolonging your portfolio," said CFP Rose Price, a financial advisor and partner with VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia. The Secure Act of 2019, which made a variety of changes to the U.S. retirement system, included a provision intended to eliminate companies' fear of legal liability if their chosen annuity provider fails or otherwise doesn't deliver on its promises. "Some plans have started to offer these different types of income options, but we still don't know what the real take-up of it is," Copeland said. Some may provide a standalone annuity option, while others offer annuity-enhanced target-date funds. In simple terms, these are target-date funds that allocate some of your money toward a future annuity purchase. Target-date funds overall start out invested aggressively when you're far from retirement and gradually shift to less risky investments as you get closer to retirement. "There are certain plans that have adopted those [annuity-enhanced TDFs], but it hasn't been at huge scale," Copeland said. Roughly $29 billion is invested in these funds, which is a tiny fraction of the more than $4 trillion invested in target-date strategies, according to Morningstar. You have to choose to take the income part of it, and we don't know yet what people will do." In other words, annuitization won't be automatic — the person will have to actively choose to use the money for an annuity. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

In particular, the challenges facing the US Air Force's airlift force could undercut its plan for keeping units dispersed and survivable in a fight with China. In a new Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies paper, retired Air Force Col. Robert Owen, who flew C-130 transport aircraft during his 28-year career and also served in a leadership role at Air Mobility Command, argues the current size and state of the airlift fleet may not meet potential wartime demand. "The US Air Force, in particular, may not have enough airlift to support its ACE concept," Owen says, referring to the service's Agile Combat Employment strategy aimed at disaggregating assets to make it harder for an adversary to cripple US airpower in a single overwhelming strike. The US military relies heavily on a mix of C-17s, converted airliners, and helicopters to haul cargo, refuel aircraft, and move people between theaters. But many of these airframes are now decades old and sliding toward obsolescence, Owen writes. Some airlift aircraft, like the C-17, are already flying beyond their originally planned service lives. The Air Force's 52 C-5M Super Galaxies — its largest airlifters — now average 37 years old and suffer from low mission-capable rates, Owen notes. Other military leaders have raised concerns about airlift capacity, recognizing significant drops from Desert Storm in the 1990s to now. That presents challenges as the US focuses its attention more on higher-end threats like Russia or China. While the first two basing options can be supported by prepositioned stocks and host-nation support, small fighter teams at dispersed FARPs could be dependent almost entirely on C-17s and other theater mobility aircraft to bring in the fuel, weapons, and people. The Air Force has been training on its ACE concept for years, having airmen maintain, fly out of, and land across atypical locations like a simple airfield or even a stretch of highway. The concept is that while many air bases are in range and easily targeted, China would be unable to devastate American airpower if it were dispersed across the Indo-Pacific at a mix of traditional and makeshift airfields. But, Owen writes, the Air Force "has not acquired significant numbers of aircraft capable of operating at the lower end of this requirement — delivering combat equipment and supplies into short and weakly surfaced forward airfields — and has no publicly released plans to do so. The budgets are not sized for this mission growth." Thus, efforts to expand and sustain the airlift fleet should be a priority for the Department of Defense, he says. The US still retains significant advantages in stealth aircraft, global logistics, combat experience, and allied support, they note, but China's sustained investment in capability is narrowing the gap and changing the balance of risk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stock market continues to be volatile as concerns about the elevated valuations of artificial intelligence stocks impact investor sentiment. Investors looking beyond short-term noise might want to consider enhancing their portfolios with stocks having attractive long-term growth potential. To that end, top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick the right stocks, as their recommendations are based on in-depth analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is Credo Technology (CRDO), a provider of connectivity solutions for AI-driven applications, cloud computing, and hyperscale networks. Credo reported upbeat results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2026, generating a 272% surge in revenue. Impressed by the Q2 performance, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya boosted the price target for Credo stock to $240 from $165 and reiterated a buy rating, calling it a top small-midcap pick and including it among his favorite AI picks, with the others being chip giants Nvidia, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an outperform rating on CRDO stock with a price target of $194. Arya highlighted that Credo's top line figures increased by double digits sequentially and triple digits year over-year for the fourth straight quarter, driven by strength in the company's active electrical cable, or  AEC product line. He added that new customer acquisition and product diversification are vital for the company's future sales. The analyst also noted that despite some concerns about growing competition from rivals like Marvell Technology and Astera Labs, Credo expects mid-single-digit quarter-over-quarter sales growth throughout fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027. This optimism is backed by the expansion of AEC adoption at four large hyperscalers and the beginning of revenue contribution from a fifth customer. "In total, we now see up to $10bn TAM [total addressable market] for CRDO, driven by its system-level electrical/optical solutions that leverage its in-house SerDes [Serializer-Deserializer technology]," said Arya. Assuming a 50% market share, or about $5 billion in annual sales, the analyst sees the possibility of Credo delivering earnings per share of about $10 to $11 at 45% net margin. We move on to database software provider MongoDB (MDB). The company recently saw its stock rally after reporting better-than-expected results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and issuing a strong outlook. Following the Q3 print, Stifel analyst Brad Reback reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB stock and raised the price target to $450 from $375. This growth was driven by a steady increase in consumption and robust new customer additions of 2,600 in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Reback explained that about two-thirds of the outperformance in MDB's Enterprise Advanced (EA)/non-Atlas revenue was driven by greater-than anticipated multi-year deals. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that MongoDB's third-quarter operating margin exceeded expectations by an impressive 750 basis points, thanks to a strong revenue beat and the shift in timing of some investments to Q4 FY26 and fiscal 2027. Consequently, management increased its full-year operating margin outlook to 18% from 14%. Overall, Reback is confident that MongoDB will be able to maintain more than 20% growth in Atlas revenue in the years ahead, driven by a "large and growing market, improving consumption trends, an expanding set of core and emerging growth drivers, and a growing legacy migration opportunity." Finally, let's look at big-box retailer Walmart (WMT). The company delivered healthy results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, driven in part by strength in its e-commerce business and membership growth. On Dec. 3, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reaffirmed a buy rating on Walmart stock and bumped up his price forecast to $130 from $125. The analyst expects the retailer to generate robust revenue and profitability growth, supported by "technology-driven scale and AI acceleration." The 5-star analyst discussed how Walmart is using technology to automate supply chain and in-store processes to drive operating efficiencies. Feinseth also noted the company's efforts to enhance its omnichannel fulfillment capabilities, store-fulfilled pickup and delivery, and other initiatives to bolster its logistics, which have helped in driving e-commerce sales higher. Additionally, Feinseth highlighted Walmart's growing use of AI, including offering generative AI-based shopping experiences with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The analyst is also impressed with the company's focus on "high-margin, capital-light" growth drivers, such as retail media, Walmart Connect, memberships, health and wellness, and financial services, which are boosting its profitability. Overall, Feinseth is bullish on Walmart and believes that it deserves a premium valuation compared to the conventional brick-and-mortar retailers, given its massive scale, brand value, and solid execution, in addition to its focus on technology and AI-centric strategy. Like Feinseth, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also optimistic about WMT, and has an outperform rating with a price target of $122. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prices in the beef and veal category are up 14.7%, while overall food is up 3.1% from September 2024 to September 2025 — the latest publicly available consumer price index data due to the government shutdown in October. But expenses for America's farmers are soaring too. Input costs for ranchers are up more than 50% over the past five years, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. I mean, if people are paying $6 for a latte at Starbucks, but then they're paying $6 for a pound of beef, they're able to feed a family for a family of three with that pound of beef," said Taylon Lienemann, co-owner of Linetics Ranch in Princeton, Nebraksa. A major driver of the rising price of beef prices stems from a record low cattle supply. It typically occurs every eight to 12 years. When producers can get higher prices for their cattle, they will likely retain more females, called heifers, for breeding. "It's the big question right now for our producers. You know, they have a 50/50 decision to make. Do we sell these cattle off into the supply system or do we hold them back? "The amount of cattle that are out there are still out there, and they're still needing that feed." During times of drought, ranchers will often supplement grass feed with grain. Grain prices have come down significantly since 2022, but it can still be an unexpected cost for producers. "What we're experiencing now is a sort of a mashup of drought, high demand and low heifer retention, sort of making up this herd size problem that we have today in America," said Omaha Steaks CEO Nate Rempe. "We have got to build the herd, period." The direct-to-consumer meat company said it hasn't raised prices in over three years but it's now feeling the pinch. "The cost of beef has increased so much that it's really starting to hit our bottom line," Rempe said. How can we invest in our business to drive more volume for less cost? But there is some breaking point, right? There is some point at which the raw material that we need is at a price point, that we're going to have to start passing some of that on." Despite smaller herd numbers, beef production has increased overall because the U.S. is producing bigger cattle. Incremental supply, mainly for ground beef, also comes from beef imports, which have been increasing steadily over the past decade. Now a rapidly evolving tariffs situation in Brazil and parasitic cattle infections in Mexico are further driving up prices for consumers. Still, experts say that the domestic herd is most critical for long term relief. "In the short run, if we actually begin retaining heifers to put into the breeding herd, that actually is going to reduce total domestic beef production because we have fewer animals going to the feedlot. But within that three-year period that we're talking about, we'll start seeing that increased production feed into the system, which should start to [soften] beef prices and cattle prices alike," said Andrew Griffith, an agricultural and resource economics professor at the University of Tennessee.

One answer: call Day Job, a Los Angeles-headquartered creative agency. It'd be somewhere between a news station and a sports-casting channel — hence the rebranding from the "Technology Brothers Podcast" to TBPN. We were trying to capture their energy, right? The podcast, which launched in 2024, has become a new center stage for a rotation of headline-making Big Tech guests like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Palantir's Alex Karp, and Anduril's Palmer Luckey. That, in turn, has helped make Day Job a hot commodity in the tech world, as startups and VCs seek to stand out with their branding. The growing attention from Silicon Valley is paying off. Harmon said that this year, Day Job has doubled its revenue and head count. "With Day Job, what separates them is they will make four or five different brand directions that are all viable and all justifiable in different ways," Hays said. Since its launch, it has worked with hundreds of brands, such as Millennial-coded pastel CBD Recess drinks and the chili crisp sauce brand Fly By Jing. Harmon had also worked on Coogan's Zyn competitor, Excel. The firm collaborates with clients on a wide range of projects, from brand ideation at the earliest stages, including coming up with a company name, to fine-tuning product and creative design or running advertising campaigns. While Day Job's roots are in consumer packaged goods like Recess or recent viral protein bar David — which Day Job helped name and created giant billboards of cod in New York City for — more and more tech clients are flocking to the creative agency. Patron, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on consumer startups, hired Day Job to rebrand the firm and overhaul its website. Stuut, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed AI startup, also got the Day Job treatment this fall. The agency recently worked on advertising campaigns for customer service startup Bland AI and crypto exchange Gemini, too. Tech brands often look and feel … the same. "There's this addiction to homogenous design choices right now," Patron's Amber Atherton said. Making a company stand out is hard, especially for AI startups. "AI just kind of has a branding problem," Harmon said. Day Job worked with Stuut, which uses AI to process payments, to push against that narrative and presented it as a fun tool. "This isn't some scary tech thing," Harmon said about Stuut's branding. "It's helping you get your job done so you can go home at five to hang out with your family and can go to your kids' soccer game." Harmon highlighted how Stuut's mascot, a cartoon inspired by vintage clock-in-clock-out machines, is shown eating invoices, and when scrolling to the bottom of the site, "gives you a little kiss." Atherton said she came to Day Job after hearing about their work with TBPN. When working with clients, Day Job will act as a sort of therapist, probing founders with existential questions. For instance, when working with Patron, Atherton said Day Job asked the VC firm's founding partners to "talk about each other and why you like working with each other and what makes you a strong partnership." Hays compared the agency's vibe to the hip LA neighborhood of Silver Lake, adding that Day Job's aesthetic is "timeless yet internet native." "It's never been easier to generate creative assets," Hays said. "Anybody can go on ChatGPT or Nano Banana and say, 'Make me a website.'" But Hays said that AI is "creating more demand than ever" for creative minds who can "think differently" and "break through the noise." It's something Harmon is taking solace in as he looks forward to the future of creative agencies like his own. And brands are, meanwhile, learning the hard way that not all AI will help you stay relevant or in favor of consumers. "We may become more valuable in a way because everything goes to the mean," Harmon said. "AI is good at outputting things that have already happened, but they're not good at figuring out what's next."</p>

Public broadcasting in America traces its roots back to 1967 — when Lyndon Johnson was President, and there were three broadcast TV networks, no iPhones, and no internet. Things are very different now, which might explain why major cuts to PBS to NPR, enacted this summer, haven't generated much news now that they're actually working their way through the system. But they're very top of mind for PBS CEO Paula Kerger, who instituted a 21% budget cut following the clawbacks. She's been spending a lot of time looking for donations to shore things up. She is also still holding out hope that Congress can be convinced to restore the funding. She made her case to me in the latest episode of my Channels podcast; an edited excerpt of our conversation follows. Peter Kafka: Congress clawed back $1 billion from public media this summer. Those cuts are starting to hit your operations now. For some stations, it's a relatively small portion of their budget, but particularly in rural parts of the country — where I always say we have an outsize influence and importance — it's as much as 30 or 40%. As soon as the monies were rescinded this summer, a small group of us began working quickly to put together resources for the stations most at risk. Has the bridge funding been enough to keep them alive? The bridge fund is now close to $65 million. So that immediately puts money into the pockets of stations. There was one station out of Penn State University that announced it could no longer sustain. We haven't seen stations yet go off the proverbial cliff, but we're watching very carefully, and I would not be surprised if some stations — whether they get some of this bridge funding or not — realize that it's going to be a bridge too far. We've made some shifts because suddenly a significant amount of money has come off the table. I've been most focused on NewsHour because that's a nightly news operation — you have to make sure that is funded. They have made some cuts to sustain the core NewsHour service. I have been talking to legislators since July — when we were defunded — who didn't quite realize it was their local station that was going to be impacted. If we could get back some money for them, I think it would make the rest of this easier to figure out. Where I'm most concerned — because a lot of our stations are doing good work raising money locally — is that people have always been confused about us: Where does your money come from? This at least helps people realize, '"Oh, that's what 'viewers like you' means." We've had good success with fundraising, and some stations are doing OK. But I want to make sure we're not losing stations in places like Cookeville, Tennessee — a part of Appalachia not well-covered by media. Being able to fill some of those gaps is really critically important. This defunding event accelerated a lot of decisions and discussions we were already engaged in. Over the last year, we've been deliberately working to push our content out on multiple places. I don't know what media is going to look like five years from now. I do believe there's a continuing role for broadcast. We're pushing content out to first responders, using our broadcast spectrum because it doesn't melt down when there is high demand, which is what happens in an emergency. We have to plan [as if] the money is not coming back. There are some good kids' series out there, and I'm not going to say we're the only place for educational kids' content. There's a whole generation of kids who grew up on "Sesame Street," but also newer series like "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood," and we've done longitudinal studies showing that at age 14 or 15, they can still remember the lessons they learned. We've been in this business a long time. It's the flip side of what everyone else is doing. We put rigor behind our content, and there is a value to it. So let's stipulate that all the work you do is valuable. Let me just clarify: Federal funding is about 15% [of public media]. A lot of it comes from viewers like you. I do think that some mix of earned revenue, philanthropic revenue, and strategic partnerships with other media organizations is how you can build this out. What if a benevolent billionaire or two stepped in and said "I'll replace the federal money you are missing, for years." I'm not sure if someone funding us for 10 years is necessarily a good idea, either — because one of the things that has made us who we are is that we've largely been funded by lots of small contributions. So whatever our funding scenario is moving forward, people need to feel bought in — that they own it. This is media for everyone, and people should feel like they have a piece of it. That said, if we were not worrying about finances all the time, I would love to see us go deeper in the work we do for kids. I see the impact it has had, and our team is relentlessly focused on figuring out how to use emerging technology for the benefit of kids — and to do it in a safe way.</p>

The US is light years behind its adversaries in military drone production. Firestorm Labs has designed a small, mobile factory that the company says can fabricate virtually any model of drone or drone part. Each factory consists of two 20-foot shipping containers, outfitted with industrial-grade HP printers. Set-up requires just two to four people, and the company estimates that each factory can currently churn out about 17 small-to-mid-sized drones drones per week. The company also has two of its own drone designs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has challenged the tech industry to help the US catch up on drones, and Silicon Valley is eager to cash in. Firestorm last year won a $100 million Air Force contract to research and develop unmanned aerial systems. This year, it raised $47 million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates, Lockheed Martin Ventures, and others. Chad McCoy, cofounder and chief growth officer at Firestorm, served in the military for 23 years as a pararescueman, a medic trained to jump from aircraft and rappel down mountains to rescue service members or civilians in perilous situations. One of the pieces of equipment he sorely needed was a small, waterproof box with a single plug to power his medical devices. Now, he wants to help the military iterate and produce things faster. "Logistics is the way we win wars," McCoy told Business Insider. When Firestorm co-founders Dan Magy and Ian Muceus pitched McCoy on joining their company a few years ago, they proposed making cheap cruise missiles that could be built in mass quantities. Magy had founded Citadel Defense Company, which made counter drone technology and was acquired in 2021 by BlueHalo. Muceus had worked in aerospace and defense manufacturing at Origin, a 3D printing startup that was acquired by 3D printing company Stratasys. McCoy, Magy, and Muceus eventually settled on creating a manufacturing solution for drones, which were becoming ubiquitous on the battlefield in places like Ukraine. Hegseth last week announced a plan to solicit bids from US companies to manufacture hundreds of thousands of inexpensive, unmanned drones over the next two years. "We cannot be left behind," Hegseth said in a Defense Department video posted on YouTube. For Firestorm, one challenge could be convincing the Pentagon to use drones made out of nylon instead of materials like steel and carbon fiber. Hegseth has said he wants to speed up the Pentagon's notoriously slow acquisition process. "If we could create weapons anywhere in the world," McCoy said, "that would be a massive force multiplier." The sides of each shipping container pop out to create more space inside. Firestorm has a handful of xCells in the US. Firestorm's two drone designs, called Tempest and Hurricane, are customizable with open software development tools. Eventually, McCoy hopes xCell can print more than just drones, perhaps venturing into prosthetics or medical devices.</p>

This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Morgan Night, who rents out her Los Angeles pool and spa room by the hour using the Swimply app. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I was actually supposed to die three years ago, so because of that, I ran out of money. I bought my house really cheap when interest rates were low 13 years ago, and I fixed it up into my dream home. I grew up in the seventies and am a big fan of that era. I thought I would have to move out and downsize into a much smaller place during my final years. I had seen ads for the app Swimply, where people rent out their pools. It was wildly successful, and I think that's partly because my previous job was as a themed hotel owner, so I knew how to deal with guests and make the space really fun. That first summer, renting out the pool earned three times my best-case scenario. When the weather changed, we weren't getting many bookings, and heating the pool is way more expensive in the winter, so I was trying to think of a way to keep income coming in. We had an old indoor spa room that we weren't using because it had issues with tile breaking, and the spa itself wasn't that great. I spent three or four months fixing it up. I added a sauna and an outdoor fire pit area right next to it that has great views. I let all our summer guests know we had a winter option. I offer the hot tub for a starting base rate of $25 per hour, and people can add on the fire pit, sauna, or the rec room, which features a pool table, jukebox, darts, and video games. Most people who book the spa are couples looking for a romantic night. The pool gets everything from couples to parties. We get 18-year-olds up to 60-year-olds, swim instructors, big 40-person birthday parties, and corporate events. We get a lot of repeat bookings too. Because of the political climate we're in, I also make it clear on our listings that we're a safe space for gay and trans people. To me, all of it seems like the easiest job I've ever had. I don't even have to leave home. However, when I clearly outline everything in the messages ahead of time, there are no issues. Everyone is really respectful because it's your private home. The work I'm able to do is health-dependent. Luckily, I've been able to do 90% of this on my own, and my partner helps if I'm sick. I would never take a job where being part of a team would be affected by my health, so this is kind of the perfect scenario. It's allowed me to stay in my dream house.</p>

Or does it mean shutting off your Slack and email over the weekend? These clear-cut solutions may not fit all office jobs. On Skims cofounder Emma Grede's "Aspire" podcast, Finkelstein called work-life balance a "misnomer." "I think actually what we're all searching for is some sort of harmony," he said. "There are some Saturdays where I have to work, and there are some Thursday afternoons that I go for a walk with my wife. Finkelstein said that work-life balance can also look different depending on the individual circumstances, or life chapter, you're in. I think everyone needs to find their own version of it." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shares a similar definition. In a 2019 interview with the Financial Review, Nadella said that he wanted to "harmonize" what he cares about with his work. Other business leaders have also expressed a desire to reframe the concept of work-life balance. Mark Cuban said that there "is no balance" for incredibly ambitious people, because competitors will work even longer. Jeff Bezos referred to work-life balance as a "debilitating phrase" in 2018. As hardcore work culture and employee monitoring surges, some office workers may struggle to maintain Finkelstein's flexible work-life harmony. As for those 80-hour workweeks, Finkelstein clarified that they weren't necessary to be a high achiever. "I know some people who work 40 hours a week who are some of the greatest performers ever," he said.</p>
