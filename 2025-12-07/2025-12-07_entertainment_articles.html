                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix taking pole position to win the race for Warner Bros. Discovery sent shockwaves through Hollywood, partially because it was presumed that Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison had the support of President Donald Trump. Now multiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Netflix may also have received some sort of blessing by Trump, or at least his ear. Netflix did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday and over the weekend. Hollywood, Here's Your Chance to Save America: Give Trump an Overall Deal 'Supernatural' Cast Reunion Gets Political as Star Compares Trump to "Evil Monster" From Show That also meant agreeing to a $5.8 billion break up fee in case any deal falls through. If Sarandos made a pitch of his own, it may explain why Trump has been quiet on the deal, an unusual thing given how outspoken he is, particularly when it comes to major media stories. This would not be the first time Sarandos has sat down with Trump. The two men had a long dinner at Mar-a-Lago late last year, with the executive recalling that both First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were Netflix fans. The more recent meeting, it seems, may have been a different story.</p>

Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw made history this year as the first woman to shoot a movie in IMAX 65mm, but the greatness of her work on “Sinners” goes beyond the stuff that interests format wonks. Regardless of film gauge, the haunting, funny, rousing, poignant, terrifying vampire film is simply one of the most beautiful movies ever made, a movie where the photography expresses theme and character with elegance, complexity, and an awe-inspiring tonal range. When Arkapaw accepted the Impact Award at this year's IndieWire Honors ceremony, held at Hollywood's Nya West on December 4, she began by referencing her “Sinners” director and trusted collaborator Ryan Coogler. “I'm going to try and channel Ryan because he's so good at this stuff,” she said. “Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with people that have supported me and trusted me with their ideas, and these directors have become family even outside of work. They've allowed me to think big and always contribute my visual taste.” Related Stories 2025 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award Winners (List Updating Live) Ryan White Calls for Studios to Buy Independent Documentaries Not Based on ‘Feeding the Algorithm' Arkapaw said this trust is what allowed her to thrive as a woman in a field still largely dominated by men. “This is so important for any filmmaker, especially one who looks like me. It helped me truly feel like I had something unique to say, and that my strong perspective mattered. I want to make images that resonate and inspire, and being in a field where women have historically been few, I hope to show others that they can enter this industry with courage.” Arkapaw once again mentioned Coogler as a key partner in this regard.

Deeply thankful for my family — who always show up for the girls and I,” he captioned the photo. David, 38, appeared in good spirits for the family photo, which showed the family of four posing with an inflatable gingerbread man. He has shied away from posting on social media since he was let go from the CBS series in October when his co-star Leah Lewis, 28, accused him of sexual assault. According to Deadline, CBS conducted an internal investigation before he was let go. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Insiders told the outlet that the alleged misconduct between David and Lewis, who portrays Sarah Franklin, occurred on Paramount premises on Sept. 26. Shortly after the news made headlines, Lewis told her fans she was “moving forward.” “Mom is here, we're moving forward in love and strength. I'm in good hands,” she wrote via social media with a snap of her mom. “Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care.” While David has yet to respond to the allegations, his wife has publicly called out the actress by taking a photo of the latter and resharing it on her Instagram Stories. “This is the most disturbing human being I have ever met,” Katherine wrote in October.</p>

Director Martin Scorsese has long served as a mentor to rising directors, from giving John McNaughton (“Mad Dog and Glory”) and Allison Anders (“Grace of My Heart“) their first shots at studio movies to employing “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon as an assistant on “Casino.” For the season finale of the series “Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,” which Scorsese hosts and executive produces, he looked closer to home for a protégé — the episode marks the television directorial debut of his daughter Francesca. Francesca and Martin have been working together for years on a series of viral videos (more on that later), but “The Saints” marks their first collaboration on a longer-form piece of filmmaking, and it was a labor of love for both given the subject matter. Related Stories IDA Documentary Award Winners Led by ‘The Tale of Silyan' and ‘Apocalypse in the Tropics' Kristen Stewart Called Out Hollywood. Minutes Later, Netflix Announced a Deal to Buy It. “I always imagined the saints being ancient beings,” Francesca told IndieWire. He used his platform for good — I think of him as the first influencer.” Martin noted that what made Carlo Acutis special was the fact that he lived according to his faith but didn't judge his peers. “He didn't put anybody down, and that's a big question: how can a young person go against the flow or the wave of sexuality, pornography, etc., and say, ‘I'm going to be abstinent,' without looking as if you're judging others? For Martin, the episode is another in an ongoing series of films designed to explore spirituality and moral choices from a variety of perspectives and attitudes — a mission that began with his very first feature, “Who's That Knocking At My Door,” and which has continued in recent films like his 2016 masterpiece “Silence.” “Even ‘Killers of the Flower Moon' has an element of the fine line between good and evil in human nature,” Martin said. He felt that Francesca was the right person to tell this particular story, as a member of Generation Z. “I said, ‘Why don't you try this, because it's your generation,'” Martin said of the Carlo Acutis episode. Martin's main pieces of advice for Francesca as she started work on the episode had to do with preparation. “One is, prepare as best you can on paper, with drawings. You may get to a place with five drawings and have to distill that five down to one or two, but you can say, ‘Okay, at least I got those two.' You don't walk in and waste time, you ideally get to the locations a few days before and double check and see where you can get your angles based on your storyboards.” Following her father's guidance, Francesca meticulously storyboarded every shot for “The Saints,” one reason her episode has such visual elegance even though she was often limited when it came to time and resources. “In Assisi, we weren't able to go into the Basilica of Santa Chiara until the day we shot and we only had about a half an hour in there,” Francesca said. “It was very last minute, getting in there and figuring out the shots. And then we only had 30 minutes to shoot the scene, getting ushered out by angry nuns. Then when Carlo is dying, I tried to keep a little warmth in the frame so it wasn't like he was alone, but I did make the light and colors a bit cooler.” In addition to his suggestion that Francesca plan her shots in detail, Martin also advised that she devote time to rehearsing the actors — though she found that there was a tricky balance between rehearsing and letting the performances get stale. One scene in the episode that Francesca did not direct — much to her chagrin — was Martin's introduction in which he addressed the camera alongside a piece of decor Francesca would have preferred to keep out of the episode. “Unfortunately I didn't direct the intro, or I would have gotten rid of the awkward teen photo of me!” she said. “It's so embarrassing.” Francesca did direct her father for the narration he had to read throughout the episode, which she said was one of her biggest challenges. “I kept saying, ‘Do it again, you sound like you're asking a question,' and he would really give me hell for it. He had comment after comment.” “I do the same to Kent [Jones], who's a wonderful writer,” Martin added. and I'll say, ‘Oh, now he wants another, why don't you write it better? The playful banter between Martin and Francesca that went on during the recording of Martin's narration will come as no surprise to fans of the pair's viral videos on TikTok and Instagram, which began as a lark but have become essential viewing for Martin Scorsese fans who have reveled in the chance to see the iconic director in a more intimate, personal setting than they're used to. “An honesty comes out that if very intimate in a sense,” Martin said of videos like the hilarious one where Francesca invites him to describe feminine products on camera. “I'm shooting ‘Killers of the Flower Moon,' and I'm busy, and I really tried to answer the questions honestly because otherwise she wouldn't go away.” From Francesca's point of view, her dad is the perfect subject. “He's performative, in a good way,” she said. I just love him with my whole heart.” Francesca added that when the SAG strike happened and Martin was left on his own to represent “Killers of the Flower Moon,” the videos turned into a marketing tool. “Apple asked us to make some videos to help promote the movie, and there was this huge effect of young people coming to see it because of our presence of TikTok,” Francesca said, with Martin laughing, “The picture was three hours and 15 minutes. Those kids didn't know what they were getting into!” For Martin, the videos are like “little epigrams, or haikus. Even when I do a commercial — commercials are not easy. Martin says that the key to mentoring Francesca and other directors is helping them achieve their intentions without imposing his own way of doing things. “If she wants to go to a certain place, maybe you can help her get there by saying, ‘I think I know what it is that's throwing you off. “I always say it felt like turning in a homework assignment,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You can see it at home, and the food will be perhaps better, [but] you will have this experience collectively, all of you," the filmmaker told audiences in London at an IMAX screening of 'Frankenstein.' Would you share your popcorn with Guillermo del Toro? The Oscar-winning filmmaker was admittedly a little hungry Saturday night as he and Jacob Elordi arrived at an IMAX screening of Frankenstein in central London. After gratefully accepting a handful of popcorn from the fans in front of him, del Toro spoke about how he came to love Frankenstein and why this story in particular has shaped him as an artist. 'School Spirits' Reveals First Look at Season 3, Sets January Return In the wake of the enormous news that Netflix will acquire Warner Bros. in a deal worth $82.7 billion on Friday — and with fears swirling around how this will shape the industry and future of theater-going — del Toro said “there's no substitute” for seeing films on the big screen. “Make no mistake: fairy tales [and] horror stories are parables,” he began to interviewer Edith Bowman. For people that see them on their phone… it takes 38,000 of those little things to form a screen,” he added. Every veil is embroidered by hand… Everything is done to sustain this feeling that you're seeing something thematically and artistically done by a group [of people].” Del Toro revealed that, upon watching James Whale's Frankenstein (1931), he felt “struck by God.” The director said: “I finally understood what religion meant after so many years as a Catholic — Frankenstein's Creature made sense to me.” He likened the feeling of finishing the film, a project symbolic of his life's work, as an experience similar to postpartum depression. “I feel like one of those fishes that lays the eggs and dies,” he laughs. I mean, postpartum depression happened… Everything on all my movies led to this. Elordi heaped praise on his director as he spoke about the significance of embodying such an iconic character of the horror genre. “It's been my intention to do a performance like this since I was 13 years old,” the Australian actor began. “This is the only way to make movies — by hand,” Elordi declared, “and it's the only thing that should be digested. It's the only thing that's healthy for an audience, I think, and as an actor, that's the only universe that I want to be a part of, one where every single person is an artist… The idea that art and creativity is life or death… Guillermo gave me the wind in my sails to keep making movies until I'm dead.” Del Toro added, chuckling: “It'll take a long time.” As he departed, he teased audiences with one hint as to what's coming next: “The next one is stop motion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thai star Metawin Opas-iamkajorn came by Deadline's Red Sea International Film Festival studio in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Win, as he is known, gave us the latest on his upcoming historical fantasy series Scarlet Heart Thailand and talked about his ambition to bring Thai stories to the world. He then went on to star in another hit romantic drama series, F4 Thailand: Boys Over Flowers. Based on Chinese novel ‘Startling by Each Step', Scarlet Heart Thailand is Win's new project. “It's gonna be the big one for me for next year,” he said, before teasing some details of his part: “My character is a kind of soldier from that time, and he has to protect the country and fight many bad guys.” Adrien Brody Says He Has Not Accepted A Role Since Oscar-Winning Performance In 'The Brutalist' French Cinema Boss Addresses Netflix-WBD Deal As  Execs At Red Sea Film Festival Take Stock: "You Can't Have Your Cake & Eat It" Win tells Deadline the show will stream globally on Netflix, meaning a huge potential audience around the world for a Thai-produced drama series. That chimes with the ambitions of its Thai star, who, at 26 years-old, is also a successful entrepreneur with several businesses in Thailand. “I just want to do more international projects,” he said. I feel like Thailand has that potential to grow globally, and I just want to be a part of that.” Win became a star over lockdown, which meant the impact of newfound stardom didn't really hit home until those restrictions had lifted. “After Covid was gone, then I had a chance to do an event outside…that's the moment that I saw a lot of fans waiting for me.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update trashed the peace prize that the president of FIFA “invented” and and bestowed on Donald Trump this week. “Trump has not yet won the Nobel Peace Prize, but he did win the equally prestigious soccer peace prize,” co-anchor Colin Jost said sarcastically. “FIFA actually invented a fake peace prize in Trump's honor, and that's why the trophy shows Trump's gnarled hands dragging Earth into hell,” Jost said alongside an image of the golden award, which Trump received with a medal and a certificate. that he received two months ago—a test which the White House only recently claimed was just preventative in nature. “Trump said he will soon release the results of his M.R.I. He just needs a little more time to write ‘of genius' after the word ‘stroke,'” Jost joked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew Lillard has now become the first actor actually namechecked in Quentin Tarantino's recent diatribe against Actors He Doesn't Like to respond publicly to the unprovoked attacks, telling a crowd at GalaxyCon in Ohio this weekend, “Quentin Tarantino this week said he didn't like me as an actor. Lillard, who currently stars in this week's Five Nights At Freddy's 2, then went on to kind of give a shit, saying, “Listen, the point is that hurts your feelings. And you wouldn't say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn't say that to somebody who's a top-line actor in Hollywood.” Lillard essentially caught a stray in Tarantino's takedown during a recent appearance on Bret Easton Ellis' podcast, with the bulk of the director's ire focused on actor Paul Dano and his performance in There Will Be Blood. But the casual, dismissive, Arrested Development-esque “I don't care for Matthew Lillard” was, in some ways, crueler than Tarantino's vitriolic assertions that Dano is “the weakest fucking actor in SAG” and “the limpest dick in the world”—especially since, unlike Dano, Lillard didn't immediately have big-name directors and supporters stepping up to push back against Tarantino's snap judgments. Which is a shame, given that Lillard has had a long and pretty interesting career—you can read our 2012 Random Roles with him right here to get a sampling of it—where even more commercially minded films (Scream or Scooby-Doo, say) saw him bring full commitment to the job. We're not saying every single performance he's ever given has been a masterclass, or that he didn't spend a big chunk of the '90s and 2000s getting cast in a pretty narrow window of roles. But the man has given a lot of solid performances over the years, and being reached for out of the blue—along with Owen Wilson—as Tarantino suddenly decided to start negatively tossing names around has a unfair flattening effect on a diverse acting resumé.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Great news tonight for people who get excited when they see two people who were both in one thing now being in the same thing, once again: Prime Video rolled out the trailer for its upcoming fifth and final season of The Boys at CCXP today, and that long-teased Supernatural reunion was absolutely in the mix. Now, admittedly, there are a lot of things going on in this new trailer that are not reminders that series co-star Jensen Ackles and newcomer Jared Padalecki used to pal around in a car for a scant two-thirds of each of their professional lives. But Winchester fans will still get their thrills acknowledged—albeit briefly—by the trailer, which has a bit of fun juxtaposing the pair's characters with a weird little look. Meanwhile, it looks like everything else is pretty much par for the course for this series, which is to say pretty damn grim, with members of The Boys in some kind of Homelander-branded prison camps, Karl Urban's Billy Butcher doing that thing where he veers between inspirational pep talks and full-on psychopathic cult leader schtick, and Antony Starr punching the ever-living shit out of something that we have to assume will be very dead by the time the trailer wraps up. On the plus side, it is nice to see the band back together, especially after how nasty and fractured things got at the end of season 4, and we're always happy to take a lil' Giancarlo Esposito, as a treat. All that being said, the tone here is definitely “Nobody's getting out of this thing alive,” which is saying something for a show that already had one of the highest, and most gruesome, body counts on TV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tori Spelling expressed gratitude for her co-parenting relationship with ex-husband Dean McDermott, just weeks after settling their divorce. “I watched families go through horror stories with the parents, and at the end of the day, you created beings because you had so much love between you,” the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum told People at an event on Friday, noting that she's “so grateful” for their friendly dynamic. “We do family dinners, we do everything together, so it's really good for the kids,” she told the outlet. The “Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood” alums announced their separation in June 2023 after 17 years of marriage, with the actress filing for divorce nine months later. The former couple finalized their divorce last month, with documents revealing a staggering 7-figure remaining tax debt. McDermott was last romantically linked with Lily Calo following his split from Spelling, while the “misSPELLING” podcast host was still linked to Ryan Cramer as recently as April. And though the breakup at times appeared intense — with Spelling being spotted crying during a conversation with McDermott in 2024, and bouncing from a motel to an RV with her children for temporary stays in 2023 — she's insisted their split was without strife. “I gotta say, you guys, this is something never said — this was one of the easiest divorces in Hollywood,” she declared during an episode of her podcast last month.

They've gotten along so well, in fact, that Spelling once admitted her old habits are dying hard, when it comes to her former pet name for McDermott. “I don't know if anyone has gone through this, but I've never called him ‘Dean,'” she shared during her podcast in March. “I've called him ‘babe' for 20 years, so it is super hard to remind myself that like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys aren't together anymore.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During Saturday's panel at CCXP in São Paulo, Brazil, the streamer announced on the Thunder Stage that the concluding season of the Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios show will debut on April 8, 2026 with a two-episode premiere, culminating in a May 20, 2026 series finale. In the fifth and final season, it's Homelander's (Antony Starr) world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie (Jack Quaid), Mother's Milk (Laz (Alonso) and Frenchie (Tomer Capone) are imprisoned in a ‘Freedom Camp'. Annie (Erin Moriarty) struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher (Karl Urban) reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. Also featured in the teaser is the return of Jensen Ackles‘ Soldier Boy, now in a cryogenic state, as well as the debut of Jared Padalecki‘s undisclosed character, marking a Supernatural reunion with the shows' mutual creator Eric Kripke. Showrunner Kripke was joined onstage Saturday by Moriarty, Alonso, Fukuhara, Capone and Colby Minifie. Prime's college spin-off Gen V recently concluded its second season, which sets up The Boys finale, and the animated The Boys Presents: Diabolical is not likely to get a second season. Meanwhile, Paul Grellong serves as showrunner on the upcoming prequel series Vought Rising, and Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are executive producing The Boys: Mexico, from Blue Beetle writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.
