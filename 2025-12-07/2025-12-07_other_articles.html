                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's what most Americans believe, according to a new YouGov poll. The majority think that extraterrestrial aliens definitely or probably exist, the survey found, and many are also pretty sure they've paid us a visit recently. Probably not Santa Claus, but he wasn't mentioned, so I'm just assuming. It's really not such a stretch to think that life exists elsewhere. After all, there are trillions of planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone, and ours is just one among trillions of others like it in the universe. So, it stands to reason there would be other places where some forms of life have taken root. Maybe some of the feelers we've sent out, in the form of signals issued from roving spacecraft, have attracted an advanced alien species to come and check us out. Maybe these extraterrestrial creatures are so evolved they've figured out how to find other life forms amid their celestial wanderings. Or at least watching from a safe distance? Again, I'm just supposing, but they might find much to recommend our planet. Perhaps they marveled from space at our natural wonders, like the Grand Canyon, Victoria Falls, the Great Barrier Reef or Mount Everest, and wanted to get a closer look. They might also be impressed by the diversity of life here and the fantastic ways that that our world's creatures have adapted and evolved. Homo sapiens, with their bigger brains and opposable thumbs, could present these intelligent alien beings with a worthy opportunity for connection and interaction. We might have much to learn from each other. Orange County, I expect, would be a prime destination. I imagine these aliens would also be puzzled by other features of our planet,  particularly by the confounding aspects of American culture. Why do you call your passing and running game “football” when that's also the name of the world's most popular sport, which is literally all about foot-and-ball interaction? I picture them shaking their alien heads over such puzzles. Also, they might ask, why would a beautiful beach town build an artificial surf park when it already has a giant natural one? Those awe-inspiring glaciers are melting at an ever-quickening pace, the oceans are rising and many of those gorgeous beaches could soon be submerged. The diverse array of life on this planet is also at risk from humans' heedless actions, the aliens would likely observe. On land, many places are fast becoming uninhabitable. Yet denial seems to run high among these people, they would surely think. And they are always fighting with each other, these creatures who won Earth's evolutionary lottery, the ones who claim to cherish peace and goodwill but can't seem to stop shouting at each other. They spend too little time trying to understand each other. That YouGov poll also found most people think alien encounters would have a negative effect on human civilization, whether through unintentional harm or outright hostility. With absolutely zero evidence, the presumption is that aliens are to be feared. Perhaps, as many believe, we have been visited by aliens, or at least beings from other worlds know that we are here and have observed us to some degree. If that is the case, it's just as likely that those aliens, after taking a good, hard look, decided to pass on our planet. Nice beaches and all that, but the people on this third rock rotating around an unremarkable, average-size star are just too crazy.</p>

Years later, he discovered his psychic gift. "I've known all my life that I've had something that wasn't like anyone else," he said. "It was through training, study, learning with other people. I've taken classes here at Camp Chesterfield, from people back home (in Ohio), about how to step into this energy." Please enable it in your browser settings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All in all, for people that casually hear this stuff for the first time, i think its a decent segment about the situation. Just to make clear this show isnt usually about UFOs, the part immediately after the UFO segment is about 25 people dying in a fire in India. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and discussed cases: Description: Over 60 children at the Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings coming out. Credibility: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. It was investigated by a well known psychologist, you can find a documentary on YouTube so go check it out!" A military spy satellite also recorded an infrared anomaly during the event. Credibility: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Description: Thousands of people across Arizona, including the then-Governor, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the night sky. Credibility: "I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it." The incident was also tracked by ground radar. Credibility: "Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident & Belgian UFO wave" Description: U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unusual lights in the forest and encountering a metallic object. Description: U.S. Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a tic-tac-shaped object that performed incredible maneuvers. The incident was captured on FLIR footage. They are often described as bright, pulsating lights that move erratically. Almost definitely not alien invaders but definitely unidentified despite showing up regularly in the same place since forever." Description: During World War II, the military had to resort to using anti-aircraft weapons against an unidentified object over Los Angeles. Credibility: "The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'." Description: Multiple witnesses, including airline employees, reported seeing a disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C17 at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. These subreddits are great places to ask more questions and get answers from a community of enthusiasts and skeptics alike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While official science now confidently classifies it as a natural celestial interloper — only the third known object of its kind to enter our system from deep space — a significant portion of the internet has already crowned it the latest piece of irrefutable proof that aliens are here. But new research is less interested in the comet itself and far more interested in us, the humans, and why we're so desperately willing to believe the impossible. Mert Bayar, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington's Centre for an Informed Public, zeroed in on the 3I/ATLAS phenomenon, not as an astronomer, but as a digital analyst. His goal was to meticulously track how social-media influencers exploit genuine information gaps — the moments where natural explanations feel incomplete or overly complicated — to fuel over-the-top, alien-centric speculation. Bayar's academic focus is clear: 'I've written previously on how expert opinions can fuel conspiracy theorizing through elite-driven rumoring and amplification', he told GeekWire in an email. This, combined with 'a personal interest in space-related conspiracy theories', spurred him to look 'more closely at 3I/ATLAS'. His comprehensive analysis, which has just been published, is provocatively titled, Alien of the Gaps: How 3I/ATLAS Was Turned into a Spaceship Online. Bayar argues that today's speculation follows a remarkably similar, if secularised, process: 'Where natural explanations feel incomplete, we substitute a different higher agency, not Zeus this time, but extraterrestrials', he writes. The moment 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July, its non-solar, interstellar trajectory immediately marked it as a source of intrigue. Even after astronomers gathered enough evidence to confidently classify it as a comet, the object's somewhat 'anomalous' behaviour ensured the alien speculation remained stubbornly in orbit. Loeb is, of course, no stranger to this narrative. Years before the comet was identified, he gained notoriety for raising the possibility that an earlier interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, 'may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization'. Crucially, the discovery of 3I/ATLAS this year provided fresh, fertile ground for his speculative musings. He analysed roughly 700,000 posts about the comet published on the X social-media channel (formerly Twitter) between July 1 and Nov. 21. Bayar found that 'almost 280,000 of the 700,000 posts invoke aliens or ET technology — about 40% of the 3I/ATLAS conversation on X'. Furthermore, the gravity of Loeb's profile is undeniable: roughly 130,000 posts reference him by name or by his status as a Harvard scientist, and more than 82,000 posts explicitly pair his name with the alien-technology hypothesis. Bayar is quick to add a note of journalistic fairness, conceding that, 'To be fair, at times, Avi Loeb states that 3I/ATLAS is most likely a natural interstellar comet'. However, Bayar argues that this necessary caveat is lost in the sheer volume of his other commentary. He suggests that Loeb then 'spends far more time walking through its supposed 'anomalies' and entertaining the alien-technology hypothesis. This dynamic feeds directly into a broader online ecosystem that Bayar has dubbed the 'mystery economy'. 'Our information systems reward the production of mystery and speculation,' Bayar asserts. He points out that this reward structure is deliberately amplified by a ready-made ecosystem of websites, content creators across platforms who produce, spread and amplify speculative takes. These content creators, whether they are small-time YouTubers or large conspiracy websites, require 'a steady supply of 'new' material', which, Bayar concludes, is constantly fed by 'Loeb's ever-growing list of anomalies, even when indirectly refuted by organizations like NASA, [which] feeds that need for sustained mystery and endlessly recyclable content'. For those curious about the specifics of the comet's 'anomalies', Penn State astronomer Jason Wright, who focuses on studies of extrasolar planets and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, has compiled a comprehensive blog post offering scientific explanations for Loeb's list that do not involve alien intervention. Interestingly, Bayar's analysis reveals that this viral narrative is not contained to a single platform. 'One of the most frequently appearing terms in the 3I/ATLAS conversation on X is '@YouTube', suggesting that many X accounts are reacting to or sharing YouTube videos', he confirmed. This cross-platform flow indicates a networked spread, though Bayar cautions that the conversation remains niche, observing that the 'Total volume is still under a million posts, which suggests it hasn't broken out into a truly mass-viral story beyond the UFO/UAP crowd'. The story of 3I/ATLAS is not just about a comet; it's a terrifyingly accurate blueprint for how modern conspiracies are built, monetised, and sustained. The story of 3I/ATLAS is not a tale of little green men, but a chillingly effective blueprint for how modern conspiracies are built, monetised, and sustained online.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small community along the coast of Labrador is shrouded in mist and being terrorized by ghosts — but world famous paranormal investigator Hellboy is on the scene. That's the premise of The Ghost Ships of Labrador, a new comic book story co-written by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola and Rob Williams, and illustrated by Laurence Campbell. “I like the idea of this small little town with a population of maybe like 100 people or more. And suddenly one day a great fog descends upon it and ghosts are everywhere,” Williams told CBC Radio's Labrador Morning. In this new Hellboy adventure, the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.) send exorcist Agatha Blunt, who uses a wheelchair and is aided by her dog Elba, to Red Bay — only for the pair to go missing. That's when Hellboy is dispatched to the community. And that's what happens to Hellboy as we go,” Williams said. After the first issue was released, Williams said he found out it had coincided with a replica of the San Juan being relaunched into the sea, "which blew our minds.” He said he had fun digging into the history of the area as part of his research. “The best Hellboy stories are always based on real life folk tales,” said Williams. This time the inspiration came from an ghost ship map of Newfoundland and Labrador posted online. “Some kind soul had made a list of all the sightings and where they happened. And what had been … seen out there,” said Williams. Karin Murray-Bergquist, a folklore PhD candidate at Memorial University, is the creator of that map. It denotes the legends and their locations. “People were sending me the link to this new issue and saying, ‘Look, ghost ships of Labrador.' And I thought, ‘Oh, wow, that's a funny coincidence,'” she said. When CBC News told her that her research helped inspire the story behind the new issue, Murray-Bergquist said she couldn't believe it. It's really thrilling to know that one's research can be used creatively,” she said. I'm really interested to learn more,” said Murray-Bergquist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Add ANI As A Trusted Source For Reliable Information By Naman YadavNew Delhi [India], December 7 (ANI): Former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino, known for his work on the Hubble Space Telescope and who flew on two space missions, has weighed in on one of humanity's biggest questions: Are we alone in the universe?The veteran astronaut--who flew on two space missions, conducted four spacewalks, and spent an astonishing 30 hours and 44 minutes working outside the spacecraft--shared that while we have no proof of alien contact, the possibility of life beyond Earth remains strong.Speaking to ANI in an exclusive interview, Massimino said that despite popular speculation, "We have no proof that we haven't been contacted or visited. "We have seen some of the building blocks of life as we know it, even within our own solar system. We haven't discovered any life or any life form yet, but there's certainly possibilities out there somewhere. "The distances are really great between stars where we would think planets might, where planets are that we think maybe there's some sort of life somewhere. And they're so far away that even at the speed of light, it takes a long time for a radio wave to travel if we were to try to make contact somewhere. "For now, he says, humanity's search continues--limited not by imagination, but by physics.The astronaut also gave a straightforward reponse to the viral question circulating on social media on whether or not "can people have sex in space? "I don't see why not," he said with a smile. Weighing in on prospects of reaching Mars in the next 20-25 years, the astronaut said it's expensive and extremely challenging--but achievable.Several countries and organizations, inclding Elon Musk's SpaceX, have established ambitious, multi-stage plans to achieve the goal of going to Mars. But with Mars, you have to wait for the planets to align--only certain times of the year you can even launch. "He highlighted the communication delays as a major operational hurdle. "On the space station, you say 'Houston, we have a problem,' and get an answer in a second.On the moon, it's about three seconds. '"Despite the obstacles, he believes a human expedition is feasible, though astronauts would need to stay about a year on Mars while waiting for planetary alignment for the return trip. "It's going to be a hard problem, but I don't see why we couldn't solve it. You're not even allowed to fly over it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are some spooky places in the Natural State, and a new TV series investigates 10 of them. "Haunted Arkansas," which debuts Tuesday on Apple TV, was created and directed by 22-year-old Gavin Webb of Alma. "I've always had a passion for filmmaking, ever since I was a kid," Webb said last week. During high school he became interested in the paranormal and investigators like Zak Bagans of the TV series "Ghost Adventures." The nearly hour-long film is streaming on Tubi and Amazon Prime. Filming for "Haunted Arkansas," which consists of 10 1-hour-long episodes, began in February. The series finds Webb and his friends -- Emily Ruckman and Mickayla Carreker -- searching for paranormal activity at locales you might expect, like the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, and others you may not, like on the campus of Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. It was key, Webb said, to explore areas other than the typical spots associated with ghosts in the state. I think this is a very unique topic and Arkansas barely gets touched on this topic in the mainstream, so I wanted to make a series about it," Webb said. "One place that really shocked us was Cosmic Caverns, the cave system (near) Berryville," Webb said. "We didn't know anything about it, but it seems there was an exorcism performed in the cave in the late '90s or early 2000s. The crew ended up at Cosmic Caverns after a visit to another location fell through. He has some advice for aspiring paranormal investigators. I've heard a lot cases of people being rude," he said. You get to explore things that not a lot of people know about. Webb plans to expand the series, should it find an audience. "If 'Haunted Arkansas' does well, we're going to do 'Haunted Missouri' and possibly 'Haunted Arkansas' season two because we missed a few locations," he said. So, one last question: Does he believe in ghosts? Donate today to preserve the quality and integrity of local journalism.
