                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino revealed that he has rejected the advice of coaches to “understand the culture of American players” and instead insisted that “they need to know” his own personal soccer philosophy. Pochettino was a surprise appointment by U.S. Soccer in September 2024. The Argentine tactician, four months on from being released by Chelsea after one sixth-placed Premier League finish, had no experience of America or the international level after conducting his 15-year coaching career exclusively among European clubs. The former Tottenham Hotspur boss did have a strong reputation after impressing in the Premier League, although his failure to exert utter dominance with a glittering Paris Saint-Germain side hurt his credentials. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Nevertheless, Pochettino had no intention of ditching his strongly held ideals in favor of a more American philosophy. “Sometimes you feel people don't understand the culture of football... soccer,” the USMNT boss sighed in an interview with BBC Sport. Heading into last summer's Gold Cup, the statistics surrounding his tenure were damning. Fast forward five months and it is the USMNT who are now boasting 4–0 leads before half time. “After one year, we are making great progress,” Pochettino declared, “and building with people who are starting to realize the language of soccer is only one—it doesn't matter if you are American, Brazilian, English... there is only one language of football. Pochettino has already made it clear that he is targeting nothing less than ultimate glory at this summer's World Cup. A kind group stage draw with the likes of Australia and Paraguay will have only emboldened that stance as he continues to get his players to sing from the same hymnsheet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AC Milan are planning to use Croatia legend Luka Modric to help land his former Real Madrid team-mate Andriy Lunin in case their star goalkeeper Mike Maignan exits the club as a free agent. With his contract expiring at the end of this season, Maignan can begin negotiations with other clubs as early as January, raising the possibility of leaving Milan on a free transfer next summer. The Rossoneri had reportedly offered an extension until 2028, increasing his salary from €2.8 million to €5.5m per year, but he has not been convinced to sign on the dotted line with Calciomercato reporting that no further talks are scheduled between the goalkeeper and club. Maignan is reportedly demanding a fee in the region of €8m, which is significantly higher than what the Italian giants are offering. Juventus have emerged as serious contenders for Maignan's signature, while top European clubs like Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are also in the race. With Maignan unlikely to stay back, AC Milan have started their search for a new No.9 at San Siro and Tuttosport reports that they have included Real Madrid's Ukrainian custodian Lunin. Lunin is represented by famous football agent Jordge Mendez, a representative with whom Milan have worked in the past. The report also adds that the Italian giants are hoping that Modric, who joined them from Madrid, would play a key role in the club's negotiation with Lunin and convince him to move to Milan.

Against Azerbaijan, when Kylian came off, Mike took over the armband. The fact that he has been able to play so many matches means that he is solid. He is a great competitor, even in training. The stopper also does not lack confidence. When asked if he is the best goalkeeper in the world, he told GQ Italia: "I'm not going to say, no. There are a lot of great goalkeepers around. I try to do things in the simplest way possible.” After spending more than a decade at Santiago Bernabeu, where he established himself as an all-time great in world football, Modric finally left Madrid this summer to join AC Milan on a free transfer. The veteran midfielder has appeared in 15 matches for the club thus far in all competitions, where he has scored one goal and provided two assists. When asked why he chose to move to Italy, Modrid had earlier said: "After Real, I've always said it, wherever you go it's a step down. There is no doubt about this and all players can confirm it. But I think I arrived at a club that is very close to Real Madrid in terms of reputation and history: for me it is the most ideal situation that could have happened to me. When Milan's option presented itself, it was the right one for me." People welcomed me phenomenally, both inside and outside the club. You can see that Milan is a great historic club, one of the biggest in the world. You can feel it at every step, so I'm really happy and I'm enjoying all of this."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba placed the final stone on their brilliant careers on Saturday, closing out their journey in the best way imaginable: with another trophy. “Now we'll be watching from the other side, but we finished in the best possible way. We'll keep seeing one another and keep enjoying life,” the former Barça stars said during an emotional farewell after the final. Busquets began his footballing path at Jàbac Terrassa before joining Barça's Juvenil A in 2007 at just 19 years old. One season later, he made his first-team debut—on September 13, 2008, against Racing Santander. He played all 90 minutes at an exceptional level, and from that moment on, his performances earned him an irreplaceable role in the squad. Under Pep Guardiola, “Busi” became the heartbeat of what many consider the greatest midfield ever assembled, forming an iconic trio alongside Iniesta and Xavi. His full trophy haul is staggering: nine LaLiga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, and seven Spanish Super Cups—plus the Leagues Cup, Supporters' Shield, and MLS Cup earned with Inter Miami. Busquets retires as Barça's third-most capped player, behind Xavi and Messi. Jordi Alba also emerged from La Masia, beginning in 2003–04 before eventually leaving for Cornellà's Juvenil A and later Valencia. His breakthrough at Mestalla prompted Barça to bring him home in 2012 for €14 million—a move that turned into one of the club's great success stories. Former FC Barcelona star Jordi Alba Alba adapted instantly and, like Busquets, built a career defined by silverware. With Barça, he collected a Champions League, six league titles, five Copas del Rey, four Spanish Super Cups, a UEFA Super Cup, and a Club World Cup. One of his most iconic assists came at the Santiago Bernabéu in the 2016–17 season—the prelude to Messi's legendary shirt celebration. Busquets received his first Spain call-up from Vicente del Bosque in 2009 at the age of 20, and months later he helped secure the 2010 World Cup, starting all seven matches. He was also a key pillar in Spain's Euro 2012 triumph. With 143 caps, he finishes as the third-most capped player in Spain's history, behind Ramos and Casillas, and won an extraordinary 97 matches with La Roja. Alba, though not a World Cup champion, was crucial in the Euro 2012 victory, scoring in the final against Italy. Busquets and Alba had announced months earlier that they would retire at the end of the season, marking December 6 as their final chapter. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and David Beckham Inter Miami delivered a nearly flawless postseason run, with five wins and just one defeat. There were, of course, occasional setbacks, but what endures is the image of two legends raising the MLS Cup—smiling, fulfilled, and at peace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's record-breaking unbeaten run in the Women's Super League came to a shock end on Sunday as Everton, who came into the game with just one victory in the competition this season, stunned the defending champions, winning 1-0 to deal Sonia Bompastor her first defeat as Blues boss. It's not that Bompastor's Blues didn't create chances, either. In the first half especially, the Ireland international produced two outstanding saves, tipping a Macario strike onto the post before doing just another to prevent Thompson's powerful effort squeezing in. When a goalmouth scramble in the latter stages left everyone in the ground wondering just how the ball had stayed out of Everton's net, it felt like a sign that it just wasn't to be Chelsea's day. Bompastor's side are now six points behind leaders Manchester City, with the season just one game away from its halfway stage. Tidy on the ball but couldn't provide a moment of quality to really carve Everton open. Had some decent moments in possession but could've moved better off the ball to be more of a threat. Moved well, linked play nicely and forced a fantastic save out of Brosnan early on, but was often operating in much deeper positions than she would've liked and so couldn't be a consistent threat. Unlucky not to score, seeing a good effort well-saved in the first half before another went just wide after the break. Worked hard and had some nice moments creating for others but lacked service. Looked lively, especially considering her time out, and forced a good save out of Brosnan in the first half, but lacked incision. Was on the end of plenty of chances but just couldn't provide that clinical finish she's so known for, with one pretty bad miss in particular. Showed quality in possession after coming on, creating plenty of chances, but couldn't make a defining difference. Didn't bring her direct running consistently enough to trouble Everton. Suffered her first ever WSL defeat in her 26th game in the competition, with her unlucky not to prevent that from happening herself when a header hit the bar late on., Went very attacking with her line-up but by selecting a lot of players who like to roam and pick up pockets of space, players got in each other's way at times and there wasn't a lot of structure, either. Reacted well with her changes, in terms of addressing that problem and also by giving the subs a lot of time to make their mark, but the ball just wouldn't go in the net.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino declared it an “outrage” that Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni was forced to wear gloves while holding the World Cup trophy at Friday's draw. Scaloni, who led La Albiceleste to glory in Qatar three years ago, presented the World Cup on stage at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. “I apologize on behalf of FIFA. Lionel Scaloni and an old friend 🏆#FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/1pcx9J0obu The 55-year-old allowed Scaloni to come on stage for a re-do, and this time, he handed over the trophy with his bare hands.

Argentina landed in Group J with Algeria, Austria and Jordan. It was a favorable draw for Argentina, but Scaloni is not taking any opponents lightly. Scaloni went on to point out Austria's “great qualifying campaign” and praised Algeria for having “great players and a large youth academy that also feeds France and other countries.” La Albiceleste's first test at the 2026 World Cup comes against Algeria on June 16 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA tries its best to make first-round World Cup life easy for certain teams, starting with the hosts. Consider that goal accomplished with Mexico and the United States. Or France and Germany, for that matter. The best-case scenario for the North Americans in next year's tournament was to be grouped with one European foe, and that is what happened with Mexico and the US. The Maple Leafs, though, will be contending with Switzerland and a playoff team from a group that includes four-time champion Italy. Then there are Les Bleus, who open with Senegal, which defeated them, 1-0, when they were reigning champions in 2002. If you believe the 29th-ranked Norwegians have been underrated by FIFA, you'll find agreement with oddsmakers, who list them ninth favorites to win the tournament. Die Mannschaft will be challenged by two of the better defensive teams, reigning African champion Cote d'Ivoire (8-0-2, 25-0 goal differential in qualifying) and Ecuador (8-2-8, 14-5). The match should be a good advertisement, both teams relying on creativity and technique — but, this time, Mexico will have home-field advantage. If El Tri can equal their 2-2 tie (late Santi Gimenez equalizer) with South Korea on Sept. 10 in Nashville, that could be enough, no matter their result against a Euro qualifier. 27, 13 places behind the Americans — who they are 3-1-2 against since 2021. 17 Switzerland is three places behind the US, despite a 4-0 victory last summer. Five-time champion Brazil is, as usual, heavily favored. But Morocco, which became Africa's first semifinalist in 2022, should provide a difficult test on June 13. The Scots displayed reslience with two stoppage-time goals in a 4-2 win over Denmark in the qualifying finale. Haiti, with the country's two all-time leading scorers Duckens Nazon (43 goals) and former Melrose High forward Frantzdy Pierrot (33), should be buoyed by strong support. The Americans have not lost to Australia since 1992 (2-0-1) or Paraguay since 2011 (3-0-0), but both present a physical presence that could take a toll, no matter the result. The US edged Australia, 2-1, on a cool October night in Colorado, but lost Christian Pulisic (hamstring) in the first half. Coach Mauricio Pochettino noted the risk presented by extreme climates, but that should not be a factor when the teams meet in Seattle on June 19. 9 FIFA ranking is deceptive, as they showed during practices at the Revolution Training Center and a 3-1 dismantling of the US in East Hartford last year. But both the Elephants and La Tricolor had strong qualifying campaigns, displayed exceptional defense, and are known for their physical play. Belgium managed to avoid European colleagues, almost guaranteeing advancement. France has reached two successive finals and played in four of the last seven title games, but will not have it easy. The reigning champion Albiceleste should be able to pace themselves. Group leadership could come down the last game, Portugal-Colombia in Miami on June 27. Democratic Republic of the Congo could challenge, but the Leopards first must qualify in a playoff with Jamaica and New Caledonia. The country has transformed its soccer image since, presenting a team ranked No. 4 and a tamed down, though still high-spirited, following.</p>

The final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, which took place on July 13, was a little cooler, with highs of 85F. The 10-year average is 87F, according to data from Weather Underground. A report published in June by FIFPro, the union that represents more than 70,000 professional players worldwide, previously called on FIFA to avoid midday games in “extremely high-risk” areas, advice the world governing body has heeded. No group-stage games in Kansas City, Miami and Monterrey will begin before 6pm ET. So it's not unusual for us to do events in the summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are preparing for the possibility of a major sale involving Rodrygo, after reports from Defensa Central revealed that the club are now willing to listen to offers worth around €70 million for the Brazilian forward. While Xabi Alonso still believes in Rodrygo's talent, the club is no longer ruling out a high-profile departure if his situation does not improve significantly in the coming months. Between now and the summer, Rodrygo has a clear window to prove that he deserves to remain a core part of Madrid's long-term project. If those demands are not met, a sale will be seriously considered. In that regard, several elite clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, and Bayern Munich, have already made informal approaches to monitor his situation. Saudi Arabia also remains an option financially, although for now the Brazilian's priority is to continue competing at the highest level in Europe. Despite this growing market, Rodrygo's personal preference has always been to stay at the Santiago Bernabeu. His desire to succeed at the club and cement his legacy at the club initially ruled out any winter move, even with Premier League interest intensifying. However, that stance could evolve if his sporting situation does not change. He has featured in 16 matches across all competitions without scoring a single goal. Even more telling is his role within the squad, having made only four appearances as a starter, with just 446 minutes played in total.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup Draw is complete. The tournament's 12 groups are set in stone, and we now have a general sense of which teams will beplaying in which cities (at least for the 72 group stage games). We have narrowed down which 12 teams could be coming to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, which will be called Boston Stadium. After a slurry of speeches and some political posturing, the biggest sporting event of the year's initial stage has been set in stone. Exact schedules, locations and kickoff times will be confirmed tomorrow on Saturday, Dec. 6. There could be some seriously good soccer players coming to Boston this summer. Though we don't yet exactly know when and where (we'll find this out tomorrow), we've narrowed down the potential teams coming to Boston to just 12 (below). Keep reading, and you'll find a breakdown of the stars each team could potentially bring with it. (We'll have coverage so check back tomorrow.) The United States Men's National Team, which is in Group D, now knows its opponents for the group stage of competition. Here's a look at every team in the group: Cape Verde, which has a large population of immigrants in the Brockton area, was drawn to Group H, meaning they will play at least one game in Miami Stadium, Atlanta Stadium, Houston Stadium and Estadio Guadalajara. Haiti also has a prominent population in the Brockton area and throughout Massachusetts. Portugal has a considerable fan base in the Brockton and Southcoast area of Massachusetts. The team was drawn to Group K, along with Colombia. In Group L, England was drawn from Pot 1. However, there will only be a single Group L match played in Boston Stadium. Drawing officially began around 1:27 p.m. at the group stage final draw. The game schedule will be announced tomorrow (Saturday), starting at noon Easterntime. Group A: Mexico, Korea Republic, South Africa, [winner of Playoff D] The former New England Patriots quarterback has officially taken the stage to help pull teams out of their pots. "Certainly incredible to have this incredible event coming to North America," Brady said, who played at Gillette Stadium for 20 seasons. There's huge anticipation always for this event." Unsurprisingly, no teams have been drawn yet. However, hosts Kevin Hart and Heidi Klum kicked off the ceremony with some speeches and Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams introduced thefestivities with some songs. Patriot Place is a shopping and dining center located adjacent to Boston Stadium. "Patriot Place features more than 1.3 million square feet of shopping, dining, and entertainment," Patriot Place said on its website. "You will find major fashion retailers, live and interactive entertainment, eateries, a four-star hotel, state of the art theatre and much, much more." Moments ago, President Donald Trump took the stage at the final draw to receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize, awarded to individuals recognized as striving for peace. "In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in an Instagram post. Thierry Henry, a World Cup winner who cemented himself as a legend with France and Arsenal, has given his prediction for the winner of the tournament. Henry, a Frenchman himself, considers France to be the team best suited to win the tournament. The player-turned-pundit noted that Les Bleushave made it to the finals of the previous two FIFA World Cups, and he expects his France side to make it to their third consecutive final. The stadium is located around 29 miles southwest of downtown Boston in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Teams are picked and assigned to "groups" in accordance with which "pot" they are placed in. There are four "pots" that the 48 teams have been organized in, corresponding to team rankings in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. In total, there are 16 cities hosting matches in this year's World Cup, split between Canada, Mexico and the United States. The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) has its schedule for FIFA World Cup group stage matches laid out, as do the teams for Mexico and Canada. In the final draw, which is scheduled for Dec. 5, teams are selected from four "pots" which correspond to their FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. Gillette Stadium has a seating capacity of 64,628. The venue has undergone considerable updates since its opening over two decades ago. FIFA said the third phase of 2026 World Cup tickets will begin on Dec. 11 at 11 a.m. ET as part of an update about its ticket sales inventory. It is the initial phase in which fans can submit applications for tickets after the group-stage matchups are revealed. World Cup tickets can also be bought through secondary ticket marketplaces, including the official FIFA resale/exchange and Stubhub. Previously, there were only 32 teams in the tournament, so, therefore, the first knockout round used to be a round of 16. These pots are determined based on skill level. So the best teams are in Pot 1. That way, ideally, the groups are all of equal strength. There are a total of 12 groups, with four teams in each. Each team plays the other teams in its group exactly once. Expect a lot of glitz and glamour. For starters, the event is co-hosted by Heidi Klum, Kevin Hart and Danny Ramirez, and it will feature performances by Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams. Assuming you aren't a ticketholder for the event, the draw will also air live on FOX. It will also be streamed live at foxsports.com if you're stuck in front of a computer. The draw itself is scheduled to take about two hours. In the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, five matches took place at what was then called Foxboro Stadium. Four years later, when the United States hosted another Women's World Cup in 2003, the tournament returned to Foxboro. This time, Gillette Stadium hosted four of the tournament's matches. The Patriots have a bye week and will return to Gillette field on Sunday, Dec. 15, at 1 p.m. when theytake on the Buffalo Bills. This week the Gillette Stadium hosts a different kind of Super Bowl, the Massachusetts High School Football Championships. Last night in the first game, top-seeded Cohasset outlasted Amesbury, 22-14, to capture the program's third state championship all-time and first since 2021. In the second game, thetop-seeded Norwood Clippers beat No. 3 Fairhaven in the MIAA Division 6 Super Bowl 28-14. Long answer: We know that groups C, I and L will all play some of their matches in Boston. We also know that the winners of Group E will play a Round of 32 match in Boston. But the specific teams playing won't be known until the official schedule is announced tomorrow, Saturday, Dec. 6. Boston Stadium was awarded a total of seven World Cup matches. Five of those are group stage matches, one is a Round of 32 matchup and Boston's final match is a quarterfinal matchup on Thursday, July 9. Here's what we know about all the matches so far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel spent some of his jaunt to the Club World Cup last summer checking in on Manchester City in Boca Raton, Florida. City were just north of Miami and Tuchel liked what he saw, hoping that this would be home to a pre-tournament camp. Inter Miami's facilities in Fort Lauderdale, just behind the club's temporary stadium, appeal. If they're good enough for David Beckham and Lionel Messi, then a week for the FA is more than manageable. Stifling with high humidity, it is the perfect spot to quickly acclimatise to the worst of their new surroundings – the real energy-sapping, salmon-skinned Brit abroad sort of weather. Time spent in Miami, which is pencilled in as an early base, will actually help more for potential knockout games - in Mexico City, as well as Miami - rather than the heat England may face over the course of Group L. Tuchel is openly discussing the idea of keeping substitutes inside until required but thankfully that will not be necessary in this part of Texas. Houston, south of the state, is a different proposition altogether. ‘In 1994 we played in Dallas,' said Manchester City boss and ex-Spain midfielder Pep Guardiola, an unused substitute that day for a 2-2 draw with South Korea. And maybe it would have been better to be inside. So the air conditioning certainly saves teams there. The second match, when meeting Ghana in Boston, could present humidity issues, although not as severe as elsewhere. But still not quite as daunting as it might have been had the other option for that day arisen. Perhaps it is good to familiarise ourselves with what Maresca thought about the Club World Cup, claiming that the US wasn't fit to host this event. ‘Seven, eight, nine games they have suspended,' he said after lengthy delays to a last-16 win over Benfica. For two decades, Premier League clubs have had to endure severe weather warnings during naked money grabbing pre-season tours. One of City's friendlies in Wisconsin once looked as if it was possessed by an antagonist out of Stranger Things, a thick black cloud engulfing Lambeau Field. Not in the perfect surrounds of Atlanta though, where a possible date awaits in the last 32. It's another climate-regulated arena that is the best of what America has to offer and would seemingly be a more sensible choice for the final from that sense and the logistics. While only seven miles from Manhattan, New Jersey's ground has long been a nightmare for supporters – in the middle of nowhere with awful transport links, and still like that for FIFA's tournament earlier in the year. Then again, if it is already palatable enough for fans of Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift to sell the place out then maybe a bit of extra care and attention before the biggest day in the sporting calendar should see things go smoothly enough. Atlanta, scene of a possible England semi-final (but let's not overdo the optimism given the route) is a dream. But the proximity to America's greatest metropolis won. A last-16 meeting with co-hosts Mexico in their capital – dependent on England topping the group and progressing through the first knockout round – is scheduled for 1am. That is then in the territory of short-term licensing agreements coming into force across the country, which is something they will be negotiating north of the border too, given Scotland's opening group fixture against Haiti begins at 2am before a couple of 11pm starts. Steve Clarke does have both of his first two in Boston though. Proof that there are both pros and cons to each route handed to those embarking on America.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA revealed the full schedule, including venues and kickoff times, for the 2026 World Cup on Saturday, one day after the 42 qualifiers and six remaining playoff slots were drawn into 12 groups. That includes the group itinerary of both the United States and Mexico, who will kick off two of their three matches in prime time. Mexico Group A Schedule Thursday, June 11 vs. South Africa – 3 p.m. ET, Guadalajara Wednesday, June 24 vs. UEFA Playoff D – 9 p.m. USA Group D Schedule Friday, June 12 vs. Paraguay – 9 p.m. ET, Seattle Thursday, July 25 vs. UEFA Playoff C – 10 p.m. Which city (debatably) got the best games? The answer to this question might depend on your criteria. In terms of getting the widest range of glamorous nations to visit, you'd have to go with New York's group itinerary, which includes appearances by — in order — Brazil, France, Germany and England: New York group fixtures Saturday, June 13 – Brazil vs. Morocco – 6 p.m. In terms of getting a mix of well-known teams and matches likely to be competitive until the final whistle, the best mix might belong to Dallas. Dallas group fixtures Sunday, June 14 – Netherlands vs. Japan – 4 p.m. ET Thursday, June 25 – Japan vs. UEFA Playoff B – 7 p.m. There's been an obvious adjustment with the group stage schedule for next summer. While there are several matches in warmer markets with outdoor stadiums before sundown, most of them are late enough that the playing surface should be in the shade. But there are a few exceptions to the rule. Here are the group stage matches that kick off before 6 pm local time in markets that could pose a risk of extreme heat. ET, New York/New Jersey Thursday, June 25 – Curacao vs. Ivory Coast – 4 p.m. ET, New York/New Jersey Saturday, June 27 – Croatia vs. Ghana – 5 p.m. However, FIFA will still go ahead with a 3 p.m. After months of anticipation, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on Friday gave us a much clearer picture of how next summer's tournament — the first staged with a record… National Signing Day is the culmination of a months- and years-long process of college football recruiting in a three-day span during this week's early signing period.
