COTONOU, Benin (AP) — A coup that was announced in Benin has been “foiled,” the interior minister said Sunday in a video on Facebook, but there was no word from the president and sporadic gunshots were heard in parts of the administrative capital, Cotonou. “In the early morning of Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025, a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny with the aim of destabilizing the state and its institutions,” Alassane Seidou said. “Faced with this situation, the Beninese Armed Forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic.” It remains unclear if Lt. Col. Pascal Tigri, the coup leader, has been apprehended. Gunfire was heard and soldiers were seen patrolling around some locations in Cotonou, but the city has been relatively calm since the coup attempt was announced. Earlier on Sunday, a group of soldiers appeared on Benin 's state TV to announce the dissolution of the government in an apparent coup, the latest of many in West Africa. Following its independence from France in 1960, the West African nation witnessed multiple coups, especially in the decades following its independence. Since 1991, the country has been politically stable following the two-decade rule of Marxist-Leninist Mathieu Kérékou. There has been no official news about President Patrice Talon since gunshots were heard around the presidential residence. However, the signal to the state television and public radio, which was cut off, has now been restored. Talon has been in power since 2016 and is due to step down next April after the presidential election. Opposition candidate Renaud Agbodjo was rejected by the electoral commission on the grounds that he did not have sufficient sponsors. In January, two associates of Talon were sentenced to 20 years in prison for an alleged 2024 coup plot. The coup attempt is the latest in a string of military takeovers that have rocked West Africa. Last month, a military coup in Guinea-Bissau removed former President Umaro Embalo after a contested election in which both he and the opposition candidate declared themselves winners.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former FBI Director James Comey speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, in Washington, June 8, 2017. WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has dealt a setback to Justice Department efforts to seek a new indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, temporarily barring prosecutors from using evidence they had relied on when they initially secured criminal charges. The ruling Saturday night from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly does not preclude the department from trying again soon to indict Comey, but it does suggest prosecutors may have to do so without citing communications between Comey and a close friend, Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman. Comey was charged in September with lying to Congress when he denied having authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for media coverage about the FBI. In pursuing the case, prosecutors cited messages between Comey and Richman that they said showed Comey encouraging Richman to engage with the media for certain FBI-related coverage. But that ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. After the case was thrown out, lawyers for Richman sought a court order that would bar prosecutors from continued access to his computer files, which the Justice Department obtained through search warrants in 2019 and 2020 as part of a media leak investigation that was later closed without charges. But Richman and his lawyers say that in preparing the criminal case against Comey, prosecutors relied on data that exceeded the scope of the warrants, illegally held onto communications they should have destroyed or returned and conducted new, warrantless searches of the files. Kollar-Kotelly on Saturday night granted Richman's request for a temporary restraining, instructing the department “not to access the covered materials once they are identified, segregated, and secured, or to share, disseminate, or disclose the covered materials to any person, without first seeking and obtaining leave of this Court.” “Petitioner Richman has also shown that, absent an injunction, he will be irreparably harmed by the ongoing violation of his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures arising from the Government's continuing retention of the image of his computer and related materials,” she wrote. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Sunday on the ruling and what it meant for revived charges against Comey. It is not clear that the Justice Department could secure new charges against Comey even if it could rely on Richman's communications. Comey's lawyers have said the statute of limitations on such a case — the congressional testimony at issue was given on Sept. 30, 2020, or more than five years ago — has expired.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo combo shows candidates for Mayor of Miami, from left, Republican Emilio Gonzalez and Democrat Eileen Higgins. Rick Scott, right, laughs with Emilio Gonzalez, director and chief executive officer of the Miami-Dade Aviation Department, center, and Jose “Pepe” Diaz, Miami-Dade County commissioner, left, after a news conference at Miami International Airport, Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015, in Miami. MIAMI (AP) — It has been nearly three decades since a Democrat held the mayor's office in Miami, a span of futility the party is hoping to reverse during a special runoff election this week in one of the last electoral showdowns before next year's midterms. While it is a local race, this election has become the latest test of the nation's political mood nearly a year into President Donald Trump's second term. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott, have weighed in for the conservative candidate, former city manager Emilio Gonzalez, in the otherwise nonpartisan race. Nationally known Democrats, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have offered support on behalf of Eileen Higgins, a Democrat who served on the county commission before winning a runoff spot last month. An upset for the Democrats on Tuesday would give the party an additional burst of momentum heading into a crucial election year when control of Congress will be at stake, especially in a region that has become increasingly friendly turf for Republicans and where Trump plans to build his presidential library. Higgins, who lives in the Cuban enclave of Little Havana and had represented a district that leans conservative, proudly wears the label of “La Gringa,” a term Spanish speakers use for white Americans. A Spanish speaker herself, Higgins has focused her campaign relentlessly on local issues such as the cost of housing while capitalizing on national ones, including the treatment of immigrants under the Trump administration in a city with sizable Hispanic and foreign-born populations. “I have been a Democrat serving in a primarily Republican district, and all I have done is work for the people,” she told The Associated Press. The city of 487,000 is part of Miami-Dade County, which Trump flipped last year, handily defeating Democrat Kamala Harris after losing the county to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Christian Ulvert, Higgins' campaign manager, said early returns of mail ballots are encouraging. About 44% had been cast by registered Democrats as of Thursday, a day before early in-person voting began, compared with about 30% by registered Republicans. Higgins, who would be the first non-Hispanic mayor of Miami in almost 30 years if elected, said she is confident she will receive support not only from Democrats, but also from unaffiliated voters and some Republicans because of her work as an elected official. Her pitch to voters includes finding city-owned land that could be turned into affordable housing and cutting unnecessary spending. She was asked during a recent forum sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce if she would try to turn the more ceremonial role of mayor into a full-time job and not take on other work, something that raised ethical concerns for the current mayor, term-limited Francis Suarez. I'm going to be a full-time mayor,” Higgins said as the interviewer continued to press her about whether that meant not accepting any outside employment. In a blunt-talking style, Higgins responded sternly: “All right, do I have to say it more clearly? While Latino voters nationally have traditionally leaned Democratic, Republicans in Florida have found strong backing among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan immigrants, who resist socialist inclinations likened to the ones from the governments they fled. Trump tapped into those sentiments in winning Miami-Dade County last year, a turnaround from his 30 percentage point loss there to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Yet some Florida Republicans began sounding the alarm after November's elections, when Democrats secured wins in nationally watched governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia. Those results were largely seen as a reflection of concerns over rising prices and the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies. U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican whose district includes the city of Miami, called the elections elsewhere a “wake-up call.” Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump, has said about immigration arrests that “what we are witnessing is inhumane.” Citizenship and Immigration Services under Republican President George W. Bush, said during a debate sponsored by Miami's CBS affiliate that he supported immigration arrests against those who committed crimes. But he demurred when the moderator said most of those arrested had not committed violent offenses: “But this is a federal issue,” Gonzalez said. “This is not an issue that has to do with the mayor of Miami.” “When we start to enforce whatever shenanigans is coming out of the federal government to just randomly pick people up, we could erode that trust,” she said. Some Democrats who could be considering a presidential run in 2028 also are backing her campaign. Buttigieg encouraged voters in a video to make a plan to vote for her, U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona joined her Sunday for early voting stops and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is scheduled to appear at a rally for her Monday. Gustavo Ascani, a 30-year-old Miami voter, said the city has long-standing problems that need addressing. “Maybe Republicans have overlooked, after having locally been in power for so long, certain issues that are important for the people in Miami,” Ascani said. Robin Peguero, a former prosecutor who is running for the chance to challenge Salazar for her congressional seat, said voters' concerns center around affordability, an issue that has become a focal point of both parties after Democrats' wins in New Jersey and Virginia. The Obama-era health law remains popular in South Florida, and recent polling shows most people who will be affected by the increases blame Trump and Republicans. “It's kitchen table issues, whether it's an election for local officials or whether there is an election for the president,” Peguero said. “It's a rejection of what is happening in this country.”</p>

John Moxley joins 'The Story' with reactions to the Connecticut court's decision to order a new murder trial for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel, first found guilty of Martha's murder in 1975. Despite being released from prison in 2013 and later having his conviction vacated, Skakel is still looking to assert his innocence in a case that has captivated the nation. Moxley was only 15 when she was beaten and stabbed to death with a golf club in the yard of her family's suburban Greenwich home on Oct. 30, 1975. She was last seen hanging out with friends on "Mischief Night," an annual evening in which children partake in neighborhood pranks on the night before Halloween. File photo of Martha Moxley when she was 14. An autopsy later revealed Moxley had been killed with the golf club, which was ultimately traced to the Skakel family's home. Investigators initially began looking into Thomas Skakel, Michael's older brother, and the family's live-in tutor, Kenneth Littleton, before ultimately turning their attention to Michael, who was 15 at the time of Moxley's death. However, he is now speaking out to tell his side of the story, while recounting painful details about his traumatic childhood. Skakel detailed how his family's Catholic religion played a large part in his upbringing, while recalling how he was hit over taking Playboy magazines when he was a child. Michael Skakel reacts to being granted bail during his hearing at Stamford Superior Court on Nov. 21, 2013, in Stamford, Connecticut. He went on to discuss how his parents primarily showed affection toward his brother, Tommy, when the brothers were growing up. Skakel also pointed to how his parents hardly visited him after he was hospitalized with a broken neck when he jumped off a desk in his childhood home. Skakel recalled a time in which his father, whom he had not seen in weeks, told him, "You make me sick. "I just wanted to die," Skakel said in the episode, as he recalled how his father barely addressed his mother's death. As his mother struggled with her illness, Skakel began drinking when he was just a teenager. On the day she died, he finished off an entire bottle of Smirnoff on his family's lawn, he said. "His alcoholic, abusive father tortured him physically and psychologically throughout his boyhood, including beating him and telling him he was responsible for killing his mother," Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist, told Fox News Digital. Lieberman pointed to how the psychological damage inflicted on Skakel likely impacted him in his adult life as his drinking eventually escalated. In 1978, he borrowed his brother's car and, while driving with a few friends, smashed into a telephone pole. File photo of Martha Moxley when she was 14. Individuals from the boarding school traveled to Connecticut to pick him up, with Skakel recalling how he "was dragged out of there like an animal," before being loaded onto a plane where he was thrown into "a world of utter insanity." The Élan School had roughly 300 live-in students who were often subjected to harsh physical punishments, prolonged screaming and occasionally wearing dunce caps, according to the podcast. Headcounts were carried out every 15 minutes to keep residents from escaping, which Skakel attempted multiple times. In an emotional recounting, Skakel described how he was subjected to various punishments, including the "general meeting" and "boxing ring" where students would face forms of physical brutality. "They sent maybe 10 guys upstairs to get me," Skakel said, as he recalled a failed escape attempt. "And they literally picked me up over their heads and carried me down the stairs like I was a crash test dummy. After Skakel left the school, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and spent a month at a residential care facility in California. He got married in 1991 and established a skiing career. "My Uncle Tommy rented me a private jet the next morning," Skakel said. Skakel did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment. On Jan. 19, 2000, Skakel turned himself in to authorities after police issued a warrant for his arrest, 25 years after Moxley was killed. Skakel, who was 39 at the time, was initially arraigned as a juvenile, with the case later ending up in regular court. He was convicted of murder by a panel of 12 jurors in Norwalk Superior Court on June 7, 2002, and later sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 2013, following multiple failed attempts to appeal his conviction, Skakel was granted a new trial after a judge ruled his attorney, Michael Sherman, did not adequately defend him in his original case. Skakel's conviction was ultimately vacated by the Connecticut Supreme Court on May 4, 2018, with prosecutors later deciding to not seek a second trial for Skakel on the murder charge. "Michael Skakel should never have spent one day in prison because there was no way to determine that he was guilty beyond reasonable doubt," Lieberman said. "Michael was a victim of torture throughout his life, from his childhood to the court system," Lieberman said, adding Skakel "has continued to unconsciously play out this victim role until today." While the mystery surrounding who killed Moxley continues to loom over the case, Skakel's bid to assert his innocence in the podcast adds a new voice to a story that has been marred by decades of silence.

The trip, organized in partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is designed to provide training and prepare participants to serve as unofficial ambassadors for Israel in their communities. Dr. Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Heritage Center in Jerusalem and a confidant of President Donald Trump, said most Evangelical Bible believers are Zionists, making them a key ally in efforts to counter antisemitism. The largest delegation of evangelical Christian pastors and influencers ever brought to Israel meets with former Hamas captives at the site of the Supernova music festival on Wednesday as part of the Friends of Zion Ambassador Program. What is being said against the state of Israel is one hundred times worse than what the Nazis said on their party platform in 1920, and everyone is ignoring it. They don't realize how dangerous this is," Evans told Fox News Digital. And while Israel has never fought an ideological war, its enemies have," he added. Evans said members of the visiting delegation were vetted to ensure no hidden agendas and signed a pledge committing to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people. These 1,000 pastors represent tens of millions of Americans and have major media and social media influence," he said. The initiative was approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Evans has known for 45 years. Dr. Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Heritage Center in Jerusalem, meets with former Hamas hostage Edan Alexander. "When we were on Mount Herzl, one widow was there sharing her story. Her daughter no longer has a daddy. I connected on a deep personal level," Tamryn Foley, a member of the National Faith Advisory Board's executive team, told Fox News Digital.The board is the largest coalition backing and advocating for people of faith, led by Pastor Paula White-Cain. Its mission is built on four pillars — protecting religious freedom, promoting a strong America, defending life at all stages and honoring family values — and it identifies the U.S.-Israel alliance as central to that agenda. I don't think we realized how big this event would be. "I am going back home with a fire to make sure young people in my country know the truth. It's one thing to understand something intellectually, and another to come here, meet people who have been affected, and connect with them on a heart level," she continued. MIKE PENCE: NO PLACE FOR ANTISEMITISM IN AMERICA TODAY, TOMORROW OR EVER"There is so much negative propaganda in our country. It's loud, and we need to do a better job of educating young people. They're capable of seeing through the nonsense and lies — I don't think we give them enough credit. We need to present them with the truth and plant the seed for lifelong support for Israel," Foley said. One objective of the training, he explained, is to reach young people — claiming countries like Qatar have turned against Israel by investing millions of dollars to spread antisemitic content through universities and digital platforms. Evans said the Muslim Brotherhood, for example, has waged ideological warfare, describing it as a "powerful demon because it doesn't clear customs, and you can't kill it with a bullet. "More than half of the Palestinian population embraces Hamas' ideology of radical Islam," he claimed, "which isn't based on land for peace but on establishing an Islamic state and eradicating the Jewish state." Dr. Mike Evans meets with former Hamas hostages Keith and Aviva Siegel. "The president loves us and knows how we feel about Israel," he said. We would not have had the hostages back without him. He will stand with us and will not cave in to Jew-haters' intentions regarding Judea and Samaria or a Palestinian state. On Wednesday, the delegation met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and visited the site of Hamas's Oct. 7 massacre at the Supernova music festival, accompanied by former hostages Emily Damari, Tal Shoham, Moran Stella Yanai, and Aviva and Keith Siegel, who received the "Here Am I" Award for their advocacy work. "We are seeking to unify — and demonstrate that unity — between evangelical Christian leaders in America, Israel and the Jewish people, and to counter any perception that this community is divided on the issue, because it is not," Pastor Mike Atkins, a member of the delegation, told Fox News Digital. "The antisemitism that erupted had long been simmering beneath the surface on university campuses and in major European cities. Delegates, he said, have also received extensive information through symposium speakers on how to combat antisemitic deception and will continue to do so as they coalesce into a coalition. Take a stand, speak up and do not remain silent," he said. "The best medicine for Jewish Derangement Syndrome, an acute form of bigotry and antisemitism, is for people to come to Israel and see and hear for themselves. These American spiritual leaders are committed to using their pulpits and influence to provide truth," Huckabee told Fox News Digital. Amelie Botbol is a freelance journalist based in Tel Aviv.

Actor and director Robert Davi discusses President Donald Trump's hosting of The Kennedy Center Honors on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' President Donald Trump spearheaded major changes to the Kennedy Center Honors ahead of the highly anticipated awards ceremony. Founded in 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors recognize a handful of performing artists every year for their lifetime contributions to culture. After returning to the White House in January, Trump, 79, became chairman of the Kennedy Center board and has since undertaken efforts to reshape the honors program — pushing for a glitzier, star-studded celebration. In August, Trump announced this year's lineup of honorees, country legend George Strait, Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone, rock band KISS, Broadway icon Michael Crawford and Grammy Award-winning singer Gloria Gaynor. "The 48th Kennedy Center Honorees are outstanding people, incredible, we can't wait… in a few short months since I became chairman of the board, the Kennedy Center, we've completely reversed the decline of this cherished national institution," he said in his speech. From overhauling the honoree selection process to unveiling a new medallion, here's a breakdown of how the Kennedy Center Honors have been revamped under Trump. Trump said he was "98% involved" in choosing the honorees. Though there was a Special Honors Advisory Committee that made recommendations, Trump appeared to confirm that he made the final choices. Honoree George Strait has the most No. 1 singles of any artist in any music genre, and he's the only artist to chart a top 10 hit every year for 30 years. When reporters asked Trump how involved he was in selecting the 2025 honorees, he responded, "I was about 98% involved… they all came through me." "I turned down plenty, they were too woke," he continued. This is very different than it used to be." While taking aim at the state of Hollywood awards shows, Trump took a swipe at the Oscars. Trump concluded his "very long answer" by saying he "was very involved" in the selection of the Kennedy Center honorees. The 2023 class of honorees with their medallions, from left, Renée Fleming, Queen Latifah, Billy Crystal Barry Gibb and Dionne Warwick. The Honors medal hung from wide satin ribbon in five bright rainbow colors that formed a V-shape around the honoree's neck. The gold circular medallion was shaped like a starburst and featured an abstract representation of the Kennedy Center building and was handmade by the same family for nearly five decades. In a press release issued on Tuesday, the Kennedy Center announced that the medallions "have been re-imagined and donated by Tiffany & Co." "The brand-new medallion features a gold disc etched on one side with a depiction of the Kennedy Center. Trump revamped the Kennedy Center board and took over as chairman. In February, Trump announced a major shakeup of the Kennedy Center leadership. He revealed that he had decided to immediately fire multiple Kennedy Center board members appointed by former President Joe Biden and other prior trustees, including the chairman, and fill that role himself. Trump claimed he and the former chair David Rubenstein, along with the ousted board members, "do not share [the same] vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture," according to his announcement on Truth Social. "We will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. Trump also criticized Kennedy Center programming, including drag shows, under the prior administration. Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone said he could "still not fathom" receiving the honor. "Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP. The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. He later replaced the former members with 14 other members, including allies such as second lady Usha Vance and "God Bless the USA" singer Lee Greenwood. The new board elected Trump as chairman on Feb. 12. Trump dismissed long-serving Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter and appointed his ally Richard Grenell – who became the U.S.'s first openly gay Cabinet member under the first Trump administration when he served as acting director of national intelligence – as interim executive director amid the board overhaul. Legendary rock band KISS will be honored. The 2025 honorees – KISS, Gloria Gaynor, George Strait, Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford – indicated a shift toward recognizing artists from more mainstream, pop culture fields rather than the cross-disciplinary lineups of prior years. During the first two decades after the Honors were founded, the recipients were mainly from the world of classical arts, with some notable exceptions, including actor James Cagney, actress Lucille Ball and film director Elia Kazan. In the mid-1990s, the Honors began expanding toward mainstream entertainment, honoring more pop musicians, rock artists, film and television actors and Broadway stars. Iconic singer Gloria Gaynor was named as one of the honorees. In addition to mainstream artists, past honoree classes have always included representation from classical music, jazz, dance, opera or composition. However, 2025's lineup features no honoree from those disciplines, marking a first in modern program history. The 2025 honorees chosen under Trump's direction are entirely from rock, disco, country, film and Broadway. In the Kennedy Honors Center's August press release announcing the honorees, Grenell said, "For nearly half a century, this tradition has celebrated those whose voices and visions tell our nation's story and share it with the world." "This year's Honorees have left an indelible mark on our history, reminding us that the arts are for everyone." Are you fools asking me to do that? Trump went on to say that his chief of staff Susie Wiles also asked him to host the Honors. That's the power she's got," he said. And I didn't want to do it, OK? I used to host ‘The Apprentice' finales and we did rather well with that," Trump added, referring to his long-running NBC reality competition show. "So I think we're going to do very well, because we have some great honorees, some really great ones." Broadway star Michael Crawford was also unveiled as one of the honorees. During Trump's first term, he and first lady Melania Trump did not attend the Honors or host the traditional White House reception for the honorees. In 2017, honorees, including Norman Lear and dancer Carmen de Lavallade, announced that they would not attend a White House reception hosted by Trump in protest. The White House subsequently issued a statement that read: "The president and first lady have decided not to participate in this year's activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction." In 2020, the Honors were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead took place in May 2021, with a revamped format, including smaller, socially-distanced and virtual tributes.

Experience the holiday magic from anywhere as you admire this merry and big Christmas tree in Manhattan. Lillian Richey of Dallas, Texas, created "Finding Jesus," an interactive Christmas countdown activity that shares the Nativity story. A plush Jesus doll and 24 puzzle pieces paired with Scripture teach families about the birth of the Lord. The "Finding Jesus" founder told Fox News Digital the idea came to her during a Bible study session. A Dallas mom created the "Finding Jesus" kit. The "fun and meaningful countdown to Christmas," as it's described, features a plush Jesus doll and 24 puzzle pieces paired with Bible verses. A woman in her study group spoke about how her son would pick up the baby Jesus figurine from their porcelain Nativity scene, but would keep dropping him. Richey went on, "She would be like, 'Where's Jesus?' And we all thought: Isn't that what we should be doing — trying to find Jesus instead of all these other things?" She felt the Lord put the idea in her heart of helping kids to seek Jesus during Advent — rather than engaging in secular activities. Richey launched the plush doll last year with her small batch of 10,000 units that promptly sold out. "I wanted something that was easy, simple, all in one — not intimidating." "I wanted something that told the birth of Jesus [and] that was all Scripture — there's no commentary from me," said the creator of "Finding Jesus." Richey added, "I wanted something that told the birth of Jesus [and] that was all Scripture — there's no commentary from me. Many across the country agree that the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah on Sept. 10 — after his years of outreach to young people about faith, family, values and country — has helped spark a religious revival, with scores of non-believers picking up a Bible for the first time. The churches are coming back ... religion is coming back to America," said President Donald Trump, in part, at the Thanksgiving turkey pardoning. Many people have rediscovered their faith in this country and begun practicing it again. Richey said she hopes the "Finding Jesus" kits help children and families in their journey toward a relationship with God — and that they keep strengthening that relationship.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? You can now place bets on elections, wars, and deportations. Think of them as like a stock market, but instead of buying shares in companies, you buy shares in the outcomes of real-world events — and you can bet on almost anything. When the bet is settled — maybe PTA gets that Oscar win — you get paid. The sector just had its strongest period yet, pulling in nearly $10 billion combined in bets on Kalshi and Polymarket last month. But at a time where sports betting scandals are on the rise, prediction markets are facing their own ethical reckoning. To help us navigate that question, Vox's Noel King spoke with John Herrman, a tech columnist at New York Magazine. He explained why these markets feel so unsettling and how they might open up new opportunities for political corruption, especially under the Trump administration (both Kalshi and Polymarket, notably, have enlisted Donald Trump Jr. as an adviser). Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. If we're ok with betting on horses and football games, why does betting on elections skeeve us out so much? If we think back to the way that sports betting online took over sports media, there was a lot of squeamishness early on. And that's in a situation where we're betting on games. We're betting on things that aren't life or death — that aren't the types of things you can bet on now on Polymarket or Kalshi, like how many people will be deported in the next six months. More obviously, you have just unbelievable opportunities for corruption here. If we think about the ways in which betting on, say, a presidential election could go sideways, what is the worst-case scenario? You have people who have basically removed themselves from the democratic process to engage instead in a market process — it turns everyone into a speculator rather than a voter. It sort of takes them out of this decision that will have a massive effect on how the world works, and it potentially just replaces a lot of the also-problematic ways that they interact with elections and politics, through media and through social engagement, with something that is just reading the financial news or reading about options calls or something like that. It's a completely abstract way to engage with politics and, to me, it represents kind of an exit from politics. The dark scenario — here's where my brain went, tell me if I'm being nuts. Someone has the opportunity to win $10 million if a candidate is assassinated. There's an enormous incentive to do a very bad thing. That's actually one of the early foundational concepts of prediction markets, where people were imagining and contriving ways where a prediction market might be set up to function explicitly as an assassination market. Now, these actual platforms in the world have prohibitions on that. We should probably prepare for a world where, much in the way that sports has become nearly impossible to follow or talk about without talking in this meta way about odds, betting outcomes, etc., politics will start to feel like that. We just did an episode about sports betting, where fans are saying that when they learn about betting scandals again and again and again, their trust in the sport starts to erode. If people are losing trust in sports, it seems possible that, if we bet on elections, we could be looking within a couple of years at people losing faith in the outcome of elections. But none of those sensations are quite the same as losing a bunch of money on a bet. That is a new flavor of interaction with politics. But losing even more trust in the process is — I mean, I don't know how much lower you can go. But it seems like we're trying to find a way, and someone is maybe making a lot of money on it. Is there a possible upside here, if we're letting people bet on elections, that they become more engaged? But I do want to make sure that we mention here that prediction markets as an additional source of information in the world are really interesting and useful. I will make a case for prediction markets as good aggregators of information, and I think they also allow people to check out where you are, on one hand, voting, and on the other, betting. Or are they at odds with one another? And I think it's very possible to imagine that they could be at odds. Donald Trump Jr. is advising both Kalshi and Polymarket. What role do you think prediction markets are going to play in this administration, and what do you think it means that they're playing a role in this administration? And so if you are in the family that has arguably more non-public important information than any other family in the world, and you are doing everything you can to make as much money as possible in a variety of ways, here is a situation where it's basically not illegal to bet on something where you know the outcome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 2,000 years after a devastating volcanic eruption destroyed and entombed a thriving Roman city, researchers are turning to the novel technique of digital archaeology to reveal the “lost Pompeii.” Some residents fled, while others were killed, trapped by volcanic material. The ghostly ruins, frozen in time, became a tableau that archaeologists have investigated since 1748. But not all of the architectural structures were preserved in Pompeii, leaving researchers with lingering questions about daily life in the ancient, southern Italian city. Now, a sophisticated combination of remote sensing technology, close-range photography and good old-fashioned archaeological techniques are helping researchers pick out once-hidden clues, revealing aspects of Pompeii that have been lost over time — such as towers, symbols of wealth and power, that might have once shaped the cityscape. 4 people sought shelter from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius — and sealed their own fates “By reconstructing the lost architecture, we gain a more nuanced and historically accurate understanding of the ancient city and life within it,” said co-lead study author Dr. Susanne Muth, professor at Humboldt University of Berlin's Institute for Archaeology. During a visit to Pompeii with students in 2022, Muth became inspired by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii's efforts to preserve the city. Aware of the challenges of studying fragile ruins amid fluctuating weather and a changing climate, she proposed an idea to preserve Pompeii's cultural heritage through noninvasive digital reconstruction while gaining knowledge about the ancient city. The Archaeological Park of Pompeii took an interest and teamed up with Humboldt University, which has an archaeology department with a strong digital focus that includes past projects such as a digital reconstruction of the ancient Roman Forum. Other recent explorations of Pompeii's people and architecture also revealed that inhabitants returned to the ruins a few decades after the disaster in in AD 79. Former ground floors became cellars where inhabitants built ovens, mills and fireplaces, which were uncovered earlier this year. There was a lack of interest in those missing top floors, as they were thought to be simple living quarters for Pompeii's slaves and poorer citizens, Muth said. “For many centuries, excavations in Pompeii focused more on finding precious statues and wall paintings,” she noted. DNA analysis upends long-held assumptions about Pompeii victims' final moments But renewed interest came from a desire to understand the everyday lives of ordinary citizens, she added. “When we began to reconstruct this room in terms of its lost architecture, it became clear to us that it could only be a tower,” Muth said. The Casa del Tiaso was one of Pompeii's most lavish homes and probably belonged to an influential family, Zuchtriegel said. It contained large decorative banquet rooms, with one opening up into a garden courtyard and another leading to a private thermal bath complex, Muth noted. Roman writer Pliny the Younger described such a tower in his country villa where he could enjoy the sunrise and sunset, Muth said. But archaeologists haven't looked for evidence of towers within Roman cities such as Pompeii for a good reason: These houses were often built as sprawling structures, rather than tightly clustered multiple-floor dwellings, Muth said. Astrology was popular in Roman society, although several emperors tried to forbid it, Zuchtriegel noted. In ancient Rome, temples and sanctuaries needed clear sight lines for the taking of auspices — interpreting omens from the behavior of birds — and other rituals. While there is clear evidence of upper floor apartments in Pompeii, a high-rise tower in a prestigious home like the House of Thiasos is unprecedented but not far-fetched, he said. “Tower-like structures do appear in Pompeian wall paintings representing urban landscapes, though these have traditionally been dismissed as artistic fantasy driven by the taste for illusionism,” Mogetta said. If accurate, it means those painted scenes may have reflected the real cityscape more closely than we thought.” Digitally reconstructing Pompeii's buildings is like detective work, Muth said. Overlapping images help to create 3D models in a process called photogrammetry. A digital twin of a building is made from the scans and photos, which researchers use to reconstruct the lost architecture, virtually reinserting wooden beams into holes in the wall and following patterns to determine where upper floors or stairs once existed. “We proceed very cautiously, discuss a lot, test a proposal, reject it again, correct it, discover new clues, compare these clues with other buildings in Pompeii to find analogies,” Muth said. Archaeologists have long employed drawings or scaled-down 3D models to reconstruct lost architecture. Digital archaeology takes the process a few steps further, Muth said. It's easy for two-dimensional drawings to contain errors because they can only be checked from one angle. “Only when the building's structural design is precisely recreated digitally in a 3D model can the architecture be understood and a plausible reconstruction developed,” Muth said. Computer game technology is also making 3D models more accessible, allowing for a closer examination of ancient living spaces by creating virtual walk-throughs. Still, questions linger about whether there were more houses in Pompeii that once included towers, and the team continues to search for traces of lost upper floors. “For those who could not take advantage of natural vistas, a tower-like structure was a clever solution — combining spectacle, visibility, and social signaling in one architectural gesture,” Mogetta said. Ancient homes rarely survive the passage of time, especially millennia, and if they do, only fragments like sturdy foundations remain to mark where a residence once stood. For instance, researchers know medieval Italy was filled with towers because some of them still stand today. Over time, new dwellings were built on top of the original homes. “There is evidence of taller buildings if you look for it.” But the wider project has no end date; the team wants to see how many buildings it can virtually reconstruct to preserve Pompeii's heritage. “Digital archaeology is much more than simply creating fanciful reconstructions of ancient buildings,” he said. More than 13,000 rooms have been excavated in the lost city since 1748, with one-third of ancient Pompeii remaining buried under volcanic ash. Insights from recent excavations could inform how researchers understand houses that were first investigated decades or centuries ago, but excavating all of Pompeii isn't the goal, Zuchtriegel said. The archaeological park wants to leave something for future generations. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People of Somali descent in Minnesota have endured a dizzying week. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump called them “garbage” and sent immigration enforcement agents into the state, which is home to the nation's largest Somali diaspora. And yet, the wave of vitriol during the Trump administration's continued nationwide immigration crackdown has been met with an opposing wave of solidarity in Minnesota. State leaders have been quick to publicly embrace the community. In the unfamiliar glare of the national spotlight, Minnesotans with roots from the East African country of Somalia have felt pulled in two directions: singled out by an American president who has called attention to a massive and still-unfolding case of pandemic-era fraud, but embraced by the state that offered them refuge from a vicious and bloody civil war decades ago. Anxiety grips Minneapolis's Somali community as immigration agents zero in on the Twin Cities “It's very unpresidential coming from the commander in chief of the United States to dehumanize … a whole entire community by calling them garbage,” he told CNN Saturday. “I sympathize with them,” he said of the Somali diaspora. Prior to the 1990s, there were very few Somalis living in Minnesota. Millions of residents were displaced or ultimately fled, seeking refuge and asylum. “People had nowhere to go,” said Abdi Ismail Samatar, a distinguished University of Minnesota geography professor, researcher and author who left Somalia 34 years ago. Somalis fled to nearly every continent on the planet, but Minnesota became an epicenter. The immigrants were drawn to the North Star State by job opportunities at meatpacking plants in rural areas where demand for workers far outstripped the supply, said Ahmed Ismail Yusuf, a Minnesota author, writer and playwright who wrote “Somalis in Minnesota.” “They found out that there were other jobs no one was taking, like janitors or in the hospitality industry, car rental agencies, taxi driving,” he said in an interview with CNN. The state's generous offering of social services was another magnet. “That helped the elderly people who had fallen between the cracks, and young people who didn't have anything were able to sustain themselves and put families together,” Samatar said. “So then, the kids who came here in their early teens, in 10 to 15 years, are graduating from high school, from college and became lawyers, doctors, nurses, schoolteachers.” Over the decades, a snowball effect took hold as the Somali diaspora reached a critical mass in Minnesota, pulling in still more friends and relatives from abroad and other US states. Omar also happens to be one of Trump's most frequent foils – he has often targeted her over the years on social media and in public remarks. She was again on Trump's mind days after a report in a journal published by a conservative think tank about the fraud scandal in Minnesota, which involved as much as $300 million and has led to charges against dozens of people, the vast majority of them of Somali descent. Trump had referenced the scandal, which diverted money meant to feed children during the pandemic to fraudsters, a week before Thanksgiving, calling Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” as he announced plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state. Omar responded on X that Trump's “obsession” with her is “creepy.” Around the same time, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants launched in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. In a Thursday news release, DHS said it had arrested 12 “criminal illegal aliens” during what it is calling “Operation Metro Surge” in the Twin Cities. Five of them are from Somalia, according to the statement. Meanwhile, public officials in Minnesota have taken pains to show their solidarity with the Somali community. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara joined an interfaith prayer circle. On Friday, US Sen. Amy Klobuchar appeared at the same place – the Karmel Mall – to show her support; she was thronged by a small but enthusiastic crowd of onlookers, many of whom sought to have their photo taken with her. “As a former prosecutor, I'm strongly in favor of prosecuting those fraud cases,” she told CNN, walking down a corridor that included tailor shops, eateries, cellphone accessory stores and garment boutiques. “However, what the president has done here is indict an entire group of people. Mohamed Ali Hassan, the president of a nonprofit with an office at the mall, condemned Trump's use of the term “garbage,” adding that such dehumanizing terms should never be used to describe people. “An insulting or cursing mouth is on the person who curses.” Taaha Sameru, a board member at the Tawfiq Islamic Center in Minneapolis, said she fled Ethiopia due to political repression. “It is particularly disheartening to witness the prevalence of bigoted views, especially during times of heightened political tension and social unrest,” she said in an email. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of CAIR, said he believes Trump's attacks will ultimately make the state's Somali community stronger. “I think it's giving us a chance for many Americans to learn about the Somali community, and not only that, but also to see the resilience,” he said. “While at the same time, every community looks inside itself and says, ‘We are not going to allow some of our members to do these kinds of things.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans in the Indiana state Senate could give President Donald Trump a major political black eye this week — and the conservative voters who elected them say they don't mind. The state Senate is set to gather Monday to start a weeklong process of considering new congressional maps that could deliver the party a clean sweep of Indiana's nine seats, boosting the GOP's chances of retaining its narrow US House majority in next year's midterm elections. How the week unfolds will test Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray's claim that the party does not have enough votes to pass new maps, despite holding a 40-10 supermajority. Trump and his political allies have turned the Indiana state Senate's vote into a loyalty test with dramatic ramifications — with the president vowing to leverage his political might to oust those who break with his wishes in future primaries, and a number of pro-Trump groups and conservative influencers insisting they'll support those efforts. But those promises don't appear to be generating any kind of groundswell of conservative grassroots support for redistricting in Indiana. CNN visited towns across a swath of the state last week and found that many Republican voters — including those with long histories of supporting Trump — are greeting the redistricting debate with a shrug. Many are like John Badger XIV, the owner of a 106-year-old candy shop in Bray's hometown of Martinsville and a Republican member of the city council: not opposed to Trump's position, but not thinking much about it, either. “But there's no need to redo the maps right now. As for Trump's threats to unseat Bray in a 2028 primary, Badger said there's little chance of succeeding. “I think Rod's doing a great job up there.” The resistance to Trump's demands in Indiana could represent the inkling of some Republican voters' desire for independence from what Trump is dictating for the party, which recently lost two key governor's races and has seen slippage in special elections. It comes after the House forced Trump's hand on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, and a long-time Trump ally, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, made a dramatic break from the president and then announced her resignation. In the Indiana redistricting fight, outside groups — including the conservative Club for Growth led by former Indiana congressman David McIntosh, the Charlie Kirk-founded Turning Point USA, and a new organization led by veteran Indiana Republican operative Marty Obst and veterans of Trump's campaigns — have spent months heaping pressure on Republican senators, including advertisements urging constituents to contact key legislators. Many state senators say they've also faced violent threats, including swatting attempts and bomb threats on their homes or businesses. Ahead of the Senate's expected vote next week, CNN spoke to about 50 voters across the districts of four Republican state senators. Jean Leising and Greg Walker, are opposed to new maps, while Sen. Cyndi Carrasco has not weighed in publicly but is widely expected to vote for new maps. Bray, meanwhile, has been in the crosshairs of Trump, who has threatened to support a primary opponent in 2028, and Braun, who has publicly floated supporting a challenge for Bray's post as the Senate leader. Those conversations underscored two political realities: Rank-and-file Republicans in this deep-red state generally haven't soured on Trump. But they aren't rushing into battle for him, either — and they don't think this issue will be top of mind when they cast their votes in a state Senate primary. Unseating Bray over his position on redistricting “would be ridiculous,” said Debbie Myers, a Republican who co-owns Berries & Ivy, a home goods store in Martinsville. “It's ridiculous to bring the whole thing up to begin with, but it's what the president wants,” she said. Myers said she believes Bray — who has insisted there aren't enough Republican votes in the Senate to pass new maps — is “just being very honest” about the political reality. “His daddy taught him well,” she said, referring to Bray's father, Richard, who was a state senator. He's saying, ‘We don't have the numbers. Karen Luther, who works at Fables & Fairy Tales, a children's bookstore, said she is a conservative Republican who supports Trump even though he “is not a Boy Scout.” She's not opposed to redistricting, because she said she sees it as a tit-for-tat across the political map. “Everybody acts like this is some horrible thing. The Democrats go in there, they try to do it. “They probably should just either outlaw it completely or just shut up and let each one do it when they get in there.” “No, I'm not all in a dither,” she said. I would not want to get rid of him,” she said. “He seems like a man of integrity and honor. One issue that came up in interviews with Indiana voters of all political stripes is the violent threats some state senators say they have faced. Many voters who spoke with CNN said they did not want to be named because they feared being vocal about the issue could also subject them to threats. “It's scary, what you see on the news.” She opposes redistricting in part, she said in a statement, because only a tiny fraction of her constituents who have contacted her support new maps. It's a sentiment other state senators, including Vaneta Becker of Evansville, have shared with CNN. Sen. Kyle Walker, a moderate Republican from the northeastern Indianapolis suburbs who also opposes redistricting, similarly said his constituents are broadly opposed to new maps, and announced this week he will not run for reelection in 2026. “Everyone is just really concerned about the temperature,” said Catherine Chmiel-Goetzinger, who manages an art gallery in Greensburg. “It's gotten to a point where even a Republican is getting that kind of attention, just for doing her job. Jonas Brock, who works at a holiday goods store in Greensburg, said she supports Trump but isn't interested in the redistricting fight. I just don't think it's that important, with everything else going on in the world,” she said. And other Republicans said that while redistricting might not be decisive, it's something they would weigh when thinking about state Senate primaries. Chris Robbins, who owns a sporting goods store in Greensburg, said breaking with Trump on redistricting, as Leising has, “would make me look to somebody else.” You've got to look at the overall picture,” he said. “I mean, that's the reason we voted for Trump, was his agenda.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jasmine Crockett has two cashier's checks made out to use on Monday: one to submit if she files for reelection for her US House seat, the other to jump into the already competitive Texas Democratic primary for US Senate. She's invited hundreds of people to an announcement event Monday that's scheduled 90 minutes before she needs to submit one of the checks. Asked when she'll decide, Crockett told CNN in an extensive interview on Friday between working the phones and meeting with supporters back home, “Hopefully, it will be early that day.” She asked Colin Allred, her former House colleague making a second Senate run after losing in 2024, to drop out and run for governor instead as part of a slate that would also have Rep. Joaquin Castro run for state attorney general. She's frequently cited a poll, including to James Talarico, the state representative who entered the Senate race in September, that shows her in strong shape, though people familiar with that poll say its conclusions are drawn from a sample of just 600 people. Crockett and Rep. Marc Veasey, a fellow Dallas Democrat dealing with the gerrymandered breakup of his current seat, have already discussed sequencing on Monday for him to file in her district shortly after she submits her Senate paperwork. And she's talked with Stacey Abrams, the two-time failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate, about expanding the electorate in a longtime red state that turned purple. Crockett, a 44-year-old former state representative and civil rights lawyer, has become one of the most talked about Democrats in the country through her viral takedowns of Republicans, a Black woman who's always ready to rip President Donald Trump and fire back when he questions her intelligence. The fighter persona that's appealed to so many disillusioned Democrats now has many of them, and Crockett herself, thinking that it's exactly what the Senate race needs. But for all those who believe Crockett brings the fundraising ability and energy needed to seriously contend in a long-shot race, there are those who fear she is setting up the latest example of classic Texas Democratic self-immolation. If she runs statewide, Crockett will almost certainly energize Republicans who will be reminded of her blunders, like calling Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, “Gov. Hot Wheels” or  accusing several GOP figures of taking campaign contributions from what turned out to be a Jeffrey Epstein but not the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A wave of Republican voters turning out against her could take down not just Democrats running for US House seats in newly redrawn districts but also state legislative candidates trying to stop a future gerrymander. To some Democrats, this seems like a classic case of the party seeing a potential Republican disaster it could take advantage of, then laying the groundwork for the Democrats' own disaster. Democrats haven't won statewide in Texas since 1994, a three-decade streak including failures by Beto O'Rourke and Wendy Davis, who both became national causes and lost anyway. This time, Republicans have a vicious primary featuring four-term incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Rep. Wesley Hunt, who are spending millions ripping one another apart and are likely to emerge from the March 3 primary having to go to a top-two runoff election in May. If Paxton eventually wins, as many observers expect, Democrats will have an opposition researcher's dream of material against the controversial attorney general: now-closed federal and state investigations, a Republican-led impeachment attempt, and a messy public divorce. “You've got two highly intelligent, very articulate, very prominent persons running in a race that we never thought we had a chance to win but now we do,” one senior Texas Democrat told CNN. Over a 45-minute conversation on Friday, Crockett expressed annoyance at accusations that she's just barreling into the race. Even when I go in to help candidates in other states, I ask them, have you polled for me?” she said. Crockett knows about the opposition research already circulating on her, with past quotes labeled “divisive comments that call into question her electability in a statewide race in Texas.” She argues her profile and politics might be the way to actually put the seat, and with it the Republican Senate majority, in play by turning out voters particularly in Black and Latino communities who'd otherwise stay home. “I agree that we don't need a messy primary. “It would be because different people in their minds have different ways about how and why they would be successful.” She's trying to figure out whether she would be starting from a workable position given how much she's embraced being a partisan lightning rod, whether in committee fights with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or in frequent cable appearances. “We also had to test for the fact that I not only have high name ID, but the reason that my name ID is high, right? Calling Marjorie ‘Bleach Blonde' may work nationally,” Crockett said. An October poll had Crockett leading a hypothetical four-way primary with her, Allred, Talarico and O'Rourke, who was considering a run but has since passed. “There's a real shot she wins the primary,” said another Texas Democratic official who asked not to be named to provide a candid assessment of the race. “But I think she's our least competitive general election candidate.” “If she's going to get in, that's because Colin and Talarico haven't sucked up all the oxygen, and her polling is showing that there's a whole lot of people out there — not the insiders, but Democratic voters — who would be with her,” Carroll Robinson, a former Houston city councilman and chair of the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats, told CNN. This kind of pileup is exactly what prominent Democrats were trying to avoid when a group of them — Allred, Talarico, Castro and O'Rourke — quietly huddled earlier this year. In 2018, when O'Rourke came up less than 3 points short of beating Sen. Ted Cruz, he was the only competitive statewide Democrat. That meant Abbott and other Republicans could use their campaign funds to boost Cruz. “What if we had a ticket of well-known, well-funded people?” a third person familiar with the meeting recalled to CNN. But Abbott had more than $80 million raised already to seek his fourth term. Allred felt that his 2024 Senate run was an argument for a second chance. Allred and Talarico went on to enter the Senate race. O'Rourke thought about running for Senate anyway but has decided to focus on his group, which is trying to recruit Democratic candidates into races across the state and build up grassroots support. Castro, who's been gaining seniority in the House and could get a committee chairmanship if Democrats win back a majority, opted to stay focused on Washington. “Ideally, if you were gonna design the strongest possible chances of winning, you would design it so that you have strong candidates that are well-funded in each of those races,” Castro said at the Texas Tribune Festival last month. While the group briefly talked about reaching out to her about running for attorney general, that was news to her. While declining comment on any of her private calls, she told CNN that not having one “does make it a lot more difficult. And then I just don't think that you can rely on one person to have enough cross-appeal to everybody.” An Allred spokesman told CNN he “already endorsed Gina Hinojosa — he's not running for governor.” A Talarico spokesman said he's “100% in the race for Senate” and pointed to a surge in fundraising, volunteer recruitment and poll numbers. Crockett has talked to leaders in her Dallas-area district and weighed what it would mean if she lost a Senate race and, as she told CNN, “the possibility of my voice being absent during the second half of a Trump presidency.” But she also believes running statewide could boost Texas Democrats both next year and in 2028. It may not be the normal way that people work.</p>

The National Park Service updated its free-admission calendar, adding free entry for President Donald Trump's birthday but removing Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth from the list. 

The Department of the Interior announced last month the new free-entry days at national parks, designating them as “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.” Under the Biden administration, NPS included MLK Jr. Day and Juneteenth among its free-entry days.

The move comes as the Trump administration works to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives nationwide. 

In April, NPS faced backlash for removing content from its website about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad and later restored it. 

The park changes are part of the Trump administration's “modernization” of park services. Recently, the Interior Department unveiled the “America-first” initiative, which would require foreign tourists without an annual pass to pay $100 extra per person at 11 of the most visited national parks. 

“President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a press release. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.” 

Non-U.S. residents will still need to pay on entry-free days, the press release added. 

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ROLLS OUT NEW FEES FOR FOREIGN TOURISTS AT NATIONAL PARKS

In addition to including Trump's birthday, which is also Flag Day, as a new free-entry day, NPS also added July 4 weekend, the 110th birthday of NPS, and former President Theodore Roosevelt's birthday. 

The 2026 free-entry days include President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/Trump's birthday on June 14, July 4 weekend, 110th birthday of NPS on Aug. 25, Constitution Day on Sept. 17, Roosevelt's birthday on Oct. 27, and Veterans Day.</p>
