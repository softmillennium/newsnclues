                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistan accelerates its crypto regulatory push as Binance leadership meets top government and military officials. Pakistan's crypto market shows sharp activity over the last 30 days despite ongoing volatility, and the country now moves closer to a full regulatory structure. The engagements show that Pakistan seeks structure, clarity, and global alignment as it transitions from an unregulated environment toward a regulated market. PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib presides over the core discussions and outlines progress made by his newly formed authority. His briefing includes updates on licensing, market surveillance systems, and the country's attempts to bring crypto service providers under a unified national standard. Pakistan wants a clear framework that supports financial innovation and ensures investor safety. The government views digital assets as a sector that can help modernize payment systems and expand financial inclusion. Saqib confirms that Pakistan studies stablecoin models and explores the creation of a state-backed digital currency as part of its broader modernization plan. Pakistan has already unveiled its first strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, which shows the government's intent to participate in global digital finance. Saqib mentions that CBDC discussions continue as the country assesses long-term benefits for settlement, security, and cross-border transactions. These discussions evolve as Pakistan gains momentum in retail user activity, exchange use, and overall adoption. The country sits ahead of global economies like China, Germany, and Japan. These rankings show strong local engagement and broad national interest. From a recent tweet, Binance reveals that Pakistani users trade over $250 billion in crypto each year. The platform hosts nearly 17.5 million registered Pakistani users with digital asset holdings worth about $5 billion. Analysts estimate that about 20 to 40 million citizens hold crypto in some form, a figure that highlights the scale of adoption and the urgency for clear regulation. Pakistan now aims to convert raw adoption into a structured and regulated ecosystem. The country invited exchanges and virtual asset service providers to apply for licenses in September. Saqib states that Pakistan wants to turn its rapid adoption into a global model for responsible growth. Pakistan stands at a pivotal moment as it balances mass adoption with regulatory clarity. The visit from Binance's top leadership signals global recognition of Pakistan's market size and growing influence. The government now seeks to create a transparent, innovation-driven environment that protects investors and strengthens long-term market stability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Right now, the message is simple and compelling,” he recently told Decrypt. He added: “We know that market periods of significant decline represent buying opportunities for long-term investors. The co-founder of Edelman Financial Engines—a nearly $300 billion asset manager—had previously advocated for “low single-digits” investments in crypto, but said he had been swayed by “dramatically improved regulatory clarity and institutional engagement in crypto.” He said that institutional investors' ongoing optimism about cryptocurrencies and the widening adoption of blockchain networks underpinning these assets trumped concerns about crypto markets' price swoon. “We are seeing massive levels of engagement and adoption, not just by traditional finance, but the entire Fortune 500,” Edelman said. “This can only serve to support and increase prices over the next several years.” Cantor Slashes Strategy Price Target By 59%, Remains 'Long-Term Bullish' on Bitcoin Giant Edelman called current price trends “routine” and no different than for other assets vulnerable to wider forces that prompt investors to take profits after lengthy price climbs. In his white paper, Edelman predicted that Bitcoin would reach a $19 trillion market capitalization—up more than 955% from its current value of nearly $1.8 trillion—and that given rising life expectancies, even 90-year olds should consider exposure to digital assets with their decisions based on risk tolerance, not age. He said that Bitcoin's struggles are, if anything, a sign of its maturing. “It's testimony to the fact that being lumped together with all other asset classes demonstrates better than ever that Bitcoin has become a mainstream asset, and that institutional investors are now treating Bitcoin the same way they're treating everything else,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump took office early this year, with at least part of his 2024 election victory thanks to voters who took to heart campaign promises about a crypto-friendly administration. So far, the Trump administration has indeed taken decisive pro-crypto steps, including signing an executive order rescinding Biden-era policies, establishing the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, and prohibiting a U.S. CBDC. Trump also established a strategic bitcoin reserve, though he disappointed some in deciding that the reserve will be funded with seized bitcoin, rather than fresh purchases. Digital assets and blockchain technology, however, received zero mention in Trump's latest national security strategy. Instead, artificial intelligence, biotech, and quantum computing are highlighted as keys to U.S. tech leadership. "We want to ensure that U.S. technology and U.S. standards — particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing — drive the world forward," the national security strategy statement released Friday said. The omission could mean that President Trump and the U.S. establishment as a whole remain reluctant to see crypto as anything beyond just another financial asset rather than something that could give America a strategic edge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin continues to dominate the market with a 59.6% share, and its recent struggle to hold bullish momentum has not translated into any meaningful boost for altcoins. Meanwhile, a critical indication has been detected from on-chain data that suggests this may be a rare moment to accumulate strong altcoin positions before conditions eventually turn. Altcoin performance has really been lagging behind Bitcoin throughout this year, and the persistent weakness is now being reflected across multiple market indicators. The wait for an altcoin breakout has now stretched far longer than many anticipated. Even as the Bitcoin price is struggling, traders have not redirected liquidity toward altcoins. The leading cryptocurrency is now down by 28.9% from its October all-time high of $126,080. Instead, altcoins have also stayed muted, and their combined market cap shows no signs of outperforming the leading cryptocurrency. Data from CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index shows the reading is currently at 20. The low reading shows that altcoins are still losing ground relative to Bitcoin. Readings this low signal hesitation across the market, as investors shy away from taking new positions, and this environment makes an altcoin season much harder to materialize. Technical analysis using data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that altcoin traders may be entering another window that has frequently been favorable for accumulation. The data compares the 30-day trading volume of altcoins against their yearly average and finds that current volumes have slipped back below that long-term line. Each time this pattern has appeared in past cycles, it marked a period when activity was unusually quiet and traders were hesitant, but it also tended to show up just before the market picked up again. According to the analysis, this drop in volume can be called a “buying zone,” which is a phase where dollar-cost averaging into selective altcoins has often paid off over time. These low-volume stretches can last for weeks or even months, giving investors enough room to build their positions gradually. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WisdomTree (WT) just rolled out its Equity Premium Income Digital Fund, pairing a traditional put write strategy with blockchain based tokenization, and that mix is exactly what has investors rechecking their assumptions on the stock. The launch of the digital premium income fund comes as WisdomTree's 1 day share price return of 1.86 percent and 7 day share price return of 4.08 percent hint that sentiment is stabilising after a tougher 90 day stretch. If this kind of innovation has your attention, it could be a good moment to explore fast growing stocks with high insider ownership as you hunt for the next wave of high conviction ideas. With shares pulling back over 90 days but still trading nearly 30 percent below consensus targets, is WisdomTree quietly cheap after its latest digital fund launch, or is the market already pricing in the next leg of growth? Against a last close of $11.49, the most followed narrative points to a fair value near $14.79, implying meaningful upside if its assumptions play out. The continued global shift from active to passive investing remains a powerful driver for WisdomTree's core ETF business, as evidenced by broad-based net inflows, growing international scale, and record AUM, which should translate to higher revenue and improved operating leverage. Curious how double digit growth, rising margins, and a lower future earnings multiple can still support upside from here? However, rising fee compression and potential setbacks in digital asset regulation could quickly erode margins and challenge the growth reflected in this valuation. Find out about the key risks to this WisdomTree narrative. On simple earnings maths, WisdomTree looks less clear cut. That gap suggests a modest valuation risk rather than an obvious bargain, especially if growth expectations or sentiment cool. Investors need to decide whether the digital and buyback story is strong enough to keep the multiple from sliding toward that lower fair ratio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is stabilizing above a key support zone after recent losses, but analysts warn that the next move hinges on sustained volume and successful EMA retests. Maintaining this level could influence the next resistance tests around $3,400–$3,500. ETH/USD has been in a corrective downtrend on the daily chart, with recent price action approaching a supply zone between $3,500 and $3,700. Supply zones represent areas where selling pressure historically outweighs buying, often causing price consolidation or pullbacks. ETH/USD shows short-term bullish momentum toward $3.3k–$3.4k, but a drop below $2.95k could revisit $2.8k lows. A successful EMA reclaim often signals that buyers are regaining control, while failure to hold can indicate potential weakness. A breakout from the prior trading range, accompanied by elevated volume, suggests possible continuation, but analysts note the rally remains corrective rather than impulsive. ETH holds short-term support near $2,964–$2,957 but faces key resistance at the 100- and 200-day EMAs ($3,013–$3,206). Market commentator Jainam Mehta, “The chart shows cleaner higher-low formations on both the 4-hour and daily charts.” Higher-low patterns are significant because they indicate that buyers are entering on dips, providing incremental support for potential upward movement. Historically, these EMAs have served as supply zones during prior rallies. Further declines could extend toward $2,800–$2,720, particularly if high leverage accelerates selling pressure. Analysts emphasize that these levels provide structural reference points but warn that short-term volatility may create false signals, such as EMA whipsaws or liquidity sweeps. The Fusaka upgrade, activated on December 3, improves Layer 2 settlements and lowers node costs, offering some fundamental support. According to on-chain data provider Glassnode, Ethereum has recovered approximately 45% from November lows. Spot market inflows also indicate renewed interest, with ETH registering $58.10 million in net inflows on December 3—the largest in over a month. Derivatives data show rising open interest totaling $38.34 billion, suggesting that institutional and high-volume traders are positioning for potential volatility. However, these metrics carry dual interpretations: while they indicate accumulation, they may also imply an elevated risk of liquidation if the price reverses suddenly. Market participants should consider potential macroeconomic factors, the pace of Ethereum network upgrades, and competition from other smart contract platforms. Even with technical and fundamental support, outcomes can diverge significantly based on adoption trends, regulatory developments, and broader crypto market sentiment. Short-term scenarios suggest that ETH could approach $3,400–$3,500 if support around $3,050 holds. Key resistance at $3,500–$3,700 will determine whether the rally extends. Traders should also monitor volume confirmation, EMA behavior, and market positioning. ETH/USD bounces toward $3,500–$3,700 resistance, with support at $2,400–$2,550; a break higher targets $4,400–$4,800, while rejection risks $1,400–$1,000. Risk management is crucial in this environment, as algorithmic trading and leverage could magnify price swings. Analysts recommend tracking both structural signals (EMA clusters, support/resistance zones, higher-lows) and short-term noise (liquidity sweeps, sudden inflow spikes) to distinguish reliable trends. Ethereum currently shows tentative signs of stabilization, with short-term support holding near $3,050 and technical indicators improving. Investors and traders are advised to watch for sustained closes above key EMAs, monitor supply zones, and assess liquidity trends. While early accumulation is evident, the broader market trend remains cautious, underscoring the need for disciplined risk management and vigilance against potential volatility.
