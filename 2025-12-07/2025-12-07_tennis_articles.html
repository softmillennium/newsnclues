                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Measured, thoughtful and quietly driven, Martin Landaluce carries the aura of a young player shaped not only by talent but by the powerful influences around him. It is here, on these pristine courts, that much of his growth has taken place. A former US Open boys' singles champion and now a two-time ATP Challenger Tour titlist, Landaluce credits part of his progress to a unique apprenticeship few players his age experience: training with Rafael Nadal himself. “On this first court is where I practised with [Nadal] several times,” Landaluce said, looking over the courts in Mallorca. “We talk about things normally no one asks you,” Landaluce said. “But he doesn't have a filter, so if he wants to ask you that he is going to do it and I like that from him and I admire him. It is good to do that reflection.” Family has also played a defining role in Landaluce's journey. His father, Alejandro, still competes on the ITF Seniors Tour, while both his siblings share the same competitive fire. Their unity was once captured in a story almost too improbable to believe. “I think that is very, very difficult and rare in the history of tennis.” If Landaluce's path has been shaped by family and mentorship, Alexander Blockx's story begins with sibling rivalry and the moment a young boy realised he wanted to be on the court, not just watching from the side. “I used to sit on the bench and watch a lot, what my brother was doing,” the 20-year-old Belgian said. My coach asked me if I wanted to try and at first I was a bit shy, and then eventually I started hitting and it was so nice and I had the feeling instantly.” That early spark has evolved into a dynamic, forward-leaning style that powered Blockx to two ATP Challenger Tour titles this season and a place at the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. “I am pretty quick for my height,” said World No. “I can attack really well from my forehand. Philippe Cassiers, his coach since childhood, has been guiding him for 16 years, a rarity in the modern game. “We have known each other for 16 years now. We are enjoying the process.” Watch Episode 2 of Journey to Jeddah now, and follow both Landaluce and Blockx as they take aim at the title at the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held in Jeddah from 17–21 December. “We talk about things normally no one asks you,” Landaluce said. “But he doesn't have a filter, so if he wants to ask you that he is going to do it and I like that from him and I admire him.
