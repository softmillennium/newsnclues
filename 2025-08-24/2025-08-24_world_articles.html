                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, tanks shelled houses and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown up in the northern area of Jabaliya. Other residents said they would prefer to die and not leave. A few thousand have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws. “I stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave my home in Gaza City,” Mohammad, 40, told Reuters. “No place is safe, but I can't take the risk. Others said they would not leave, despite the explosions. “We are not leaving, let them bomb us at home,” said Aya, 31, who had a family of eight, adding that they could not afford to buy a tent or pay for the transportation, even if they did try to leave. “We are hungry, afraid and don't have money.” Israel approved a plan earlier this month for an expanded military offensive to seize control of Gaza City. Still, Israeli forces have bombed the city and surrounding areas, and said on Sunday that forces had returned to combat in the Jabaliya area in recent days. Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. On Friday, Katz said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas militants agreed to end the war on Israel's terms and release all the hostages it still holds. Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel's plan to take over Gaza City showed it was not serious about a ceasefire. UN-backed experts declared on Friday that an “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza's largest city and its surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten increasing deaths across the devastated territory. On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people had died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war started. Israel is fighting allegations at the world's top court of committing genocide in Gaza, where it has killed more than 60,000 people. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. The Associated Press reported that Israeli forces had killed four people seeking food aid on Sunday as they travelled through a military zone south of Gaza City – an area regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point. The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian troops have liberated three front-line villages in Donetsk Oblast from occupying Russian forces, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Aug. 24, Ukraine's Independence Day. Syrskyi's report followed a working visit to combat zones in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has steadily gained ground in recent months, particularly near the embattled logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian forces "successfully counterattacked and cleared" the villages of Zelenyi Hai, Mykhailivka, and Volodymyrivka, Syrskyi said in a social media post published by Ukraine's General Staff. "(D)efending Ukrainian independence and the Ukrainian flag is not just empty words, but a daily risk and a daily feat," Syrskyi said. The three liberated villages are all located south of Pokrovsk. Russian troops are trying to close in on the Ukrainian pocket around Pokrovsk, an area of approximately 16 kilometers wide (around 10 miles), according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. Ukrainian troops have liberated the villages of Zelenyi Hai, Mykhailivka, and Volodymyrivka, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on Aug. 24. Zelensky's statement follows a recent report by the Wall Street Journal saying that the U.S. has quietly implemented a review process giving Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authority to bar Ukrainian long-range strikes inside Russia with American missiles. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down Monday's meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which came just a few days after Trump's Aug. 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the defense ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia, as well as the U.K. Minister for Veterans Affairs, are also in Ukraine for Independence Day. Ukraine shot down a total of 48 drones, while a missile and 24 Shahed attack drones struck 10 locations, the Air Force said, without specifying the targets. But I will say it figuratively, we are at a distance of 10 kilometers and have passed, maybe, the first 200 meters, no more. In response to concerns over airspace safety, Russia's federal aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, temporarily suspended operations at multiple airports in major cities of the Volga and Central regions of European Russia—including Izhevsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Penza, Tambov, and Ulyanovsk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As White House moves to militarize more cities, Hakeem Jeffries says president is ‘playing' with Americans' lives Jeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular.” He continued: “I strongly support the statement that was issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there's no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago.” The White House has been working on plans to send national guard to Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants, the Washington Post reported. Pritzker issued a statement on Saturday night that began: “The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.” Trump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation's capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities, has actually plummeted. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the president insisted that “the people in Chicago are screaming for us to come” as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later “help with New York”. California sued the federal government when it deployed national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June over protests against Ice raids, but a court refused to block the troops. Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas. He added about Trump's agenda: “He gave his speech in Iowa, he said ‘I hate' Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” The speech was in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagship legislation of the second Trump administration so far that focuses on tax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts for the anti-immigration agenda and benefits cuts to programs such as Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story was first reported and published by National Catholic Reporter Numerous officials within the Roman Catholic religious order known as the Jesuits struggled in the 1970s and 1980s over how to deal with a man whom they knew molested children – but nonetheless was ordained a priest, according to a review of internal correspondence concerning his career. It provides a rare, complex, behind-the-scenes look at how local leaders during a much earlier phase of the worldwide Catholic church's ongoing clergy molestation scandal struggled to contain a predator priest's repeated abuse of children while encouraging him to seek psychological help. In 1974, Jesuit priest Anthony McGinn – who would later serve as the New Orleans high school's president – described Dickerson as lazy and manipulative. “He does whatever he pleases,” McGinn wrote in a character appraisal that is now an exhibit in the court case, which seeks damages from Loyola and the Jesuit order. “This is a dangerous sign that the Society will have difficulties with him in future years.” Dickerson should not be advanced to theology, the next level in formation, concluded McGinn, who did not respond to a request for comment. Despite the negative appraisal, Dickerson went to theology instruction in Chicago. In March 1975, during a six-hour meeting attended by multiple priests and a brother at the Jesuit provincials' office to discuss several clergy, Jesuit priest Louis Lambert, the vice-provincial for formation and a top Jesuit in the region, held that Dickerson “was making great progress in working through his problems” – and that a recent psychological report on him was “positive”. By 1977, concerns from high-ranking Jesuit priest Thomas Stahel had reached a crisis point. The provincial of the Jesuits' former New Orleans province, Stahel had learned of yet another accusation that Dickerson had harassed a minor. Five days before Christmas that year, the provincial, who would later serve as executive editor at America magazine, detailed specific misgivings about Dickerson in a lengthy letter to the Jesuits' worldwide leader at the time, superior general Pedro Arrupe. “I recommend that Dickerson's ordination be postponed, at the very least, and that we raise with him a question about his staying in the Society.” According to the letter, Arrupe had already agreed that Dickerson's ordination should be postponed. It is unclear whether Arrupe responded to this letter. Αccording to a 1977 letter, Dickerson's Jesuit superiors believed that his “psychosexual problem was under sufficient control”. Yet Stahel, who details serious concerns regarding Dickerson's “suitability” for the priesthood, found himself at an impasse with Lambert. “He thinks Dickerson is no more a risk than others who have been ordained, and he characterizes the recent incident as a regrettable slip. I am unpersuaded by his reasons,” Stahel wrote to the superior general. “I have the distinct impression that Fr [Father] Lambert's resistance in this matter had to do, not with the merits of his case, but with the jealous guard he maintains over his Vice-Provincial's prerogatives,” Stahel wrote. Describing the disagreement, Stahel alleged that Lambert considered Dickerson's improper behavior to be the result of nerves – and rejected Arrupe's move to postpone ordination as unjust “strong-arm tactics”. Lambert, Stahel said, “argued that, once a man is approved for ordination by the Society (as Dickerson had been), the Society is committed to him. In September 1978, Arrupe said in a letter to Lambert that he had received a psychological report on Dickerson, but the details of that report were not readily available. Dickerson had received psychological treatment at least twice by then – in 1975 and 1978. He later noted that he had submitted to “extensive psychological therapy” at Foundation House, a former treatment facility for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico. Dickerson had still not been ordained by the summer of 1979, when Stahel said Dickerson had told him that sexually harassing an underage boy was “a relatively insignificant incident”. “I did not feel that I could ordain him until we had removed as much as possible any worries that such incidents would happen again,” Stahel wrote. But Stahel's worries about Dickerson had apparently subsided by the end of that year, after Dickerson understood the “scandal” molesting children could cause. Six months later, on 7 June 1980, Dickerson was ordained by Birmingham, Alabama, bishop Joseph Vath. Dickerson began teaching at the boys Jesuit preparatory school in Dallas that same year. That year, Stahel had written to Dickerson with the hope “nothing would happen in Shreveport”. Two years later, in an August 1984 letter to Dickerson, Jesuit priest Edmundo Rodriguez, the new provincial in New Orleans, noted that he had “a duty to protect the Society and the Church from unacceptable behavior of its members”. During Dickerson's evaluation, he said that he had been molested by a man at age six, according to clinical notes included in the most recent New Orleans lawsuit. “Recently he was rejected by his natural father,” the woman said of her son. “Instead of help from Fr Dickerson, he has been mentally damaged even further.” She added that Dickerson should never work near children again. Dickerson's Jesuit superiors assigned him to Loyola University New Orleans in 1985. There, the New Orleans lawsuit alleges, he abused another minor. Yet Dickerson maintained the support of his direct superior even while facing an investigation. But in early March 1986, after Rodriguez received three separate allegations against Dickerson in one week, the provincial encouraged him to leave the priesthood “to save everyone from a very painful process”. On 12 March 1986, Rodriguez wrote that he had contacted Jesuit priest Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then the order's superior general, requesting that Dickerson be dismissed from the society and priestly life. And a former Jesuit Dallas student sued the school in 2019, alleging Dickerson gave him alcohol and raped him during a trip to Alabama decades prior. During his 18 years as Jesuit superior general, Arrupe emerged as a widely respected leader, beloved by the men's religious community at the time of his resignation in 1983, two years after a disabling stroke. Attorneys Richard Trahant, John Denenea and Soren Giselson, who represent the plaintiff in the New Orleans lawsuit centering on Dickerson, argue Arrupe should not be considered for sainthood. While Arrupe, as superior general, could have stopped Dickerson's ordination, biographies and statements from Arrupe show that he opposed an authoritarian style of leadership of the Jesuit order. If local Jesuit officials decided to ordain Dickerson, it is unclear whether Arrupe would have stepped in to stop it – or if he had all the facts supporting such a decision. “At this point, we don't know whether this might rather be a case of superiors following the accepted procedures of that time,” she said. But, she added, that explanation does not justify their actions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After winning the National Bank Open women's singles title in Montreal, Victoria Mboko is heading to the U.S. open to continue her stunning ascent.David Kirouac/Reuters Canadian teen Victoria Mboko captivated tennis – and the country – when she defeated Naomi Osaka to win the National Bank Open women's singles title earlier this month, and now she's looking to continue her meteoric rise at her first U.S. Open. She is Canada's first tournament champion since Bianca Andreescu ended this country's 50-year drought in 2019. Now, the highest-ranked Canadian woman in tennis, Mboko's first World Tennis Association tournament title has secured her a spot in the Grand Slam's main draw, where she's hoping to keep her winning streak going. Here's everything you need to know about Mboko as she prepares for her debut in the U.S. Open's main draw. Victoria Mboko beat four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka at the National Bank Open in Montreal. When she was two months old, the family moved to Toronto, where Mboko and her three older siblings – who all played tennis as well – grew up watching the sport at Sobeys Stadium. Mboko, who will turn 19 during the U.S. Open on Aug. 26, began playing tennis at age 4 and started competing at an early age, but one early victory had a lasting impact on her career. After her first International Tennis Federation pro tournament win in 2022, she personally thanked the man whose donation made it possible. Opinion: For my father, Victoria Mboko's victory is a decade-long tennis dream come true “My main focus is now to compete primarily in the professional pro tournaments to get my pro ranking up and one day become world No. That same year, agents came calling as she rose to prominence in juniors and made two Grand Slam junior doubles finals at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Mboko has blossomed on the pro circuit this season, and has sped through the lower rungs that take most young players years. In January and February, she won four ITF titles, securing 22 consecutive match victories without dropping a set, before she made her WTA-1000 singles main draw debut at the Miami Open in March. After training much of last year at the Justine Henin Academy in Belgium, Mboko wanted to return home, and has been coached by Nathalie Tauziat and Noëlle van Lottum since November, 2024. Tauziat is a French former player who reached No. A Dutch-French former player and coach, van Lottum has been working as the head women's national coach for Tennis Canada in Montreal since 2023. Mboko kisses the National Bank Open trophy on Aug. 7.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press 24 in the WTA Rankings after her National Bank Open victory, an incredible ascent from No. Her victory also made her the youngest player in the Open Era to defeat four Grand Slam champions in a single tournament – Osaka, Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff and Sofia Kenin – since 17-year-old Serena Williams did it at the 1999 U.S. Open. Victoria Mboko tries to stay grounded as her career takes off But Mboko says she is trying not to let the fact she won a WTA Masters 1000-level tournament – one rung below a Grand Slam – or the rising expectations get to her. “I don't like to put pressure or set goals for myself, because anything can happen, and I'm okay with it. That's sports,” she told The Globe after her win in Montreal. Thanks to her victory in Montreal, Mboko's ranking has earned her a spot as one of the 32 seeded players in the Grand Slam's main draw, and she did not need to play any qualifying matches. “But [the NBO win] definitely brings a lot of ease to my draw, because I don't have to play [qualifiers], and I could play slightly later.” The Montreal victory also gives her extra time to rest her body, including a wrist she injured during her semi-final win over Elena Rybakina and later aggravated during the final win against Osaka. The U.S. Open is shaping up to be a thrilling tournament with 19 individual Grand Slam champions and five Canadians already seeded in the men's and women's singles main draws. 31, and will face qualifying player Yulia Putintseva in the first round. In the men's singles draw, there are three Canadians seeded: Félix Auger-Aliassime (No. Diallo will face Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday at 11 a.m., while Shapovalov takes on Márton Fucsovics of Hungary, also at 11 a.m. Sunday. Compatriot Liam Draxl vied for a spot in the qualifying round but fell to France's Kyrian Jacquet. Among the former Grand Slam champions competing are reigning U.S. Open singles champs and world No. 1s Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, who will be looking to defend their titles from a field of fierce challengers, including No. After a life-changing run, Mboko took home US$752,275 at the National Bank Open – nearly double what she's made in prize money in her whole career so far. Mboko couldn't think of anything she'd like to buy with the money when asked by The Globe after her NBO win. I believe she has an exceptional backhand, like way above normal,” Guillaume Marx, Tennis Canada's vice-president of high performance, told The Globe earlier this summer, “and then she has the mentality, the belief.” In Montreal, Mboko was lauded for her mental toughness, as she beat players with more experience, rebounded after losing the first set of matches, fought back in games that looked lost and battled through pain in her wrist. And I think she has that in her, and ... we can see that right now, just by how composed she is,” said tournament director Valerie Tétreault. According to Mboko, she gets it from her “very calm” father. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

MOSCOW, August 24. /TASS/. India and Russia are not experiencing any problems in payment for oil imports, India's ambassador to Russia Vinay Kumar said in an interview with TASS.

"India and Russia have a working system of trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment for oil imports," he said.

Director General and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO) Ajay Sahai told TASS earlier that there were billions of rupees in Indian banks belonging to Russian exporters. He did not give a specific amount though. Trade with Russia in Indian rupees was still ongoing, the FIEO chief added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This is the transcript of President Volodymyr Zelensky's address released by the President's Office on Aug. 24, 2025, Ukraine's 34rd Independence Day. I am here now, in the heart of Kyiv, on Independence Square. And it is here that one can truly feel what independence means, why it is so important to us, and why Maidan is far more than just the main square of the country. It is a place where history is always being made, where the energy and strength of our people are born in times when independence is under threat. And now, in a full-scale war for independence, it is here, on Maidan, that one can find such important symbols. These symbols are all around us. Inside, it has a reinforced concrete frame and can literally withstand a hurricane. In the same way, our Ukraine has withstood the great calamity that Russia brought to our land. Today, these markers have a completely different meaning. They are no longer just about kilometers. They remind us that all of this is Ukraine. And there are our people, and no distance between us can change that, and no temporary occupation can change that. One day, the distance between Ukrainians will disappear, and we will be together again as one family, as one country. It is only a matter of time. And Ukraine believes it can achieve this — achieve peace, peace across all its land. Because Ukraine has character — a stone-like endurance, a gaze that does not waver, and hands burned by fire and time but strong. Hands that hold the shield and protect what is theirs—their land, their culture, their millennia-old history, whose proof is the founders of Kyiv. Names that we will never forget or betray. And it is here, on Maidan, that Ukrainians often bid farewell to heroes on the shield. Anyone who has attended such a farewell, and anyone who has lost someone in this war, has their own personal account with Russia forever and has promised themselves never to forget their heroes. A field of great strength, because in every small flag there is someone's great story, act, and choice — a choice in favor of Ukraine. In favor of the future. This philosophy is reflected in our culture through the image of Cossack Mamai, who gained freedom and can therefore put down his weapon and take up the kobza. Still keeping the saber close, just in case, but returning to a peaceful, civilian life. This is what we all aspire to. And we know: No one will give this to us — it can only be won. This is exactly what we have been doing for 1,278 days of this war, the war for independence. For every one of these days, I want to thank you, Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian volunteers, medics, rescuers, teachers, our youth, our parents. For what we have already gone through. And for Ukraine, we are building together. For the Ukraine that already exists now. The Ukraine that came of age on February 24. And we will talk about this. We continue to prove it now. Everyone who carries independence within themselves. Today, independence is being forged on the battlefield, independence closes the sky every night, it saves lives in hospitals, it puts out fires, and it teaches. Independence does not sleep, working around the clock at defense enterprises, because it is so important that our soldiers have everything, that independence has everything to defend itself. Independence fights in the ring, on world stages, and arenas where Ukrainians perform. It is on the pages of books, in the words of poems written by Ukrainians. When we hear from the enemy every day: "There is no such state, no such nation," and when we prove the opposite every day. We prove that Ukrainians exist and Ukrainians will remain on this land, on this square, where in a hundred years our next generations will stand. And in a hundred years, they will celebrate Ukraine's Independence Day here. It will be so, because Ukraine today is different. Ukraine is stronger and respects itself. And Ukraine does not wait for "gestures of goodwill," it has its own will to implement what is necessary for us. And when Russia wants to take Sumy Oblast, then the Armed Forces appear in the Kursk region. When the enemy strikes our energy infrastructure, trying to leave us without light and heat, then its refineries burn. And no one can forbid us such strikes, because they deliver justice. That is Ukraine striking back when its calls for peace are ignored. How many times have we proposed a ceasefire? But a decent and comprehensive peace, and therefore, we rely on the strength of the whole world. And this Ukraine will never again in history be forced into the shame that the "Russians" call a "compromise." What our future will be is up to us alone. And the world respects it, respects Ukraine, and accepts Ukraine as an equal. Ukraine can truly gather and unite the world's leaders in a single day. Ukraine, with which America and the whole world want to jointly produce drones. Ukraine, which restored unity between Europe and the US and is now the foundation of this alliance. Ukraine, which stands firm and can defend itself. Today, both the US and Europe agree: Ukraine has not yet won, but it certainly will not lose. Ukraine does not ask; it offers. The best army in Europe. But we are needed by it no less. And so Ukraine is recognized — not as a poor relative, but as a strong ally. This is what Washington was about — how to ensure a sustainable, reliable, lasting peace. Ukraine will achieve it because it will receive security guarantees so strong that no one in the world will ever again even think of attacking Ukraine. This is not only our goal; it is exactly what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren: a strong Ukraine, an equal Ukraine, a European Ukraine, an independent Ukraine. To break the closed cycles of history, in which each generation lacked something to preserve independence, and each new generation entered a new stage, again forced to take up arms, again having to defend itself and regain freedom. We must not pass this burden onto our descendants. We are building a Ukraine strong enough to live in safety and peace. With confidence in the future. With respect and gratitude to all who defended Ukraine in this war, the war for independence. This is the purpose worth living for. Daria Shulzhenko is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent.

LONDON, August 24. /TASS/. The government of the United Kingdom may apply for a loan to the International Monetary Fund due to economic problems, Professor of the University of Cambridge Jagjit Chadha said, cited by The Daily Telegraph.

"I'm in a world in which I could imagine it [an IMF bailout] happening, and we'll be bereft in that case," the economist said, cited by the news outlet. "We will not be able to roll over debt, we will not be able to meet pensions payments, benefits will be hard to pay out," he added.

The economist stressed that the economy of the United Kingdom is on the brink of collapse. Chadha compared the current situation with the one occurred in 1976, when London eventually applied to the IMF for a bailout amid high energy prices and de-industrialization in the country.</p>

China and members of an alliance of Latin American and Caribbean nations in recent days joined countries including Brazil and Colombia and anti-war voices around the world in denouncing the Trump administration's deployment of US warships off the coast of Venezuela. At least three US Navy guided missile destroyers and thousands of Marines are currently off the coast of Venezuela, with Pentagon officials citing President Donald Trump's January executive order designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and his directive authorizing military force to combat narcotraffickers abroad. On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that “China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the [United Nations] Charter and a country's sovereignty and security.” Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. “We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela's internal affairs under any pretext,” she added. “We hope that the United States will do more things conducive to peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region.” Addressing the summit Thursday, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said that “Cuba firmly denounces this new demonstration of imperial force and makes a call to ALBA-TCP and from here to all the peoples of the world to condemn this irrational attack by the Trump administration,” according to Venezuelanalysis. As Common Dreams reported, other Latin American leaders also condemned Trump's military deployment, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro telling his Cabinet Wednesday that “the gringos are mad if they think invading Venezuela will solve their problem” and Celso Amorim, a foreign policy adviser to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, warning of “the risk of an escalation” and reiterating that “the principle of nonintervention is fundamental” to international order. The United States has been meddling in Venezuela's affairs since the 19th century, citing the dubious Monroe Doctrine to assist coups, support brutal dictatorships, and pursue policies of economic strangulation in an effort to exert control over the country and its immense petroleum resources.
