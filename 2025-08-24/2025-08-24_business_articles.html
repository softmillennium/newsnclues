                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov threw cold water on the possibility of an imminent meeting taking place between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that no meeting is currently planned. "Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy, when the agenda would be ready for a summit," Lavrov said during an interview with NBC News' "Meet the Press" that aired Sunday. "And this agenda is not ready at all," he continued. "I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy," Trump wrote on his Truth Social on Aug. 18, after he met separately with the two leaders. Trump met in Alaska with Putin, and then subsequently hosted Zelenskyy at the White House, alongside several European leaders. But in the days since Trump's meetings with the two leaders, Russia has continued to launch missile strikes on Ukraine, including one that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. The continued attacks — and Lavrov's comments — have raised questions about Trump's ability to broker a peace deal between the two countries. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Lavrov's remarks. Vice President JD Vance in a separate interview on NBC News, however, expressed optimism that "energetic diplomacy" will "bring this war to a close." "We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall," Vance told NBC News' "Meet the Press." "And if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's attack on solar and wind projects threatens to raise energy prices for consumers and undermine a stretched electric grid that's already straining to meet rapidly growing demand, renewable energy executives warn. Trump has long said wind power turbines are unattractive and endanger birds, and that solar installations take up too much land. "We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar," Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum took control of all permit approvals last month in a move that the American Clean Power Association criticized as "obstruction," calling it "unprecedented political review." Even solar and wind projects on private land may need approvals from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if, for example, a waterway or animal species is affected, the executives told CNBC. The Interior Department "will not give preferential treatment to massive, unreliable projects that make no sense for the American people or that risk harming communities or the environment," a spokesperson told CNBC when asked if new permits would be issued for solar and wind construction. Choking off renewables will worsen a looming power supply shortage, harm the electric grid and lead to higher electricity prices for consumers, said Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, that's active in 17 states. "I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be," Smith said. "We don't want to sign contracts until we know what the playing field is," said Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in San Diego. Avantus has built three gigawatts of solar and storage across the desert Southwest. "I can do whatever you want me to do and have a viable business, I just need the rules set and in place," Graham said. Engie could cut its plans even more, he said. Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end. But that assessment is changing in Engie's boardroom and across the industry, he said. Arevon is seeing costs for solar and battery storage projects increase by as much as 30% due to the metal tariffs, said Smith, the CEO. Many renewable developers are renegotiating power prices with utilities to cover the sudden spike in costs because projects no longer pencil out financially, he said. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends two key tax credits for solar and wind projects in late 2027, making conditions even more challenging. Those tax credits were just passed on to consumers, Smith said. The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham. Prices will surge again to around $100 per megawatt-hour when the tax credits are gone, he said. Renewable projects that start construction by next July, a year after the One Big Beautiful Act became law, will still qualify for the tax credits. Arevon, Avantus and Engie are moving forward with projects currently under construction, but the outlook is less certain for projects later in the decade. The U.S. will see a big downturn in new renewable power generation starting in the second half of 2026 through 2028 as new projects no longer qualify for tax credits, said Smith, the head of Arevon. "You're going to see less projects built in the sector." Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said. Electricity demand is surging from the data centers that technology companies are building to train artificial intelligence systems. PJM Interconnection, the largest electrical grid in the U.S. that coordinates wholesale electricity in 13 states and the District of Columbia, has warned of tight power supplies because too little new generation is coming online. Renewables are the power source that can most quickly meet demand, Smith at Arevon said. Trump is prioritizing oil, gas and nuclear power as "the most effective and reliable tools to power our country," White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. "President Trump serves the American people who voted to implement his America First energy agenda – not solar and wind executives who are sad that Biden's Green New Scam subsidies are ending," Kelly said. But new natural gas plants won't come online for another five years due to supply issues, new nuclear power is a decade away and no new coal plants are on the drawing board. Utilities may have to turn away data centers at some point because there isn't enough surplus power to run them, and no one wants to risk blackouts at hospitals, schools and homes, Arevon's Smith said. This would pressure the U.S. in its race against China to master AI, a Trump administration priority. "The panic in the data center, AI world is probably not going to set in for another 12 months or so, when they start realizing that they can't get the power they need in some of these areas where they're planning to build data centers," Smith said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly's stock is still recovering after the drugmaker released trial data earlier this month on its closely watched obesity pill that underwhelmed Wall Street. In a key late-stage trial, Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, caused less weight loss and had higher side effects than what analysts were expecting. The pill's efficacy also appeared to come in slightly below that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide for obesity, which showed strong data in a separate study. But some analysts say Eli Lilly's daily pill, if approved, could still be a viable competitor in the weight loss drug space — even if it will likely be second to enter the market. It's a highly lucrative area that is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it. Analysts note that Eli Lilly's pill could have a few advantages over the daily oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug semaglutide, which is on track to become the first needle-free alternative for obesity to win approval in the U.S. later this year. Eli Lilly hopes to launch its pill globally "this time next year," CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August. Both drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. That means Eli Lilly's pill is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's does. Orforglipron will also be easier to manufacture at scale, which is crucial as demand for obesity and diabetes injections outpaces supply. Neither company has released prices for its respective pill, but some analysts said Eli Lilly's drug could potentially have a lower price than Novo Nordisk's pill. That would be a notable edge, as many health plans in the U.S. still don't cover obesity treatments. "It's a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison because Novo Nordisk could have difficulty manufacturing enough of the product, given the high cost and requirements to manufacture oral semaglutide," Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in an interview. "Whereas Lilly plans to blanket the world with orforglipron, and very quickly it will generate dramatically more sales," he continued. Goldman Sachs analysts seem to agree, based on a note in August. They forecast daily oral pills will capture 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also exploring other experimental oral drugs, along with a slate of other companies such as Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics, AstraZeneca and Roche. Dr. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of endocrine hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said it's hard to crown a winner between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without knowing how their respective pills will be priced and whether insurance will cover them. "I think both of the drugs are going to be gamechangers," he said. It's difficult to directly compare the results of separate clinical trials, especially as investors wait for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to release the full data from their phase three studies. Eli Lilly's ATTAIN-1 trial also followed 3,000 patients, while Novo Nordisk's OASIS 4 study evaluated a much smaller group of roughly 300. There are currently no studies directly comparing the two drugs, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said. But Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide appears to cause a greater level of weight loss than Eli Lilly's pill based on the available data, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman. In the trial, the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. The pill's weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations. Wall Street had hoped Eli Lilly's pill would generate weight loss of around 15%, the same level as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart Ozempic. Meanwhile, the 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. Still, the slightly lower efficacy of Eli Lilly's pill may not be significant enough to deter patients from taking it. "For many patients, 12% is a really great number," said Seigerman. "Yes, weight loss fell a bit short, but ask 100 prescribers whether this new data will really make a difference in who they'd put on orforglipron, and our belief is the vast majority would say, 'not really,'" they wrote, referring to Eli Lilly's trial data. But Seigerman said the drug's tolerability data — how well patients tolerate it — appears to be relatively in line with that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. Leerink's Risinger said he is watching to see how persistent those gastrointestinal issues are once Eli Lilly presents the full data. Johns Hopkins' Zilbermint said it's difficult for him to decide which one has a better safety and tolerability profile based on the available data. Unlike Eli Lilly's pill, patients need to take Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water. They're instructed to wait 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicines. Seigerman said that could be a hurdle for some patients. "I try to think about the real-world use of these drugs in a market like this. But it is still unclear how Eli Lilly will price orforglipron. But it does not mean they will be cheaper," Johns Hopkins' Zilbermint said. He questioned whether Novo Nordisk will lean into the deal it recently struck with CVS's pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. Under the deal, Caremark started to prioritize Novo Nordisk's Wegovy on its standard formularies on July 1, making that weekly injection the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity over Zepbound. But it is unclear whether oral semaglutide could receive a similar preferential status. Seigerman also questioned whether Eli Lilly will offer orforglipron through its direct-to-consumer pharmacy, LillyDirect. That offering bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, allowing patients to directly purchase Zepbound and some of Eli Lilly's other drugs from the company. Seigerman said he expects "a lot of nuances in the go-to-market campaign for these drugs," adding "that's going to matter." Other obesity pills are in earlier stages of development, making it difficult to directly compare them to the drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without longer and larger trials. But so far, some experts think they pale in comparison. Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the results on Viking's drug "look inferior" to those of Eli Lilly's pill "on almost all metrics." Viking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months, with no plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study. Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks. That's "a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head," Holz said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vietnam plans to evacuate more than half a million people and has ordered boats to stay ashore, while the southern Chinese city of Sanya closed businesses and public transport on Sunday as the two countries braced for an intensifying Typhoon Kajiki. The storm could make landfall along the southern coast of China's southern island province of Hainan from Sunday afternoon to evening, or skirt the southern coastline before heading toward Vietnam, China's National Meteorological Center said. The storm, packing winds of up to 149 kph (93 mph), was about 500 km (300 miles) off Vietnam's central coast at 0600 GMT, moving west at 20 kph, according to Vietnam's national weather forecast agency. Authorities in Vietnam plan to evacuate more than 586,000 people from the central provinces of Thanh Hoa, Quang Tri, Hue and Danang, where the typhoon is forecast to make landfall early on Monday, state media reported. Seven coastal provinces in the Southeast Asian nation banned boats from leaving shore early on Sunday, Tien Phong newspaper reported. Vietjet Aviation said it was cancelling or delaying flights but did not provide details. China's Sanya, renowned for seafront resorts and sandy beaches, closed tourist attractions, shuttered businesses and suspended public transport. China's weather agency forecast heavy rainfall and strong winds in Hainan and nearby Guangdong province and Guangxi region, with areas in Hainan set to receive as much as 400 mm (1.7 inches) of precipitation. Sanya issued a red typhoon alert on Sunday morning - the highest in China's colour-coded warning system - and raised its emergency response to the most severe level, according to posts on the local government's WeChat account. City officials convened a meeting on Saturday evening, urging preparation for "worst-case scenarios" and stressing the need for heightened vigilance to ensure no fatalities and minimal injuries, the government said. Vessels have been ordered to cease operating in Sanya's waters. Sanya is one of China's most popular holiday destinations, attracting 34 million tourist visits last year, state news agency Xinhua reported. Since July, record rainfall has lashed China north and south in what meteorologists describe as extreme weather events linked to climate change, testing local government readiness and posing significant risk to lives and the economy. Natural disasters including flooding and drought caused 52.15 billion yuan ($7.28 billion) in direct economic losses in China last month, affecting millions of people and leaving 295 dead or missing, data from the Ministry of Emergency Management showed. The Vietnamese government likened the strength of Kajiki to that of Yagi, which battered the country less than a year ago, killing about 300 people and causing property damage of $3.3 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spotify will raise prices as it invests in new features and targets 1 billion users, the Financial Times reported on Sunday citing the music streaming provider's Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norstrom. The increases would be accompanied by planned new services and features, the FT cited Norstrom as saying in an interview. Spotify did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Earlier in August, the Swedish firm said it would increase the monthly price of its premium individual subscription in some markets from September, as it looks to improve profit margins. It said the price will rise to 11.99 euros ($14.05) from 10.99 euros in markets including South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. "Price increases and price adjustments and so on, that's part of our business toolbox and we'll do it when it makes sense," Norstrom told the newspaper. Price increases combined with cost-cutting efforts in recent years helped Spotify achieve its first annual profit last year. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When actress Sydney Sweeney's jeans campaign came out last month, critics lambasted the wordplay of good "jeans" and "genes" as tone deaf with nefarious undertones. Colgate-Palmolive's ad for Sanex shower gel was banned in the U.K. for problematic suggestions about Black and white skin tones. And consumers derided Cracker Barrel's decision to ditch its overalls-clad character for a more simplistic text-based logo as "sterile," "soulless," and "woke." Meanwhile, recent product launches from Adidas and Prada have raised allegations of cultural appropriation. That has reignited the debate about when an ad campaign is effective and when it's just plain offensive, as companies confront increased consumer scrutiny. "Modern brands are trying to navigate cultural complexity with corporate simplicity. They're using 1950s boardroom thinking to solve 2025 human problems," he continued. They viewed culture as something to navigate around rather than understand deeply." Some companies have had success in tapping into the zeitgeist — and, in some cases, seizing on other brands' shortcomings. Gap, for instance, this week sought to counter backlash against Sweeney's advertisement with a campaign in which pop group Katseye lead a diverse group of dancers performing in denim against a white backdrop. Brier said companies should consider how they can genuinely connect with consumers and be representative, rather than simply trying to avoid offense. "No brand can afford to fake understanding. No brand can focus-group its way to authenticity. In 2025, customers can smell the difference from a mile away," he added. Nevertheless, ads are meant to spark conversation, and at a time when grabbing and maintaining consumers' attention — and share of wallet — is increasingly difficult, brands have a fine balance to tread. On top of that, iconic and culturally relevant brands want to stand for something and be recognized for it. Wilson, professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London. In an age of social media and with ever more divided public opinions, landing one universal message can be difficult, Wilson noted. For as long as that remains the case, some brands may still see value in taking a calculated risk. "It's hard to land one universal message, and even if you try and tailor your message to various groups, others are watching," he said. "Controversy grabs attention and puts you at the front of people's minds. It splits crowds and forces people to have a decision when otherwise they probably wouldn't care. That can lead to disproportionate publicity, which could be converted into sales." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>
