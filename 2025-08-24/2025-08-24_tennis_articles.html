                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton arrived at the US Open as a contender and did nothing to dispel that status Sunday inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. The sixth seed made a perfect start to his tournament when he cruised past Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 for a place in the second round. The big-serving lefty did not lose serve in his two-hour, seven-minute victory. "It's starting to feel like home for me. So opening day, first match, there are always a little bit of nerves, but I'm really happy I came out here and you guys got to see me do my thing. I'm really appreciative of everyone who came out." Shelton has proven capable of rising to the Grand Slam occasion, advancing to the quarter-finals or better in four of his 12 previous major appearances, including twice this year. "We take it one step at a time. I'm trying to get better every day," Shelton said. "I think that as soon as you start looking ahead of yourself, you stumble over your own feet. So for me, it's one match at a time, one day at a time and just grateful to be out here. "I'm happy to come back here every year. This is the pinnacle of tennis for me, what I dreamed about when I was a kid." 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will take it match by match, starting with his next encounter against a Spaniard: former Top 10 star Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz. Shelton was familiar with his opening opponent, Buse, even if this was their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. When Shelton played college tennis at the University of Florida, Buse visited the school as a highly coveted recruit. The American very much looked the part of an elite player in front of his home crowd, rushing the net with great effect — winning 26 of 33 net points — to move on. Shelton converted four of his 13 break points while saving the five he faced.

Thus the only logical conclusion, never wear any color other than red until you lose. While Raducanu stole most of the headlines leading up to the US Open playing mixed doubles with close friend Alcaraz, displaying their natural chemistry together, it was obviously a weight lifted off of her shoulders to get that first-round victory in Louis Armstrong Stadium. And if she decides to tempt fate and wear colors other than red, then it's on her if she doesn't capture that record-setting $5 million payout, the largest ever for a tennis tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serena Williams made a surprise appearance on Saturday to honour her "former rival" Maria Sharapova, taking the stage in Newport, Rhode Island, to induct her into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Serena, 43, and Maria, 38, shared a fierce sporting feud that all started in 2004, when Maria – who was only 17 at the time – won the Championship title over Serena, who was the two-time defending champion. What later unfolded was two decades of sporting rivalry, with the two athletes repeatedly going head-to-head to take the Grand Slam. In the end, Maria ended up winning five titles, while Serena dominated with 23 – securing her reputation as the second-most decorated champ of all time, following Australia player Margaret Court, who had 24. On court, Serena dominated their head-to-head matches with 20 victories to Maria's two, fuelling an often-tense dynamic that reportedly spilled beyond the baseline. In a post on Instagram, Serena began by acknowledging the full-circle moment: "Last night, I flew to Rhode Island for Maria Sharapova," she said. "Maria's career, as her dad put it yesterday, started with me and last night, ended with me inducting her into the tennis hall of fame." Reflecting on their past, Serena acknowledged the full-circle moment in a heartfelt Instagram post: "I'm probably the last person you expected to see standing here tonight," she said. "Honestly, a few years ago, I would've said the same thing. But years after getting to know her better, we now call each other friends. Retiring in 2020, 2025 marks the qualifying year that Maria could be inducted. Honouring her "forever friend", Serena spoke of Maria's nearly 20-year professional career, as well as the tension that arose between them during that time. "In 2004, when Maria was just 17 years old, she stunned the world and won Wimbledon," Serena said. "To this day, she calls it the highlight of her career, and to this day, I call it one of my hardest losses. It launched one of the most talked about and controversial rivalries in tennis." Serena continued: "For more than a decade and a half, every time we faced each other, the atmosphere shifted. Laughing from the audience, Maria playfully called back: "Yours too!" Later, Maria shared her gratitude for her rival-turned-friend on Instagram: "Thank you for having my back tonight, @serenawilliams. By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka go “Slamless” in 2025 — and does it even matter? Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could go eight from eight at the Grand Slams — but their bigger fight might take place in the world rankings. But she has one more chance for that elusive major, and Iga Świątek is hot on her heels at the top of the rankings. Her Grand Slam record this year speaks to going deep reliably as much as missing out at the last. But she has also eked out a lot of wins through tiebreaks — tiebreaks which became tiebreaks because she had to recover from her serve being broken, not because both players held. Only two of the 19 sets Sabalenka has played in 2025 that ended in tiebreaks have not featured a break. “If this goal is not going to be achieved, I'll still think that this season has been really amazing for me,” she said in her pre-tournament news conference. “All of those tough lessons that I learned this season are only going to make me stronger for the next one. I'll work even harder in the preseason to make sure next year is going to be only a year of success, like truly success.” 1 is a tennis archetype that refuses to budge even though it ultimately means little. Sabalenka appears to be aware of that — but she will also be desperate to make sure that she does not fill it. Having never had a match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, let alone a final, the U.S. Open won't be taking anything for granted when it comes to a potential meeting between Alcaraz and Sinner in two weeks' time. If the world's two best men's players do contest their third Grand Slam final in a row, it would be the first time it has ever happened on the ATP Tour in the same calendar year; Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced each other in four straight finals across 2011 and 2012. Sinner and Alcaraz met in a final as recently as this week, but their Cincinnati Open contest was cut short in the first set with the Italian feeling unwell. What's especially worrying for the rest of the field is that each time these two play each other, they each elevate the other a bit more and create ever-increasing distance from their peers. If Alcaraz betters Sinner's result in New York, he will assume the world No. 1 ranking, having lost it to Sinner last year despite beating his nearest rival in all three of their meetings that year. And they appear aware of the task at hand. “If we don't continue to improve, players will catch us,” Sinner said in a news conference Friday. After winning all of the previous seven majors between them, it still doesn't look like happening anytime soon. Focussing on process rather than results is one if the biggest cliches in sports and life. As cliches go, it's not a bad one to follow. Gauff became a walking billboard for it this week, when she switched technical coaches and embarked on the process of changing her serve just days before the start of her home Slam, which is arguably her most important tournament of the year. Her new coach, Gavin MacMillan, achieved pretty fast results with Sabalenka three years ago when he worked with her. “I'm looking at long-term,” Gauff said Friday. “I hope I can get it all together.” She knew she needed to make a change, even if that meant potentially sacrificing this tournament while she tries to learn on the fly. With every passing Grand Slam, the sandwich generation of 1990s-born players led by Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas seems to slip further and further away from genuine contention. 3, is slightly separate from this, but for Tsitsipas and Medvedev, it's been a miserable year. Especially at the Grand Slams, where they have two match wins between them in 2025. Tsitsipas is battling an ongoing back injury and has given worrying quotes about how much it's affecting him, while Medvedev has looked hopelessly underpowered for much of the year. Zverev said Friday that consideration has to be given to external factors when assessing a player's form, and that he expects both Medvedev and Tsitsipas to work their way back into the world's top 10. At present, though, the most likely genuine challengers to Sinner and Alcaraz would appear to be the players younger than them rather than the lost boys of men's tennis. It was the first topic raised with Emma Raducanu in her news conference Friday, and she instantly suggested the other majors should follow suit. “Yeah, I think it would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format. That said, every other slam from here on in, including the U.S. Open, can refine and rework the mixed-doubles event from the last week to make it an even more compelling package. Gauff, for instance, said in a news conference Friday that she very much enjoyed the event, but that it would benefit from more actual doubles teams. This tournament is notorious for its late finishes. When matches finish in the small hours of the morning and players get to sleep as the sun is rising, it's talked about as an epic event, regardless of how bad it is for the people competing for one of the biggest prizes in their sport or any other. This generally happens during the night sessions on the stadium courts, when two matches take place but don't start before 7 p.m. When a men's match goes more than four hours or a women's match goes more than three, the tournament has a Late Finishing Match policy, which it introduced last year. If a match isn't likely to start before 11:15 p.m., tournament officials have claimed the right to move it into or out of Louis Armstrong or Arthur Ashe Stadiums. As the first weekend of last year's U.S. Open ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning, Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekic set a record for the latest-finishing women's match in U.S. Open history, with Zheng closing out match point at 2:15 a.m. That was just a few minutes later than the finish time for Sabalenka and Ekaterina Alexandrova's third-round match earlier in the first week. That had been down on the Friday, but started very early Saturday morning, at 12:08 a.m. It was the latest-starting match in U.S. Open history. They will talk to the players about it and take their opinions into consideration, but don't have to follow them. Probably some more late nights at the U.S. Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TC Analyst Jim Courier predicted Alcaraz would have an advantage during a night session.ByDavid KanePublished Aug 24, 2025 copy_link NEW YORK—At 22 years old, Carlos Alcaraz is set to kick off his 2025 US Open campaign in hot pursuit of a sixth major title, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for most Grand Slam victories before the age of 23.But first Alcaraz, fresh off a Masters 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open, will have to face big-serving American Reilly Opelka, one of the most dangerous floaters in the men's singles daw, in the opening round.Previewing the match on Tennis Channel Live, former Australian Open semifinalist Chanda Rubin argued that despite Alcaraz's strong form heading into Flushing Meadows, he “can't look past” Opelka.“I think it's always a dangerous match when you've got such a big-serving guy who can get hot, who can create some problems, and who can win quick points,” said Rubin.

Standing at 6'11”, Opelka is one of the biggest servers on tour and a former world No. Alcaraz and Opelka have never played before, but the reigning Cincinnati Open champion has never lost a Grand Slam first round.Jim Courier echoed Rubin's sentiment, predicting Opelka's chances of an upset could come down to when the match is scheduled on Monday: Alcaraz and Opelka will follow Venus Williams' first round match Monday night on Arthur Ashe Stadium.“If I'm Alcaraz, I want to play at night because it slows things down even more,” said Courier.

Should Alcaraz get past Opelka, his road doesn't get much easier, argued Rubin, but the tough road could keep him sharp heading into the second week.“He's got a tough section, though, and you look at the potential quarter with Ben Shelton there, he's got some roadblocks up to that point. So, maybe that plays him into even better form as he gets later into the tournament, if he can survive, that will be interesting to see.” “He's got a tough section, though, and you look at the potential quarter with Ben Shelton there, he's got some roadblocks up to that point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Email Taha with your thoughts on the action Shelton's rocket first serve forces Buse to stand behind the baseline in another postcode. The left-hander gets himself to set point and needs just one shot at it, his second serve down the middle still too hot for Buse. Shelton has a chance to break but Buse delivers a gorgeous backhand half-volley to keep himself in the game. The sixth seed hits a delicious forehand around the net to take advantage after five deuces, and he finally breaks after the sixth, a forehand winner extending Shelton's lead to 6-3, 5-2. Shelton leaps high to smash away – he's won 16 of 18 net points. Then comes his work from deep, a forehand leaving Buse wrong-footed behind the baseline before Shelton makes it 6-3, 4-2. Shelton breaks, helped by a Buse double fault. He now leads 6-3, 3-2, while Taylor Fritz has begun his tournament at the Louis Armstrong Stadium. The fourth seed is up against Emilio Nava. But Buse has got some ticker and holds his serve. Shelton heads to deuce on his serve and takes advantage after Buse goes long with a forehand. It's Shelton who has compiled more unforced errors though, and he adds another with his backhand to take it to deuce. Shelton slides to close the rally with a backhand volley, making it 15-all. But Buse's back, baby, nabbing himself two break points. He nets and Buse has another chance to break … but Shelton clocks an ace at 132mph. Shelton takes himself to set point and doesn't let go, Buse going wide with a backhand. Buse has matched Shelton's efforts but the latter has two break points after the Peruvian sends a forehand wild. Then comes the double fault, Buse suddenly losing control of his first serve which, um, had served him well to this point. Shelton is up 5-3, serving for the first set. Shelton's wicked serve brings him an ace to go 30-15 up and he takes the game with a backhand volley. This is the first time Buse has made it into the main draw at a grand slam and he holds his serve after Shelton goes a touch too wild with a backhand. Let's head to Ben Shelton's contest with Ignacio Buse. Shelton is the sixth seed, 22 years young and an American hope. He's got form, too, having won the Canadian Open this month. He's 3-2 up against Buse, with the Peruvian to serve. Raducanu speaks: “Playing Ena, she's really tricky, she hit so many balls on the baseline that I was not expecting to just dip. She obviously came through qualifying and you feel like you have a bit of an advantage, you're playing on the surface and know what it feels like so I'm just very pleased with how I managed myself, managed my game through that match.” Raducanu goes up 40-0 after dominating from the baseline, and Shibahara sends a forehand wide to end the contest. Shibahara is growing into the contest … but it's probably too late. She's looked more comfortable when advancing to the net and goes up 40-15 … before double-faulting. Raducanu goes wide with a forehand to begin the game and Shibahara pumps her fist … but her frustration returns when she goes long to make it 15-all. Over on Arthur Ashe, Ben Shelton is getting ready to start against Ignasio Buse. Shibahara finally has some joy, going 40-0 up as she hold her nerve at the net, and a forehand winner brings further respite. An ace completes another dominant game from Raducanu, extending her lead to 6-1, 4-0. The unforced errors continue from Shibahara and Raducanu has two break points. She's ready to attack the second serve and dictate play; Shibahara nets and Raducanu is up 6-1, 3-0, the march continuing. She races through on her serve, leading 6-1, 2-0. Raducanu has two break points to start the second set but Shibahara resists, dragging the game into deuce. Shibahara's forehand down the middle thunders into the net … but she keeps herself going with a whippy backhand. Raducanu capitalises on her opponent's errors, taking the break. Raducanu gets to set point after Shibahara loses all power with her forehand. Raducanu wins the first set 6-1 inside half an hour, no dramas. Shibahara's double fault allows Raducanu to make it 15-all, and a forehand into the net gives Raducanu the next point. Shibahara finds the net while trying to return a backhand slice and goes long moments later, allowing Raducanu to go 5-0 up. Raducanu breaks once again with little to no discomfort, Shibahara netting while down 15-40. The former takes the game to deuce after finding some confidence with her forehand … well, just as I type that, she sends one way out of bounds. Shibahara's first point of the match is set up by a tidy drop shot. Shibahara finds the net with a forehand and Raducanu goes 2-0 up. An ace is her first act of the tournament, and she's rapid in going to 40-0, that first serve looking in good order. She's up to the net as Shibahara is quickly overpowered. Raducanu has played Shibahara before, beating her 6-1, 6-4 in Nottingham last year. Shibahara is best known for her work in doubles, having won the mixed event at the 2022 French Open. If you fancy indulging in some nostalgia. Ben Shelton, Aryna Sabalenka and Taylor Fritz are among the big names ready to get going in the next few hours, but our early focus will be on the 2021 champion Emma Raducanu. She hasn't won a match at Flushing Meadows since that life-changing triumph but is carrying some good vibes into this year's draw; the world No 36 pushed Sabalenka all the way to a third-set tiebreak in Cincinnati this month. I'll try keep my eye on everything, of course, but drop me a line with the things I'll inevitably miss. Share your thoughts, hopes, fears, dreams, whatever compels you. Here's to a fun couple of weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner and Sabalenka have had their respective ways at the hard-court majors recently. Sabalenka enters New York with three of the last five hard-court majors in her trophy case and five straight hard-court major final appearances. Each top seed has a serious challenger in Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, but both of them would be favored in any championship matchups, including against the No. Australian Open champion Madison Keys, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Amanda Anisimova and Emma Navarro are all top-10 seeds in the women's draw. Pegula lost to Sabalenka in last year's final and Navarro made a run to the semifinals in 2024. Pegula and Navarro reside in Sabalenka's portion of the 2025 bracket, while Keys, Gaiff and Anisimova are all in the bottom half alongside Swiatek, who is far better on the clay and grass courts. Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton are the best American male hopefuls to win. Fritz fell to Sinner in the final a year ago and is coming off a semifinal run at Wimbledon. Shelton reached the quarterfinals in three of his last five hard-court majors and was a semifinalist earlier this season in Australia. Fritz and Shelton are both in Alcaraz's side of the bracket, which also features Novak Djokovic, so getting to the final will not be easy for either player. The favorites are projected to win given their hard-court dominance, but if there is a surprise winner of the $5 million purse, it could be one of the Americans playing on home soil.</p>

They were big tennis fans and the price was right: free. As a young teen, the US Open meant ball-boy shifts for Aleks, who remembers gleefully blowing his earnings on Ben & Jerry's milkshakes. Now 26, Kovacevic is back at the Open, working on-court again — this time as an established pro. On Monday, he faces Coleman Wong of Hong Kong, ranked 174, who got into the tournament's main draw by winning three matches in last week's qualifying round. “It's been a good year for me for sure,” Kovacevic said from the players' locker room at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Thursday. “My best year on tour.” That year has so far included a run to his first ATP final in Montpellier, France (ATP is the organization that runs men's tennis), then another in Los Cabos, Mexico. He earned his first win over a top-ten player, Andrey Rublev. Kovacevic's ranking went up to number 62 – the highest it's ever been. His path to the pros ran through afterschool tennis at UWS elementary and middle schools and one year at Beacon High School in midtown. Photo by Tracy Zwick At last year's US Open, Kovacevic drew his friend, Big Foe – star player Francis Tiafoe – in round 1. Kovacevic lost in four sets, and Tiafoe plowed his way into the semifinals, where he lost to American number 1 Taylor Fritz. Coleman Wong, the qualifier he plays on Monday, is lower-ranked and had to battle his way through those three qualifying matches, the last one on Friday. Tour life has given Kovacevic perspective about the luck of the draw and other such things: “It's not always easy to be in the best head space when you're playing each and every week,” he said. “Even when you're winning, it's tough being out there competing, alone. You can get humbled pretty fast in tennis.” Though there's also validation. At last year's US Open, Kovacevic played mixed doubles in addition to singles, with young sensation Tyra Grant as his partner. Errani and Vavassori defended that title a few nights ago, winning the 2025 title as well, earning them not just another trophy but a cool million bucks. “I feel a little vindicated now that they've won for two years in a row, and the best men's singles players in the game have struggled with Errani's serve. We lost to a pretty good team!” Kovacevic said. “Props to them.” At this point, Kovacevic has played most of his heroes, including Novak Djokovic, with whom his family shares Serbian heritage. He's eager to take the court with them. Though he quickly added: “I”m not super sad that I don't have to play them in the first round here.” For now, Kovacevic is “locking in” for round one action – confident that “in grand slams, you just find a little inspiration.” The New York crowds make sure of it. “This tournament is more special to me than any other.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it be entry through qualifying or as the top seed, there is a unique feeling around Grand Slams that makes it feel like anything is possible. And, at the US Open in particular, unpredictable new victors are commonplace. Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open title stands out as the most extraordinary, and it only feels like she has now settled after that impossible triumph. Even lucky losers have technically earned their place in the main draw, and on the eve of this tournament, we have seen a key withdrawal which has afforded one ATP star a dream route into the event. This particular individual is certainly capable of causing an upset, especially considering the wins he has amassed across his career thus far. Laslo Djere has withdrawn from the Men's Singles event due to injury.He is replaced by Lucky Loser, Daniel Elahi Galan. Ironically enough, one of Galán's greatest victories actually came in New York, where he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas back in 2022, even bagelling him one set. Another of his most famous triumphs came against Alex De Minaur in Miami the previous year. 16 men came through US Open qualifying, many of whom will be recognisable names to most tennis fans. Lloyd Harris, Jesper De Jong and Ugo Blanchet make up the other key names, with Brit Billy Harris another who gains his place in the US Open as a lucky loser.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been ruling the roost in men's tennis lately, bagging every major tournament between them this year and raking in millions for their efforts. 1, with his victories at the Australian Open and Wimbledon netting him a cool £4.6million. Together, the pair have pocketed a combined total of £14.6m this year for their troubles. And there's still a £3.6m sum available for them both to fight for at the final major of the season. The Swiss star has earned £263,000 from his performances in 2025, clinching the Tiriac Open in April to record his first victory since October 2024. The 40-year-old has amassed a total of £28m across his 23-year career and boasts three Grand Slam wins. However, he's not competing at the US Open this year. Despite retiring over two decades ago, Pete Sampras still ranks among the highest earners in tennis. The American legend, who clinched 14 Grand Slam titles throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, earned a total of £32m during his 14-year career. Sampras, known as 'Pistol Pete' for his powerful serve, won Wimbledon seven times, bagged two Australian Opens and five US Open titles. Current Wimbledon champ Sinner is eighth on the list of top-earning men in tennis, with his recent victories netting him millions. This year alone, the Italian has pocketed £6.7m in prize money, adding both the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles to his collection in 2025. With a career earnings total of £34m, 20 ATP Tour titles, and four Grand Slam victories under his belt in just seven years, the world No. Despite this setback, Sinner is set to face Vit Kopriva in the first round at Flushing Meadows. Daniil Medvedev has raked in a whopping £34.9m over his 11-year career, despite only clinching one Grand Slam title - the US Open. The 29-year-old, who's pocketed £1.3m in 2025 alone, has come tantalisingly close to another major win three times at the Australian Open final. However, he fell short each time against Djokovic, Nadal and Sinner, respectively. Despite boasting 20 ATP Tour titles from his 405 circuit wins, Medvedev recently lost in the US Open mixed doubles quarter-finals alongside partner Mirra Andreeva, losing 4-1, 4-1 to Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Alcaraz has emerged as one of tennis' most beloved figures in recent years, bagging five Grand Slam titles in just three years. The 22-year-old prodigy earned an impressive £7.9m in 2025 alone, thanks to his French Open victory, and a staggering £36m over his seven-year career. Alcaraz has proven himself a formidable force on the court, securing consecutive Wimbledon titles in 2023 and 2024. All eyes will be on him in 2026 as he continues to battle with the Australian Open, the only title he needs to complete a career Grand Slam. Although he's yet to bag a Grand Slam title, the world No. 3 has triumphed over his closest rivals - Sinner and Alcaraz - multiple times. As the US Open looms, the 28-year-old will hope to turn one of these victories into a major tournament win. Despite competing in what many consider the golden era of tennis, the double Olympic champion has managed to outplay Federer, Nadal and Djokovic on multiple occasions. Murray has amassed a total of £48m from his tennis career, which includes three Grand Slam titles and six more major tournament finals. His victories include two Wimbledon titles and one US Open win. He defeated Djokovic twice and Milos Raonic once in the finals to secure these trophies. Roger Federer retired in 2022 after a glittering 24-year career that saw him clinch 20 Grand Slam titles. Out of this trio, Federer has the most Wimbledon titles, with eight, as well as seven Australian Opens and five US Opens. Despite winning just one French Open title at the age of 44, he had to battle the king of Roland-Garros - Nadal - over the years to claim this singular Grand Slam. Rafael Nadal sits in second place on both the highest earners list and the number of Grand Slams won in his career. The Spanish icon, who boasts 22 major tournament wins, raked in a staggering £100m from his tennis career. With 1,080 professional wins and 92 titles to his name, Nadal is best known for his prowess on the hard clay courts, where he secured a record 14 French Open titles. Novak Djokovic continues to reign supreme as the sport's top earner. The Serbian superstar has raked in a whopping £140.5m from his ATP Tour career, amassing an impressive array of titles along the way. With both of his closest financial rivals now retired and the nearest contender over £100m behind, it seems unlikely that anyone will knock Djokovic off this lucrative perch anytime soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>3 seed Diana Shnaider won her fifth career WTA singles title by defeating compatriot Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. It's Shnaider's second title at the WTA 500-level and her straight victory in a singles final. In doubles, Cristina Bucsa and Nicole Melichar Martinez dominated to claim the title without dropping a set. If Diana Shnaider and Ekaterina Alexandrova noticed the threat of rain Saturday night in Monterrey, they were unwilling to let it distract them. In the end, it was Shnaider who prevailed, defeating her compatriot 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes to capture her second WTA 500 singles title and fifth career WTA singles title overall. Since losing her first career singles final, Shnaider has won five straight. It was a pleasure to play, it was a pleasure to show high quality tennis and I hope you enjoyed this week in Monterrey. The win marks Shnaider's first singles title of 2025, adding to her two doubles titles this season, including a WTA 1000 title in Miami. She went 4-0 in tiebreaks during the week and survived a three-hour, three-set battle against World No. But Alexandrova responded, leveling the set at 2-2 and breaking Shnaider twice more to force a decider. In the third set, Shnaider again broke early — and this time held firm. Shnaider will now rest before opening her US Open campaign Tuesday against Laura Siegemund. Alexandrova faces Anastasija Sevastova in her first round-match the same day. Cristina Bucsa and Nicole Melichar Martinez capped a flawless week in Monterrey with a commanding win in Saturday's doubles final. 3 seeds Guo Hanyu and Alexandra Panova 6-2, 6-0 in just 52 minutes to claim the Abierto GNP Seguros 2025 doubles title — without dropping a set all tournament. Championship 🏆Cristina Bucsa and @nicole_melichar defeat Panova/Guo to take home the doubles title in Monterrey.#AbiertoGNPSeguros pic.twitter.com/XsrqBdVbw6 Bucsa earned her seventh career WTA doubles title and second of the season. Melichar-Martinez notched her 16th career doubles title and first of 2025. After losing 10 consecutive doubles finals between 2022 and 2024, Melichar-Martinez has now won her last four. 3 seed Diana Shnaider won her fifth career WTA singles title by defeating compatriot Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) — Serena Williams made a a surprise — and early — appearance at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, emerging from behind the stage to introduce “former rival, former fan and forever friend” Maria Sharapova for her induction on Saturday night. Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who will be eligible for her own enshrinement in 2027, drew gasps and shrieks from the crowd at the Newport shrine. “There are only a few players in my career who challenged me to be the very best, every single time we stepped out on the court,” Williams said. And I'll forever be grateful for bringing out the best in me,” Sharapova said in her acceptance speech. “We both knew no other way than to fight our hearts out. The first Russian woman ever to reach No. 1 in the rankings and one of 10 women to complete the career Grand Slam, Sharapova was joined in the Class of 2025 by dominating doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. Hall of Famers Martina Navratilova, Jim Courier, Stan Smith and Andy Roddick were among those in the crowd, wearing their blue Hall of Fame blazers. Sharapova and the Bryan brothers also received a cast tennis racket that is the hall's newest offering to inductees. Sharapova was described in her introductory video as someone who “combined grit with glamour,” and some of the stylish outfits she competed in are already displayed in the hall — including a tuxedo-inspired dress she wore when she won Wimbledon in 2008. Williams noted that her rival was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 straight years — bolstered by endorsement income that surpassed her on-court winnings. “She showed us all how to take excellence on the court and turn it into excellence in business, and fashion, branding and everything that she touched,” Williams said. “She changed how women not only approached tennis, but sports and opportunity. Sharapova said her induction gave her a chance to look back — something she tried not to do when she was playing. And don't forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how small. The Bryans shared a speech as if they were taking turns hitting on a court, alternating at the microphone as they thanked coaches, friends and Davis Cup teammates from a career in which they won 119 ATP titles, including 16 Grand Slams, and an Olympic gold medal. They spent a record 438 weeks atop the world rankings. “Not too many athletes transcend their sport,” she said. Bob Bryan said he was fortunate because “for most of my career, I had the No. “Doubles was our love from Day 1,” Mike Bryan said.</p>
