                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. I've been fortunate to build a successful career in Los Angeles as a Lighting Designer, contributing to some of the most exciting and high-profile projects of the past 35 years. From scripted series to live telecasts to reality competition shows, I've worked alongside incredibly talented people, making magical moments. For the past five seasons I've served as Lighting Designer on the technicolor explosion of artistry and self-expression that is “RuPaul's Drag Race,” which has been proudly made in Los Angeles since 2009. At a time when productions are increasingly leaving Los Angeles, “RuPaul's Drag Race” has remained firmly planted, holding onto its LA roots and much of the dedicated crew who helped build the iconic show.

Welcome to ‘Long Story Short' We Think We Know What the '70s Looked Like — It's Still Tricky for Production Designers to Get Right Many of us have worked in production for decades. We've come up through the ranks, mentored by veterans who shaped this industry and were lighting stages with carbon arcs and tungsten sources. We've got camera operators who started out as PAs in the early days of reality TV, and passionate, young talent—many making the move to Los Angeles to break into the business— who hope this will be the first of many projects in a lifelong career. We're the kind of workers who have long formed the backbone of this industry town: generational, skilled, and deeply invested in its future. We are artists who want to create something timeless—a moment that people will remember, and that might even change their lives. That level of creative ambition is made possible because of LA's unmatched production ecosystem: the best crews in the business, cutting-edge rental houses, experienced collaborators, versatile sound stages, and reliable industry partners. These local, world-class resources allow us to be bold, flexible, and efficient. They've proven there is no better place to make award-winning, culturally resonant television than right here at home. Their continued investment in LA's production community not only helps sustain jobs and businesses, it preserves the legacy of craftsmanship, collaboration, and creative excellence that defines this town.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus: Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album, while Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift surge back into top 10. Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem notches its 12th nonconsecutive week at No. Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album yet as Wishbone bows at No. Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Of I'm the Problem's 121,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 21, SEA units comprise 116,000 (down 4%, equaling 154.02 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a 13th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 4,000 (up 1%; it moves 21-17 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 1%). 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 41 weeks at No. That puts him in second place for the most weeks at No. 1 this century, surpassing Adele's 40 weeks on top. Only Taylor Swift, with 86 weeks at No. Before I'm the Problem's 12 weeks at No. 1, One Thing at a Time ruled for 19 nonconsecutive weeks in 2023-34 and Dangerous: The Double Album was tops for 10 straight weeks in 2021. The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack holds at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 108,000 equivalent album units earned (up 3%). 8 nine weeks ago and has never left the top 10. The last soundtrack to spend its first nine weeks in the top 10 was Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015, which spent its first 14 weeks in the top 10. Further, KPop Demon Hunters has spent five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, was Forrest Gump in 1994, which notched five straight frames in the runner-up spot (behind another soundtrack, The Lion King). KPop Demon Hunters is likely to sport further gains on next week's charts, with the Netflix film getting a wide release in movie theaters for a sing-a-long event this weekend. Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album ever on the Billboard 200 as Wishbone bows at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 18,000 (equaling 23.71 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 27 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The set's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across seven CD variants (including signed editions) and seven vinyl editions (some signed) and a standard digital download edition. Wishbone was preceded by its single “Vodka Cranberry,” which peaked at No. Gunna's The Last Wun falls one spot to No. 4 on its second week on the Billboard 200 (48,000 equivalent album units, down 40%), while Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid is steady at its No. 5 high for a second week (nearly 40,000 units, down 6%). Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft rallies 24-6 after the release of a one-year anniversary vinyl edition of the album. Of that sum, vinyl sales accounted for nearly 18,000. The anniversary edition of the vinyl was pressed on bio-vinyl dark blue and orange splatter with its cover printed on silver mirror foil board and contains a poster. Hit Me Hard and Soft, which peaked at No. 2 in its debut week (chart dated June 1, 2024), was last in the top 10 on the June 7, 2025-dated list (at No. 9) and last ranked as high on the Feb. 22, 2025, chart (when it was also at No. 7 on the latest Billboard 200 (nearly 38,000 equivalent album units, down 1%), SZA's former leader SOS is up two spots to No. Closing out the top 10 is Taylor Swift's former No. 1 The Tortured Poets Department, which jumps 18-10 with 30,500 equivalent album units earned (up 18%). Poets' vault back into the top 10 comes after Swift's Aug. 12 announcement of her forthcoming new studio album, The Life of a Showgirl (due Oct. 3). On Aug. 13, Swift provided further details about the album, including its tracklist and producers, and appeared on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast, New Heights, to chat about the project. YouTube announced that the pod peaked at 1.3 million concurrent livestream viewers — more than any other podcast has garnered since the platform launched a “dedicated podcast experience in 2023,” per the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for latest…: Two major global milestones were crossed this weekend as Warner Bros/DC's Superman passed the six-century mark — at $604.5M through Sunday — and Apple Original Films' F1, via WB, also pushed the needle past $600M, reaching $603.4M through today. 'Kpop Demon Hunters' Scares Away 'Weapons' With Opening Around $18M; Netflix's First No. James Gunn Won't Retcon 'Peacemaker' After 'Superman' Crossover: "I'd Love To George Lucas The S*** Out Of It" The Joseph Kosinski-directed racing pic added $6.1M in this 9th frame, a 37% dip. It's Brad Pitt's biggest movie ever worldwide, and best ever in China for the actor as well as one of only three studio titles to cross $50M in that market this year. Tops to date are: China ($59.2M), Korea ($35.2M), France ($30M), UK ($29.7M) and Mexico ($19.9M). Speaking of China, New Line/WB's Final Destinations Bloodlines finally released in the market this weekend, and to very positive results amid strong local titles. The opening session there is an estimated $8.2M, lifting the international cume to $157.4M and sending global close to $300M, currently at $295.5M through today. As we saw last year with Alien: Romulus, there has been some relaxation of censorship for horror/R-rated films, and audiences are responding. This weekend marks the first time the Final Destination franchise had ever been played in mainland China cinemas. Staying in Asia for a moment, Japanese hit Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle added another $10.5M in the markets where Crunchyroll/Sony have the movie. Not included here is Japan, where Toho/Aniplex release (we will update that total once it becomes available), and Korea which killed it at open this session with a leading $13M. The global total is now well above $200M. There are nine Southeast Asian Sony markets in release so far, including this weekend's new opener, Philippines. Other holdover markets further elevated their record totals as the highest grossing anime film of all time: Hong Kong ($7.1M), Indonesia ($6.2M) and Malaysia ($5M). In Japan, Infinity Castle has become the highest-grossing for Imax ever, overtaking Mugen Train. Korea's weekend debut of $1.4M makes it Imax's biggest ever 3-day opening for the country, besting Avatar: The Way of Water. There are many more markets on deck including North America, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, UK, Spain, France and Germany. Leading other continued play, New Line/Warner Bros' Weapons continues to hold well, dropping 31% internationally with a $13.2M 3rd frame. The Top 5 overseas plays are: UK ($11.6M), Mexico ($7.5M), Spain ($5.7M), France ($5.6M) and Australia ($5.1M). With a terrific 29% drop, Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 added another $12M to its overseas coffers for an $83M running international cume in 68 markets. Italy was new this frame, opening at No. China had a strong second weekend of $4.5M (-32%), taking the cume there to $16.4M through Sunday. The Top 5 to date are: China ($16.4M), UK ($13.7M), France ($8.7M), Spain ($6.2M) and Mexico ($5.5M). Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth this week became only the 3rd studio title to cross $500M at the international box office, reaching $508.6M through Sunday. Excluding China, the overall overseas performance to date is on par with Jurassic World Dominion. Here are the Top 5 to date: China ($79M), UK ($47.3M), Mexico ($36.4M), Germany ($32.6M) and France ($28.4M). Disney's Freakier Friday had a solid 35% drop in its 3rd frame, notably with the UK down just 19% and Mexico, Australia, Italy, Germany and France all sliding within the 30s. The full overseas weekend was $6.2M for a running $42.8M international cume and $113.3M global. 1 title in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Central America, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina (non-local), Uruguay (non-local) and the region as a whole. The Top 5 markets to date are: UK ($7.9M), Mexico ($7.6M), Australia ($3.3M), Argentina ($2.3M) and Colombia ($2.2M). Still to open are Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. Dakota Johnson/Pedro Pascal/Chris Evans-starrer Materialists just keeps cranking out strong numbers, this weekend adding $6.2M in 57 markets for a $48.6M international running cume and $85.1M global. Sony has overseas on the A24 pic which is still to release in Italy next month. The offshore take was $5.8M (-42%) across all international markets. The Top 5 of those to date are: UK ($29.5M), Mexico ($27.4M), France ($15.4M), Brazil ($13.5M) and Australia ($11.1M). Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Right now, there's a focus on nationality-specific casting when it comes to Asian Americans that I feel is an overcorrection,” he said. 'Butterfly' Series: Daniel Dae Kim Says Violence, Espionage and Deceit Are Backdrop for Family Trauma 'Butterfly' Review: Daniel Dae Kim Is a Superspy Superdad in Amazon's Blandly Sweet Thriller However, Kim explained that often “the role itself has not been thought through,” yet they're already putting up nationality-specific barriers for actors who want to audition. The Hawaii Five-0 alum recognized that there are times when nationality-specific casting is “important,” such as when “there's an authentic language requirement in the role, or it's based on someone who's a real person that has cultural significance to that particular country.” But when the role centers on the broader Asian-American experience, Kim doesn't think there should be ethnic-based limitations when it comes to casting. “And we all know what it feels like to be othered. Though the Lost alum believes the focused effort began with good intentions, “because originally, it was like, ‘Well, we can't just consider them all as one,'” he encourages casting directors to be “a little bit more sophisticated now about how we can open opportunities to actors.” That's one of the reasons why Kim cast Reina Hardesty, who is Japanese American, as his Korean American character's daughter in his new Prime Video series Butterfly. “That was a deliberate choice on my part, because what the significant part of her character was is the idea of feeling alienated and alone in America. Whether you're Botswanan or from the Ivory Coast, it's not pertinent. The actor also used non-American actors playing American comic book characters (such as British actors Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Henry Cavill) as another example to back up his observations when it comes to nationality-specific casting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lady Gaga received a heartfelt pep talk from her fiancé, Michael Polansky, ahead of her Mayhem Ball tour stop in New York City. The 39-year-old pop superstar returned to her hometown on Friday (Aug. 22) for a two-hour show at Madison Square Garden, marking her first performance in the Big Apple since headlining MetLife Stadium during The Chromatica Ball in 2022. “I think about walking on the concrete, going all around the city and just — I remember fighting really hard, fighting really hard for my dreams and what I believed in and for myself,” she told the crowd, according to People. The singer and actress added that Polansky echoed a similar sentiment. “Right before I came onstage, my fiancé, Michael, said, ‘When you go out there, let them fill you up,'” Gaga recalled, visibly emotional. From there, Gaga introduced her next song “Hair,” which peaked at No. “I'm sure all my albums could not be made without New York, but I am sure that this album would not have been made without New York,” she said. As noted in Billboard‘s recap, Gaga's homecoming concert marked the start of a six-night run at Madison Square Garden as part of her globe-spanning Mayhem Ball tour.

I don't think that would be a good idea. I can do an accent but that would be kind of sacrilegious. Butler continued, “Those movies meant so much to me, but I think that it's gotta be somebody who is from [England].” A post shared by Hits Radio (@hitsradiouk) Glen Powell previously gave the same answer, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “A Texan should not play James Bond.” In June, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Villeneuve to direct the next installment, and last month, Steven Knight was announced to write the film amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film. “We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Daniel Craig played the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple's foray into theatrical also made headlines as 'F1: The Movie' raced past a huge $600 million globally. Most in Hollywood are betting on the former despite the fact that a special two-day sing-along event of the hit animated movie could earn as much as $18 million to $20 million from 1,700 North American theaters, according to exhibition sources and rival studios with access to certain data. Since Netflix — which has a turbulent relationship with exhibitors — refuses to report box offices, no one will ever know the actual number. Bobby Berk Says Netflix Could've Gave Him a "Heads-Up" 'Queer Eye' Was Ending Before His New HGTV Show Reveal Box Office Milestone: 'Superman' First Superhero Pic of Year to Fly Past $600 Million Globally That means that New Line and Warner Bros.' horror sensation Weapons will be listed as the official winner of the Aug. 22-24 frame with $15.6 million in its third outing for a horrifyingly impressive global cume of nearly $200 million, or $199.4 million through Sunday. (And it's always possible Weapons could be the actual winner if Demon Hunters comes in lower than anticipated.) Since debuting in June on the streamer, Kpop Demon Hunters has fast become a cultural phenomenon. Regal Cinemas and Cinemark Theatres — the country's two largest circuits behind AMC Theatres — along with Alamo Drafthouse and numerous other circuits were all game to grab a piece of the action. The clever, original storyline centers on the adventures of Huntr/x, a trio comprised of K-pop superstars Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo) who use their secret identities as badass demon hunters to protect their fans from an ever-present supernatural threat. Together, they must face their biggest enemy yet — an irresistible rival boy band of demons in disguise. Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans directed the animated feature for Sony Pictures Animation, based on a screenplay by Danya Jimenez, Hannah McMechan, Kang and Appelhans. The project ultimately landed at Netflix as part of a larger deal with Sony Pictures. The original songs for KPop Demon Hunters were performed by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI, Andrew Choi, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, samUIL Lee, Neckwav and Lea Salonga, while Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung performed their own original song. Sans its own distribution apparatus, Apple must rely on third-party partners. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27, looked noticeably slimmer during a sun-soaked family getaway in Cape Cod. In photos shared by his sister Katherine on Aug. 22, he appeared sharply transformed—sporting a crisp white short-sleeved button-down and pastel pink shorts, casually checking his phone aboard a boat. A post shared by Katherine Schwarzenegger (@katherineschwarzenegger) The fun getaway also featured mom Maria Shriver and brother-in-law Chris Pratt, who flaunted his own fit physique in shirtless photos. Katherine simply captioned the carousel of images, “A perfect day ☀️🌊.” He first showed off his slimmer physique at the June premiere of “FUBAR” Season 2 in Los Angeles, where he stood confidently beside Arnold, Katherine, Christina, and Patrick. He opened up about the origins of his weight-loss journey during May's Beacher Vitality Happy & Healthy Summit in Los Angeles, according to PEOPLE. I made it a big [deal] like, ‘Oh, I'm going to go out and do all this stuff, be in Australia,' and I just saw how much my weight was prohibiting me from doing the everyday activities,” he stated. And my friends were like, ‘Yeah, no shot.' Christopher described years of trial and error with various diets and meal programs dating back to his high school days. “Weirdly enough, I gave up bread for Lent,” he told the audience. “I don't know if anyone's Catholic in here, but I gave up bread for Lent.” And so I lost 30 pounds just through that.” Though Christopher mainly stays out of the spotlight, his famous father opened up about his weight loss in a June 2025 interview with The Sunday Times. The actor recalled that he never told his son he was overweight, instead introducing healthy food and the gym. I always felt one day it will have to come from him — and it did.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Brooklyn native who didn't become an actor until he was in his early 60s — despite being related to famed acting teacher Stella Adler — Adler played Herman “Hesh” Rabkin, consigliere to James Gandolfini‘s mob boss Tony, on HBO's The Sopranos. 'Emily in Paris' Crew Member Diego Borella Dies at 47 After Collapsing on Set Harrison Dossick, Entertainment Lawyer and Copyright Litigator for Angelina Jolie, Dies at 65 He also was the boorish law partner Howard Lyman on CBS' The Good Wife, and on FX's Rescue Me, he recurred as NYFD station chief Sidney Feinberg. He also played a spry Holocaust survivor on the final season of Comedy Central's Broad City. Adler was a student at Syracuse University in 1950 when his father, Philip, then the GM of the Group Theatre working on the Carol Channing musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called to offer him a job as assistant stage manager. He followed with gigs as stage manager, production manager or production supervisor on a 1952 revival of Of Thee I Sing, directed by George S. Kaufman and starring Jack Carson; 1956's My Fair Lady, starring Julie Andrews, then a very nervous 19, and Rex Harrison; 1966's The Apple Tree, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Alan Alda and Barbara Harris; and 1967's The Homecoming, written by Harold Pinter. Along the way, he also was backstage for the original productions of Annie and Hal Holbrook‘s Mark Twain Tonight!, helped Zero Mostel evade a subpoena from the House Un-American Activities Committee and worked with the likes of Arthur Miller, Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles, Angela Lansbury, John Gielgud, Noël Coward, Joan Rivers, Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Milos Forman, Richard Rodgers, Liv Ullmann and Richard Burton. He had a great story about Katharine Hepburn portraying Coco Chanel on Broadway in 1969. “She had this little quiet song to her father, and during the first matinee, you could hear them banging away from across the street. “So I go back to her and tell her it's impossible and then she goes out, goes across the street, gets in one of those open construction elevators and arranges with the workers herself on every floor that when I come out of the stage door and give them the signal, they stop work and then restart when I come out again. He was a stage manager on the soap opera Santa Barbara in Los Angeles when he took a call from a friend who was casting the 1992 Joe Pesci film The Public Eye. “My friend wanted me to meet with the director [Howard Franklin], and the first thing he said to me was how much I reminded him of his father,” he recalled in 2015. I'd never entertained the idea of acting; it was an unusual thing. But I was getting ready to retire from the production end, anyway. Adler appeared onscreen for the first time on a 1991 episode of the Gary David Goldberg sitcom Brooklyn Bridge on CBS and later landed regular roles on three other short-lived series: ABC's Hudson Street, starring Tony Danza, and The WB's Alright Already and Raising Dad (as Carol Leifer and Bob Saget‘s father, respectively). Adler also would go on appear on the big screen in Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), Getting Away With Murder (1996), In Her Shoes (2005), Synecdoche, New York (2008) and A Most Violent Year (2014). “You know what's interesting?” he said in a 2017 interview. Things came full circle when he returned to Broadway in 2000, not as a stage manager but as an actor in the Elaine May comedy Taller Than a Dwarf. He released a book, Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales From Broadway, Television, and the Movies, in May 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY AM: Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demon Hunters have risen and they're snatching No. 1 away from New Line/Warner Bros' Zach Cregger horror movie Weapons, with an estimated $18M two-day opening. Admissions for Kpop‘s Saturday and Sunday per EntTelligence is 1.5 million alone off a standard ticket price of $13.63. Premium tickets went for $16.31 repping 18% of the weekend's admissions, while general attendees represented 82%. Warner Bros is reporting that Weapons third weekend stands at $15.6M, -36% with a running total of $115.8M. Netflix had ComScore shield exhibitor grosses from rival studios, but the majors had other means to compute Kpop‘s weekend. Comscore isn't expected to call Kpop at No. Netflix has only booked Kpop Demon Hunters for a two-day play. At a time when exhibitors are calling for windows on theatrical releases, they've caved during one of the driest weekends at the summer box office by making an exception for Kpop Demon Hunters. Comscore is calling the weekend sans Kpop at $60M. That would rank as the lowest grossing weekend of summer to date. It's still bound to be the lowest weekend of summer 2025 so far even if you include Kpop, but it's not as bad, around $78M. AMC hasn't caved to playing Kpop, but they will play Netflix's Greta Gerwig's Narnia. When the time comes, will Netflix report grosses on behalf of the filmmaker who delivered Warner Bros' their highest grossing movie ever? It's strange to hide the box office on a No. The machine driving awareness and engagement on social per RelishMix on Kpop Demon Hunters is fueled by YouTube videos over the last two months with a social media reach across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, and YouTube of 10.5 billion. Says RelishMix, “Convo on Kpop Demon Hunters run positive, as a stadium chant — loud, euphoric, and bordering on religious devotion. Fans swoon over the soundtrack, calling it ‘better than BTS' and joking that they've been ‘hypnotized' into looping the songs all day, while others gush that this ‘could debut as an actual boy group track.' Fans admit that they came expecting a disposable Netflix filler and left ‘addicted' to the point of nonstop replays. Comments liken the movie's animation to Spider-Verse and even Big Hero 6, calling Jinu the new gold standard for animated K-pop idols. The through-line is clear: people can't believe this much polish and catchiness came from a demon-slaying parody premise, and they love that the songs double as both bops and sly metaphors for soul consumption.” Does Sony have any regrets about handing off Kpop Demon Hunters to Netflix? Sony has no regrets whatsoever as it was always part of the plan in the Culver City lot's $3 billion Netflix deal. All the animated work on the movie was done by Sony ImageWorks, so even more of a margin for Sony. Sony Pictures Animation is attached to all Kpop sequels and spinoffs. The movie, I'm told, is a profitable play for Sony. How the indie openers went down this weekend: Focus Features Honey Don't! ($3M opening), Bleecker Street's David Mckenzie directed Relay ($1.9M ), A24's Nhe Zha II ($1.5M for the Michelle Yeoh English lingo version; overall cume for Mandarian and English domestic is $22.4M), Vertical/AGC Studios' Eden from Ron Howard ($1M) and NEON's Splitsville from Michael Angelo Covino ($105,5K at 5 locations in what is the weekend's best theater average at $21K, muy bien). Mubi's Sundance pick-up Lurker from Beef and The Bear episodic director Alex Russell did $64,4K for the weekend at four LA and NYC locations, for a $16K theater average. The movie stars Théodore Pellerin as Melrose Ave shop clothing shop employee who works his way into the inner circle of a hot burgeoning pop star played by Saltburn‘s Archie Madekwe, creating a toxic relationship. The pic is 93% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Kpop Demon Hunters Singalong (Netflix) 1,700 theaters, Sat $9.6M Sun $8.4M, Weekend $18M/Wk 1 Freakier Friday (Dis) 3,675 (-300) theaters, Fri $2.8M (-38%) Sat $3.7M Sun $2.7M 3-day $9.2M (-35%), Total $70.5M/Wk Fantastic Four: First Steps (Dis) 3,190 (-165) theaters Fri $1.6M (-35%) Sat $2.6M Sun $1.7M 3-day $5.9M (-36%), Total $257.2M/Wk 5 Bad Guys 2 (Uni) 3,288 (92) theaters, Fri $1.3M (-34%) Sat $2.2M Sun $1.5M 3-day $5.1M (-32%), Total $66.1M/Wk 4 The Naked Gun (Par) 2,776 (-251) theaters, Fri $900K (-35%) Sat $1.25M Sun $800K 3-day $2.95M (-40%), Total $47.5M/Wk 4 Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 2,100 (-170) theaters, Fri $580k (-25%) Sat $920K Sun $600K 3-day $2.1M (-29%), Total $335.5M/Wk 8 SATURDAY AM: Warner Bros/New Line's third weekend of Zach Cregger's Weapons is coming in stronger than anticipated with $4.67M yesterday on its way to a $15M+ weekend. The swing factor here is Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demon Hunters Singalong which isn't on any box office charts this AM; not so much because Netflix isn't reporting and burying their figures in ComScore, but any kind of indication of that anime movie's success won't be apparent until tonight into tomorrow AM. Currently that belongs to March 14-16 when Novocaine numbed audiences, with all titles doing $52.1M. Kpop Demon Hunters is only playing today and Sunday at most circuits minus AMC, which is holding the line on theatrical windows. Running cume for Weapons by Sunday looks like $115.2M. With more kids heading back to college (65% were on break Friday, which will fall to 25% on Monday), the arthouse box office has been flooded with edgy and some auteurish films including Focus Features Honey Don't! ($3.2M opening), Bleecker Street's David Mckenzie directed Relay ($2M estimated), A24's Nhe Zha II ($1.4M), Vertical/AGC Studios' Eden from Ron Howard ($1.36M) and NEON's Splitsville from Michael Angelo Covino (estimated $90K at 5 locations in what is the weekend's best theater average at $18K). It's almost like an advertisement for the specialty sector itself. Still, nothing is breaking out here with soft ticket sales all around except for Splitsville. is doing 33% more money on less screens than Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke's previous Focus Features Lesbian comedy caper, Drive Away Dolls which opened to $2.4M with a $1K theater average and a C CinemaScore. No CinemaScore, but the audience isn't excited about this single Coen brother comedy like they were with No Country for Old Men, giving it 43% on Rotten Tomatoes audience and a horrible 1 1/2 stars and 28% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak. No PLFs, but a lackluster result despite hitting its tracking. When it comes to these arthouse releases, many of these distributors aren't spending much on P&A, including Bleecker Street and Vertical. Relay, with good critic Rotten Tomatoes scores of 75% certified fresh is seeing its best playability in East, South, Midwest and West with AMC Lincoln Square NYC up to around $5K so far, the pic's highest grossing venue in North America. The Riz Ahmed-Lily James-Sam Worthington action thriller world premiered at TIFF last year and Bleecker Street acquired the pic two months later. China's animated Ne Zha 2, the fifth highest grossing movie of all-time at $2.15 billion, already played at the domestic box office back in February with a Mandarin language print that grossed $20.9M. Overall audiences gave it 85% positive and a 61% definite while kids under 12 awards it 86% positive, but a lower 43% definite recommend. The Denzel Washington based on Akira Kurosawa's 1963 Japanese film High and Low continues to play in theaters this weekend. We'll get more into Vertical's save of the Ron Howard multi-star period thriller Eden later this weekend, but after a $640K Friday it's putting up a $1.36M opening which is better than Vertical's Jude Law thriller The Order from December which debuted to $887K and ended its run at $2M domestic. Eden cost $55M gross before P&A with a net production cost of $35M; the movie largely funded by Australian tax incentives and foreign sales. Offers made to AGC Studios for domestic weren't good enough for this Sydney Sweeney, Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, and Daniel Bruhl movie. Why didn't distribs jump on this movie? Because it came out of its TIFF world premiere with middling reviews (currently at 55% Rotten), making it a risky theatrical investment. Eden is on a 30-day exclusive theatrical window before PVOD. In a marketplace where the agencies have a number of unsold starry movies, here's one path for mid-sized priced indie movies to the big screen. Rotten Tomatoes audiences like the movie better than critics at 69%. FRIDAY AM: Only one reported preview last night and that's Focus Features' Ethan Coen-directed and co-written Honey Don't!, which did $525,000 in both Thursday and early previews ahead of its 1,300-theater opening Friday, The frame is expected to be between $3M-$4M. Unlike other indie releases on the marquee this weekend, Honey Don't! is playing on a full schedule at theaters, not split. It's Coen's second feature with wife Tricia Cooke on which they both wrote and produce; she has long edited for the Coen brothers. Coen and Cooke's previous movie, which also starred Margaret Qualley, was 2024's Drive-Away Dolls, which did $450K in previews on its way to a not wowing $2.4M opening at 2,280 theaters. Reviews were much better on Drive-Away Dolls at 64% fresh than for Honey Don't!, which stands at 49% on Rotten Tomatoes. Meanwhile, she's having an affair with a cop played by Aubrey Plaza. The movie ends week 2 with $36.2M, down 43%, for a running cume of $100.2M. The original movie is soaring 42% ahead of another New Line August horror release, Annabelle: Creation, which stood at $64M after two weeks and finaled at $102M stateside. Weapons' third weekend is expected to be around $13.5M, with sources believing that Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demons Hunters sing-along in its mere Saturday and Sunday play sans AMC will outstrip the horror pic with around $15M+. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We're super happy to have sold all the upside of a hit to Netflix during a down year overall! But in all honesty I don't see the movie doing this through a theatrical run or even on another streamer. Netflix has such mass it's like broadcast or peak cable. The question is whether there may be promotional opportunities. This will raise its profile even more to break out from just Netflix preteen girls and be crossover mainstream Disney-like hit. Will be able to cash grab at singalong's for ever and franchise into eternity. KPDH is everything Disney has spent the last 10 years telling you that nobody wants. That company may never recover from all the damage Iger and his C-suite have done. Its a solute BS that Netflix can refuse to provide official numbers and still get the positive headlines of winning the weekend.

Quentin Tarantino‘s recent — and no doubt coveted — appearance on “The Church of Tarantino,” a long-running fan podcast run by Scott K., provided spicy details about the director's next moves. It turns out that Tarantino's planned limited series, as announced in 2022 for an unspecified network or streamer, began as “The Movie Critic” before he whittled it down to a feature film version. The Oscar-winning “Pulp Fiction” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” director first announced in 2024 that he would not move forward with “The Movie Critic,” about a film writer in 1970s Los Angeles circa the same time and place as “Once Upon a Time.” There wouldn't have been, he insists, any overlaps in terms of characters, nor would there be an appearance from Cliff Booth (played by Oscar winner Brad Pitt). Of course, we now know that Booth and Pitt are returning for a new film, scripted by Tarantino and directed by David Fincher, for Netflix.

Our mutual favorites include “Klute” and “Chinatown,” and we gave a shout-out to films like “A Clockwork Orange” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” that didn't make the cut. Speaking of podcast appearances, Warner Bros. film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy gave a candid chat to The Black List founder Franklin Leonard about the studio's recent successes. They also unpacked further the revolutionary deal for Ryan Coogler and “Sinners”; the filmmaker will get back the rights to the horror movie in 25 years, which is five years longer than Sony's similar deal with Tarantino and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” a movie Warners chased. At this point, “Sinners” is a Best Picture Oscar frontrunner. Listen to this week's “Screen Talk” episode below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beloved Hallmark stars Kristoffer Polaha and Nikki DeLoach began filming their just-announced movie, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” in Nashville on August 23, 2025. As they wrapped up their first day on-set, Polaha revealed a surprise co-star via social media. He shared a photo of himself and DeLoach alongside Sharon Lawrence, whom he also co-starred with in the 2016 Hallmark movie “Hearts of Christmas.” Lawrence has been in numerous Hallmark movies over the last decade, so fans and fellow stars were thrilled to see her join the cast of the new flick, which will also feature music from Brad Paisley and other still-to-be-announced country stars. Jonathan Bennett, who co-starred in “The Christmas House” movies with Lawrence and posted in early August that he considers Lawrence his second mom, adorably wrote in the comment section of Polaha's post, “Sharon Lawrence is a national treasure protect her at all costs” Polaha sweetly responded, “@jonathandbennett consider her in Fort Knox while she's with me. Polaha also included photos with visiting Hallmark execs in his post, but the pic with Lawrence overshadowed everything else for fans, who immediately flooded his comment section to celebrate her addition to the cast. @nikdeloach and @polahaha I didn't even realize your working with this beautiful lady…. Another fan commented, “Sharon Lawrence 🔥🔥 can't wait to see what's being created 🥰” Hallmark announced on August 11 that Polaha and DeLoach would soon reunite for “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” — 20 years after they became good friends while co-starring on the Fox TV series “North Shore.” The synopsis continues then says Gentry's lifelong friend Mac, played by Polaha, is a country music talent manager, and “finds himself in 1995 as well. Thanks to some Christmas magic, Gentry gets precious time with her father, creative inspiration to finish the song she began decades earlier as a teen and learns surprising answers to questions about her father that have followed her for the last three decades.” “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” is expected to premiere during Hallmark's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming, but the full slate of holiday programming hasn't been announced yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>n the arctic evening of Feb. 13, Yessenia Ruano and her husband, Miguel, stand in their Milwaukee living room turning over a question they've been avoiding for weeks: whether tomorrow will be the day Ruano, 37, says goodbye to their two nine-year-old twin daughters, without knowing when she'll see them again. She and Miguel sort through documents they haven't touched in months, maybe years: tax returns, pay stubs, the girls' birth certificates. Ruano pulls out two Social Security cards and hands them over. “Paola,” she says, “and Elisabeth.” Ruano then gives her husband the girls' passports. The weight of what tomorrow could bring seems to settle on him all at once. The last time Ruano was gone — just two nights away — he reminds his wife, the girls sobbed for hours. But she doesn't stand still for long. Miguel, who has no legal immigration status, works long days at a local factory and leaves before the rest of the house wakes. Ruano tells her husband to get the girls up at 6:05 so they can be out of the door 35 minutes later. She explains what snacks they like, which groceries to buy, and how to comfort the twins when they're upset. Ruano smiles at them, holding the expression even as it dims from her eyes. IN SOME WAYS, THE ANXIETIES THAT plague Ruano on this particular February night are familiar. In the 14 years since she fled El Salvador and asked for asylum in the United States, Ruano has endured numerous sleepless nights in the hours leading up to her annual check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But this upcoming appointment is different: A few months ago, Ruano was warned that this check-in would likely be her last. Here in the Midwest, Ruano has built a life shaped by school drop-offs and grocery lists, spring prairie walks and summer afternoons at Lake Michigan. But the violence she fled left a permanent mark. After graduating from university with a teaching degree in 2009, Ruano says she was regularly followed and threatened by MS-13 gang members. Once, she recalls, a group of men grabbed and mugged her on the street, yanking the gold earrings from her ears. Trump Is Holding Immigrants at a Former Japanese Internment Camp Pritzker Calls Trump's Threat to Target Chicago Next ‘An Authoritarian Grab of Major Cities' She crossed into the United States in 2011 leaving behind her mother, brother, and nearly all of her extended family. She paid a coyote thousands of dollars and made the grueling journey through Guatemala and Mexico alone, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on foot. Women were injecting themselves with birth control.” She pauses. Not long after Ruano entered the country, she was detained by ICE and issued a deportation order. Ruano returned to El Salvador and immediately turned back around and paid a second coyote to bring her back into the United States. This time, she was guided through a network of underground tunnels that led to a windowless halfway house in El Paso, Texas. There, Ruano says she was held for two weeks with 30 others. The women, adds Ruano, including herself, were assaulted by the coyotes and warned that if they tried to leave, ICE would be called to detain them. After six months in detention, a judge found her eligible to apply for asylum. Ruano was placed in what's called “withholding-only” proceedings, a process that allows asylum seekers with removal orders to seek protection while their cases are being considered. Her bail was set at $5,000, and after scraping together the money from a broad network of family and friends, she boarded her first-ever flight — to Milwaukee, where a friend had settled a few years earlier. That same friend introduced Ruano to Miguel, who had made a similar journey from El Salvador after his brother was threatened by MS-13. Ruano found work as a teacher's aide in a public elementary school and attended church every Tuesday and Sunday. Not long after, they bought the building next door. The appointments weren't to evaluate her asylum claim, but to confirm she hadn't broken the law. In 2023, Ruano's plea for asylum was finally heard by a judge and denied. But last November, the administration — and its policies — changed. Ruano's long-dormant deportation order meant she was no longer legally allowed to remain in the United States, even under government supervision. In response, Ruano — on the advice of a second attorney — applied for a visa available only to survivors of trafficking. The application, which came with nearly $14,000 in legal fees, would be Ruano's last shot at staying in the U.S legally. As part of his campaign and now his return to office, President Trump has vowed to deport millions of people living in the United States without permanent legal status. This summer, Trump secured $170 billion to fund his immigration agenda, with the majority earmarked for the Department of Homeland Security to carry out mass deportations. With an annual budget of $28 billion in funding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is now the country's largest law-enforcement agency. “Every single administration since Gerald Ford has had a prosecutorial discretion policy,” says Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank focused on immigration. “But on day one, Trump rescinded those discretion policies. While extreme cases have drawn national attention — massive workplace raids, Venezuelans sent to detention centers abroad without due process — millions of immigrants like Ruano live in growing uncertainty, their lives caught in a terrifying limbo. Their only offense: entering the country without authorization. It is these quieter cases, unfolding everywhere across the country, that reflect how the United States is rapidly redefining its position on immigration — and on who is allowed to belong. “I'll be leaving behind my dreams,” Ruano says, reflecting on the possibility of deportation. “Coming here opened my eyes to the amount of possibilities that are in the world.” Clinging to those dreams, however, has taken a toll. AFTER PUTTING HER DAUGHTERS TO BED, Ruano lies awake for most of the night. A school colleague arrives around 6:30 a.m. She's come to sign a standby guardianship form, legal paperwork that would allow her to take Paola and Elisabeth home if Ruano is arrested at the appointment. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field office, Ruano sits between her daughters in the backseat of her colleague's car. Ruano repeats a mantra she told girls the night before: “We have to trust in God,” she says. And if I'm detained, we will be together again in El Salvador.” She'd heard a few people might join her, but she didn't expect to find dozens of supporters including clergy, co-workers, and local politicians. Local news has come, too, and a cluster of cameras crowd the corner. Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera, a Wisconsin immigrant-advocacy group, helped organize the protest for Ruano. “We are here … to call on ICE,” she says, “to grant a stay on her order for deportation.” Ruano stands nearby, nodding, tears in her eyes. Her speech comes out in spurts, the sentences punctuated by deep, guttural sobs. “It's so painful for my soul and for my dreams.” She then looks toward the cameras, addressing her kindergarten students directly. You will be all the time in my heart.” Just before 8 a.m., Ruano heads to the immigration field office. Standing at 5′ 1″, she nearly disappears among the crowd of supporters who surround her. As she waits to enter the building, Ruano takes a breath and pulls her daughters close. Two hours pass before news arrives: Ruano has been granted 45 more days. It may be enough time for her trafficking visa application to be logged and placed under official review, a process that can take up to 18 months. And if she is indeed denied, Ruano was told she must return to the office with proof of a one-way plane ticket to El Salvador. As the news spreads, one of Ruano's colleagues begins to cry from relief. “In the Jewish tradition, we say dayenu,” she says — a sentiment that loosely translates to, it's enough for now. With her hair twisted and pinned in a large gold clip, she moves confidently around her kitchen as she shapes a clump of pupusa dough with damp fingers. Nearby, Miguel assembles Salvadoran ceviche, and Ruano teases him about being the sous-chef. Ruano's pupusas are a favorite among colleagues and neighbors. She runs a small side business, mostly by word of mouth, sometimes making as many as 200 for a single event. Around lunchtime, Ruano's sister-in-law and her kids show up. They've gathered to celebrate Ruano's good, if precarious, news. Paola and Elisabeth giggle with their cousin before the three disappear upstairs, slipping into that preadolescent world where stuffed animals and TikTok influencers coexist. She's lost several pounds since learning about her expedited deportation order. “I think maybe it's a better option to live in the shade.” She pauses as though to consider the thought. “But I want to leave with my dignity.” Three weeks later, in March, Ruano and her family visit the Milwaukee RiverWalk, a secluded path tucked between woods and an overpass. “I tried carp once,” Miguel says, shaking his head. Most years, Ruano and her family would spend spring break further northwest at an indoor water park, but Miguel, who cannot legally obtain a driver's license in Wisconsin, was recently pulled over and given a warning: If he's caught driving on the highway again, he will be detained and deported. While Ruano still holds onto hope that she'll be allowed to stay in Milwaukee, Miguel is tired — tired of their world shrinking, of the constant fear. Ruano is due back at the immigration office in just a few weeks. She's called every day to check on the status of her visa application. So far, she learns, it has yet to be processed. Four days before her next check-in with ICE, Ruano fears the worst and buys herself a ticket to El Salvador on June 3. Under previous administrations, immigrants with pending visa applications were often allowed to remain in the country while their cases were reviewed, a process that could take years. “Deportation is extremely expensive,” says Marc Christopher, an immigration attorney who works with the advocacy group Voces and who took on Ruano's case pro bono in March. (Ruano has rotated through four attorneys since first applying for asylum in 2011. In total, the legal fight has cost her upwards of $36,000.) And Ruano — who refuses to disappear or leave without a fight — stands squarely in view. IN APRIL, RUANO IS GIVEN ONE more 30-day extension. After her appointment with immigration, Ruano suggests that she and the girls get breakfast at IHOP, a favorite of the twins. “I don't think they'll be serving breakfast anymore today,” an older man says. It's really happening,” she says in a near whisper. Even if Ruano is allowed to stay for now, the ground under mixed-status families like hers, never solid to begin with, is eroding fast. The girls worry about Miguel; his workplace could be raided at any time. But while she fights to remain in the U.S. legally, Miguel continues to live and work without legal protection, his own situation growing more precarious all the time. “The landscape is changing every day,” says Christopher, her attorney. At a nearby McDonald's, Ruano orders pancakes and biscuits for the twins. She taps her fingers lightly across the table. HOVERING AT THE EDGE OF HER GARDEN in mid-June, Ruano leans down and gently tugs at the stems of a small strawberry bush. Summer has arrived, and with it, the syrupy weight of Midwestern heat. “I won't have time to eat my strawberries,” she laments, surveying her plants. Inside, Paola and Elisabeth are back on the couch, watching a peroxide-blonde YouTube influencer walk through the choreography of American air travel: security lines, boarding passes, takeoff, and landing. The twins have never been on a plane, and Ruano's only experiences were a deportation flight to El Salvador in 2011 and a plane from Texas to Milwaukee that same year. A scale sits against the wall, and beside it stand three large suitcases. “You can't find this stuff in El Salvador,” she says, handing them to Miguel. Miguel plans to stay in Milwaukee for a few more months to make a little more money and fix up their home for renters. Garbage, or the familiar menagerie of family life, collected over years of trips, school art projects, and birthday parties. “I worry,” Ruano says, looking at her daughter. “Am I doing the right thing for my girls? On the morning of June 17, Ruano enters Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport. Inside, she stands in the terminal's echoing hall, once again surrounded by supporters and news cameras. Ruano has agreed to one last press conference. Since February, Ruano's story has reached beyond Milwaukee and a petition launched by Voces de la Frontera has gathered hundreds of signatures and raised more than $16,000 for Ruano and her family. We need to keep working for our children's futures…. As Ruano speaks, Miguel circles the crowd, staying just far enough from the cameras to remain out of frame. He takes a risk coming to the airport; immigration arrests have been rising in recent weeks. Just before 11 a.m., Ruano, Miguel, and the twins head toward security. A FEW DAYS LATER, RUANO SHARES a batch of photos from Comasagua, the rural, mountainous area of El Salvador where Ruano grew up and where she has now returned. Even as she fought to stay in the United States, Ruano told herself that seeing her mother after 15 years might be the reason she was meant to return.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cindy Crawford is soaking up the last days of summer, showing off her radiant, makeup-free look in a new Instagram post. The carousel of photos featured Crawford embracing a fresh, makeup-free look. In the first photo, Crawford can be seen with her husband, Rande Gerber, 63. The couple is smiling alongside each other while on a boat. She can also be seen sporting her summer tan during the casual outing. She accessorized it with black sunglasses and a trucker hat. In the second photo, Crawford kept things even more laid-back. She can be seen wearing cozy sleepwear, pairing it with a loose gray long-sleeve tee with white pajama shorts, and fur-lined brown loafers. Crawford can be seen holding a striped coffee mug while showing off her striking side profile. The Instagram post also included an image of Crawford spending some time with her friends, Stephanie Coffey and actress and Bleusalt founder, Lyndie Benson. It was time spent by the water for the girls' catch-up day, as Crawford looked amazing while sporting a tie-dye cover-up and oversized straw hat. Crawford captioned the photos, saying, “And that's a wrap on summer ‘25 ❤️🌅🌊.” Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber, wrote the sweetest comment on her mom's post. Crawford's fresh-faced look in the photos shouldn't surprise anyone. Crawford added, “I would say that's the biggest evolution for me, which is kind of counterintuitive, but that also means that taking care of your skin is more important because you're not covering it up with makeup.”</p>
