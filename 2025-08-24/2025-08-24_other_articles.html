                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Trump decided to put the National Guard in D.C. I began to suspect that something might be going on behind the scenes that is prompting him to put the military in our cities. It's a bold move and for me, unsettling. 3I/Atlas is something that, when we find out about what it really is, could cause social disruption and disorder across the major metropolitan areas. Maybe something bad is about to happen, and he wants the military in the major cities to suppress marches and the backlash from whatever is about to happen Maybe it's related to his health, and if he suddenly dies, he thinks there will be riots in the streets? What if he's about to drop a bomb. Maybe the staffers saw Trump and Putin morph into reptiles. Either way, I'm open to some alternative thoughts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For 15 seasons, Supernatural gave fans a mix of monster-of-the-week scares, heartfelt brotherly drama, meta humor, and apocalyptic battles between Heaven and Hell.The show consistently produced episodes that could rival theatrical horror releases, especially in the early seasons. Whether you were watching during its debut on The WB in 2005 or revisiting it on streaming today, these stories remain effective reminders of the show's roots as a paranormal thriller. Beyond Sam and Dean's larger mythology, the show also delivered some truly terrifying standalone episodes that could rival feature-length horrors. Many of these installments borrowed directly from horror tropes, folklore, and even infamous real-life killers, making them just as chilling as the films they were inspired by. When fans talk about Supernatural's early days as a horror series, “Asylum” almost always comes up. And it's understandable—who isn't freaked out by a deserted, ramshackle psychiatric hospital? “Asylum” remains one of the scariest Season One outings because it leans into the natural, claustrophobic dread over flashy CGI effects. The setting alone taps into classic horror imagery of flickering lights, dark corners, decrepit hallways, and the uneasy feeling that something is always watching. If this were a feature film, it would sit comfortably next to cult favorites like Session 9 or Grave Encounters, both of which used similar asylum settings to terrifying effect. The episode does a great job of taking a familiar horror concept and twisting it through the lens of Supernatural's monster mythology. Steeped in the realms of true-crime style stories, “Family Remains” sticks with you because it proves that the monsters are real, and they're human.But beyond that, it also incorporates the classic ghost horror trope well. Few urban legends are as universally feared as Bloody Mary, and Supernatural's take on the legend remains one of its most terrifying early entries. The episode follows victims who die gruesomely after chanting her name in front of a mirror. It taps into childhood dares and slumber party games that most viewers already knew, making the horror feel unsettlingly close to home. If you're from the Millennial and Gen X generations, there would have been many a sleep over where someone was dared to test the legend as a kid, and then no one could sleep after out of absolute terror. Like Candyman before it, “Bloody Mary” blurs the line between folklore and supernatural slasher, cementing its status as a story that could have easily anchored its own horror film franchise. Now, we know that for many, “Bloody Mary” takes the top spot for scariest episode, but “No Exit” definitely gets our vote. Much like “Family Remains,” this episode is based in reality. Holmes, often called America's first serial killer, and even suspected of being Jack The Ripper. Holmes' spirit haunts an apartment building constructed over the site of his infamous “Murder Castle,” where he tortured and killed victims in the late 1800s. Trapped women, hidden walls, and eerie whispers give the episode a genuine sense of menace. Add in the fact that it's Jo Harvelle's first real hunt alongside the brothers, and you get a story that feels both personal and unflinchingly scary. It's easy to imagine “No Exit” as a standalone horror movie about an urban haunting rooted in true crime, making it one of the show's most cinematic effort. Now, we know this is cheating a little bit as technically this makes 6 episodes, but you can't have modern horror without honoring its elders. “Monster Movie” is a black-and-white love letter to classic Universal horror films, complete with vampires, werewolves, and mummies. While it isn't terrifying in the traditional sense, it captures the joy of horror fandom and serves as a reminder that horror movies don't have to be… well… horrific.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US First Lady Melania Trump's letter was handed over to Russian President Vladimir Putin by her husband Donald Trump at the Alaska summit last week. She urged Putin to put a full stop on the violence, stressing that “In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future.” The signature drew several reactions on social media, sparking conspiracy theories. So weird,” wrote one person, sharing a side-by-side picture of their signatures. “Melania has the same type of signature as Trump...odd...” another said. “No way is that her signature,” the fourth user chimed in. Also Read: Will Trump really invite Putin for FIFA World Cup 2026 in Washington? “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. No official reason given.” Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has provided testimony in criminal cases, agreed with the chatbot's response. Reddit users wonder if Melania used an autopenUsers on Reddit and X were also making wild guesses about whether Melania used an autopen, which has turned into one of Trump's favorite ways to criticize his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump accused Biden of signing pardoning documents using an automated device rather than his own hand. Without providing any proof, Trump asserted that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents. “The autopen can only have one signature preset,” quipped another. Some users even asked Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?” “Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok responded. “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warning: Disturbing content ahead, including stories involving murder and extreme violence. "It is Austin's most famous unsolved murder — four teenage girls were murdered for NO reason." The Yogurt Shop Murders took place in Austin, Texas, on December 6, 1991, when four teenage girls were found bound, shot, and killed in a burning “I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!” shop. The case shocked the community and led to multiple wrongful convictions later overturned due to coerced confessions and mismatched DNA evidence. Despite decades of investigation and advances in forensic testing, the crime remains unsolved and is considered one of Austin's most infamous cold cases. Molly Bish was a 16-year-old lifeguard who vanished from her post at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts on June 27, 2000. According to investigators, Molly was gone just after 10:00 a.m., but wasn't reported missing until almost two hours later, and police didn't speak with her mother until after 1 p.m. According to Molly's mother, "The crime scene was almost completely destroyed, and it has had devastating consequences to this day. NBC 10 Boston reported in June 2023, "The search for Bish's killer has led investigators to convicted rapist Frank Sumner, who died in 2016, but more [DNA] testing needs to be done." In June 2025, her family hosted a vigil marking 25 years since her disappearance, emphasizing that the investigation is still active and ongoing. She withdrew money from an ATM and then disappeared. Kierra Coles was 26 years old and roughly three months pregnant when she went missing on Oct. 2, 2018. According to ABC News, "The surveillance video showed a man — who is considered a person of interest — arriving at Coles's home, and later Coles and the man were seen driving away in Coles's car. At about 10:43 p.m. that night, Coles was spotted on surveillance video making ATM withdrawals — the last known images of her, according to police. Later that night, Coles's car was parked in another part of the city, police said. The next day, the person of interest was seen parking Coles's car near her home and going inside, police said. He then left Coles's home and drove away in his car. When the person of interest was interviewed, police said he gave varying accounts of the last time he saw Coles." She was showing signs of a mental health episode, was released from jail after midnight without her wallet, phone, or any way to get home, and her remains were found by park rangers 2.5 miles from the sheriff's station almost a year later. A cause of death was never determined; her family suspects foul play, but the sheriff's department insists there's no evidence." Richardson was a 24-year-old Cal State Fullerton grad who went missing on Sept. 17, 2019. Richardson was last seen allegedly leaving a sheriff's station in Malibu. Eleven months went by before her body was inadvertently found by park rangers in August 2010 in Malibu Canyon. "I live near Wichita, Kansas, and there was a little 5-year-old Black girl named Jaquilla Scales who went missing just before 9/11 happened. Six days after she disappeared, the 9/11 attacks occurred." An age progression photo was released by Kansas Bureau of Investigation in 2022. They were two boys I attended high school with. They were murdered and then placed on a railroad track where they were run over by a freight train. Unable to stop in time, the train ran them over, finally coming to a complete stop in Benton where Union Pacific employees reported the incident to the police. Though a gun was found near the bodies, investigators initially ruled the incident as a suicide or related to drug use; later reviews of autopsies revealed they had been murdered, their bodies placed on the track near or shortly after their deaths. During an interview with the host, Garrett said he believed the two boys 'saw something they shouldn't have seen and it had to do with drugs.' Kevin Ives' and Henry's deaths were ruled homicides in March 1990. "Jodi was a news reporter who overslept for work. She is ambushed by her car and abducted. There were apparently signs of a struggle outside of her apartment, so it was presumed she was abducted. She was 7 years old and dropped off at school by her stepfather but never made it into the building. Some people speculated that her mother and/or stepfather were somehow involved, but there was never enough evidence to arrest either of them. According to USA Today, "The morning Alexis disappeared, she and her mother, Ayanna Patterson, argued over cupcakes. LaRon Bourgeois, Ayanna's husband, and Alexis's stepfather, told police he and his son walked Alexis to the corner between their home and the school and left her with a crossing guard, who — according to the records — was a fifth grader. Some said they saw Alexis on the school grounds that morning. Two weeks after Alexis went missing, FBI behavioral analysts concluded she was most likely the victim of an 'emotion-based' homicide at the hands of her mother. Also possible, but less likely, they said, was that she had been the victim of a neighbor. The two leading theories both conclude that Alexis is likely dead, but her remains have never been found. And there is little physical evidence to support either theory." "She was teaching an early morning yoga class at a church, and her killer, who remains unknown, was caught walking around on camera in SWAT gear before murdering her. According to CBS News, "Her suspected assailant was also seen on surveillance video walking the hallways of the church early that morning, using a hammer to break windows, while wearing a helmet and tactical gear. "We are about the same age and I remember being so confused as to why my parents were following her story so much on 20/20 and Dateline. The case became a media circus, largely in part because Ramsey was a child beauty pageant contestant and it received constant coverage from around the world. "Within the span of four hours, he was abducted from his front yard, and his body was found near a local river. There's a Netflix documentary called Who Killed Little Gregory? It is both heartbreaking and incredibly frustrating because he was just 4 years old, and his murder is still unsolved." According to BBC News, "Hours before the boy was discovered, his hands and feet tied, his uncle said he had received a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped him. The next month, a cousin of the boy's father, Bernard Laroche, was arrested when his sister-in-law, Muriel Bolle, testified against him. He was released in 1985 when she retracted her statement, but shot dead by Jean-Marie Villemin, the boy's father, weeks later. The boy's mother, Christine Villemin, was also jailed for her son's murder but later cleared. Both were later given compensation by the state for miscarriage of justice. Three separate traces of DNA were found but not identified." "The video surveillance of him being followed by a figure in black is terrifying. If someone did hurt/kill him, I hope justice is served." Trevor Deely, a 22-year-old IT worker in Dublin, disappeared in the early hours of December 8, 2000, after leaving his work Christmas party. CCTV last captured him walking along a road around 4 a.m. in heavy rain, and he was never seen again. Despite major investigations, searches, and media appeals — including footage of a suspicious man thought to be following him — no trace has been found.. "Diao Aiqing was a 19-year-old Chinese university student last seen alive in 1996. Her body was boiled and chopped up into pieces. Body parts were found in multiple trash bags, located all over the university campus. Nine-year-old Degree was living in Shelby, North Carolina, when she went missing on Feb. 14, 2000. Apparently, one person even went back to check on her and said she'd disappeared into the woods. Despite years of searching, finding her backpack was the only major clue until recent developments tied a local family to the case through DNA evidence and text messages. However, no arrests have been made and Asha remains missing. "Her murder is a case that keeps me up at night. Crime Junkie podcast covers her story, and there is an ID Discovery doc, too." Lindsay Buziak was a 24-year-old real estate agent in the Victoria, Canada area who was stabbed to death on Feb. 2, 2008, while showing a property to an unnamed couple. According to CTV News, "Investigators believe the couple arranged the meeting using a prepaid cellphone that was later determined to be registered to a fake name in Metro Vancouver." Lindsay's boyfriend at the time, Jason Zailo, was questioned by police; however, no charges have ever been made against him. "She was a Canadian woman who disappeared on Nov. 28, 2012. Shortly before her disappearance, Fillipoff had been living at a shelter in Victoria. According to CTV News, "Acquaintances who would see Emma around were noticing that she seemed to be acting paranoid, lost, confused, and not like herself." They didn't have any reason to hold her under the mental healthcare act." Police believed she ran away and 'searched' the park where her car was found. Nothing happened (except a lot of police failure) for three years until the case was given to a different detective (who actually came out of retirement to work on this case). He decided to go back and research the park her car was found in, and they found her body in a drainpipe less than 200 yards from her car (the opening to the pipe where her body was put into the drain was less than 100 feet from where her car was). As mentioned above, her body was found nearly three years later, not far from where her car had initially been found. According to Ebby's family, as revealed in a 2022 Dr. Phil episode, the Little Rock Police Department allegedly claims that Ebby died by suicide, which her family disagrees with. On the same program, Ebby's boyfriend revealed that he believes Ebby had been involved in a "terrible accident" with some of her friends. Police now suspect he may have died in an accident at the foster home, though his foster mother, who has never been charged, denies involvement.As of 2025, the case remains unsolved, but a coronial inquest is nearing its conclusion. New claims from a podcast suggest convicted child offender Frank Abbott confessed to knowing where William is buried, prompting calls for a reinvestigation. His home on Holly Street was the last place he was ever seen, and he left behind his truck, keys, wallet, and dog Harley. However, the search was apparently "hampered" by a lack of coordination between police agencies, and according to NBC News, Billy's family said they were "victimized [...] by a system that didn't allow them to participate in the search." As a result, Billy's parents lobbied Congress for "Billy's Law" for over a decade, which finally passed in 2022. "Billy's Law" will essentially work to try and match up missing-person cases with unidentified bodies. "There is good evidence that does point to someone, but no one has ever been arrested to my knowledge." In July 2011, Rebecca Zahau was found dead, naked, gagged, and bound, hanging from a balcony at her boyfriend Jonah Shacknai's Coronado mansion. She had been found like this just two days after his six-year-old son, Max, was critically injured in a fall under her care. Authorities ruled Zahau's death a suicide, but her family has long argued it was murder, pointing to the unusual bindings and a cryptic message painted on a door in the home. In 2018, a civil jury found Jonah's brother Adam Shacknai liable for her wrongful death, though the case was later settled and the judgment vacated. Despite multiple re-examinations upholding suicide as the official cause, Zahau's family continues to push for the case to be reopened. "This was a local 2017 case here in Toronto, Canada. Barry was the founder of a pharmaceutical manufacturer and distribution company and was worth millions, if not billions. It was initially thought to be a murder-suicide, but was soon found to be a double murder. Someone (an urban explorer) got into the house before it was demolished and said they found all sorts of possible evidence left behind by the police that was still in the house when it was torn down. It's been six years and still no leads. Their kids are now offering a large reward for any information that could clear the case up." "A horrible tragedy for all the families involved. It's definitely a case more people should know about. But outside of Asia, I've never really seen much news about it." The "Frog Boys" were a group of five boys who disappeared while out trying to catch frogs in the outskirts of Daegu, South Korea in 1991. Although authorities believe the boys were likely murdered (three of the boys had signs of blunt force trauma to their heads), what exactly happened has never been solved. "They were left home alone by their mom, and when she came home, they were gone without a trace. Sisters Diamond and Tionda Bradley were 3 and 10 years old when they went missing in July 2001 in Chicago, Illinois. When their mother returned home, instead of finding her children there, she found a note on the back of the couch that had allegedly been written by Tionda saying she and Diamond "had gone to the store and to a school playground nearby." According to NBC News, "But there was something off about the note. They added it was also not like Tionda to leave a note — instead, she would have just called her mother." In May 2023, a woman came forward claiming to be Diamond. "He went missing in Victoria, British Columbia, on March 24, 1991. Michael was last seen that day around 12:30 p.m. at the Blanshard Park Elementary School playground while his mother, Crystal Dunahee, was participating in a women's football practice. Despite more than 10,000 tips over three decades and one of the largest police investigations in Canadian history, the case remains unsolved." "He was up late playing video games in his dorm with a friend, then last seen going back to his room. Eighteen-year-old UCLA student Michael Negrete disappeared early in the morning on Dec. 10, 1999. Although it was initially categorized as a missing persons case, according to police, it eventually turned into a homicide investigation. Brandon was out with friends at a bar, celebrating the end of their first year of college, when he decided to start heading home around midnight. Around 2 a.m., he called his parents to let them know that he had driven into a ditch and needed to be picked up, so his parents started driving to him. While on the phone with him, Brandon shouted 'oh shit' and went silent. This happened about two hours from where I live, and it still shakes me to my core when I think about it." Swanson's car was later found abandoned in a ditch with the car doors open and keys missing, roughly 25 miles from where he had said he was. Her car was found the next day parked across the street from her apartment and was covered in mud. Months later, her body was found in the woods. There were very few leads until decades later when one of her former students came forward claiming a priest, who was the school principal at the time, had taken her to the woods and shown her Cathy's body. He told her, 'That's what happens when you say bad things about people' because shortly before her disappearance, the student had confided in Cathy that the priest had been sexually abusing her. A lot of other former students have since come forward claiming to have been sexually abused by the same priest. He has since died, and the case is still open. Netflix has a docuseries about it called The Keepers. It's a case that still upsets me because there seems to have been many other people involved in the abuse and possibly Cathy's murder, and as usual, the church was very aware of how dangerous this priest was and covered it up for decades." "This was in Iron Mountain, Michigan, on May 15, 1999. Police have long considered local man Rallund Lee Ottlinger a person of interest, but no one has ever been charged. Despite being a 25-year-old cold case, Lisa's family and investigators remain hopeful that advances in forensic science may one day bring justice. His mother, Julia Biryukova, said she left him alone in her car (allegedly) on a residential street because her car had 'run out of gas' even though police later determined it had not run out of gas. There have been no leads or traces to this day. The mother was entirely uncooperative and refused to answer any questions." According to King 5, "Biryukova has continued to live in the area, remarrying, later fighting over custody of another child with another ex-husband. She declined to talk when approached by a reporter in 2019, and has successfully hidden from public view since the story got national attention." "He had been acting strangely throughout his drive home. The last time anyone heard from him was a call with his mother at around 2 a.m. "The fact that they have so much DNA evidence but still can't catch the person responsible is just heartbreaking." "She was from North Carolina and left unexpectedly to drive across the country with her cat. Her car was found crashed on a mountain road in Washington state. Years later, they finally checked her car more thoroughly, and there was evidence that the engine had been tampered with to cause a crash." "It included cash covering a month's worth of expenses, leading Kara to believe that Leah planned to return within a few weeks. Parts of the note — such as the bit about leaving money for bills — made perfect sense, while others were vague and even ominous. After a brief introduction, Leah wrote: 'While I am gone, remember — everyone is together in thoughts and prayers and time passes quickly. "He vanished on his way home from a party at Big White Mountain Ski Resort just outside Kelowna, BC, Canada, in February 2018. They have held so many searches over the years, and talked to everyone possible. I remember reading that he didn't even have a winter coat on when people saw him leave; he was staying only a 5-minute walk away from the house party, and he never made it. According to Kamloops This Week, "Mounties have not ruled out foul play, but have not reported finding anything suspicious, and Ryan's disappearance remains a mystery." Then came all the copycat tampering of different OTC medications. I think about this every time I open tamper-proof tabs, which were put in place as a deterrent to these murders." No suspect has ever been found or convicted. "She went missing from the Owego, New York area on Sept. 11, 2001. There wasn't as much law enforcement in the area that day because this happened on 9/11, and many first responders, etc. She was estranged from her husband Cal Harris, a well-known auto salesman. He was tried four separate times and eventually acquitted. There are rumors during a heated exchange, he said something to the tune of 'No one will ever find you.'" According to WNBF, "Her husband, Calvin, was charged with murder more than four years later. "In 1992, two friends, Suzanne Streeter and Stacy McCall, and Streeter's mother, Sherrill Levitt, were kidnapped in the middle of the night. Robbery wasn't considered a motive because their personal belongings, like cars and purses, were found in the open with cash inside. The town they were taken from, Springfield, Missouri, was a nexus of known killers at that time." His dad dropped him off at school, and a short while later, his mom, Amy Fry-Pitzen, picked him up. They went to the zoo and some water parks. She left a note that said Timmothy was with people who loved him, and he would never be found. According to NBC Chicago, Fry-Pitzen's sister, Kara Jacobs, believes that her sister, Amy, handed off Timmothy to another family in Iowa. However, no one has reported seeing Timmothy since his disappearance. The case was ruled an accident/suicide, but there's no way. There has to be some sort of foul play." Phoebe Handsjuk was a 24-year-old woman in Melbourne, Australia whose body was found after she'd apparently fallen several stories, feet first, down into a high-rise building's garbage chute. "I graduated college the year before she disappeared, and honestly used to just take off a lot and clear my head or take unplanned weekend trips alone. She was in nursing school, too, so I understood the struggle sometimes. The strange thing was, prior to disappearing, she'd told professors that she would be taking a week off due to a death in the family. However, her family later told authorities that there had been no death. The couple was supposed to attend a Kentucky Derby party with friends. When they didn't show, some friends went to their house. I believe Shirley was found a week or so later weighed down with cement blocks in the lake on their property. No suspects have ever been named, at least publicly. I really hope they find the person(s) responsible for this horrible murder." There was even a situation in 1999 where a US Navy man visited a brothel overseas and had a woman approach him, begging for help and telling him that her name was Amy Bradley and that she was being held hostage, but he didn't do anything about it for fear of anyone finding out where he was at the time." "Out of all the horrible missing story reports, this one always stayed with me. Maybe because it could have been avoided if the crew members actually listened to her parents, and refused to let anyone off the ship when she was reported missing. Either way, this story just makes me really sad." I saw an update where they think it was a case of mistaken identity." She was also four months pregnant and engaged to a man named Rob Shafer. After dropping Shafer off at his parents' house one night, Hammond later called him from a pay phone. Shafer drove out to help Hammond, and on the way saw her being driven away in a green Ford truck. Although there are still active leads in the case, Hammond has not been found to this day. "I worked with her dad at the mine, and it has always driven me crazy that she has not been found." Beth Miller was a 14-year-old girl who went missing in the Denver area on August 16, 1983. She had been out jogging but never returned home. Witnesses at the time reported seeing her talking to a man in a red pickup truck, but authorities were never able to track it down. Although investigators and many volunteers helped search for her, she has still never been found. "She was an abuse survivor just trying to live her life. She was fun-loving and trusted people too easily, according to her mother. She was last seen alive in 2000 by her neighbor with an unidentified man, and then was found dead, tied to her bed, and burnt. I found out about the case when I was about 15, and have been studying murder most of my life, and this is one of the ones that upset me the most, and I think about it every few days." Ayla's mother filed a wrongful death suit, and her father went on the run and hasn't been seen since 2017. And in the Maine wilderness, it's unlikely she'll ever be found. "In the 1980s, she reported over 100 incidents of violence and stalking. On different occasions, she was tied up, drugged, and even had a knife stuck through her hand, but never saw the man's face. This went on for almost seven years until in 1989, she was found tied up and murdered. Her death was originally ruled a suicide but later changed to 'death by an unknown event.'" I probably passed by her car that day. I've never been able to understand how someone could be kidnapped along a busy road in the middle of the day!" I have so many questions and will probably never find out, but I've never been more perplexed about an unsolved crime." In September 1986, 23-year-old Beth Barnard was found brutally murdered on Phillip Island in Australia — her body was found with an "A" carved into her chest. Beth was allegedly having an affair with a man named Fergus Cameron. He was a little boy who disappeared near Portland, Oregon in 2008 or 2009. His stepmom was investigated, and most people think she had something to do with it, but he has never been found. They only found I think like three pieces of the plane that were confirmed to be part of that flight." On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia to Beijing Capital International Airport with 239 people on board. The flight was lost on air traffic control radar but picked up by military radar, hundreds of miles off course from the planned flight path. Although various pieces of plane debris have been found in the years since, most of it is unconfirmed to have actually belonged to MH370. "Agnès Dupont de Ligonnès, her four children, and two dogs were found murdered underneath the garden in the backyard of their house in France while her husband went on a three-week roadtrip down the coast of France. He disappeared without a trace into the hills after the last town he visited and hasn't been seen since, even after an extensive manhunt search was held. She went to the same school district as me. She got off the bus and was never seen again. In high school, some of my teachers who also grew up there would reveal they had been friends with her and still wondered what happened. Someone in the area has got to know something and I honestly just want someone to finally speak up because the family deserves closure." Eight-year-old Mahan was living in rural Pennsylvania when she disappeared after getting off a school bus not far from her home on Feb. 22, 1985. Although a suspect vehicle was sighted and many leads pursued, Mahan was never found and declared legally dead in November 1998. "His mother claims that in 1997, a 27-year-old Johnny visited her accompanied by a strange man, talked with her for an hour, then left again, feeling it was not safe to return home. He was a 12-year-old from West Des Moines, Iowa, who disappeared early in the morning on Sept. 5, 1982, while delivering newspapers. Witnesses reported seeing Johnny talking to a man in a car and possibly being followed, but no one knew exactly what happened. After Johnny's parents received calls from customers complaining they hadn't received their papers, his father combed the route. No arrests were ever made, and there was never any conclusive evidence found. Johnny's mother, Noreen, believed he was taken by a trafficking ring and spent years searching for him. Although there have been many theories and reported sightings over the years, the case remains unsolved to this day. "It's rather unknown, but essentially two men were found facedown in the woods by a little boy flying a kite. They were dressed in suits, raincoats, and had glasses made of lead, and there were no signs of trauma. They also had water bottles, two wet towels, and carried a rather cryptic note. 18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals await signal mask.' Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel José Viana were Brazilian electronic technicians whose bodies were found on Aug. 20, 1966 in Rio de Janeiro. They had apparently been planning something secret and told their families just a few days earlier that they were going to buy electronic materials for work. However, after their bodies were discovered, no cause of death was determined by authorities, as there were no clear injuries, no toxic substances found, and their internal organs were too badly decomposed by the time the autopsy happened. "Three-year-old Michelle disappeared, her mom and stepdad abruptly moved across the country a few days later, and they repeatedly changed their story. Michelle was never seen again — alive or dead." Michael died in 2005 before he could testify in the case and Donna was released after a mistrial and lack of evidence. Several people have had their own theories as to what happened. There has never been any conclusive proof of what happened on that day and perhaps there never will be. Katherine Korzilius was a 6-year-old girl living in Elder Circle, Texas when she was found dead on Aug. 7, 1996, just minutes from her home. According to the medical examiner, the injuries she sustained could have been the "result of either jumping from a moving vehicle, being thrown from a moving vehicle, or falling from a moving vehicle." However, her cause of death remains a mystery. According to CBC, when investigative journalist Habiba Nosheen received an intense "cryptic email" to look into Nuseiba Hasan's story, Nosheen "soon learned that the 26-year-old had actually disappeared in 2006, yet nearly a decade had passed before anyone reported she was gone." However, when I was a teen I read the book her mum wrote and the case has fascinated me since." Fourteen-year-old Jensen was living in Napier, New Zealand when she disappeared on Sept. 2, 1983 while riding her horse. Went missing on a family camping trip…so mom and dad say. The image of this sweet boy's face is burned into my memory and I pray he gets justice someday." DeOrr Kunz was just 2 years old when he disappeared on July 10, 2015 while visiting a campground with his parents, Jessica Mitchell and Vernal DeOrr Kunz. Although several private investigators have worked on the case, no solid evidence as to what may have happened has been found. He was caught on CCTV entering the bar, but never exiting it. Medical student Brian Shaffer was last seen in Ohio, on CCTV, going up an escalator to a popular campus bar. Foul play has still not been ruled out. This one is worth looking up — it's a lot. And nothing the husband has said adds up." Angela Green was a 51-year-old mom who disappeared under inexplicable circumstances in June 2019. She was last seen at her home in Prairie Village, Kansas, but was not reported missing until some months later. Ellie says she eventually tried to get her mother's death certificate and discovered the State of Kansas had no record that Angela died." After her father's story became 'even more unbelievable,' Ellie filed a missing person's report. Authorities have since investigated more than 150 leads; however, Angela remains missing. Wells was a 5-year-old who was last seen at her home on Ben Hill Road in Rogersville, Tennessee, where she lived with her parents and older brothers in June 2021. According to Fox News, "Don Wells and his wife maintain their belief that their daughter was kidnapped from their home in the presence of her family, who did not witness anyone at the property at the time." After that, the police found a multi-generational incestuous pedophilic trafficking ring in her family where the adults would get the kids hooked on hard drugs at a very young age. Brittney Wood was a 19-year-old single mom who disappeared on May 30, 2012, in southwestern Alabama. According to WKRG, "On that day, Brittney left her mother's home and headed to visit her uncle Donnie Holland. Two days later, Holland was found in his truck off of a beaten path with a gunshot to the head. In the wake of Brittney's disappearance, 11 people were arrested on sex abuse charges, including members of her family and family friends." Although there have been tips and some leads over the years, her case remains unsolved. "She was a  well-known British TV presenter who was shot dead on her London doorstep in broad daylight, and 24 years later, it remains an unsolved case." Jill Dando was 37 years old when she was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, an area of London, on April 26, 1999. A man named Barry George was eventually arrested for murder, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison in 2001. Although many other theories exist, including ones involving various hitmen, the case remains unsolved. It is incredibly likely that a couple killed her, as she had been having an affair with the married older man, but her body is still missing. There was a lot of victim-blaming in her case, which is horrific." According to WMBF News, "Elvis was last seen or heard from on Dec. 18, 2013. It was revealed that Sidney Moorer and Elvis had an affair from July 2013 until late October or early November 2013. Documents show that during the early morning hours of Dec. 18, 2013, Sidney Moorer and Elvis had been in communication. There were also suspicions that Elvis was possibly pregnant when a surveillance video from Walmart that morning showed Sidney Moorer buying a pregnancy test. Tammy Moorer was found guilty of kidnapping Elvis in October 2018, while Sidney Moorer was found guilty in September 2019. Both appealed to have their convictions overturned, but were denied in 2023. "She was a preschool teacher from South Dakota. Police had proof of life and found her deceased not long after. Alicia Hummel was 29 years old when her body was found in the Missouri River near Vermillion, South Dakota on June 1, 2015. According to Keloland News, "An autopsy was done, revealing that she drowned, but investigators ruled her death a homicide as the autopsy also revealed that she sustained injuries to her head and a cut on her neck." "This happened in Bloomington, Indiana, it is also a weird one." According to WISH-TV, "Spierer vanished on June 3, 2011, after a night of partying with friends at a bar in Bloomington. Police said she was last seen leaving a friend's place. They say she left alone and was walking back to her apartment when something happened. Investigators say a male friend reported the Indiana University student missing." Although there have been many theories over the years, "Her body has never been found and police have not made any arrests in the case. Investigators have received more than 800 tips and executed 10 search warrants in recent years." "Where did he go, why did that officer not care about the car, the clothes any of it that night???" Landry, a Texas State student, went missing in December 2020, while driving home to Missouri City, Texas, for the holidays. His abandoned car was found wrecked and pinned against a tree, lights on, keys in the ignition, and clothes in the car, too. I'm a ‘99 grad of PSU who was working in town at the time. Early morning Nov. 1 she disappeared without a trace from her apartment. There's been nary a sighting or lead since." Song, a student at Penn State, disappeared on Halloween night in 2001. She reportedly went to a party that night dressed as a bunny and was last seen by friends who dropped her off at her apartment complex afterward. "Reports say she was seen arguing with someone in the parking lot of the salon (reports say it was her estranged husband), they got in her car, and she was never seen or heard from again. Her husband wasn't considered a person of interest, despite the fact that they had a domestic violence incident prior to her disappearance." Felicia Martin Cochran vanished from Pell City, Alabama, on June 11, 1992, after leaving her mother's home to go to a salon. The next day, her car was found burned and abandoned on a rural road in Talladega County, but Felicia was never located. The case had a couple of suspicious leads over the years — including an unknown girl calling the police to say she's Anthonette and a suspected sighting in Carson City, Nevada — but none of these leads ever panned out. But the circumstances leading up to her disappearance are very strange. Her car was found abandoned in a rural area on Reuben Mountain Road, a few miles past Grave Creek Boat Landing in Josephine County in September, but as far as I know, nothing else has been reported on her case." Her vehicle was found months later, hidden deep in a forest. Her car was found at an apartment complex a mile away from where she lived, and there's even footage of someone parking it and walking away. Kess, a 24-year-old living in Orlando, Florida, went missing on Jan. 23, 2006. She was last seen leaving work around 6 p.m. and then spoke to her father on the drive home. She also talked on the phone with her boyfriend later. Kesse did not arrive at work the next day. "Literally vanished from a school playground with scores of people around." Dunahee vanished from a Victoria, B.C., playground on March 24, 1991, just steps from his parents, sparking one of Canada's largest missing-child investigations. His disappearance remains unsolved, though his family continues to raise awareness through the annual Keep the Hope Alive run and advocacy for missing children. Cooper is the pseudonym of an unidentified man who hijacked a plane on Nov. 24, 1971. The flight then took off again and headed for Mexico City. The hijacker has not been found to this day. However, there are many theories about who he was. (Side note: The hijacker bought his plane ticket under the name "Dan Cooper," and after a misunderstanding, people/the media thought it was "D.B. Cooper" and the wrong fake name has stuck ever since.) Note: Some submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The nascent search for radio transmissions from alien civilizations should focus not on planets, but on their alignments, according to new research from Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. NASA's Deep Space Network — three vast dishes in California, Spain and Australia — sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space. The theory, published this week in a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, goes that if Earth is sending messages to Mars, any star directly behind Mars would receive spillover radio transmissions — and realize where they're coming from. “Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,” said Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Eberly College of Science, science principal investigator of the NASA grant supporting this research and first author of the paper. SETI — the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — has so far found no definitive radio signals sent by extraterrestrial intelligence — but is constantly refining where to look and how to detect them. According to NASA, if the Milky Way galaxy were an ocean, then SETI would have listened to the equivalent of a small swimming pool within it. There may be other reasons to explain “The Great Silence” — the lack of any evidence for extraterrestrials — but all humans can do is be as clever as possible about where to look. “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures,” said Fan. The paper looked at 20 years' worth of transmissions between Earth and Mars, as well as between Earth and spacecraft positioned around the sun or at Sun-Earth Lagrange points — such as where the James Webb Space Telescope is. “Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions," said Fan. That's orders of magnitude more likely than detecting our signals from a random position. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.” It's hoped that NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal hundreds of thousands of previously undetected exoplanets — planets orbiting stars other than the sun — and reveal systems containing planets that align from Earth's point of view.</p>

Yet far too often, social justice takes a backseat while those in authority violate human rights. See all inspiring news on criminal justice system reform. Considering the vital role money plays both in our lives and in the world, our educational system teaches us very little about how money is created, how banks operate, and what causes the huge banking scandals and bankruptcies that have occurred. Furthermore, rising wealth inequality is a major issue of our time. We delve into all things related to financial system corruption. Technology is a powerful force that has helped shape and define human life since the very beginning. Yet when exploited, technology comes with environmental, human rights, and existential costs while Big Tech corporations profit immensely.

Beginning in 2004, the CIA established a vast network of at least 885 websites, ranging from Johnny Carson and Star Wars fan pages to online message boards about Rastafari. Spanning 29 languages and targeting at least 36 countries directly, these websites were aimed not only at adversaries such as China, Venezuela, and Russia, but also at allied nations ... showing that the United States treats its friends much like its foes. These websites served as cover for informants, offering some level of plausible deniability if casually examined. Informants in enemy nations, such as Venezuela, used sites like Noticias-Caracas and El Correo De Noticias to communicate with Langley, while Russian moles used My Online Game Source and TodaysNewsAndWeather-Ru.com, and other similar platforms. In 2010, USAID—a CIA front organization—secretly created the Cuban social media app, Zunzuneo. While the 885 fake websites were not established to influence public opinion, today, the U.S. government sponsors thousands of journalists worldwide for precisely this purpose. The Trump administration's decision to pause funding to USAID inadvertently exposed a network of more than 6,200 reporters working at nearly 1,000 news outlets or journalism organizations who were all quietly paid to promote pro-U.S. messaging in their countries. Facebook has hired dozens of former CIA officials to run its most sensitive operations. As the platform's senior misinformation manager, [Aaron Berman] ultimately has the final say over what content is promoted and what is demoted or deleted from Facebook. Until 2019, Berman was a high-ranking CIA officer, responsible for writing the president's daily security brief. Note: Dozens of former CIA agents hold top jobs at Google.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-sunscreen sentiment is cropping up on social media with alarming frequency. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. He might even (falsely) claim that, rather than protecting you from skin cancer, sunscreen increases the risk. Over on TikTok, this backlash against SPF (sun protection factor), known as the “anti-sunscreen movement”, has been brewing for a couple of years, but in the summer of 2025, it seems to have moved from a conspiratorial niche into something more mainstream. In the same month, actor and influencer Kelsey Parker revealed that she avoids using SPF on her children, too (she said she uses a homemade “organic” version instead, made from beeswax and “no bad stuff”). Recent research has suggested that Gen-Zers are particularly susceptible to sunscreen myths. Last year, a study from the American Academy of Dermatology found that 28 per cent of 18- to 26-year-olds believe that getting a tan is more important than the risk of skin cancer, with 37 per cent admitting to only using sunscreen when they're nagged by others to do so. And new data from health insurance provider Vitality found that 18 per cent of Gen Z respondents believed that you don't need sun protection if you tan easily (there's the myth of “good tolerance” again). UVA rays, he explains, “penetrate more deeply” into the skin and are responsible for signs of ageing, like wrinkles, sagging and pigmentation, while “UVB rays affect the surface, causing sunburn and direct DNA damage, which increases the risk of skin cancer”. Cancer Research UK estimates that 85 per cent of cases of melanoma (a type of skin cancer that develops in melanin-producing cells) are caused by overexposure to UV radiation; their analysis has also found that melanoma rates have increased by almost one-third over the past decade. A broad spectrum sunscreen, Perry adds, is designed to shield us against both UVA and UVB rays. There are two main types of sunscreen: those that use chemical filters, which “work by absorbing UV radiation and converting it into harmless heat”, and those that use mineral filters, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These “sit on the skin's surface to reflect and scatter rays away”. That's because a handful of studies have discovered UV filters such as oxybenzone and avobenzone in people's blood stream after applying sunscreen. These chemicals are benzophenones, a type of chemical that may influence the endocrine system, which is in charge of creating and releasing hormones in the body. And if you truly wanted to avoid benzophenones, you'd probably have to ditch half the contents of your washbag, because they're common in other makeup and skincare products too. Since sunscreen is used by so many people, even if there were a small negative effect, this would be very evident Consultant dermatologist Dr Magnus Lynch takes a similar view. “It is true that certain chemicals used within sunscreen can be absorbed in small quantities through the skin,” he says, “however, there is little evidence that these are harmful.” Plus, “since sunscreen is used by so many people, even if there were a small negative effect, this would be very evident”. And yet he is still seeing patients “who are scared to use SPF” now, after seeing “myths amplified on social media” by people with no medical expertise. “I do understand the appeal of natural products and avoiding chemicals”, he adds, but “the risks of sunlight exposure are far greater”. For those who are worried about chemicals, he suggests swapping to a mineral sunscreen instead. As for the idea of sun “tolerance” that seems to be cropping up all over social media? “A tan is a visible sign of DNA damage, not a shield.” It might provide, at best, “an SPF of roughly two to four, which is nowhere near adequate”, he adds (the NHS recommends using at least SPF 30). “Relying on this ‘tolerance' leads to cumulative damage, photoageing and higher skin cancer risk.” Another concern for dermatologists is influencers sharing at-home “sun care” recipes. Last year, for example, model Nara Smith shared a video in which she mixed up coconut oil, shea and cocoa butter, jojoba oil, beeswax and zinc oxide. “These homemade concoctions are not tested for UV protection, may offer inconsistent coverage, and could result in uneven or insufficient protection, raising the risk of burns and long-term damage,” Dr Perry says. Perry describes its use for sun protection as “complete nonsense and potentially very dangerous”. “Beef tallow has absolutely no SPF or UV-blocking properties, so applying it to your skin gives you zero protection against sunburn, sun damage or skin cancer,” he adds. He describes home remedies like these as not just ineffective but outright irresponsible, “because they give people a false sense of security in the sun, and that's when real damage occurs”. So why has sunscreen suddenly become the site of conspiracies? At the same time, there's been a fresh focus on “clean” or “natural” products, which, as Dr Anand puts it, “sometimes frames ‘chemical' as a synonym for ‘harmful', which is misleading”. Medical advice, Perry says, can often feel “technical or confusing, so myths and conspiracies offer an easier narrative, often framed as ‘big companies' trying to hide the truth'”. “Platforms like TikTok reward short, emotive messages,” says Dr Jonathan Kentley, consultant dermatologist at Montrose Clinic London and the Lister Hospital, so influencers attempt to craft “a catchy narrative that cuts through, even if it's completely untrue”. Throw in “a growing mistrust of institutions”, he adds, “and you have fertile ground for health misinformation to flourish. It's part of a wider trend: we're seeing ‘DIY wellness' and anti-medical narratives become popular online because they're framed as empowering and rebellious”. Unfortunately, though, Kentley adds, these narratives “often end up doing more harm than good. We as doctors are finding it increasingly challenging to present the facts in an age where many get their primary source of information from social media platforms”. And while “there is no case of cancer that has ever been linked to sunscreen”, he adds, “conversely, as a busy dermatologist, I can assure you that I have personally seen hundreds of cases of cancer caused by not wearing sunscreen”.
