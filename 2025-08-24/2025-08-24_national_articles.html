                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Law enforcement crackdown: President Donald Trump has said he plans to expand his law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to other parts of the country, starting with Chicago. • Deportation push: The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, a Department of Homeland Security official told his lawyers. The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador before being returned to the US in June, has served as a flashpoint in Trump's sweeping deportation efforts. A flurry of diplomacy but little concrete progress on ending the war has followed Trump's recent meetings with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. As President Donald Trump prepares to expand his crackdown on cities he claims are overrun with crime, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN the administration should focus on aiding local authorities with specific issues, not scoring political points. President Donald Trump has heightened his feud with Maryland Gov. In a series of social media posts, the president attacked Moore's record on crime and tied reconstruction funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to a political dispute over deploying the National Guard to major US cities. “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland' with him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk,'” he added. The post came after Moore publicly challenged Trump to visit Baltimore in response to the president's claims about rising crime in US cities. “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. ?” Trump wrote, referring to the Baltimore bridge that collapsed after being hit by a ship last year, killing six people. Trump has continued to group Democratic states and cities such as Baltimore with others he claims are in decline due to crime rates, though local officials have refuted some of his claims. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats are ready to ensure “Donald Trump cannot steal the midterm elections” on the back of GOP efforts to redraw congressional maps. Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash on the plan to redistrict in his state of New York, Jeffries said he's spoken with Gov. Jeffries also brushed off concerns that Republicans could redraw enough seats to ensure they successfully defend their House majority next year, pointing to Democrats' sweeping pickups in the midterm elections during Trump's first administration. “There's no way that Republicans can mathematically gerrymander their way to an artificial victory next year,” the minority leader said on CNN's State of the Union. Greg Abbott is expected to soon sign into law new congressional maps that could help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in the midterms. What the administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance defended the Texas GOP's move this morning, claiming in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” that it was an effort to make elections “more fair” and a response to Democratic gerrymandering. While both parties engage in the practice, Democrats have handed away their power to gerrymander in some states, including California, where a nonpartisan commission draws congressional maps. That's why Newsom's effort now requires a statewide referendum to succeed. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the Trump administration's plans to send National Guard troops into Chicago, telling CNN the president should not “play games” with people's lives. “We should continue to support local law enforcement, and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Some context: Trump said Friday he plans to widen his controversial law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities, singling out Chicago by name. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is also pushing back, saying federal intervention would only threaten to undo local efforts that have produced significant reductions in serious crimes. The search was part of a renewed investigation into whether Bolton disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, CNN previously reported. Vice President JD Vance is projecting optimism on the prospect of ending Russia's war in Ukraine, saying in a new interview that Russia has made “significant concessions” and the US will “keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.” “They've actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands,” Vance said of Moscow in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's “Meet the Press,” adding that it's clearer now what it will take to the end the war. The vice president's comments come as Russia-Ukraine peace talks appear to have stalled after some momentum earlier this month. President Donald Trump said last week that he could ultimately decide to walk away from negotiations, but Vance indicated the US will continue to be involved: “We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall, and if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.” Use of long-range weapons: Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia. “To be frank, we have not discussed such issues with the US recently,” Zelensky said, when asked about the reports at a Ukrainian Independence Day event. The Trump administration has been dogged by weeks of controversy over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, and that scrutiny continues this weekend. The committee has vowed to release them publicly, but only after lawmakers ensure they've made any further redactions needed to protect the victims. We don't currently have a timetable for that release. The DOJ also released transcripts and audio from its interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell last week — though she did not make any bombshell accusations or provide much revelatory information. DOJ is stonewalling,” Rep. Ro Khanna of California said in a statement yesterday. We'll bring you any further comment on the Epstein files from Trump administration officials and Democrats as they make the rounds this morning on Sunday political talk shows. As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump says he plans to widen the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities. Trump singled out Chicago in the Oval Office on Friday, and it has since emerged that his administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to the city, according to two officials who spoke with CNN. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Friday that he had not received any formal communication about the administration sending federal law enforcement or troops there, but that he takes the president's statements “seriously.” Federal intervention would threaten to undo local efforts that have already seen significant reductions in serious crimes, Johnson said. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Trump's move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June during protests against the administration was a “test case” for further overreach, as was his DC crackdown. I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers,” Bass told CNN. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded last week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House's immigration crackdown. “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,” Wu said. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today. • Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal “will be ready in the coming days,” following calls with several world leaders. Security guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv's western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia. • Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward “full-scale restoration” of the countries' relationship. In comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky. • Trump's deadline extended — again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart. Asked by CNN's Alayna Treene if there's a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn't come to the table, Trump said, “We'll see. Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments on Donald Trump's presidency. Trump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.” In case you missed this, the Texas Senate early Saturday morning approved new congressional maps designed to help Republicans win up to five more US House seats in next year's midterm elections. Greg Abbott, which has evolved into a national battle over partisan redistricting. “Let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” the notice read in part. “There is a perfectly reasonable option available, Costa Rica, where he his family can visit him easily, but instead they are attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language. The big picture: The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the US in June to face his charges, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's sweeping deportation push. Critics have pointed to the wrongful deportation as a prime example of what they say is a chaotic and cruel immigration crackdown, while the Trump administration has doubled down on its claims Abrego Garcia is a criminal with no right to remain in the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Sunday said that while Russia is prepared to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to further progress peace talks, it questions his legitimacy. When asked by NBC News host Kristen Welker whether Russia views Zelensky as the “legitimate leader” of Ukraine, Lavrov called Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s Ukrainian counterpart a “de facto head of the regime.” “We recognize him as de facto head of the regime. And in this capacity, we are ready to meet with him,” Lavrov said on Meet the Press in a recorded interview that aired Sunday morning. “When you come to a stage, when you have to sign documents, we would need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate,” he added. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly insisted that Zelensky, despite being democratically elected, is not a legitimate president because his five-year term expired in May 2024. Russia argues Zelensky lacks legal standing to sign any agreements because he has stayed in office for too long. After Zelensky and Putin separately met with President Donald Trump, Trump said he was attempting to arrange a face-to-face meeting between them. While Trump hopes a Zelensky-Putin bilateral summit will happen without his direct participation, Lavrov said there is no plans for such a meeting at this time. Meanwhile, Zelensky is actively seeking NATO-like security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression. The agreement would be a substitute for Ukraine's NATO membership, which Russia has strongly opposed. Security guarantees was a major topic discussed between Zelensky, Trump, and European leaders at the White House last week.</p>

When President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he faced the same formidable adversary that defined much of his first term: China. This time the stakes were even higher. The trade deficit with China had ballooned to roughly $300 billion, while IP protection, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial and international development practices remained significant issues. And Beijing doubled down – weaponizing its control of rare earth minerals, tightening its grip on semiconductors and wielding economic coercion against U.S. allies from Australia to Lithuania. Against this backdrop, Trump 47 adopted a two-pronged approach. On defense, it has wielded tariffs not only as bargaining chips but as engines of industrial revival – reshoring supply chains, rebuilding America's manufacturing base and hardening strategic alliances to reduce dependence on China. In a world where semiconductors and rare earths are the new oil, this is about nothing less than U.S. national security. I have seen firsthand how high-stakes these negotiations can be. As I recount in my forthcoming book, "A Seat at the Table," Chinese officials have long relied on psychological tactics, slow-walking responses through layers of bureaucracy, handing us last-minute drafts in Chinese – even removing chairs at negotiating tables. They are meant to unnerve, unsettle and push the U.S. team toward compromise. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. is standing up to its trade partner China. The Trump response was simple but powerful: don't flinch. In Beijing, when presented with a Chinese draft that ignored our work, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin waved it away and insisted the talks proceed on the American document. When a chair was removed to show disrespect, we calmly got it back – without ever conceding authority. That posture of confidence – staying the course under pressure – continues today in Trump 47. Tariffs are sharper, more targeted and higher than before; allied trade deals (Japan, South Korea, the EU) allow us to focus resources on China; and deadlines are extended when useful, but only on U.S. terms. But the broader truth is that tariffs are tools to rewire incentives, drive investment back home, and ensure the United States does not remain vulnerable in sectors critical to survival. Already, the tariffs of Trump 47 are accelerating investment in domestic chip foundries, battery plants and energy infrastructure. They are also forcing hard conversations with allies about aligning supply chains – from rare earth processing in Australia to semiconductor alliances with Japan and the Netherlands. The message is clear: America will not be held hostage to coercion. Strategic autonomy requires resilience, even if it comes with short-term discomfort. For me, the source I found was the timeless wisdom of "Kedushas Levi," an 18th-century Chassidic work by Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev. The "Kedushas Levi" teaches that challenges – no matter how overwhelming – are never insurmountable. That teaching, echoing the Talmudic reality that the good Lord gives trials in proportion to a person's strength, gave me composure when sprinting to translate a Chinese draft in a Beijing motorcade, or when facing off with officials determined to stall and delay. It also teaches that truth, even when inconvenient, carries divine weight. When Chinese officials resisted opening their financial markets, I pointed out the obvious but often ignored truth: Chinese banks in the U.S. had seen double- and triple-digit growth, while U.S. banks in China struggled for even single digits. That argument broke through where posturing could not. Silk's new book, "A Seat at the Table: An Inside Account of Trump's Global Economic Revolution." Negotiations with China will not be wrapped up overnight. And here, the lessons of faith matter most. Facing giants, the Jewish tradition teaches, you do not shrink back. You lift your head high, stand on truth, and trust that what feels impossible can indeed be achieved. That is how we approached China in Trump 45. That is how we are approaching China in Trump 47. Silk served as assistant secretary for International Markets at the U.S. Treasury during the first term of President Donald Trump. His forthcoming book, "A Seat at the Table: An Inside Account of Trump's Global Economic Revolution," will be published by Post Hill Press in September 2025.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses boys suspended over an incident involving a transgender student in a locker room on 'The Faulkner Focus.' Both were rejected by school officials, who only approved a third non-religious version. "I put in three drawings that I did, and the first drawing was a drawing of this mountain called Salvation Mountain," Steffans told CBN. "And when I handed it in, they said… completely no to it because it had crosses, a Bible verse, and just a lot of religion that they said that wasn't allowed." A Christian student said her high school initially rejected her parking space designs because they featured Bible verses and crosses. "They finally agreed to… the last one, which had no Bible verses, no crosses, or anything," the student added. The group said it sent a demand letter arguing that the student had a constitutional right to religious expression. Days later, First Liberty announced the district had changed course and would allow Steffans' original design. "We are pleased the school district changed course and will allow Sabrina to truly express her deeply held beliefs in her design," Keisha Russell, senior counsel at First Liberty, said in a press release Wednesday. "The First Amendment protects students' private expressions of faith in public schools." Legal group First Liberty announced Wednesday that a New York high school will now allow a high school senior to decorate her parking space with a religious design after initially rejecting it. Grand Island Central School District Superintendent Brian Graham said the district was committed to fostering an inclusive environment that respects students and disputed that it violated students' rights. After consulting legal counsel, he said the school agreed to permit Steffans' design. "We also take seriously our responsibility to uphold constitutional principles, including the First Amendment," Graham wrote in a statement to CBN. "While we strongly dispute any assertion that our policies or decisions violated the rights of any student, the Board of Education and District leadership, after careful consultation with legal counsel, have decided that the student in question will be permitted to proceed with her original senior parking space design." He added the district will review its parking space program to determine whether changes are needed. Graham did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss the possible reclassification and the early warning signs for colon cancer. Officials last week dismantled a sprawling illegal marijuana cultivation site hidden deep inside Sequoia National Park, hauling out thousands of plants and nearly a ton of toxic debris that had scarred the wilderness. Crews removed 2,377 full-grown marijuana plants and nearly 2,000 pounds of trash and infrastructure from a site that damaged roughly 13 acres in the protected California parkland, the National Park Service (NPS) said on Thursday. Much of the material was removed by hand and lifted out by helicopter by NPS law enforcement rangers as well as Bureau of Land Management special agents, the agency added. Authorities said the cultivation bore the hallmarks of a well-organized drug-trafficking operation—the kind that has plagued Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks for nearly 20 years. In that time, officials eradicated close to 300,000 plants worth an estimated $850 million inside the two parks. Authorities first discovered the marijuana farm in 2024, and while they raided it at the time they did not remove it entirely until this year due to the presence of dangerous chemicals, according to NPS. When crews returned this year, they found a semi-automatic pistol, makeshift campsites with kitchen areas and chemicals including approximately a gallon of the insecticide Methamidophos, which was banned in the U.S. more than 15 years ago. A federal law enforcement ranger scopes out an illegal marijuana cultivation site at Sequoia National Park. Rangers also found far more than just the marijuana plants, documenting that they observed evidence of poaching, the clearing out of natural vegetation, nearly two miles of illegal trails, terraced grow plots carved into the hillside, and large pits that appeared to have been created to store water that was diverted from a nearby creek. Sequoia National Park in California has been the site of drug-trafficking operations for nearly two decades, officials say. Runoff from the site may have been contaminated by a large variety of pesticides that were used in growing marijuana, the NPS said, potentially exposing both park visitors and wildlife to toxic materials. The National Park Service said they found nearly one ton of garbage, as well as dangerous chemicals, at a marijuana growing site that was hidden in Sequoia National Park. Creeks siphoned to supply water for both the crops and camps would have otherwise nurtured wildlife and park vegetation, the NPS said. Each marijuana plant can consume six to eight gallons of water per day, the agency added, citing the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Fox News Digital reached out to the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management for more information. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about illegal cultivation on park land is asked to call the NPS tip line at 888-653-0009. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the debate over an increase in teacher salaries on 'Fox Report.' Amid a trend of declining membership since the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union dues, the nation's two largest teachers' unions have poured tens of millions into left-wing causes, a new report from a conservative watchdog group finds. The national nonprofit group, Defending Ed, released a report this week after combing through the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers' contributions to left-wing and far-left groups. The nonprofit found that the two unions spent a combined $43.5 million since 2022 to help fund state and federal political action committees and other ideologically left-wing entities, such as D.C. think tanks. "It is clear that the teachers unions' priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children," Defending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley told Fox News Digital. "This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics." The unions also forked over significant amounts of cash for groups that focus on supporting left-wing candidates for public office, such as the Democratic Governors Association, Democrat's House Majority and Senate Majority PACs. Other groups they have donated to include major left-wing think tanks like the Center for American Progress and its 501(c)(4) arm, which received close to a million dollars since 2022 from the two unions. Randi Weingarten and Becky Pringle speak during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024. Aaron Withe, an expert on public-sector unions, pointed out that the National Education Association spends less than 10% of its budget on what he called "representational activities," while, at the same time, the union spends 38% of its budget on contributions to left-leaning groups, lobbying and political gifts. "You'd think in light of the decline in union membership in recent years, that they'd start providing value to members that outweighs the cost of membership," Withe told Fox News Digital. "Instead, they are appeasing the radical base of union members by advocating for men in women's sports, transitioning minors, antisemitism and other radical ideological stances." He added that this is just "the tip of the iceberg" too "when you consider that there are thousands of statewide and city and county teachers unions that are mostly funding the same causes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A wild idea would treat carbon waste like cash. This story was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. At last count, in three locations — Denver, Fort Knox, and West Point— it had socked away 248,046,115.696 troy ounces of gold. One might think to round that to the nearest ounce, but at today's prices, that extra 0.304 ounces of gold would fetch about $1,060, and the entire hoard is worth more than $865 billion. There's not much practical sense in keeping all this treasure around, though. Peebles, who is American, has been thinking about this a lot. Because, if people can unearth vast amounts of a “profane” commodity such as gold, build an economy around it, and then take most of that gold out of circulation and into the realm of the sacred, why couldn't we do the same thing with other profane commodities — like excess atmospheric carbon? The world's wealthiest 10 percent are responsible for two-thirds of global carbon emissions, but the comfort class hasn't shown much willingness to change its behavior. Nor have governments done enough — the Trump administration is now taking us backward — and industrial polluters aren't about to do the right thing. Tech solutions like direct air capture are pricey and problematic, as this magazine has reported. But if we could convince the masses that waste carbon dioxide is sacred and worth hoarding — like gold — one of our most existential problems might solve itself. The result is a thought-provoking new book, The First and Last Bank, which weaves in aspects of history, monetary policy, philosophy, and religion to make its case. A utopian case perhaps, but Peebles insists that the necessary structures and precedents already exist. Peebles was visiting his friend in the Adirondacks, where Luzzatto was working on conceptual projects related to environmental sustainability, when a lightbulb flicked on. “Sitting around the campfire at night, we sort of had this a-ha experience about the gold standard and how it can serve as a beta test,” he recalls. And that's just hasn't been interesting to economists for some reason.” But wait, banking carbon — what would that look like in practice? Consider all the cellulosic carbon waste — corn stalks and such — that farmers clear from their fields in large quantities after every harvest. Put these carbon-rich materials into a big machine called a pyrolizer and heat it in the absence of oxygen, and you end up with a stable, solid form of carbon known as biochar. Biochar is already a commodity with myriad uses — as a yield-improving soil amendment for farms and garden, as a building insulator, as an absorptive agent for water filtration and wastewater treatment. It can also be stored in rural warehouses or simply buried, locking away waste carbon for hundreds of years depending on its composition and surroundings — which is why it plays a growing role in today's market for carbon offsets. Their idea is not one-size-fits-all but, very broadly, they envision small communities — churches, towns, colleges, etc. — creating their own cooperative carbon banks to accept organic waste from depositors (locals and businesses). The bank would pyrolize and quantify these deposits on site. “It would be like the gold assayers of old. Instead of risk managers at Wall Street banks, we would need a soil scientist,” Peebles explains. The depositors, in exchange, would receive digital currency they could trade for goods and services within that community — something akin to a cryptocurrency, but grounded in a commodity with real-world value. Companies looking to boost their environmental bona fides would open their own accounts at the bank, whose verification process would be transparent and verifiable — unlike many of the fraudulent schemes in today's carbon-credit markets. Community members with no organic waste to deposit could buy into these local currency systems by opening accounts and depositing dollars, thereby supporting the sequestration mission, and getting fungible digital tokens in return. In the authors' optimistic vision, a grassroots movement would emerge organically from at first a handful — then tens, hundreds, and thousands — of these community efforts. “It's a little-known fact that colleges and banks used to issue their own currencies — it was very common in America in the 19th century, so we think the movement could start at a college,” Peebles told me. “It could be part of a curriculum with a bunch of 20-somethings who want to think about what it would look like to run a carbon bank, and the college could backstop it with dollars so the local merchants were interested in joining the community of exchange.” The 49ers' quest to dig up gold was, of course, motivated by greed. One might then argue that waste carbon won't ever be valuable enough for people to want to bother collecting it. Famously, in the first real-world Bitcoin transaction, in May 2010, a Florida software developer named Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 coins for a couple of Papa John's pizzas. Those Bitcoins, then valued at about $41, would fetch nearly $1.2 billion today. In any case, the carbon banking idea pairs a collective feel-good element with modest financial benefits. Homeowners and small commercial entities typically pay to dispose of yard waste via local taxes or fees. In this scheme, they get something of value back — both monetary and spiritual, perhaps. Again, some participants would contribute cash to bolster the effort. “If we bring our collective buying power together and we say that we want to pay a higher price than what the carbon waste is worth, that will create a centrifugal movement of carbon waste into our banks,” Peebles says. Checking people's deposits for legitimacy is part of the assayer's role, Peebles says. “There are ways of spotting, you know, is it fresh wood that was alive yesterday?” What's more, local forestland, properly managed, could become part of a given bank's carbon reserves. “We only propose biochar as a transitionary tactic because it mimics the gold standard,” he says. But ultimately the banks will incorporate other ways to sequester carbon — say, untapped oil and gas that a landowner opts to leave in the ground. The authors don't foresee a mad Carbon Rush, “but we do think people might be hungry for a meaningful way of doing their part for the climate battle. Both are necessary, and we think this is more like that — instead of a gold rush.” First, “it's actually not that easy to make good biochar,” Peebles says. It requires time and effort to get it right, “so that's not as abundant as carbon itself.” What's more, the gold standard was abandoned in part because people were hoarding gold: “It became too scarce, and so it couldn't expand with the economy.” Central banks, too, know how to deal with overabundance problems via the monetary technique of “sterilization.” In 1936 and 1937, for example, as excess foreign gold flowed into US banks, the Federal Reserve, fearing inflation, ordered banks to beef up the reserves they kept on hand and issued bonds to sop up the excess money in circulation. In fact, when the authors finished their manuscript, they asked a macroeconomist to read it and offer critiques. He thought the carbon banks were a great idea and he asked, according to Peebles, “Why wouldn't we just ask the Fed to do it?” “Forty years ago, maybe we would have asked, but we're not going to wait around for them to move,” Peebles says. “We think building a grassroots banking system would be the one thing that might make the Fed wake up and say, ‘Huh, okay, now we have a threat.' These carbon banks are a threat to our system because they're growing.” “We have the tools to build this locally, and I would love for the Fed to do this, but I don't think they're going to do it until we build it ourselves,” Peebles says. Yet it still sounds so far-fetched, doesn't it — in this era of rampant disinformation and unchecked greed, with a federal government openly hostile to protecting the environment and safeguarding the health of its land and people — that a utopian economic movement could spring up and alter our collision course with the laws of nature? Then again, every social movement begin as a longshot. We had the US civil rights movement, of course. “It's gone through multiple crises, but the Euro is still around because a certain group of people is committed to it. And that was started by a small group of acolytes who were enthusiastic about a vision and pushed it forward.” “We don't need everyone to be excited about this right off the bat,” he says. Ford may just be building the EV we've all been waiting for. It probably has nothing to do with saving animals. Herds in North America will likely be hit the hardest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When members of the Democratic National Committee convene in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Monday, they'll face a host of troubles, both domestic and foreign, hanging over their summer meeting. They're also facing another sizable voter registration gap against Republicans among states with publicly available data. Some leaders have been hesitant to embrace Zohran Mamdani, who has been critical of Israel's treatment of the Gaza Strip, in his bid to become New York City's next mayor. “This is not the first time that each of us has gone to a DNC meeting where we have a number of issues that need to be tackled,” said John Verdejo, a North Carolina DNC member. And this is not unlike those other meetings.” But the three-day summer meeting from Aug. 25 to 27 will at least have one issue Democrats won't have to worry about: David Hogg. The former DNC vice chairman stepped down earlier this year as it became clear he would not prevail during a new election to elect two vice chairs. “Of course, I'm hoping that the party will right the ship, get structure down, be more disciplined,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns. We need to have relationships with donors,'” he said. “We are sending a strong message that our party is building from the ground up and we're building everywhere,” Martin said at the time. A recent report from the New York Times details a Democratic Party that has lost voter registration ground to the GOP in 30 states. In Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, important battleground states that will sway the 2026 and 2028 elections, Democrats also saw their lead slip. The DNC announced this week that it was rolling out new tools, technology, and pilot programs to better organize voters and volunteers for the first time in nearly 20 years. “We also need to go double down on our message, make it more attractive for folks to join the Democratic Party, to register as a Democrat, versus coming in and registering as independent or Republican,” added Verdejo. Neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite both lawmakers representing New York. Other prominent Democratic New Yorkers, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. However, former President Barack Obama and Mamdani did speak by phone in June after he won the primary. Mamdani has raised more than $1 million, much of it from small donors, an indication of strong support among New Yorkers and Democrats. Democrats are also dealing with another battle over the party's direction after the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which Martin used to chair, rescinded its endorsement of Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor due to a voting system error. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the more progressive voices in the party, was among a list of DFL lawmakers who criticized the decision to strip Fateh, another socialist, of his endorsement. “Not only does this decision set an extremely dangerous precedent, it will undermine the DFL endorsing process going forward and fails to center the will of delegates.” During the summer meeting, DNC members will vote on two separate Gaza resolutions, one put forth by Martin and the other championed by more progressive members. The other resolution calls for an end to military aid to Israel and pushes for Palestinian statehood, neither of which will get traction with a GOP-controlled Washington. As images of starving children in Gaza spread and accusations of famine have tilted the tide against Israel, more Democrats have been willing to break their allegiance to the Middle Eastern nation. Democrats don't expect the issue to be solved at their summer meeting. “This is an issue that has been ongoing since Jesus walked the Earth,” said Verdejo. “Even the best folks who are diplomats who work at the [United Nations] have yet to figure this out.” But tensions over how Democrats approach the conflict have not abated since protesters heckled both former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. At the DNC winter meeting earlier this year in National Harbor, Maryland, protesters repeatedly interrupted meetings and debates among the chair candidates. “Gaza hasn't really changed a whole lot since February. And so I think the same passionate, caring human beings who were outside where we were at in Maryland are going to be in that room,” said Ceraso. Democrats will face a tough congressional map during the 2026 midterm elections if several GOP states successfully implement mid-decade redrawings. Texas began the redistricting race by creating five extra GOP House seats via a new congressional map that is all but certain to get signed into law despite Democratic stalling efforts. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) countered by signing two redistricting bills Thursday to redraw a new congressional map in California. Yet Democrats still have more problems if other Republican-led states, such as Indiana, Missouri, and Florida, create more GOP-friendly districts. “They're not going to stop with Texas, we know that,” added Newsom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge in Mexico said boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. will stand trial over alleged cartel ties and arms trafficking, but could await that trial outside of detention, the boxer's lawyer said. Chávez's lawyer, Rubén Fernando Benítez Alvarez, confirmed that the court imposed additional measures and granted three months of further investigation into the case. If convicted, Chávez — who took part in the hearing virtually from a detention facility — could face a prison sentence of between four and eight years, Alvarez said. Chávez, 39, who had been living in the United States for several years, was arrested in early July by federal agents outside his Los Angeles home for overstaying his visa and providing inaccurate details on an application to obtain a green card. The arrest came just days after a fight he had with famed American boxer Jake Paul in Los Angeles. Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. detained by ICE and on track to be deported just days after fighting Jake Paul Since 2019, Mexican prosecutors have been investigating the boxer following a complaint filed by US authorities against the Sinaloa Cartel for organized crime, human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking. The case led to investigations against 13 people, among them Ovidio Guzmán López — the son of convicted drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán — along with some collaborators, hitmen and accomplices of the criminal organization. Guzmán López was arrested in January 2023 and extradited to the US eight months later. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Chávez was wanted since 2023 in Mexico, but that he wasn't detained because he spent most of the time in the US. “The hope is that he will be deported and serve the sentence in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said in July. The high profile case come as the Trump administration is pressuring Mexico to crack down on organized crime, canceling visas of notable Mexican artists and celebrities and ramping up deportations. He was arrested last year for weapons possession. He was released shortly afterward upon posting $50,000 bail, on the condition that he attend a facility to receive treatment for his addiction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to President Donald Trump, foreign countries and overseas businesses are eating the cost. “It been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury's coffers,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, earlier this month. “Also, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren't even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs.” Trump's post did not include any substantiation for his claims. There is a growing field of evidence to the contrary: Economic data, academic research, businesses' expenses, and people's first-hand experiences are showing that it's American firms and consumers who are seeing increasingly higher costs due to the tariffs. That burden is expected to grow only heavier in the months — and, potentially, years — to come as more tariffs take effect, and others settle more deeply into supply chains. If foreign exporters are absorbing tariff costs, one possible way to see that in US economic data is whether they're lowering their pre-tariff export prices. If that's the case, it would show up as lower or falling US import prices. They've risen by 0.5% since the November election and by 0.2% since March, after which the bulk of new tariffs were announced, according to a recent note from Pantheon Macroeconomics. “One argument that had looked plausible until recently was that import prices had been supported by pre-tariff stockpiling in [the last part of 2024 and the first three months of 2025], which saw goods imports soar to record highs,” Pantheon economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen wrote in an August 19 note. But import prices have remained resilient despite goods imports dropping back very sharply in [the second quarter], suggesting a steep decline in prices ahead is unlikely.” A more granular look at import price data indicates that there's a slight dip in import prices from China; however, for the vast majority of countries, it's basically been flat, Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, told CNN in an interview. They now have to figure out, ‘How much of this can I take on, and how much of this will I pass on?” To this point, consumers have been mostly shielded from starkly higher prices. There's a laundry list of reasons why tariff-driven price hikes are a slow boil: Businesses loaded up their warehouses with pre-tariffed goods; higher costs have been split by entities along the supply chain, lessening the blow at the retail store; and Trump's fits-and-starts approach to tariffs has meant that the bulk of them did not go into effect for months, and many items are exempted (for at least now). At the same time, inflation has remained relatively tame for both good and not-so-good reasons: Ongoing deflationary trends in key areas, marking a continued unwinding from pandemic-era shortages and price spikes; falling gas prices (they're down 9.5% from July of last year) amid global economic uncertainty; and then because of depressed consumer demand in areas such as travel. Still, recent Consumer Price Index inflation reports reveal increases in the cost of certain imports the United States relies on heavily, including household furnishings, linens, tools, toys and sporting goods. As of August 8, imported goods cost 5% more than pre-tariff trends predicted and domestically produced goods are running 3% higher, according to newly released research from Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo and colleagues. “But a year from now, maybe two years from now, we'll notice that consumers ended up paying a significant amount of the tariffs even if they didn't notice the increases right away.” New research last week from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that businesses — those directly exposed to tariffs and those who are not — expect to raise prices this year. By mid-May, those estimates shot up to 3.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed, which found that little difference existed in the price growth expectations of firms with or without foreign exposure. However, the survey showed some starker increases expected among services, providing firms, which prompted questions around whether these price increases could deliver an inflationary impulse as was seen three years ago . That is, will price pressures spread beyond only the prices that are directly affected by increased import duties?” Atlanta Fed researchers wrote in the report. “Businesses say they're working both with suppliers and consumers to help share some of the cost burden,” Bush said. But I think as the realization sets in that these tariffs are not going back down, they will start to pass more on to consumers.” The world's largest retailer said as much on Thursday: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said that the company's costs have risen every week because of tariffs but will aim to keep prices down “for as long as we can.” Small increases over time could make it easier for some consumers to handle; however, to others — especially those with little to no wiggle room in their budgets — that slow burn could very well feel like a slow bleed. “Lower-income Americans are sadly adept at juggling their expenses and trying to make every dime count,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in an email to CNN. “They may go without meat or coffee one week in order to buy shoes for their kids. It's a constant juggle where they allocate money to their most urgent need at that moment.” Retailers and major brands know that many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, so they're using “sneakflation” to pass along the tariffs in small increments in hopes that consumers won't notice or will be able to better absorb it, Long added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sex workers and transgender people are among South Africa's most vulnerable populations after the Trump administration slashed U.S. foreign aid and U.S.-funded health clinics dispensing HIV medication shut down. South Africa has more people living with HIV than any other country. But some sex workers and others tell The Associated Press they have been turned away from public hospitals or discriminated against as they try to find HIV medication. A 37-year-old HIV-positive sex worker and mother of three, who requested anonymity, looks out her window in Johannesburg, South Africa, Monday, June 23, 2025. An HIV-positive sex worker who requested anonymity, holds a government supplied antiretroviral drugs in Johannesburg, South Africa, Friday, June 20, 2025. A 36-year-old HIV-positive sex worker and mother of one who requested anonymity, shows a antiretroviral drug bought illegally on the blackmarket in Johannesburg, South Africa, Friday, June 20, 2025. JOHANNESBURG (AP) — On a warm evening in Johannesburg, the news spread like wildfire among sex workers: Within 24 hours, several nonprofit clinics providing free HIV services would be closing as President Donald Trump announced the United States was slashing foreign aid. Some South Africans living with, or at risk of, HIV secured supplies of life-saving drugs just in time. Half a year later, the country with more people living with HIV than any other is struggling to treat its most vulnerable. Sex workers, among the most vulnerable South Africans as their work is illegal, and transgender people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from families or communities. They described a new world of difficulty in obtaining HIV medication or the preventive medicine for people at risk of HIV. One HIV-positive sex worker and mother of three said she was off medication for almost four months after being turned away from public hospitals, which the government's health department says should not be happening. “The only thing that I could think of was my kids, and that I am going to die, and how am I going to explain to my kids that I am sick because of the line of work that I chose?” she said. The 37-year-old said she finally obtained a month's supply of medication in June from a mobile clinic that was introduced after the funding cuts. Another HIV-positive sex worker said she had resorted to illegally buying medication on the black market, where the pills have nearly doubled in price. The U.S. has since issued a limited waiver allowing the resumption of certain life-saving HIV services globally, but the dismantling of much of U.S. foreign aid has created chaos. And for many people affected, harm is already done. A major challenge for those who lost access to the U.S.-funded nonprofit clinics is finding help elsewhere, including public hospitals. “I have tried local clinics, three of them, and I have been refused treatment because I don't have a referral letter from my previous clinic,” the 37-year-old sex worker said. Kate Rees, a public health specialist at Anova Health Institute in Johannesburg, said while it's ideal to have a transfer letter, it's not needed and people can't be turned away. “But people at the clinic, whether it's nurses, security guards, doctors, whoever actually, do turn them away,” Rees said. In response to AP questions, Foster Mohale, a spokesperson for South Africa's health department, said they were not aware of anyone who had been turned away and encouraged people to go to the nearest public health facility. Another challenge at public hospitals and clinics is discrimination, especially for sex workers and transgender people. “In hospital, they said they only give PrEP to people who are in a relationship with someone who's HIV-positive and trying to have a baby,” one transgender woman said. “I am not going back to the clinic, with people who are going to make fun of me, like I'm a clown,” she said. The health department didn't respond to questions on that issue. Not everyone can afford to buy medication privately or on the black market, where a bottle reportedly goes for about $25 — and whose contents might be unverified. The withdrawal from regular health care by sex workers and others means that many are no longer being tested and don't know what level of the virus they have in body fluids — and whether they can pass it on to others. Even before the U.S. cuts, about 2 million of South Africa's estimated 8 million people living with HIV were never on medication. Yvette Raphael, co-founder of the local Advocacy for Prevention of HIV and AIDS group, said she and fellow activists are worried that South Africa could go backwards. Among South Africans, some wonder whether Trump's stance may have been influenced by their countryman Elon Musk, who oversaw the early efforts to cut U.S. aid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations would continue after Florida's “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention facility was ordered to be shut down within 60 days. The Trump administration was handed a legal setback on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the shutdown of the large-scale detention facility, saying it violated a federal law that requires an environmental review before any major federal construction project. But [the] bottom line is, we're going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national security threats every day across this country,” he said in an interview with NewsNation. Homan added that migrants could simply be moved to another facility, though he did not specify where that would be. So, we're going to build 100,000 beds, so we're not going to have a lack of bed space,” the border czar said. He also slammed Judge Kathleen M. Williams, who issued the order, as “radical,” echoing other remarks from Florida officials including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), who blasted Williams as an “activist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench.” DeSantis has been optimistic that the state's appeal will succeed, however. “We're not going to be deterred; we're totally in the right on this,” he said on Friday. We're going to continue working on the deportations, advancing that mission.”</p>
