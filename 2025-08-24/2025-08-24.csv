            Israel struck Yemen's Houthis on Sunday after the Iran-backed rebels fired a new type of missile at Israel.
    


            The Israeli military said it struck a military site where the presidential palace is located, as well as two power plants and a fuel storage site.
    


            Initial reports from the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV indicated that at least two people were killed and five wounded in the attack.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “the strikes were conducted in response to repeated attacks by the Houthi terrorist regime against the State of Israel and its civilians.”
    


            More than 10 fighter jets participated in the strikes, according to an Israeli air force official, who said the furthest target was approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) from Israel.
    


            Al-Masirah said there was “Zionist aggression ongoing on the capital Sanaa,” a city controlled by the Houthis.
    


            A member of the Houthi leadership, Mohammad al-Farrah said that the Houthis would continue to support the people of Gaza and would “not retreat from it until the aggression is lifted, the siege is broken, and the starvation of Gaza's people is stopped.”
    


            The strikes follow the Houthis' launch of a missile against Israel on Friday.
    


            An Israeli air force official said that for the first time, a Houthi missile contained a number of sub-munitions, which were intended to be detonated upon impact.
    


            Police in the Tel Aviv district said Friday they were several sites where interception fragments had landed. No injuries were reported.

US President Donald Trump has delivered a “brutal wake-up call” to the EU, shattering the bloc's illusion of geopolitical power rooted in its economic might, ex-Italian Prime Minister and former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has said, warning that the bloc must undergo major reforms to remain relevant.

Trump has pressured the bloc's NATO members to boost military spending, forced Brussels into a new trade deal that imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports, scraps duties on US industrial goods, and opens wide market access to American products.

The deal has sparked a backlash from current and former EU officials, who say it heavily favors Washington.

“For years, the EU believed that its economic size, with 450 million consumers, brought with it geopolitical power and influence in international trade relations. This year will be remembered as the year in which this illusion evaporated,” Draghi said at a conference in Rimini on Friday.

Trump's broader policies have left the EU with only a “marginal” role in Ukraine peace efforts, reduced it to a passive “observer” in Gaza and Iran, and prompted China to “make it clear that it does not consider Europe an equal partner,” he added.

“These events have done justice to any illusion that the economic dimension alone ensured any form of geopolitical power,” Draghi stated. “Trump has given us a brutal wake-up call – the thing to do is to pull ourselves together.”

Draghi claimed the bloc's weakness lies in its “passivity and rigidity” and urged internal reform. He warned that reverting to national sovereignty could “further expose us to the will of great powers,” and instead called for scrapping internal trade barriers and issuing common debt to fund defense, infrastructure, and innovation.

Critics have argued that common debt could erode national control over finances and spark division within the EU, as wealthier members may resent covering costs for poorer southern nations seen as fiscally undisciplined. However, experts, including the International Monetary Fund, warned that without reforms addressing key structural challenges, the EU faces stagnation.

US President Donald Trump has announced the appointment of a new ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs. Sergio Gor, who originates from the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, has served the Trump administration as Director of Presidential Personnel, playing a critical role in recruitment, and is regarded as one of the president's most trusted advisers. Announcing the move on social media, Trump described Gor as a “great friend” and longtime ally, praising his loyalty and work within the administration. “Sergio's role as Director of Presidential Personnel has been essential to delivering on the unprecedented Mandate that we received from the American People,” he wrote on Friday. “For the most populous Region in the World, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my Agenda and help us, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”

Gor's nomination comes amid strained ties between Washington and New Delhi, with Trump threatening sweeping tariffs on Indian goods and additional penalties over India's purchases of Russian oil. A person familiar with the matter told Politico the appointment is meant as “a powerful signal to the Modi government” that negotiations should be serious and that messages “come from the president.” Born in 1986 in Tashkent as Sergey Gorokhovsky, Gor spent part of his childhood in Malta before moving to the United States in 1999. He attended high school in Los Angeles and later studied at George Washington University in Washington, where he became active in conservative politics. He went on to build a career in Republican circles before rising to Trump's inner circle. According to the Times of India, the announcement was met with a “muted response,” with External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying only that he had “read about it.” Following the announcement, Gor said he was “beyond grateful” to Trump for “his incredible trust and confidence.” ”Nothing has made me prouder than to serve the American people through the GREAT work of this Administration,” he wrote on X.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is “aware” of reports about a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant (NPP) in Russia, which it said started due to “military activity.”

Russian officials earlier said that the plant, located about 50km from the border with Ukraine, had been targeted by a drone raid.

Air defense forces overnight reportedly intercepted a Ukrainian UAV which detonated on impact near the Kursk NPP, damaging an auxiliary transformer and triggering a fire, which was later put out.

“Radiation levels at the site and in surrounding areas remained unchanged,” a statement on the NPP's official Telegram channel read.

While no casualties were reported, the NPP had to decrease the load on one of its three working units by 50%, officials said.

In a post on X on Sunday, the IAEA stopped short of assigning the blame, saying only that it “is aware of media reports that a transformer at the Kursk NPP in Russia has caught fire due to military activity. While the IAEA has no independent confirmation of these reports, [Director General] Rafael Grossi stresses that ‘every nuclear facility must be protected at all times.'”

The Kursk nuclear facility was put at risk due to the conflict with Ukraine, particularly after Kiev's military invaded the region in force in August 2024. Russian officials declared in April that Ukrainian troops had been expelled from Kursk Region following a months-long counteroffensive.

Russian authorities have claimed that Kiev intended to seize the site, warning that if such plans had succeeded, it could have caused a nuclear accident on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The Kursk NPP has also come under several Ukrainian strikes in recent months.

As White House moves to militarize more cities, Hakeem Jeffries says president is ‘playing' with Americans' lives

Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis” to justify the notion of sending federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local leaders, a leading Democrat said on Sunday, as the White House advanced plans to militarize more US cities.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader and a New York Democratic congressman, accused the US president of “playing games with the lives of Americans” with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the military, which has escalated to include the arming of troops currently patrolling Washington, DC – after sending troops into Los Angeles in June.

Late on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men and women of the national guard were poised to mobilize in 19 mostly Republican states to support Trump's anti-immigration crackdown by assisting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with “logistical support and clerical functions”.

Jeffries said he supported a statement issued by the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was “abusing his power” in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting from the pain he said the president was causing American families.

The national guard is normally under the authority of the individual states, deployed at the request of the state governor and only federalized – or deployed by the federal government – in a national emergency and at the request of a governor.

Jeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular.”

He continued: “I strongly support the statement that was issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there's no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago.”

The White House has been working on plans to send national guard to Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants, the Washington Post reported.

Pritzker issued a statement on Saturday night that began: “The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.”

Trump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation's capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities, has actually plummeted.

Talking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the president insisted that “the people in Chicago are screaming for us to come” as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later “help with New York”.

“When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago is a mess,” Trump said. The city's mayor, Brandon Johnson, meanwhile, has claimed shootings have dropped by 40% in the last year alone and he and Pritzker said any plan by the White House to override local authority and deploy troops would be illegal. California sued the federal government when it deployed national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June over protests against Ice raids, but a court refused to block the troops.

Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas.

Emanuel said if he was still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and, although crime was coming down, to “work with us on public safety” to combat carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not “come in and act like we can be an occupied city”.

He added about Trump's agenda: “He gave his speech in Iowa, he said ‘I hate' Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” The speech was in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagship legislation of the second Trump administration so far that focuses on tax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts for the anti-immigration agenda and benefits cuts to programs such as Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The prominent religious order postponed the ordination of Donald B Dickerson, but ultimately allowed his promotion

A version of this story was first reported and published by National Catholic Reporter

Numerous officials within the Roman Catholic religious order known as the Jesuits struggled in the 1970s and 1980s over how to deal with a man whom they knew molested children – but nonetheless was ordained a priest, according to a review of internal correspondence concerning his career.

The correspondence about the late Donald B Dickerson stems from a pending Louisiana state court lawsuit filed in June 2024 that alleges he raped a 17-year-old student at the order-run Loyola University New Orleans in 1984. It provides a rare, complex, behind-the-scenes look at how local leaders during a much earlier phase of the worldwide Catholic church's ongoing clergy molestation scandal struggled to contain a predator priest's repeated abuse of children while encouraging him to seek psychological help.

Born in 1936 in Jerseyville, Illinois, Dickerson entered the Society of Jesus in Louisiana in August 1971 and professed his first vows two years later, a day before he turned 37, court documents show.

Jesuits undergo a years-long formation period that begins with a two-year novitiate and concludes after ordination with the final vows, a process that can take 15 to 20 years. While Jesuits are not priests until ordination, they begin using the initials “SJ”, for the Society of Jesus, upon entering the order.

Early in his formation, Dickerson was assigned to the Jesuit high school in New Orleans, where letters say he abused two boys. In early December 1974, he molested a minor in a car en route to a high school awards ceremony, according to court documents.

In 1974, Jesuit priest Anthony McGinn – who would later serve as the New Orleans high school's president – described Dickerson as lazy and manipulative.

“He does whatever he pleases,” McGinn wrote in a character appraisal that is now an exhibit in the court case, which seeks damages from Loyola and the Jesuit order. “This is a dangerous sign that the Society will have difficulties with him in future years.”

Dickerson should not be advanced to theology, the next level in formation, concluded McGinn, who did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the negative appraisal, Dickerson went to theology instruction in Chicago.

In March 1975, during a six-hour meeting attended by multiple priests and a brother at the Jesuit provincials' office to discuss several clergy, Jesuit priest Louis Lambert, the vice-provincial for formation and a top Jesuit in the region, held that Dickerson “was making great progress in working through his problems” – and that a recent psychological report on him was “positive”. At that meeting, four priests voted to send Dickerson to theology despite McGinn's warnings.

By 1977, concerns from high-ranking Jesuit priest Thomas Stahel had reached a crisis point. The provincial of the Jesuits' former New Orleans province, Stahel had learned of yet another accusation that Dickerson had harassed a minor. Five days before Christmas that year, the provincial, who would later serve as executive editor at America magazine, detailed specific misgivings about Dickerson in a lengthy letter to the Jesuits' worldwide leader at the time, superior general Pedro Arrupe.

“I do not think we can in conscience present Dickerson to bishop as ready for ordination,” Stahel wrote to Arrupe, one week before Dickerson was to be made a priest. “I recommend that Dickerson's ordination be postponed, at the very least, and that we raise with him a question about his staying in the Society.”

According to the letter, Arrupe had already agreed that Dickerson's ordination should be postponed.

It is unclear whether Arrupe responded to this letter. National Catholic Reporter has not obtained other documents detailing a back-and-forth conversation between the superior general and the New Orleans provincial.

Stahel wrote that he first contacted Arrupe to help resolve a debate with Lambert regarding how to handle Dickerson.

Αccording to a 1977 letter, Dickerson's Jesuit superiors believed that his “psychosexual problem was under sufficient control”.

Yet Stahel, who details serious concerns regarding Dickerson's “suitability” for the priesthood, found himself at an impasse with Lambert. “He thinks Dickerson is no more a risk than others who have been ordained, and he characterizes the recent incident as a regrettable slip. I am unpersuaded by his reasons,” Stahel wrote to the superior general.

“I have the distinct impression that Fr [Father] Lambert's resistance in this matter had to do, not with the merits of his case, but with the jealous guard he maintains over his Vice-Provincial's prerogatives,” Stahel wrote. “He was determined that I should have nothing to say about Dickerson's ordination, and it was impossible to come to a meeting of the minds concerning evidence that seemed overwhelming to everyone but him.”

Describing the disagreement, Stahel alleged that Lambert considered Dickerson's improper behavior to be the result of nerves – and rejected Arrupe's move to postpone ordination as unjust “strong-arm tactics”.

Lambert, Stahel said, “argued that, once a man is approved for ordination by the Society (as Dickerson had been), the Society is committed to him. By this kind of reasoning, nothing a person could do between approval and ordination could disqualify him.”

In September 1978, Arrupe said in a letter to Lambert that he had received a psychological report on Dickerson, but the details of that report were not readily available. “I will await further information on the case from Father Stahel,” wrote the superior general.

Dickerson had received psychological treatment at least twice by then – in 1975 and 1978. He later noted that he had submitted to “extensive psychological therapy” at Foundation House, a former treatment facility for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico.

Dickerson had still not been ordained by the summer of 1979, when Stahel said Dickerson had told him that sexually harassing an underage boy was “a relatively insignificant incident”.

The provincial disagreed.

“I did not feel that I could ordain him until we had removed as much as possible any worries that such incidents would happen again,” Stahel wrote.

But Stahel's worries about Dickerson had apparently subsided by the end of that year, after Dickerson understood the “scandal” molesting children could cause. “I said that I thought he should be ordained,” Stahel wrote in a memorandum dated 30 December 1979. Six months later, on 7 June 1980, Dickerson was ordained by Birmingham, Alabama, bishop Joseph Vath.

Dickerson began teaching at the boys Jesuit preparatory school in Dallas that same year. But in 1981, he was removed from Jesuit Dallas following an allegation from a child's parents. He was sent in September 1981 to St John Berchmans, then a co-cathedral in Shreveport, Louisiana.

A $12m lawsuit would later accuse Dickerson of raping a boy there in 1982.

That year, Stahel had written to Dickerson with the hope “nothing would happen in Shreveport”. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.

Two years later, in an August 1984 letter to Dickerson, Jesuit priest Edmundo Rodriguez, the new provincial in New Orleans, noted that he had “a duty to protect the Society and the Church from unacceptable behavior of its members”.

A 1984 psychological profile of Dickerson written by the Servants of the Paraclete, the men's order that treated troubled priests, described him as “very sick” and in need of intensive, long-term treatment. During Dickerson's evaluation, he said that he had been molested by a man at age six, according to clinical notes included in the most recent New Orleans lawsuit.

In September 1984, a mother wrote a letter to the bishop of Alexandria-Shreveport that alleged that Dickerson had molested her son.

“Recently he was rejected by his natural father,” the woman said of her son. “Instead of help from Fr Dickerson, he has been mentally damaged even further.” She added that Dickerson should never work near children again.

Court documents show that Jesuit priest Thomas Barberito had spoken in August 1984 with the bishop about “the situation with Fr Dickerson”. According to Barberito, the bishop said he would refer concerns to the provincial if one of the parties involved contacted his office.

Dickerson's Jesuit superiors assigned him to Loyola University New Orleans in 1985. There, the New Orleans lawsuit alleges, he abused another minor. Yet Dickerson maintained the support of his direct superior even while facing an investigation.

“Don has to be given the benefit of the doubt,” Rodriguez wrote in a communication dated 28 February 1986. “We owe Don the same careful due process which we would want to provide for anyone else.”

But in early March 1986, after Rodriguez received three separate allegations against Dickerson in one week, the provincial encouraged him to leave the priesthood “to save everyone from a very painful process”.

Dickerson complied, thanking the provincial for his “willingness to suspend judgment on the question of moral culpability and to acknowledge my genuine efforts to overcome my tendencies”. On 12 March 1986, Rodriguez wrote that he had contacted Jesuit priest Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then the order's superior general, requesting that Dickerson be dismissed from the society and priestly life.

Since his laicization, Dickerson has been at the center of multiple lawsuits beyond the recent New Orleans case. It is unclear whether he ever faced criminal charges for accusations of sexual abuse of minors.

In 2009, a case was settled after he was accused of molesting an eighth grade boy. Dickerson was accused in 2010, in the aforementioned $12m lawsuit, of raping an 11-year-old boy at St John Berchmans in 1982. And a former Jesuit Dallas student sued the school in 2019, alleging Dickerson gave him alcohol and raped him during a trip to Alabama decades prior.

During his 18 years as Jesuit superior general, Arrupe emerged as a widely respected leader, beloved by the men's religious community at the time of his resignation in 1983, two years after a disabling stroke. He was known for having ministered to survivors of the US's atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the end of the second world war.

Arrupe's cause for canonization, which opened in Rome in 2019, remains active. Attorneys Richard Trahant, John Denenea and Soren Giselson, who represent the plaintiff in the New Orleans lawsuit centering on Dickerson, argue Arrupe should not be considered for sainthood.

While Arrupe, as superior general, could have stopped Dickerson's ordination, biographies and statements from Arrupe show that he opposed an authoritarian style of leadership of the Jesuit order. If local Jesuit officials decided to ordain Dickerson, it is unclear whether Arrupe would have stepped in to stop it – or if he had all the facts supporting such a decision.

Dawn Eden Goldstein, an author and canon lawyer, said it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to say the way the Jesuits handled the Dickerson case was a coverup or willful negligence. “At this point, we don't know whether this might rather be a case of superiors following the accepted procedures of that time,” she said. But, she added, that explanation does not justify their actions.

The Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and it's unclear whether other records about Dickerson are in the Jesuits' files in Rome. McGinn is the only Jesuit official in this story who is still alive.

The lawsuit was ongoing as of the weekend of 22 August.

Fall of villages in Donetsk region would mark further advance towards strategic city of Kramatorsk; South Africa adds to calls for Zelenskyy-Putin summit. What we know on day 1,278

Russia says its forces have taken two villages in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, increasing the military pressure amid struggling international efforts to broker an end to the war. Moscow's forces captured the villages of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk along the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline in Donetsk, the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram on Saturday. The taking of Kleban-Byk would mark a further advance towards Kostiantynivka – a key fortified town on the road to Kramatorsk, the location of a major Ukrainian logistics base. Russia said on Friday its troops had captured three villages in Donetsk. Ukraine's military did not acknowledge that any of the villages had changed hands. On Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said on Telegram its forces had stopped a Russian advance and recaptured the village of Zeleny Gai in Donetsk. The village was being subjected to new Russian attacks, a military statement said. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified.

South African president Cyril Ramaphosa added his voice to calls for a Russia-Ukraine summit during a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “President Ramaphosa stressed the urgency of holding bilateral and trilateral meetings between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and the United States as key to signal a firm commitment to ending the war,” a statement from Ramaphosa's office said on Saturday. Zelenskyy said he told Ramaphosa he was ready for any kind of meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “However, we see that Moscow is once again trying to drag everything out even further,” he posted on X. Ramaphosa spoke last Monday with Putin, whom he has called a “dear ally”.

The Pentagon has been blocking Ukraine from using US-made long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia, limiting Kyiv's ability to employ the weapons in its defence, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing US officials. The report could not immediately be verified. As the White House has sought to persuade Putin to meet Zelenskyy for peace talks, an approval process put in place at the Pentagon has kept Ukraine from using the army tactical missile systems (Atacms) to launch strikes deep into Russian territory, the WSJ reported on Saturday.

Russian air defences downed a drone headed for Moscow on Saturday and specialists were examining fragments on the ground, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram. Several airports in central Russia suspended operations because of concerns over safe airspace, Russia's air transport agency said. Officials at the airport in St Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying dozens of flights had been delayed.

France has summoned the Italian ambassador after Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini challenged French president Emmanuel Macron for suggesting European soldiers be deployed in Ukraine in a postwar settlement, Reuters reported a French diplomatic source as saying on Saturday. Asked during the week to comment on Macron's appeals to deploy European soldiers in Ukraine after any such deal with Russia, Salvini used a Milanese dialect phrase loosely translatable as “get lost”. “You go there if you want. Put your helmet on, your jacket, your rifle and you go to Ukraine,” he told reporters, referring to Macron.

The family of a British aid volunteer reportedly killed in a drone strike in Ukraine have said they are “very disappointed” by the response from authorities. Annie Lewis Marffy, 69, travelled from her home in Silverton in Devon, south-west England, in May to deliver a vehicle packed with supplies in a mission arranged by the non-profit Aid Ukraine UK. She was reportedly fatally injured in a Russian drone strike on 11 June, according to a police file, while Kramatorsk district police department said her body remained in an area of hostilities and could not be evacuated. Lewis Marffy's relatives have asked for a death certificate to be issued for the “brave, capable and determined” mother-of-three. “All the family, the sisters and the sons, have been very disappointed at the reaction of the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and the lack of response from the police,” the relatives said, adding: “The family are desperate to get more information.”

Ukrainian flags will appear above Downing Street and several Whitehall buildings to mark 34 years since Ukraine left the Soviet Union, the British government said. The prime minister's official residence at No 10 Downing Street is among the buildings where a flag will fly on Sunday. A government spokesperson said: “We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, including those who have made a second home here in the UK, in the face of continued Russian aggression.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

We need a just peace' — Zelensky's Independence Day address","https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-never-be-forced-into-compromise-we-need-just-peace-zelenskys-independence-day-address/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 08:05:22 GMT","

Editor's note: This is the transcript of President Volodymyr Zelensky's address released by the President's Office on Aug. 24, 2025, Ukraine's 34rd Independence Day.

""Dear Ukrainians! Dear people!

Today is Ukraine's Independence Day.

I am here now, in the heart of Kyiv, on Independence Square. And it is here that one can truly feel what independence means, why it is so important to us, and why Maidan is far more than just the main square of the country. It is a symbol — a symbol of independence, its guardian. It is a place where history is always being made, where the energy and strength of our people are born in times when independence is under threat.

And now, in a full-scale war for independence, it is here, on Maidan, that one can find such important symbols. Symbols of how we fight, what we fight for, and how we are overcoming this war.

These symbols are all around us. In this Independence Monument. Inside, it has a reinforced concrete frame and can literally withstand a hurricane. In the same way, our Ukraine has withstood the great calamity that Russia brought to our land. In this ""Zero Kilometer"" point. It is the starting point where distances to Ukrainian cities are written: to our Donetsk, our Luhansk, our Crimea. Today, these markers have a completely different meaning. They are no longer just about kilometers. They remind us that all of this is Ukraine. And there are our people, and no distance between us can change that, and no temporary occupation can change that. One day, the distance between Ukrainians will disappear, and we will be together again as one family, as one country. It is only a matter of time. And Ukraine believes it can achieve this — achieve peace, peace across all its land. Ukraine is capable of it.

Because Ukraine has character — a stone-like endurance, a gaze that does not waver, and hands burned by fire and time but strong. Hands that hold the shield and protect what is theirs—their land, their culture, their millennia-old history, whose proof is the founders of Kyiv. And we protect our future, for which our heroes gave their lives.

Names that we will never forget or betray. Names that defended independence. And it is here, on Maidan, that Ukrainians often bid farewell to heroes on the shield. Anyone who has attended such a farewell, and anyone who has lost someone in this war, has their own personal account with Russia forever and has promised themselves never to forget their heroes.

The embodiment of such a vow is this field of public memory. A field of great strength, because in every small flag there is someone's great story, act, and choice — a choice in favor of Ukraine. In favor of the future. In favor of freedom in peace and peace in freedom. This philosophy is reflected in our culture through the image of Cossack Mamai, who gained freedom and can therefore put down his weapon and take up the kobza. Still keeping the saber close, just in case, but returning to a peaceful, civilian life. This is what we all aspire to. And we know: No one will give this to us — it can only be won.

This is exactly what we have been doing for 1,278 days of this war, the war for independence. For every one of these days, I want to thank you, Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian volunteers, medics, rescuers, teachers, our youth, our parents. Every Ukrainian man and woman. Thank you all. For what we have already gone through. And for Ukraine, we are building together. For the Ukraine that already exists now. The Ukraine that came of age on February 24. Took its fate into its own hands, took up arms. It had no time to hesitate and no right to fear. And it truly stopped the second army of the world. And we will talk about this. We will, because it destroys the myth of the invincible Russian army.

We have proven it. We continue to prove it now. Each in their place. Everyone who carries independence within themselves. Who defends our right to be Ukrainians — through their work, their deeds, their achievements. Today, independence is being forged on the battlefield, independence closes the sky every night, it saves lives in hospitals, it puts out fires, and it teaches. Independence does not sleep, working around the clock at defense enterprises, because it is so important that our soldiers have everything, that independence has everything to defend itself. Independence is at the wheel, on the way to those in need. Independence fights in the ring, on world stages, and arenas where Ukrainians perform. It is on the pages of books, in the words of poems written by Ukrainians.

When we hear from the enemy every day: ""There is no such state, no such nation,"" and when we prove the opposite every day. We prove that Ukrainians exist and Ukrainians will remain on this land, on this square, where in a hundred years our next generations will stand. And in a hundred years, they will celebrate Ukraine's Independence Day here.

It will be so. It will be so, because Ukraine today is different. Ukraine is stronger and respects itself. And Ukraine does not wait for ""gestures of goodwill,"" it has its own will to implement what is necessary for us. And when Russia wants to take Sumy Oblast, then the Armed Forces appear in the Kursk region. When the enemy strikes our energy infrastructure, trying to leave us without light and heat, then its refineries burn. And no one can forbid us such strikes, because they deliver justice. Just as when Russia attacks us every day, our peaceful cities, our hospitals, our schools, killing our civilians, our children, it receives ""Spider Web"" in response. And that is justice. That is Ukraine striking back when its calls for peace are ignored. How many times have we proposed a ceasefire? How many times have we said, ""We want peace, we seek peace."" But a decent and comprehensive peace, and therefore, we rely on the strength of the whole world.

This is Ukraine now. And this Ukraine will never again in history be forced into the shame that the ""Russians"" call a ""compromise."" We need a just peace. What our future will be is up to us alone. And the world knows it. And the world respects it, respects Ukraine, and accepts Ukraine as an equal.

Ukraine can truly gather and unite the world's leaders in a single day. Ukraine, with which America and the whole world want to jointly produce drones. Ukraine, which restored unity between Europe and the US and is now the foundation of this alliance. Ukraine, which stands firm and can defend itself. Therefore, Ukraine is heard, Ukraine is counted, Ukraine is listened to. Its place is at the table; it is not told, ""Wait outside."" It is told, ""The decision is yours alone.""

This is the Ukraine I had the honor to represent in the United States a week ago. Today, both the US and Europe agree: Ukraine has not yet won, but it certainly will not lose. Ukraine has won its independence. Ukraine is not a victim; it is a fighter. Ukraine does not ask; it offers. Alliance and partnership. The best army in Europe. Advanced defense technologies. Experience of resilience. We say: ""We need (to be accepted into) the EU."" Yes. But we are needed by it no less. And everyone acknowledges this. And so Ukraine is recognized — not as a poor relative, but as a strong ally.

This is what the coalition of the willing is about. This is what Washington was about — how to ensure a sustainable, reliable, lasting peace. Ukraine will achieve it because it will receive security guarantees so strong that no one in the world will ever again even think of attacking Ukraine.

This is not only our goal; it is exactly what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren: a strong Ukraine, an equal Ukraine, a European Ukraine, an independent Ukraine.

To break the closed cycles of history, in which each generation lacked something to preserve independence, and each new generation entered a new stage, again forced to take up arms, again having to defend itself and regain freedom. We must not pass this burden onto our descendants. We are building a Ukraine strong enough to live in safety and peace. So that on this square, on the Maidan of our Independence, under our flags, on our land, our children and grandchildren will celebrate Independence Day. In peace. In calm. With confidence in the future. With respect and gratitude to all who defended Ukraine in this war, the war for independence. Who endured, who were able, who triumphed. This is the purpose worth living for. This is why we stand.

Happy holiday to you, great people of a great country! Happy Independence Day!

Glory to Ukraine!""

Ukraine has brought home another group of soldiers and civilians from Russian captivity on Aug. 24, the country's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced.

The swap follows the series of other exchanges carried out in recent weeks in accordance with an agreement reached between Kyiv and Moscow at the second round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. 

""Today, our people are returning home — soldiers of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service, and civilians. Most of them have been in captivity since 2022,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram. 

Although this time Ukraine has not yet announced the number of people released, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) said among them were eight civilians, including Ukrainian journalists Dmytro Khyliuk and Mark Kaliush and former mayor of Kherson, Volodymyr Mykolaienko. 

Khyliuk, a journalist with the UNIAN news agency, was kidnapped alongside his father from their home in Kyiv Oblast in March 2022, while the area was under Russian occupation.  

Earlier in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Ukraine brought back 146 of their POWs, and they released the same number of Ukrainian POWs. 

According to the Coordination Headquarters, among the released Ukrainian soldiers are representatives from almost all defense forces, including the Airborne Assault, Air Force, Navy, as well as Territorial Defense, National Guard, and the State Border Guard Services. 

According to the report, they took part in the defense of Mariupol, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, and Sumy oblasts. Some of them were captured in Russian-occupied territories and Crimea. 

Among the released civilians is medic Serhiy Kovalov from the Hospitallers Medical Battalion, ""who saved the lives of both defenders and civilians during the siege at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol,"" in the spring of 2022, Coordination Headquarters reported. 

""Exchanges are ongoing. And this is made possible, perhaps, thanks to our soldiers, who replenish Ukraine's exchange pool; our team, working every day; and our partners, who provide assistance,"" Zelensky says. 

The previous POWs exchange, which secured the return of 84 Ukrainians, took place on Aug. 14, just a day before U.S. President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15. Trump then met President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside European leaders in the White House days later.

The Ukraine-Russia peace talks earlier this year have failed to achieve a breakthrough in ending the hostilities, but concluded with new agreements on prisoner swaps.

Zelensky announced earlier this month that Ukraine and Russia are preparing to exchange 1,200 POWs in accordance with the third round of peace talks in Istanbul on July 23.

The president also said late in July that Kyiv has secured the release of over 6,400 Ukrainians from Russian captivity since 2022, of whom 5,857 were freed during prisoner exchanges.

Ukrainian troops have liberated three front-line villages in Donetsk Oblast from occupying Russian forces, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Aug. 24, Ukraine's Independence Day. 

Syrskyi's report followed a working visit to combat zones in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has steadily gained ground in recent months, particularly near the embattled logistics hub of Pokrovsk. 

Ukrainian forces ""successfully counterattacked and cleared"" the villages of Zelenyi Hai, Mykhailivka, and Volodymyrivka, Syrskyi said in a social media post published by Ukraine's General Staff. 

""(D)efending Ukrainian independence and the Ukrainian flag is not just empty words, but a daily risk and a daily feat,"" Syrskyi said. 

Zelenyi Hai in Volnovakha district is located approximately 90 to 100 kilometers (about 56 to 62 miles) southwest of the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. The military first reported the regaining control of the village on Aug. 23. 

The three liberated villages are all located south of Pokrovsk. 

Syrskyi acknowledged in his report that Pokrovsk remains the ""most difficult"" area of the front and said Ukrainian troops ""must hold the line"" as Russia continues to concentrate the bulk of its forces in that region. 

Russian troops are trying to close in on the Ukrainian pocket around Pokrovsk, an area of approximately 16 kilometers wide (around 10 miles), according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState.

With no ceasefire in sight, Russia's advances in eastern Ukraine continue to strengthen Moscow's hand in possible peace negotiations as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a deal to end the war. 

The Kremlin's plan for peace reportedly involves Ukraine withdrawing all its forces from Donetsk Oblast, ceding the entire region to Russia in exchange for frozen battle lines on the other sectors of the front.

Ukrainian troops have liberated the villages of Zelenyi Hai, Mykhailivka, and Volodymyrivka, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on Aug. 24.

Zelensky's statement follows a recent report by the Wall Street Journal saying that the U.S. has quietly implemented a review process giving Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authority to bar Ukrainian long-range strikes inside Russia with American missiles.

In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down Monday's meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which came just a few days after Trump's Aug. 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. 

The upcoming delivery is part of the support package Canada pledged earlier in June during the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the defense ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia, as well as the U.K. Minister for Veterans Affairs, are also in Ukraine for Independence Day.



Ukrainian drones struck a natural gas terminal in Russia's Leningrad region and an oil refinery in Samara region on Aug. 24.

""We prove that Ukrainians exist and Ukrainians will remain on this land,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his address. 

Ukraine shot down a total of 48 drones, while a missile and 24 Shahed attack drones struck 10 locations, the Air Force said, without specifying the targets. 



""Yes, we have taken the first steps. But I will say it figuratively, we are at a distance of 10 kilometers and have passed, maybe, the first 200 meters, no more. But in any case, we are moving in the right direction,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.

In response to concerns over airspace safety, Russia's federal aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, temporarily suspended operations at multiple airports in major cities of the Volga and Central regions of European Russia—including Izhevsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Penza, Tambov, and Ulyanovsk.

Canadian teen Victoria Mboko captivated tennis – and the country – when she defeated Naomi Osaka to win the National Bank Open women's singles title earlier this month, and now she's looking to continue her meteoric rise at her first U.S. Open.

The 18-year-old went from wildcard to household name as she beat four Grand Slam champions in a stunning run in Montreal. She is Canada's first tournament champion since Bianca Andreescu ended this country's 50-year drought in 2019.

Tennis world hails Victoria Mboko's meteoric rise

Now, the highest-ranked Canadian woman in tennis, Mboko's first World Tennis Association tournament title has secured her a spot in the Grand Slam's main draw, where she's hoping to keep her winning streak going.

Here's everything you need to know about Mboko as she prepares for her debut in the U.S. Open's main draw.

Victoria Mboko beat four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka at the National Bank Open in Montreal.

The Canadian Press

Victoria “Vicky” Mboko was born in Charlotte, N.C., to parents who fled political turmoil in the Democratic Republic of Congo. When she was two months old, the family moved to Toronto, where Mboko and her three older siblings – who all played tennis as well – grew up watching the sport at Sobeys Stadium.

Mboko, who will turn 19 during the U.S. Open on Aug. 26, began playing tennis at age 4 and started competing at an early age, but one early victory had a lasting impact on her career. In 2014 she won The Champions Under-10 tournament at age 7, giving her a $6,000 prize that went toward her coaching. After her first International Tennis Federation pro tournament win in 2022, she personally thanked the man whose donation made it possible.

Opinion: For my father, Victoria Mboko's victory is a decade-long tennis dream come true

“Your contribution to the tennis fund for Tennis Ontario ... opened the door for myself to work with a private coach to further develop my tennis,” Mboko wrote to Murray Rubin. “My main focus is now to compete primarily in the professional pro tournaments to get my pro ranking up and one day become world No. 1 and win Grand Slams.”

That same year, agents came calling as she rose to prominence in juniors and made two Grand Slam junior doubles finals at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. 

Mboko has blossomed on the pro circuit this season, and has sped through the lower rungs that take most young players years. In January and February, she won four ITF titles, securing 22 consecutive match victories without dropping a set, before she made her WTA-1000 singles main draw debut at the Miami Open in March. Mboko also made the third round at the French Open and won a match at Wimbledon this year.

After training much of last year at the Justine Henin Academy in Belgium, Mboko wanted to return home, and has been coached by Nathalie Tauziat and Noëlle van Lottum since November, 2024. Tauziat is a French former player who reached No. 3 in both singles and doubles play, and also formerly coached Andreescu. A Dutch-French former player and coach, van Lottum has been working as the head women's national coach for Tennis Canada in Montreal since 2023.

Mboko's ranking soared from No. 85 to No. 24 in the WTA Rankings after her National Bank Open victory, an incredible ascent from No. 333 where she started the season. She is Canada's highest-ranked woman, having leapfrogged No. 33 Leylah Fernandez.

Her victory also made her the youngest player in the Open Era to defeat four Grand Slam champions in a single tournament – Osaka, Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff and Sofia Kenin – since 17-year-old Serena Williams did it at the 1999 U.S. Open. 

Victoria Mboko tries to stay grounded as her career takes off

But Mboko says she is trying not to let the fact she won a WTA Masters 1000-level tournament – one rung below a Grand Slam – or the rising expectations get to her.

“I don't like to put pressure or set goals for myself, because anything can happen, and I'm okay with it. That's sports,” she told The Globe after her win in Montreal. “My goals are kind of the same. I just want to play the best I can every time I play. Every tournament, I'm always going to be in it to win it.”

The U.S. Open main draw begins on Sunday, Aug. 24, with the first round of women's and men's singles matches. It is set to end with the women's final on Saturday, Sept. 6, and the men's on Sunday, Sept. 7.

The Grand Slam tournament takes place at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, one of the most iconic tennis venues in the world, located in Queens, N.Y.

Light fixtures on the USTA courts in Flushing Meadows are designed to cut light pollution. The stadium complex is the only professional sports venue certified by DarkSky International, a group trying to preserve the night sky across the globe.

Thanks to her victory in Montreal, Mboko's ranking has earned her a spot as one of the 32 seeded players in the Grand Slam's main draw, and she did not need to play any qualifying matches. 

Mboko has been seeded at No. 22 and will face Barbora Krejčíková of the Czech Republic in the first round on Monday at 11 a.m.

“I don't really view the competition as any different now, because I know every single player in the top 100 is really talented,” Mboko told The Globe on Aug. 11. “But [the NBO win] definitely brings a lot of ease to my draw, because I don't have to play [qualifiers], and I could play slightly later.”

The Montreal victory also gives her extra time to rest her body, including a wrist she injured during her semi-final win over Elena Rybakina and later aggravated during the final win against Osaka.

The U.S. Open is shaping up to be a thrilling tournament with 19 individual Grand Slam champions and five Canadians already seeded in the men's and women's singles main draws.

Alongside Mboko, Leylah Fernandez is the only other Canadian woman seeded in the main draw at No. 31, and will face qualifying player Yulia Putintseva in the first round. Rebecca Marino is still fighting in qualifiers for a spot in the main draw, while fellow Canadians Cadence Brace, Carson Branstine, Marina Stakusic and Carol Zhao fell in the qualifiers.

In the men's singles draw, there are three Canadians seeded: Félix Auger-Aliassime (No. 25), Dennis Shapovalov (No. 27) and Gabriel Diallo (No. 31). Diallo will face Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday at 11 a.m., while Shapovalov takes on Márton Fucsovics of Hungary, also at 11 a.m. Sunday. Compatriot Liam Draxl vied for a spot in the qualifying round but fell to France's Kyrian Jacquet.

Among the former Grand Slam champions competing are reigning U.S. Open singles champs and world No. 1s Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, who will be looking to defend their titles from a field of fierce challengers, including No. 2s Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Świątek. American tennis legend Venus Williams, a former U.S. Open champ, is also returning to the tournament as a wildcard.

After a life-changing run, Mboko took home US$752,275 at the National Bank Open – nearly double what she's made in prize money in her whole career so far. According to the WTA, the prize brings her total winnings to $1,195,240, and she is guaranteed at least another US$110,000 for making it into the main draw of the U.S. Open. 

Mboko couldn't think of anything she'd like to buy with the money when asked by The Globe after her NBO win. But she said she treated herself to extra time with her family and friends in Montreal before she made the six-hour drive back to Toronto with her parents and sister.

Mboko's commanding and powerful play, strength and ball-striking began drawing attention several years ago, but the teen's resilience and maturity at such a young age have also set her apart.

“What makes [Mboko] special is obviously the power that she can generate from the serve and from the baseline. I believe she has an exceptional backhand, like way above normal,” Guillaume Marx, Tennis Canada's vice-president of high performance, told The Globe earlier this summer, “and then she has the mentality, the belief.”

In Montreal, Mboko was lauded for her mental toughness, as she beat players with more experience, rebounded after losing the first set of matches, fought back in games that looked lost and battled through pain in her wrist. 

“In terms of the champions that we see in tennis and in any sport, it always feels like there's something special about them, and it needs to be in you. And I think she has that in her, and ... we can see that right now, just by how composed she is,” said tournament director Valerie Tétreault.

According to Mboko, she gets it from her “very calm” father. “He's a very relaxed person, so yeah, I think I take from him a little bit,” she said.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been heightened in recent days, amid joint US-South Korean military drills and an imminent summit between the South Korean and US presidents.

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has supervised a test firing of two ""new"" air defense missiles, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Sunday.

The North Korean state media's report did not provide any details on the missiles, nor on where the test was held.

It said the test-firing took place on Saturday, and that it had demonstrated the ""superior combat capability"" of the ""improved"" missile weapon systems.

""The firing particularly proved that the technological features of two types of projectiles are very suitable for destroying various aerial targets,"" KCNA said.

South Korea's military said Saturday that it had fired warning shots at around 30 North Korean troops who last week had briefly crossed the military demarcation line at the heavily mined Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two nations.

North Korean state media quoted Army Lieutenant General Ko Jong Chol as saying that the incident was a ""premeditated and deliberate provocation.""

""This is a very serious prelude that would inevitably drive the situation in the southern border area, where a huge number of forces are stationed in confrontation with each other, to the uncontrollable phase,"" said Ko.

The reported missile test on Saturday also comes as the United States and South Korea hold joint military exercises, which began on Monday.

This month, Kim slammed the annual drills, calling them ""hostile and confrontational.""

South Korean president Lee Jae Myung has called for warmer ties with North Korea and pledged to build ""military trust,"" but Pyongyang has dismissed the idea of improving relations.

Lee took office in June after a period of deep chill under his hawkish predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol.

Lee is due to meet his US PresidentDonald Trump in Washington, DC, on Monday for their first summit.

Despite Finland's warnings that Russia could invade Scandinavia and the Baltic states, Estonians don't want to live in fear — even if some are preparing themselves for the worst.

The Home Cafe Days, or Kodukohvikute paevad in Estonian, are the summer highlight on the island of Hiiumaa. Every August, the residents of Estonia's second-largest Baltic Sea island open up their homes for three days and offer up home-baked cakes, home-smoked fish and home-brewed beer. They celebrate their short summer amid children's laughter and pop music.

Ave Ungro, 44, thinks the festival is ""extremely important,"" especially now in times of war. ""It helps us Estonians stick together: Celebrating together, talking, thinking about the future,"" she told DW.

She said that Kodukohvikute paevad was as important as the shooting lessons provided by the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization, or Naiskodukaitse. Ungro has been a member since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""Like most Estonians, probably, I was in shock on February 24, 2022. Mainly because of the realization that the life we had known so far could no longer go on in the same way,"" she said.

Ungro decided to shape her new life and prepare her family, her island and her country for a possible Russian attack.

Since then, the speech therapist has spent 48 hours a year training with the Naiskodukaitse and has already completed five different programs: Safety, first aid, military skills, field catering and the history of the Estonian volunteer defense league.

""I did pick up a weapon in the military part,"" she said. ""But I didn't shoot once.""

She hopes that she will never have to make use of her military training. If the worst happens, she would prefer to be involved in evacuations.

The Naiskodukaitse was founded in 1927, banned during the Soviet era and reestablished after Estonia regained independence in 1991. It is part of the Kaitseliit, a larger volunteer defense league comprised of well-trained armed civilians intended to support the regular armed forces in times of war. Both units are accountable to the Estonian Defense Ministry.

Ungro said she's not afraid of a Russian attack. She knows that her island in the Baltic Sea is strategically important, since it lies between the Russian city of St. Petersburg and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and could potentially be invaded, but she said that despite what certain Western media outlets had reported, there was no feeling of fear.

Marek Kohv from the International Center for Defence and Security also doubts that Hiiumaa could become a second Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. He told DW that Hiiumaa and Estonia in 2025 could not be compared with Crimea and Ukraine in 2014.

He said Estonia might be a small country, but what was important was ""that we invest a great deal in security.""

Indeed, Estonia, an EU member, already invests 3.4% of its GDP in defense. This is set to rise to 5.4% by 2029, breaking a record among NATO states.

Kohv explained that Estonia's culture of self-defense was deeply rooted. ""And we have regional allies such as Finland, the new NATO member, but also other Baltic states such as Lithuania and Latvia, as well as Poland, the military superpower in Europe.""

He added that Estonia's membership of NATO was crucial — thanks to Article 5 and the principle of collective defense, any attack on Estonia would be considered an attack on NATO as a whole, and other armies would be implicated.

He also pointed out that Western military technology was superior to Russian technology. He said the idea that Russia could attack Estonia with nuclear weapons was an empty threat, considering that the proximity of St. Petersburg, which would also be affected by radioactivity in the event of a strike.

What analysts say is of more acute importance than a theoretical Russian attack on Baltic states are the very real acts of Russian sabotage, such as repeated damage to undersea communication cables or the jamming of GPS signals that can cause aircraft to disappear from the radar.

This happened to two planes flying from Finland to Estonia in April 2024. Both had to return to Helsinki after their GPS signals were seemingly interfered with.

Ships in the Baltic Sea have also been affected — and these problems are increasing. Western intelligence services suspect the jamming activities to be controlled from nearby Kaliningrad.

Russia has a lot of military equipment stored there, including nuclear-capable Iskander missiles, said political scientist Sergey Sukhankin from the Saratoga Foundation, a US-based nonprofit.

Calling Kaliningrad, where he was born, a ""dagger pointed at Europe,"" he explained that not only was the enclave located between the EU states of Lithuania and Poland but it was once ""a bastion of the Soviet military, one of the most militarized places in the world."" Today, Kaliningrad is regaining that status.

Back at Home Cafe Days, Ungro isn't thrilled about her regional neighbors and acknowledges how serious the acts of sabotage are, but she would not dream of leaving her ""magical"" island.

After the festival, she showed DW her ""secret spot"" on the coast, a headland surrounded almost entirely by water on all sides.

""Look, a sea eagle,"" she called out. ""What a beautiful place! So many birds. It's so quiet here. That's the beauty of Hiiumaa. And it should stay that way.""

The chorus of disapproval comes in response to Trump's deployment of US warships off the coast of Venezuela.

China and members of an alliance of Latin American and Caribbean nations in recent days joined countries including Brazil and Colombia and anti-war voices around the world in denouncing the Trump administration's deployment of US warships off the coast of Venezuela.

At least three US Navy guided missile destroyers and thousands of Marines are currently off the coast of Venezuela, with Pentagon officials citing President Donald Trump's January executive order designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and his directive authorizing military force to combat narcotraffickers abroad.

On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that “China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the [United Nations] Charter and a country's sovereignty and security.”

“We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela's internal affairs under any pretext,” she added. “We hope that the United States will do more things conducive to peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region.”

Mao's remarks came on the same day that members of the 11-nation Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples' Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) issued a declaration during the group's virtual 13th Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government condemning the Trump administration's “imperialist policy of harassment and destabilization” and demanding “the immediate cessation of military threat or action” against Venezuela.

The declaration expresses support for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and decries the “groundless, mythomaniacal accusations with no legal basis” against him by the Trump administration, which alleges that Maduro is one of the world's leading drug traffickers. Trump recently doubled the Biden administration's bounty on Maduro from $25 million to $50 million.

In 2020, the first Trump administration's Department of Justice charged Maduro and 14 Venezuelan officials with narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine into the US, accusations the South American leader denies. The charges followed Trump's formal recognition in 2019 of an opposition coup leader as the legitimate president of Venezuela — a policy continued by the Biden administration — and the imposition of a full economic embargo on Caracas.

The ALBA-TCP declaration asserts that the Trump administration “seeks to delegitimize sovereign governments and pave the way for foreign intervention.”

“These practices not only constitute a direct attack on Venezuela's independence, but also a threat to the stability and self-determination of all the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean,” the alliance added.

Addressing the summit Thursday, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said that “Cuba firmly denounces this new demonstration of imperial force and makes a call to ALBA-TCP and from here to all the peoples of the world to condemn this irrational attack by the Trump administration,” according to Venezuelanalysis.

“The issue is not only Cuba, the whole region is under threat and only with integration can we fight against that because the United States intends to define the options to subjugate us or be objects of aggression,” Díaz-Canel added.

As Common Dreams reported, other Latin American leaders also condemned Trump's military deployment, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro telling his Cabinet Wednesday that “the gringos are mad if they think invading Venezuela will solve their problem” and Celso Amorim, a foreign policy adviser to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, warning of “the risk of an escalation” and reiterating that “the principle of nonintervention is fundamental” to international order.

Although Trump has been a vocal critic of the regime change policies of past administrations — especially that of fellow Republican George W. Bush — he and members of his Cabinet have floated the idea of ousting Maduro, including via US invasion.

The United States has been meddling in Venezuela's affairs since the 19th century, citing the dubious Monroe Doctrine to assist coups, support brutal dictatorships, and pursue policies of economic strangulation in an effort to exert control over the country and its immense petroleum resources.

Starbucks's CEO made 6,666 times the median Starbucks worker in 2024. He's not alone. 

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The gap between CEO compensation and median worker pay at Starbucks hit 6,666 to 1 last year.

In other words, to make as much money as their CEO made in 2024, typical baristas would've had to start brewing macchiatos around the time humans first invented the wheel.

Starbucks is the worst offender, but jaw-dropping gaps are the norm among America's leading low-wage corporations. CEOs of the 100 S&P 500 firms with the lowest median wages — a group I call the “Low-Wage 100” — have enjoyed skyrocketing pay over the past six years.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

As a group, these CEOs now earn 632 times more than their median employees, I found in a new report for the Institute for Policy Studies. Their pay has risen nearly 35 percent since 2019 in absolute terms, while their median worker pay hasn't even kept up with the U.S. inflation rate.

CEOs are in effect getting richer while their workers fall further and further behind.

It's not for lack of cash. Between 2019 and 2024, these firms spent a combined $644 billion on stock buybacks. This once-illegal financial maneuver artificially inflates the value of a company's stock — and with it, CEO pay. Even the most inept executives can rake in vast fortunes through this scam.

Every dollar spent on buybacks represents a dollar not spent on workers.

The tradeoffs can be downright staggering. At Lowe's, for instance, every one of their 273,000 employees could've gotten an annual $28,456 bonus over the past six years with the money the retailer blew on stock buybacks. Lowe's median worker pay was just $30,606 last year.

If McDonald's had spent their buyback outlays on worker bonuses during this period, they could've given all their employees an extra $18,338 per year — more than the company's median wage.

Siphoning resources from workers to make CEOs even richer is especially outrageous when so many Americans are struggling with high costs for groceries, housing, and other essentials.

It's bad for business too — most of these companies are spending more on buybacks than on vital investments like training employees or upgrading technology, equipment, and properties. And extensive research shows that extreme pay disparities undermine employee morale and boost turnover rates.

As poll after poll after poll has shown, Americans across the political spectrum are fed up with overpaid CEOs and want government action. In one rather amusing recent survey, 80 percent of workers said they view corporate CEOs as overpaid, and nearly 70 percent said they do not believe their own company's CEO could do the job they do for even one week.

How could policymakers incentivize more equitable pay practices?

They could increase taxes on corporations with huge CEO-worker pay gaps. Polls suggest this would be enormously popular. In one survey of likely voters, 89 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of independents, and 71 percent of Republicans said they'd like to see tax hikes on companies that pay their CEOs more than 50 times what they pay their median employees.

Congress could also increase the 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks that went into effect in 2023. If that tax had been set at 4 percent, the Low-Wage 100 would have owed approximately $6.3 billion in additional federal taxes on their share repurchases during the past two years. That revenue would've been enough to cover the cost of 327,218 public housing units for two years.

Policymakers have ample tools for tackling the problem of runaway CEO pay. Now they just need to listen to their constituents and get the job done.

Live Updates


            • Law enforcement crackdown: President Donald Trump has said he plans to expand his law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to other parts of the country, starting with Chicago. Big city mayors are pushing back on the plans.
    


            • Deportation push: The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, a Department of Homeland Security official told his lawyers. The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador before being returned to the US in June, has served as a flashpoint in Trump's sweeping deportation efforts.
    


            • Ukraine diplomacy: Trump sent a letter of support to Ukraine, praising its courage and saying the US believes in its future as an independent state as the country marks its 34th Independence Day. A flurry of diplomacy but little concrete progress on ending the war has followed Trump's recent meetings with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts.
    


            As President Donald Trump prepares to expand his crackdown on cities he claims are overrun with crime, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN the administration should focus on aiding local authorities with specific issues, not scoring political points.
    


Watch his discussion with CNN's Dana Bash below:



            President Donald Trump has heightened his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.
    


            In a series of social media posts, the president attacked Moore's record on crime and tied reconstruction funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to a political dispute over deploying the National Guard to major US cities.
    


                    “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland' with him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk,'” he added.
                





            The post came after Moore publicly challenged Trump to visit Baltimore in response to the president's claims about rising crime in US cities.
    


                    “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???” Trump wrote, referring to the Baltimore bridge that collapsed after being hit by a ship last year, killing six people.
                





            Moore responded today in an interview on CBS' “Face the Nation,” saying, “The president is spending all this time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. I believe we have to be able to address the issue of crime.”
    


            Trump has continued to group Democratic states and cities such as Baltimore with others he claims are in decline due to crime rates, though local officials have refuted some of his claims.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats are ready to ensure “Donald Trump cannot steal the midterm elections” on the back of GOP efforts to redraw congressional maps.
    


            Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash on the plan to redistrict in his state of New York, Jeffries said he's spoken with Gov. Kathy Hochul about the issue, and there's a plan to respond “in New York and in other parts of the country as the circumstances dictate.”
    


            Jeffries also brushed off concerns that Republicans could redraw enough seats to ensure they successfully defend their House majority next year, pointing to Democrats' sweeping pickups in the midterm elections during Trump's first administration.
    


                    “There's no way that Republicans can mathematically gerrymander their way to an artificial victory next year,” the minority leader said on CNN's State of the Union.
                





The big picture: There's an expanding battle over partisan redistricting unfolding across the country, with President Donald Trump backing the GOP-led effort.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to soon sign into law new congressional maps that could help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in the midterms. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading an effort to redraw the state's own congressional maps to offset the Republican gains.
    


What the administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance defended the Texas GOP's move this morning, claiming in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” that it was an effort to make elections “more fair” and a response to Democratic gerrymandering.
    


            While both parties engage in the practice, Democrats have handed away their power to gerrymander in some states, including California, where a nonpartisan commission draws congressional maps. That's why Newsom's effort now requires a statewide referendum to succeed.
    


CNN's Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the Trump administration's plans to send National Guard troops into Chicago, telling CNN the president should not “play games” with people's lives.
    


            Jeffries backed Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's assertion that the Trump administration has “no authority” to send in the troops.
    


                    “We should continue to support local law enforcement, and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
                





Some context: Trump said Friday he plans to widen his controversial law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities, singling out Chicago by name. CNN has since reported that the administration has been planning that move for weeks.
    


            Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is also pushing back, saying federal intervention would only threaten to undo local efforts that have produced significant reductions in serious crimes.
    


            The recent FBI searches of former national security adviser John Bolton's home and office was “clearly retribution” by the Trump administration, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff told NBC's “Meet the Press” in an interview today.
    


                    “The idea that they just picked John Bolton, a prominent critic of the president, at random — what the President is trying to do here is very systemic and systematic,” Schiff said. “And that is anyone who stands up to the president, anyone who criticizes the president … gets the full weight of the federal government brought down on them.”
                





            The search was part of a renewed investigation into whether Bolton disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, CNN previously reported.
    


            Schiff said his own legal battle with the administration is another example of the president using mechanisms of the federal government against perceived enemies.
    


            Last month, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a Trump ally, referred the California senator to the Justice Department over allegations of mortgage fraud. Schiff said the allegations are “patently false.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance is projecting optimism on the prospect of ending Russia's war in Ukraine, saying in a new interview that Russia has made “significant concessions” and the US will “keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.”
    


                    “They've actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands,” Vance said of Moscow in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's “Meet the Press,” adding that it's clearer now what it will take to the end the war. “Of course, they haven't been completely there yet.”
                





            The vice president's comments come as Russia-Ukraine peace talks appear to have stalled after some momentum earlier this month.
    


            President Donald Trump said last week that he could ultimately decide to walk away from negotiations, but Vance indicated the US will continue to be involved: “We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall, and if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.”
    


Use of long-range weapons: Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia.
    


            “To be frank, we have not discussed such issues with the US recently,” Zelensky said, when asked about the reports at a Ukrainian Independence Day event.
    


            “There used to be, you remember, various signals regarding our strikes in response to their strikes on our energy sector. That was a long time ago. Today, we don't even mention it. This is news to me,” he added.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.
    


            The Trump administration has been dogged by weeks of controversy over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, and that scrutiny continues this weekend.
    


First, a quick recap: As promised, the Justice Department started providing the House Oversight Committee with thousands of pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case on Friday.
    


            The committee has vowed to release them publicly, but only after lawmakers ensure they've made any further redactions needed to protect the victims. We don't currently have a timetable for that release.
    


            The DOJ also released transcripts and audio from its interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell last week — though she did not make any bombshell accusations or provide much revelatory information.
    


Now, Democrats sound unimpressed with the new files: Members of the party on the House Oversight Committee are decrying what they say is a lack of new records provided to the panel.
    


                    “Only 3% of the documents given to the Oversight Committee are new. The rest are already in the public domain. Less than 1% of files have been released. DOJ is stonewalling,” Rep. Ro Khanna of California said in a statement yesterday.
                





            Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania also claimed the DOJ's files are “largely thousands of pages of recycled content already made available to the public.”
    


            We'll bring you any further comment on the Epstein files from Trump administration officials and Democrats as they make the rounds this morning on Sunday political talk shows.
    


            As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump says he plans to widen the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities.
    


            Trump singled out Chicago in the Oval Office on Friday, and it has since emerged that his administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to the city, according to two officials who spoke with CNN.
    


Here's how some big city mayors are responding:



Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Friday that he had not received any formal communication about the administration sending federal law enforcement or troops there, but that he takes the president's statements “seriously.”
    


            Federal intervention would threaten to undo local efforts that have already seen significant reductions in serious crimes, Johnson said.
    


                    “The problem with the President's approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound,” Johnson wrote in a statement. “Unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities.”
                





Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Trump's move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June during protests against the administration was a “test case” for further overreach, as was his DC crackdown.
    


            “The president (can) say, ‘Well we can take over your city whenever we want and I am the commander in chief and I can use the troops whenever we want.' I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers,” Bass told CNN.
    


Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded last week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House's immigration crackdown.
    


                    “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,” Wu said. “Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law.”
                





            Elsewhere, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts — but little concrete progress — since US President Donald Trump's recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


We've rounded up the latest lines on the conflict for you, below:



            • Trump's letter: The US president sent a letter of support to Ukraine as the country marks the anniversary of declaring itself free of Soviet rule. Zelensky shared the letter on X and delivered his own message on the country's 34th Independence Day: We will not lose. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.
    


            • Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal “will be ready in the coming days,” following calls with several world leaders.
    


            Security guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv's western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.
    


            • Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward “full-scale restoration” of the countries' relationship.
    


            In comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.
    


            • Trump's deadline extended — again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.
    


            Asked by CNN's Alayna Treene if there's a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn't come to the table, Trump said, “We'll see. I'll see whose fault it is.”
    


            Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments on Donald Trump's presidency.
    


            The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as the president looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.
    


            It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.
    


            Trump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The Washington Post first reported on the plans.
    


In case you missed this, the Texas Senate early Saturday morning approved new congressional maps designed to help Republicans win up to five more US House seats in next year's midterm elections.
    


            This marked the final legislative hurdle for the redistricting plan endorsed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott, which has evolved into a national battle over partisan redistricting.
    


Watch the moment it happened, below:



            The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, according to a notice sent by a Department of Homeland Security official to his lawyers Friday.
    


            The notice, made public in a court filing in Abrego Garcia's human smuggling criminal case in Tennessee, came minutes after he was released from criminal custody pending his trial on the federal charges.
    


            “Let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” the notice read in part.
    


            Abrego Garcia's lawyers accused the government of using the notice to try to “coerce” Abergo Garcia to accept a plea deal in his case.
    


                    “There is a perfectly reasonable option available, Costa Rica, where he his family can visit him easily, but instead they are attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language. This is not justice; it is retaliation,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CNN in a statement.
                





The big picture: The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the US in June to face his charges, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's sweeping deportation push.
    


            Critics have pointed to the wrongful deportation as a prime example of what they say is a chaotic and cruel immigration crackdown, while the Trump administration has doubled down on its claims Abrego Garcia is a criminal with no right to remain in the US.

            The swing voter is back — but in a new form.
    


            Earlier in the 21st century, the dominant view among experts was that swing voters — those who might switch their party preference between elections — were all but extinct. Even today, the number of people who reliably turn out to vote but also regularly flip their votes between parties remains very modest by historical standards.
    


            Yet strategists in both parties believe a new kind of swing voter has emerged as the total number of voters has dramatically increased in the past decade. Today's key swing voters are the many Americans who cycle in and out of the electorate, casting a ballot in some elections but not others.
    


            “A swing voter today is (one)   who does or does not show up to vote,” says Bill McInturff, a veteran Republican pollster.
    


            These intermittent (or “low-propensity”) voters are also more likely to switch their vote between parties than those who routinely show up at the polls, experts believe. But the principal way these irregular voters express their shifting sentiments is by whether they vote at all.
    


            Catalist, a Democratic data and analytics firm, has calculated that 126 million people voted in both the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. Of that total, Catalist estimates that only about 6 to 12 million switched from supporting one party to another across those two races (including those who switched to a third-party candidate). Those party-switchers were dwarfed by the number of people who moved in and out of the electorate itself: In each of those two elections, about 60 million either voted for the first time or sat out the contest after voting four years earlier, according to Catalist's calculations.
    


            The large number of these low-propensity voters is creating a more fluid and unstable electoral environment. In 2024, this churn clearly benefited President Donald Trump: Catalist found that most people who voted in 2024 but not in 2020 backed him, while most of those who sat out 2024 after voting in 2020 had supported Democrat Joe Biden.
    


            But it's far from clear that Trump has cemented the loyalty of his new intermittent voters, who tend to be younger and less well-educated and are more likely to be Black, Hispanic or Asian American than the people who turn out more regularly. Polls now consistently show Trump's approval rating running well below his 2024 vote share with each of those groups.
    


            “I would remind (Republicans) that the rule of coalitions is the last ones in are the first ones out,” said Dan Kanninen, the 2024 battleground states director for both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “They did get some new folks into the coalition in 2024, but nothing they are doing today seems to me designed to keep those folks in the coalition.”
    


            Which means that the intermittent voters who contributed so much to Trump's victory in 2024 could power more surprises in 2026 and 2028.
    


            Successful national campaigns have always sought a balance between mobilizing their core supporters and persuading swing voters. But the relative emphasis on those two goals has varied over time.
    


            In the 1990s, Democratic President Bill Clinton aimed his governing agenda and political strategy primarily at swing voters, such as suburban White women, who had drifted away from the Democratic Party. In his victorious 2000 campaign, Republican George W. Bush largely followed that playbook, emphasizing his “compassionate conservative” agenda and looking to claw back suburban moderates.
    


            But heading into Bush's 2004 reelection campaign, his top advisers made a revolutionary decision. Bush's campaign team — led by chief strategist Karl Rove and senior advisers Matthew Dowd and Mark McKinnon — concluded that campaigns were spending too much money trying to persuade the dwindling number of voters who were truly open to supporting either candidate. They concluded they could earn more votes per dollar by shifting their efforts toward mobilizing Republican-leaning voters who had not turned out in recent elections.
    


            That set a template the winning presidential candidates in both parties largely followed over the next decade. Democrat Barack Obama, in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, targeted working-class and white-collar White swing voters, but he also placed heavy emphasis on mobilizing African American and young voters, who at the time were solidly Democratic constituencies. In 2012, Obama generated enough Democratic turnout that he won reelection even though he lost self-identified independent voters, the exit polls found.
    


            Trump's 2016 victory represented another triumph of the mobilization strategy: His win pivoted on expanding turnout and GOP margins among Republican-leaning groups, particularly White voters without a four-year college degree. In 2020, Trump again massively mobilized Republicans, but Biden and Democrats matched that surge with huge turnout of their own partisans. Trump lost largely because he ran more poorly than any Republican in modern times among college-educated voters, many of whom identified as independents.
    


            While Clinton in the 1990s emphasized persuading moderate voters, and the winning presidential candidates of the early 21st century focused on mobilizing partisans, Biden in 2020 needed a strong performance on both fronts to beat Trump.
    


            Though the lesson was obscured by Trump's defeat, the 2020 election showed that he was no longer relying solely on mobilizing core Republican constituencies; he also succeeded at persuading more voters who didn't historically favor the GOP, particularly young people and racial minorities. In 2024, Trump pushed those inroads further, to the point that they became arguably the decisive factor in his return to the White House.
    


            All the major data sources about 2024 voter behavior show that Trump made larger gains among Hispanic, Asian American and even Black voters than he did among White Americans. He also improved more among younger than older voters. Across all those groups, Trump consistently ran best among those who were the least engaged with the political system and least likely to follow news about it, according to the polling McInturff conducted for NBC, with a Democratic partner, throughout 2020. Trump's success had always depended on his ability to motivate low-propensity working-class White voters to turn out; in 2024, he proved he could do the same with working-class non-Whites.
    


            The results of the 2020 and especially 2024 presidential elections changed the dominant view across the political system about swing voters in two important respects.
    


            First, when targeting swing voters a generation ago, both parties largely envisioned cross-pressured White moderates — for example, college-educated White men who were economically conservative but culturally liberal.
    


            Those traditional swing voters  remain important for campaigns because they are so numerous, but increasingly, each side sees working-class Hispanic, Asian-American and to some extent Black voters — as well as younger men — as pivotal swing constituencies.
    


            Ten or 15 years ago, when political strategists talked about younger and non-White voters, “It was all about how could we mobilize them to vote, because…you think that based on their demography they are going to vote Democratic,” said Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, author of “Party of the People,” a book analyzing the GOP's gains with minority voters. “Now they are very much up for grabs. Literally, both sides have a chance to win them. And there are a lot more of them.”
    


            The second important shift has been broadening the definition of swing voters beyond the relatively modest number of people who vote regularly but shift from party to party. Instead, strategists on both sides have come to believe swing voters are expressing their preferences not only by oscillating between Democrats and Republicans, but to an even greater extent by cycling in and out of the electorate.
    


Results from the Validated Voters study conducted by the Pew Research Center quantify both these changes. According to previously unpublished findings provided to CNN, Pew found that voters of color who supported Biden in 2020 were much more likely than White Biden voters to move away from Harris in 2024. Pew found that the share of Biden 2020 voters who voted for Trump in 2024 was relatively modest for White (6%), Black (5%), Hispanic (7%) and Asian (9%) Americans alike. But while just 12% of Biden's 2020 White voters didn't vote at all in 2024, Pew found, that number rose to 19% for his Black and Asian American supporters and 23% among Hispanics. Taken together, those results indicate that a much higher share of Biden's 2020 minority voters swung in 2024 than his previous White backers — and that the swing was expressed more by staying home than crossing over to Trump.
    


            The decision by so many of Biden's 2020 minority supporters to skip 2024 suggests that not voting expressed disillusionment with his performance. Ruffini, the Republican pollster, spoke for many strategists in both parties when he said Democrats were mistaken to assume that Biden's 2020 minority supporters would have stuck with Harris if they had voted. “If they had shown up, did you want them to actually show up? Is it actually in your interest to have them show up?” Ruffini said. “That was the whole thing — it's (now) a swing bloc. Nobody really owns them.”
    


            The recognition that voting or staying home constitutes a form of swing behavior is erasing the distinction between persuading and mobilizing, Kanninen said. “Every modern campaign has to think about it this way: Turnout is persuasion,” he told me. “We stopped talking about turnout as one tactic and persuasion as another tactic. But rather turnout was a category of persuasion. We would call it ‘persuade to participate.' … You had to convince (swing voters) that it was worth their time and effort to (vote) in the first place.”
    


            For the 2026 midterm elections, Republicans face a dual challenge in holding support from the new swing voters who lifted Trump in 2024. The first is persuading them to turn out at all. Historically, these intermittent younger and non-White voters have been much less likely to participate in midterm than presidential elections. Though Republicans will mount “enormous” efforts to mobilize them, McInturff said, “There is a less well-educated downscale Trump vote that has been very difficult to get to vote when Trump is not on the ballot.”
    


            The second problem Republicans face in 2026 is the mirror of the dilemma Democrats confronted in 2024: Even if they can turn out these intermittent voters, can they count on their support?
    


            Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who has become a staunch Trump critic, thinks the answer is no for many of the low-propensity Hispanic voters Trump attracted last year.
    


            Citing polls showing Trump's dwindling approval ratings among Hispanics, Madrid believes the president is both failing to meet the top priority of his new Hispanic supporters — making their lives more affordable — and exceeding their tolerance for harsh immigration enforcement. “There's been a lot of people suggesting a racial realignment has been happening,” Madrid said. “What I see is a dealignment. I don't think they are so much a swing voter as a spurned voter” who is disenchanted with both parties.
    


            John Della Volpe, an expert on youth politics at Harvard University's Institute of Politics who has also consulted for Democrats, sees a similar risk among Trump's younger supporters. Della Volpe says his continuing surveys have found that young people, including many who backed Trump last year, “are somewhere between exceedingly and somewhat disappointed so far” in his record on inflation. “They are still willing to cut him some slack,” Della Volpe added, “but he is not cementing them.”
    


            These early signs suggest Republicans may end up facing the same problem Democrats did during Biden's term, when many of the casual voters the former president attracted in 2020 grew so disenchanted with his performance that they chose not to vote again in 2024.
    


            David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and former chief strategist for Obama's campaigns, says both parties may struggle to lock down intermittent voters as long as they rely primarily on negative messages — Trump by promising to confront “elites,”  “the deep state,” undocumented immigrants and other targets; and Democrats by promising to oppose Trump. “Right now, the motivation in our politics is very much a reaction to the things we hate,” he said. “It's not an aspirational politics in any way.”
    


            That's very different, he said, from the message Obama employed to surge turnout in his day. “As I think back to 2008 versus now, there's no doubt that it was motivated by disaffection with status quo politics,” Axelrod said. “But it was also motivated by hope and a real belief that it could change. A whole lot of people came out in the belief that things could be better. The question is: Could you do that in this environment today?”
    


            As long as the answer is no, the new swing voters may remain untethered to either party, preventing either side from having much confidence about whom they will support — or whether they will vote at all — in each election.

            When tariffs are tacked on to many imported goods, someone's got to foot the bill.
    


            According to President Donald Trump, foreign countries and overseas businesses are eating the cost. But evidence shows that American consumers and businesses are paying for the tariffs the administration has implemented as its go-to policy levers. 



            “It been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury's coffers,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, earlier this month. “Also, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren't even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs.”
    


            Trump's post did not include any substantiation for his claims.
    


            There is a growing field of evidence to the contrary: Economic data, academic research, businesses' expenses, and people's first-hand experiences are showing that it's American firms and consumers who are seeing increasingly higher costs due to the tariffs.
    


            That burden is expected to grow only heavier in the months — and, potentially, years — to come as more tariffs take effect, and others settle more deeply into supply chains.
    


            If foreign exporters are absorbing tariff costs, one possible way to see that in US economic data is whether they're lowering their pre-tariff export prices.
    


            If that's the case, it would show up as lower or falling US import prices.
    


            Recent months' data, however, has shown that import prices (which exclude the costs of tariffs, insurance and shipping costs) have held mostly steady. They've risen by 0.5% since the November election and by 0.2% since March, after which the bulk of new tariffs were announced, according to a recent note from Pantheon Macroeconomics.
    


            “One argument that had looked plausible until recently was that import prices had been supported by pre-tariff stockpiling in [the last part of 2024 and the first three months of 2025], which saw goods imports soar to record highs,” Pantheon economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen wrote in an August 19 note. “That left foreign exporters flush with orders, providing little incentive to cut pre-tariff prices to remain competitive. But import prices have remained resilient despite goods imports dropping back very sharply in [the second quarter], suggesting a steep decline in prices ahead is unlikely.”
    


            A more granular look at import price data indicates that there's a slight dip in import prices from China; however, for the vast majority of countries, it's basically been flat, Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, told CNN in an interview.
    


            “So that's telling you that all of that is paid by importers,” he said. “It's now a question of, is it the manufacturer, is it the retailers, or is it the small business that's bringing it in? They now have to figure out, ‘How much of this can I take on, and how much of this will I pass on?”
    


            “It's very likely they will pass the bulk of it on,” he added.
    


            To this point, consumers have been mostly shielded from starkly higher prices.
    


            Through June, US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs, but that share was expected to rise to 67% by October, according to an August 10 estimation from Goldman Sachs economists. That assessment led to a demand from Trump that the investment giant fire its chief economist.
    


            Goldman Sachs economists said they expect that about 70% of the direct costs of the tariffs will eventually fall on the consumer, and that the total could rise to 100% if including the spillover effects of domestic producers raising their prices (something that has already occurred and is expected to continue — more on that below).
    


            There's a laundry list of reasons why tariff-driven price hikes are a slow boil: Businesses loaded up their warehouses with pre-tariffed goods; higher costs have been split by entities along the supply chain, lessening the blow at the retail store; and Trump's fits-and-starts approach to tariffs has meant that the bulk of them did not go into effect for months, and many items are exempted (for at least now).
    


            At the same time, inflation has remained relatively tame for both good and not-so-good reasons: Ongoing deflationary trends in key areas, marking a continued unwinding from pandemic-era shortages and price spikes; falling gas prices (they're down 9.5% from July of last year) amid global economic uncertainty; and then because of depressed consumer demand in areas such as travel.
    


            Still, recent Consumer Price Index inflation reports reveal increases in the cost of certain imports the United States relies on heavily, including household furnishings, linens, tools, toys and sporting goods.
    


            As of August 8, imported goods cost 5% more than pre-tariff trends predicted and domestically produced goods are running 3% higher, according to newly released research from Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo and colleagues.
    


            Cavallo, in an interview with CNN, said he expects that the passthrough will continue in steady increments but could be limited in some cases depending on the competitiveness of the product category and industry.
    


            “I think it could take over a year for us to see some of the effects of these tariffs,” he said. “But a year from now, maybe two years from now, we'll notice that consumers ended up paying a significant amount of the tariffs even if they didn't notice the increases right away.”
    


            New research last week from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that businesses — those directly exposed to tariffs and those who are not — expect to raise prices this year.
    


            At the end of 2024, surveyed businesses anticipated increasing their prices by 2.5% during the year ahead. By mid-May, those estimates shot up to 3.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed, which found that little difference existed in the price growth expectations of firms with or without foreign exposure.
    


            However, the survey showed some starker increases expected among services, providing firms, which prompted questions around whether these price increases could deliver an inflationary impulse as was seen three years ago .
    


            “The chief concern regarding the impact of tariffs is whether we will experience the same phenomenon that we witnessed during the pandemic. That is, will price pressures spread beyond only the prices that are directly affected by increased import duties?” Atlanta Fed researchers wrote in the report.
    


            But in the coming months, the expectations are for the tariff passthrough to be gradual and drawn out, Matt Bush, a US economist at Guggenheim Investments, told CNN in an interview.
    


            “Businesses say they're working both with suppliers and consumers to help share some of the cost burden,” Bush said. “They do indicate that they're willing to eat some of the cost for now. But I think as the realization sets in that these tariffs are not going back down, they will start to pass more on to consumers.”
    


            The world's largest retailer said as much on Thursday: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said that the company's costs have risen every week because of tariffs but will aim to keep prices down “for as long as we can.”
    


            Small increases over time could make it easier for some consumers to handle; however, to others — especially those with little to no wiggle room in their budgets — that slow burn could very well feel like a slow bleed.
    


            “Lower-income Americans are sadly adept at juggling their expenses and trying to make every dime count,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in an email to CNN. “They may go without meat or coffee one week in order to buy shoes for their kids. The next week, they may skip a car payment to cover their electric bill and a medical expense. It's a constant juggle where they allocate money to their most urgent need at that moment.”
    


            Retailers and major brands know that many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, so they're using “sneakflation” to pass along the tariffs in small increments in hopes that consumers won't notice or will be able to better absorb it, Long added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. to stand trial in Mexico over alleged cartel ties","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/24/sport/boxer-julio-cesar-chavez-jr-trial-mexico-cartel-hnk","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 09:01:00 GMT","


            A judge in Mexico said boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. will stand trial over alleged cartel ties and arms trafficking, but could await that trial outside of detention, the boxer's lawyer said.
    


            Chávez's lawyer, Rubén Fernando Benítez Alvarez, confirmed that the court imposed additional measures and granted three months of further investigation into the case.
    


            He described the claims against his client as “speculation” and “urban legends” following the court hearing on Saturday in the northern Mexican city of Hermosillo.
    


            If convicted, Chávez — who took part in the hearing virtually from a detention facility — could face a prison sentence of between four and eight years, Alvarez said.
    


            Chávez, 39, who had been living in the United States for several years, was arrested in early July by federal agents outside his Los Angeles home for overstaying his visa and providing inaccurate details on an application to obtain a green card. The arrest came just days after a fight he had with famed American boxer Jake Paul in Los Angeles.

            Since 2019, Mexican prosecutors have been investigating the boxer following a complaint filed by US authorities against the Sinaloa Cartel for organized crime, human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking.
    


            The case led to investigations against 13 people, among them Ovidio Guzmán López — the son of convicted drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán — along with some collaborators, hitmen and accomplices of the criminal organization. Guzmán López was arrested in January 2023 and extradited to the US eight months later.
    


            Following the inquiry, the Federal Attorney General's Office issued several arrest warrants, including one against Chávez.
    


            Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Chávez was wanted since 2023 in Mexico, but that he wasn't detained because he spent most of the time in the US.
    


            “The hope is that he will be deported and serve the sentence in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said in July.
    


            The boxer, who is the son of Mexican boxing great Julio César Chávez, was deported by the U.S. on Aug. 19 and handed over to agents of the Federal Attorney General's Office in Sonora state, who transferred him to the Federal Social Reintegration Center in Hermosillo.
    


            The high profile case come as the Trump administration is pressuring Mexico to crack down on organized crime, canceling visas of notable Mexican artists and celebrities and ramping up deportations.
    


            Chávez has struggled with drug addiction throughout his career and has been arrested multiple times. In 2012, he was found guilty of driving under the influence in Los Angeles and was sentenced to 13 days in jail.
    


He was arrested last year for weapons possession. Police reported that Chávez had two rifles. He was released shortly afterward upon posting $50,000 bail, on the condition that he attend a facility to receive treatment for his addiction.

Sex workers and transgender people are among South Africa's most vulnerable populations after the Trump administration slashed U.S. foreign aid and U.S.-funded health clinics dispensing HIV medication shut down. South Africa has more people living with HIV than any other country. Its government has vowed it won't let the U.S. withdrawal of hundreds of millions of dollars in support collapse the world's largest HIV program. But some sex workers and others tell The Associated Press they have been turned away from public hospitals or discriminated against as they try to find HIV medication.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — On a warm evening in Johannesburg, the news spread like wildfire among sex workers: Within 24 hours, several nonprofit clinics providing free HIV services would be closing as President Donald Trump announced the United States was slashing foreign aid.

Some South Africans living with, or at risk of, HIV secured supplies of life-saving drugs just in time. Others did not.

Half a year later, the country with more people living with HIV than any other is struggling to treat its most vulnerable. Over 63,000 people were being treated in the 12 clinics across the nation that shut down. Up to 220,000 people have faced disruption to their daily HIV medication.

South Africa's government has vowed it won't let the U.S. withdrawal of about $427 million in support collapse its HIV program, the largest in the world.

Sex workers, among the most vulnerable South Africans as their work is illegal, and transgender people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from families or communities. They described a new world of difficulty in obtaining HIV medication or the preventive medicine for people at risk of HIV.

One HIV-positive sex worker and mother of three said she was off medication for almost four months after being turned away from public hospitals, which the government's health department says should not be happening.

“The only thing that I could think of was my kids, and that I am going to die, and how am I going to explain to my kids that I am sick because of the line of work that I chose?” she said. The 37-year-old said she finally obtained a month's supply of medication in June from a mobile clinic that was introduced after the funding cuts. She didn't know what she would do after that.




Another HIV-positive sex worker said she had resorted to illegally buying medication on the black market, where the pills have nearly doubled in price.

The U.S. has since issued a limited waiver allowing the resumption of certain life-saving HIV services globally, but the dismantling of much of U.S. foreign aid has created chaos. And for many people affected, harm is already done.

Overall, experts warn of hundreds of thousands of new infections in the next few years in South Africa, and tens of thousands of additional deaths, if the cuts in aid aren't restored or covered by other means.

A major challenge for those who lost access to the U.S.-funded nonprofit clinics is finding help elsewhere, including public hospitals.

“I have tried local clinics, three of them, and I have been refused treatment because I don't have a referral letter from my previous clinic,” the 37-year-old sex worker said.

Kate Rees, a public health specialist at Anova Health Institute in Johannesburg, said while it's ideal to have a transfer letter, it's not needed and people can't be turned away.

“But people at the clinic, whether it's nurses, security guards, doctors, whoever actually, do turn them away,” Rees said.

In response to AP questions, Foster Mohale, a spokesperson for South Africa's health department, said they were not aware of anyone who had been turned away and encouraged people to go to the nearest public health facility.

Another challenge at public hospitals and clinics is discrimination, especially for sex workers and transgender people.

“In hospital, they said they only give PrEP to people who are in a relationship with someone who's HIV-positive and trying to have a baby,” one transgender woman said. She decided to buy medication privately, moving in with her mother to save money to afford it.

“I am not going back to the clinic, with people who are going to make fun of me, like I'm a clown,” she said.

The health department didn't respond to questions on that issue.

Not everyone can afford to buy medication privately or on the black market, where a bottle reportedly goes for about $25 — and whose contents might be unverified.

The withdrawal from regular health care by sex workers and others means that many are no longer being tested and don't know what level of the virus they have in body fluids — and whether they can pass it on to others.

Even before the U.S. cuts, about 2 million of South Africa's estimated 8 million people living with HIV were never on medication. Some didn't have the time or money to spend on traveling to clinics. Some were in denial or didn't believe in the drugs. Some had not yet been diagnosed.

Now that number is rising.

Yvette Raphael, co-founder of the local Advocacy for Prevention of HIV and AIDS group, said she and fellow activists are worried that South Africa could go backwards.

“We are scared that we are going to see people dying again,” she said.

The concerns echo across Africa, the continent hardest hit by the U.S. aid cuts. The Trump administration has defended the cuts, saying the spending was not aligned with U.S. interests.

“And we're $37 trillion in debt. So at some point, the continent of Africa needs to absorb more of the burden of providing this health care,” Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, told a hearing in June. 

Among South Africans, some wonder whether Trump's stance may have been influenced by their countryman Elon Musk, who oversaw the early efforts to cut U.S. aid.

“I've got no civil words to express how I feel, but I just hate them for what they did,” one transgender woman said. “Our lives matter.”

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss the possible reclassification and the early warning signs for colon cancer.  

Officials last week dismantled a sprawling illegal marijuana cultivation site hidden deep inside Sequoia National Park, hauling out thousands of plants and nearly a ton of toxic debris that had scarred the wilderness.

Crews removed 2,377 full-grown marijuana plants and nearly 2,000 pounds of trash and infrastructure from a site that damaged roughly 13 acres in the protected California parkland, the National Park Service (NPS) said on Thursday. Much of the material was removed by hand and lifted out by helicopter by NPS law enforcement rangers as well as Bureau of Land Management special agents, the agency added.

Authorities said the cultivation bore the hallmarks of a well-organized drug-trafficking operation—the kind that has plagued Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks for nearly 20 years. In that time, officials eradicated close to 300,000 plants worth an estimated $850 million inside the two parks.

Authorities first discovered the marijuana farm in 2024, and while they raided it at the time they did not remove it entirely until this year due to the presence of dangerous chemicals, according to NPS. When crews returned this year, they found a semi-automatic pistol, makeshift campsites with kitchen areas and chemicals including approximately a gallon of the insecticide Methamidophos, which was banned in the U.S. more than 15 years ago.

Rangers also found far more than just the marijuana plants, documenting that they observed evidence of poaching, the clearing out of natural vegetation, nearly two miles of illegal trails, terraced grow plots carved into the hillside, and large pits that appeared to have been created to store water that was diverted from a nearby creek.

Officials said the impact of the illegal growing operation extends far beyond the 13 acres it occupied.

Runoff from the site may have been contaminated by a large variety of pesticides that were used in growing marijuana, the NPS said, potentially exposing both park visitors and wildlife to toxic materials.

Creeks siphoned to supply water for both the crops and camps would have otherwise nurtured wildlife and park vegetation, the NPS said. Each marijuana plant can consume six to eight gallons of water per day, the agency added, citing the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Fox News Digital reached out to the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management for more information.

No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about illegal cultivation on park land is asked to call the NPS tip line at 888-653-0009.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses boys suspended over an incident involving a transgender student in a locker room on 'The Faulkner Focus.'

A New York high school backed down after facing a legal threat and will now allow a Christian student to decorate her paid parking spot with Bible verses.

Grand Island High, near Buffalo, has a tradition of allowing seniors to pay $50 to decorate their parking spaces with ""positive artwork"" meant to beautify the campus and promote school spirit, according to legal group First Liberty. 

Rising senior Sabrina Steffans submitted two designs featuring crosses and verses from John 14:6 and Jeremiah 29:11. Both were rejected by school officials, who only approved a third non-religious version.

""I put in three drawings that I did, and the first drawing was a drawing of this mountain called Salvation Mountain,"" Steffans told CBN. ""And when I handed it in, they said… completely no to it because it had crosses, a Bible verse, and just a lot of religion that they said that wasn't allowed.""

""They finally agreed to… the last one, which had no Bible verses, no crosses, or anything,"" the student added.

After the school rejected her initial designs, Steffans sought legal help from religious liberty firm First Liberty. The group said it sent a demand letter arguing that the student had a constitutional right to religious expression.

Days later, First Liberty announced the district had changed course and would allow Steffans' original design.

""We are pleased the school district changed course and will allow Sabrina to truly express her deeply held beliefs in her design,"" Keisha Russell, senior counsel at First Liberty, said in a press release Wednesday. ""The First Amendment protects students' private expressions of faith in public schools.""

Grand Island Central School District Superintendent Brian Graham said the district was committed to fostering an inclusive environment that respects students and disputed that it violated students' rights. After consulting legal counsel, he said the school agreed to permit Steffans' design.

""We also take seriously our responsibility to uphold constitutional principles, including the First Amendment,"" Graham wrote in a statement to CBN. ""While we strongly dispute any assertion that our policies or decisions violated the rights of any student, the Board of Education and District leadership, after careful consultation with legal counsel, have decided that the student in question will be permitted to proceed with her original senior parking space design.""

He added the district will review its parking space program to determine whether changes are needed.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the debate over an increase in teacher salaries on 'Fox Report.'

Amid a trend of declining membership since the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union dues, the nation's two largest teachers' unions have poured tens of millions into left-wing causes, a new report from a conservative watchdog group finds.

The national nonprofit group, Defending Ed, released a report this week after combing through the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers' contributions to left-wing and far-left groups. The nonprofit found that the two unions spent a combined $43.5 million since 2022 to help fund state and federal political action committees and other ideologically left-wing entities, such as D.C. think tanks.  

""It is clear that the teachers unions' priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children,"" Defending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley told Fox News Digital. ""This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.""

Left-wing philanthropic behemoths like the Tides Network, New Venture Fund, Sixteen-Thirty Fund and Future Forward, the last of which was the main Super PAC supporting Kamla Harris' 2024 presidential run after former President Joe Biden dropped out, all received a combined nearly $1.5 million from the unions, according to the report. 

The unions also forked over significant amounts of cash for groups that focus on supporting left-wing candidates for public office, such as the Democratic Governors Association, Democrat's House Majority and Senate Majority PACs.

Other groups they have donated to include major left-wing think tanks like the Center for American Progress and its 501(c)(4) arm, which received close to a million dollars since 2022 from the two unions.

TEACHING HATE, HIDING TRUTH: NEA'S REAL AGENDA REVEALED IN LEAKED HANDBOOK

Aaron Withe, an expert on public-sector unions, pointed out that the National Education Association spends less than 10% of its budget on what he called ""representational activities,"" while, at the same time, the union spends 38% of its budget on contributions to left-leaning groups, lobbying and political gifts.  

""You'd think in light of the decline in union membership in recent years, that they'd start providing value to members that outweighs the cost of membership,"" Withe told Fox News Digital. ""Instead, they are appeasing the radical base of union members by advocating for men in women's sports, transitioning minors, antisemitism and other radical ideological stances.""

He added that this is just ""the tip of the iceberg"" too ""when you consider that there are thousands of statewide and city and county teachers unions that are mostly funding the same causes.""

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

When President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he faced the same formidable adversary that defined much of his first term: China. This time the stakes were even higher. The trade deficit with China had ballooned to roughly $300 billion, while IP protection, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial and international development practices remained significant issues. And Beijing doubled down – weaponizing its control of rare earth minerals, tightening its grip on semiconductors and wielding economic coercion against U.S. allies from Australia to Lithuania. 

Against this backdrop, Trump 47 adopted a two-pronged approach. On offense, the administration has kept maximum pressure on Beijing, staying firm on negotiation positions and refusing to trade away leverage until real concessions emerge. On defense, it has wielded tariffs not only as bargaining chips but as engines of industrial revival – reshoring supply chains, rebuilding America's manufacturing base and hardening strategic alliances to reduce dependence on China. 

These were not easy calls. Tariffs rattled markets. Pressure campaigns risked alienating partners. Yet the strategy has been to hold the line, play a long game and push forward until the U.S. secured fairer, reciprocal trade terms. In a world where semiconductors and rare earths are the new oil, this is about nothing less than U.S. national security. 

TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA

I have seen firsthand how high-stakes these negotiations can be. As I recount in my forthcoming book, ""A Seat at the Table,"" Chinese officials have long relied on psychological tactics, slow-walking responses through layers of bureaucracy, handing us last-minute drafts in Chinese – even removing chairs at negotiating tables. These are not trivial gestures. They are meant to unnerve, unsettle and push the U.S. team toward compromise.

The Trump response was simple but powerful: don't flinch. In Beijing, when presented with a Chinese draft that ignored our work, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin waved it away and insisted the talks proceed on the American document. When a chair was removed to show disrespect, we calmly got it back – without ever conceding authority. 

That posture of confidence – staying the course under pressure – continues today in Trump 47. Tariffs are sharper, more targeted and higher than before; allied trade deals (Japan, South Korea, the EU) allow us to focus resources on China; and deadlines are extended when useful, but only on U.S. terms. 

TRUMP TARIFFS PUSH INDIA CLOSER TO AMERICA'S STRATEGIC RIVALS CHINA AND RUSSIA

Critics say tariffs raise consumer prices. In the short term, they can. But the broader truth is that tariffs are tools to rewire incentives, drive investment back home, and ensure the United States does not remain vulnerable in sectors critical to survival. Already, the tariffs of Trump 47 are accelerating investment in domestic chip foundries, battery plants and energy infrastructure. They are also forcing hard conversations with allies about aligning supply chains – from rare earth processing in Australia to semiconductor alliances with Japan and the Netherlands. 

When Beijing weaponized exports of gallium and graphite, vital for defense and electronics, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act and doubled down on Indo-Pacific partnerships. The message is clear: America will not be held hostage to coercion. Strategic autonomy requires resilience, even if it comes with short-term discomfort.

How do you stay steady when the stakes are so high, when the pressure is relentless? Stand aside Hans Morgenthau. For me, the source I found was the timeless wisdom of ""Kedushas Levi,"" an 18th-century Chassidic work by Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev.  

The ""Kedushas Levi"" teaches that challenges – no matter how overwhelming – are never insurmountable. ""If you encounter an obstacle that is bigger than you, do not be fearful or frightened. With simple faith, what you fear will not harm you,"" it states. That teaching, echoing the Talmudic reality that the good Lord gives trials in proportion to a person's strength, gave me composure when sprinting to translate a Chinese draft in a Beijing motorcade, or when facing off with officials determined to stall and delay. 

TRUMP BLASTED FOR ‘STEEP CONCESSIONS TO BEIJING' AFTER CHIP DEAL, CANCELED TAIWANESE VISIT

It also teaches that truth, even when inconvenient, carries divine weight. When Chinese officials resisted opening their financial markets, I pointed out the obvious but often ignored truth: Chinese banks in the U.S. had seen double- and triple-digit growth, while U.S. banks in China struggled for even single digits. That argument broke through where posturing could not.

Negotiations with China will not be wrapped up overnight. But this is a contest of wills as much as economics. And here, the lessons of faith matter most. Facing giants, the Jewish tradition teaches, you do not shrink back. You lift your head high, stand on truth, and trust that what feels impossible can indeed be achieved. 

That is how we approached China in Trump 45. That is how we are approaching China in Trump 47. And that is how America, with faith and fortitude, can win. 

Mitchell A. Silk served as assistant secretary for International Markets at the U.S. Treasury during the first term of President Donald Trump. His forthcoming book, ""A Seat at the Table: An Inside Account of Trump's Global Economic Revolution,"" will be published by Post Hill Press in September 2025.

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said there is no emergency and President Donald Trump is ""attempting to manufacture a crisis"" after reports that the federal government may deploy the National Guard to Chicago to address crime in the city.

""The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention,"" the governor said in a statement on Saturday.

This comes after Trump's move to boost the presence of federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to reduce crime. Hundreds of federal agents and National Guard troops have been deployed to the streets of D.C. as part of the federal takeover of the district.

Now, Trump says Chicago could be his administration's next target for a federal crackdown on crime.

The Pentagon has planned a military deployment to Chicago for weeks, which could include mobilizing a few thousand National Guard troops next month, according to The Washington Post.

""The safety of the people of Illinois is always my top priority,"" Pritzker said. ""There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active duty military within our own borders."" 

The governor also accused Trump of ""attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he is causing working families.""

""We will continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect the people of Illinois,"" he continued.

Democrat Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said the report that Trump is preparing to deploy federal troops in Chicago ""proves what we all know: he is willing to go to any lengths possible to create chaos if it means more political power—no matter who gets hurt.""

""As Lieutenant Governor and throughout my career, I've fervently fought for the reformation of our criminal legal system and under the Pritzker-Stratton administration, we've made tremendous progress,"" she said in a statement. ""Crime in Chicago is declining and there's absolutely no rationale for this decision, other than to distract from the pain Trump is inflicting on working families with his dangerous agenda.""

""Illinois, Governor Pritzker and I are here to stand for your rights, your freedoms, and will protect you against whatever storms of hate and fear come our way,"" she added.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, earlier said ""unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities.""

""An unlawful deployment of the [National Guard] would be unsustainable and would threaten to undermine the historic progress we have made,"" Johnson said in a statement on Friday.

The mayor also cited data showing that homicides, robberies and shootings have dipped significantly in the past year.

Emely Martinez was not licensed to perform dental work, according to authorities. (Credit: WTVT)

A Florida woman was recently arrested after allegedly performing unlicensed dental work in multiple counties.

Emely Martinez, 35, is accused of leaving victims with infections and damaged teeth after installing phony veneers with cyanoacrylate glue – aka ""crazy or superglue"" – investigators allege.

Martinez is charged with fraud and practicing dentistry without a license, among other offenses.

Emely Martinez was arrested after allegedly performing unlicensed dental work. 

WOMAN ACCUSED OF TREATING THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AS A FAKE NURSE

Martinez offered discounted full-mouth veneer treatments at the Tapp Inn Beauty Bar in Pinellas Park, where she advertised herself as a veneer technician, FOX 13 Tampa Bay reported.

Police allege she was unlicensed and had no schooling, leaving multiple victims with hefty bills from emergency dental work to reverse the damage.

""They actually have had to pay thousands of dollars to get their teeth fixed, and some of them had to wait for the infection to clear and go get their teeth fixed,"" Pinellas Park Police Department Sgt. Windy Vater told FOX 13.

Dental work should be performed by licensed technicians. 

LOUISIANA 'MEDICAID MILLIONAIRE' BOUGHT LAMBORGHINI WHILE CLAIMING GOVERNMENT BENEFITS FOR YEARS

Two people reported Martinez after experiencing pain, infections and complications following the procedures, according to arrest warrants.

While real veneers can cost more than $1,000 per tooth, the report noted Martinez allegedly charged about $3,000 for the entire set, promising a lifespan of five to seven years.

Police told FOX 13 she may have also pulled teeth and performed dental work on children.

It is unclear how many victims received services from the faux dentist. (iStock)

Authorities said she may have changed her name and created additional businesses to hide the fraud, according to the report.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The Smithsonian is long overdue for a housecleaning","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3777258/smithsonian-long-overdue-for-housecleaning/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The Smithsonian Institution removed references to President Donald Trump earlier this year from its exhibit on the impeachment of presidents. This small change, reverting the exhibit to its pre-Trump form, highlighted the important fact that a museum can change when or if it wants to.

The removal of Trump from the impeachment exhibit was no doubt an attempt to draw White House scrutiny away from the museum network and its decadeslong embrace of leftist projects, particularly historical revisionism. This seeks to portray the United States as the primary villain in a simplistic and self-hating narrative that casts white Christians as oppressors and ethnic and religious minorities as victims.

Trump was not mollified. He wrote on Truth Social, “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.”

For decades, the Smithsonian, like so many other institutions that are supposed to offer educational resources, has embraced this rewriting of history. Rather than celebrate the nation's progress in ending slavery and segregation, it has instead adopted fashionable, culturally Marxist ideas that the nuclear family and a good work ethic are a product of “whiteness.” The National Museum of African American History and Culture has shamelessly and divisively neutered the idea that the normalization of white culture must be overcome. The director of the National Portrait Gallery once expressed the bitter resentment of radical egalitarians, saying the museum she ran needed to stop being about “the wealthy, the pale and the male.”

Examples abound across the entire system. As the Washington Examiner's Jeremiah Poff wrote earlier this year, a food exhibit at the National Museum of American History tries to cast doubt on the notion that obesity is harmful to health, while another sneered that the Monroe Doctrine, which informed the nation's foreign policy for two centuries, was “used to justify future U.S. military invasions.”

If the U.S. is to survive as a nation, it must revive the teaching of a coherent, honest, and inspirational history. A people, any people, including Americans, will fall apart without a unifying history, without shared legends, morals, stories, traditions, celebrations, holidays, and culture. It should acknowledge and recognize its failures and faults, but not flagellate itself with them. Those who have overturned our culture during the past 70-odd years, including the curators of Smithsonian museums, are dragging our nation. They should be celebrating its successes and triumphs and imparting a sympathetic understanding of our history and how we got here. They should, like our political leaders, have an open-eyed and honest, but nevertheless steady, prejudice in favor of their own country.

That means an honest account of the American founding, the revolution, and the timeless principles that inspired the flawed but great men who made it happen. It means an honest accounting of the evils of slavery, but also of the tens of thousands of men who gave their lives to end that horrific practice. It means an honest accounting of segregation and racism, but also of the clear and indisputable progress that led to the election of the first black president in 2008.

THE AMERICAN HISTORY MUSEUM: AN EXHIBITION FOR DEI

The Smithsonian today does not do that. Its museums, which should be centers of learning that instill a sense of patriotism and belonging in its people and wonder and admiration in the rest of the world, instead try to diminish and destroy the culture and society of America. Rather than celebrate the great things America has offered its people and the world, it has sought to denigrate and delegitimize them and reject President Abraham Lincoln's opinion that the country is “the last best hope of man on Earth.”

If the national museums are to restore respect and honor to the history of America, the housecleaning Trump demands is sorely needed. It is, indeed, long overdue. To allow cultural Marxists to enmesh with and drag down the Smithsonian institution would accelerate national decline. As Lincoln also said, “As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When members of the Democratic National Committee convene in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Monday, they'll face a host of troubles, both domestic and foreign, hanging over their summer meeting.

Shut out of power at the White House and Congress, Democrats face a sizable fundraising gap between the DNC and the Republican National Committee. They're also facing another sizable voter registration gap against Republicans among states with publicly available data.

The party is still dealing with tensions among the progressive wing over Israel's war with Hamas. Some leaders have been hesitant to embrace Zohran Mamdani, who has been critical of Israel's treatment of the Gaza Strip, in his bid to become New York City's next mayor. At its summer gathering, the DNC will consider two resolutions on the worsening crises in Gaza.

Democrats will also have to consider how to respond to the GOP's redistricting efforts to sway the 2026 midterm elections in their favor, who the party's de facto leader will be, and how to convince disaffected Americans to return to their party.

“This is not the first time that each of us has gone to a DNC meeting where we have a number of issues that need to be tackled,” said John Verdejo, a North Carolina DNC member. “And once you gather that meeting, we felt refreshed, we felt fine, we felt rejuvenated. And this is not unlike those other meetings.”

DEMOCRATS TO CONSIDER GAZA RESOLUTIONS AT DNC SUMMER MEETING

But the three-day summer meeting from Aug. 25 to 27 will at least have one issue Democrats won't have to worry about: David Hogg. The former DNC vice chairman stepped down earlier this year as it became clear he would not prevail during a new election to elect two vice chairs.

Here are some of the top issues that will influence the summer meeting:

With President Donald Trump in power and the GOP controlling both the House and the Senate, the RNC has raked in millions of dollars over the DNC.

Federal Election Commission reports show that the RNC had $80 million cash on hand at the end of June, compared to the DNC's $15 million.

The $65 million deficit between the two committees is larger than in May, when the RNC had $72.4 million on hand compared to the DNC's $15 million, a $57.4 million gap. 

The lag in fundraising has worried some Democrats about whether the party will be able to compete in next year's midterm elections, where they are hoping to retake the House and possibly the Senate, although that may be a tougher task.

“Of course, I'm hoping that the party will right the ship, get structure down, be more disciplined,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns.

Ceraso also noted that state party infrastructure is important in making up the fundraising gap outside of the DNC. “Now, arguably, state parties will say, ‘We need more resources, we need more resources from the DNC. We need to have relationships with donors,'” he said. “And that's completely valid.”

In April, Martin unveiled a plan to invest $1 million monthly in all 50 state parties, with $17,500 going to officials in blue states and $22,500 going to officials in red states. “We are sending a strong message that our party is building from the ground up and we're building everywhere,” Martin said at the time.

A recent report from the New York Times details a Democratic Party that has lost voter registration ground to the GOP in 30 states.

Between the 2020 and 2024 elections, Republicans gained a 4.5 million lead over Democrats in the 30 states that track registration data. 

In Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, important battleground states that will sway the 2026 and 2028 elections, Democrats also saw their lead slip.

The DNC announced this week that it was rolling out new tools, technology, and pilot programs to better organize voters and volunteers for the first time in nearly 20 years. The DNC will begin using the new technology in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states holding gubernatorial elections this year.

Martin told NBC News that the goal was to be “organizing everywhere to win anywhere.”

“We also need to go double down on our message, make it more attractive for folks to join the Democratic Party, to register as a Democrat, versus coming in and registering as independent or Republican,” added Verdejo. 

After defeating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the democratic primary, Mamdani, a socialist, has struggled to win over Democratic leadership.

Neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite both lawmakers representing New York. Other prominent Democratic New Yorkers, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul, have yet to endorse Mamdani. 

However, former President Barack Obama and Mamdani did speak by phone in June after he won the primary. Mamdani has raised more than $1 million, much of it from small donors, an indication of strong support among New Yorkers and Democrats.

Democrats are also dealing with another battle over the party's direction after the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which Martin used to chair, rescinded its endorsement of Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor due to a voting system error.

DEMOCRATS HOPE ‘ORGANIZING SUMMER' CAN GALVANIZE SUPPORTERS

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the more progressive voices in the party, was among a list of DFL lawmakers who criticized the decision to strip Fateh, another socialist, of his endorsement.

“It is inexcusable to overturn the results weeks after the convention because board members did not like the outcome,” DFL members who disagreed with the decision said in a statement. “Not only does this decision set an extremely dangerous precedent, it will undermine the DFL endorsing process going forward and fails to center the will of delegates.”

During the summer meeting, DNC members will vote on two separate Gaza resolutions, one put forth by Martin and the other championed by more progressive members.

The resolution from Martin calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of humanitarian aid, the return of hostages, and a two-state solution between Israel and Gaza.

The other resolution calls for an end to military aid to Israel and pushes for Palestinian statehood, neither of which will get traction with a GOP-controlled Washington. 

As images of starving children in Gaza spread and accusations of famine have tilted the tide against Israel, more Democrats have been willing to break their allegiance to the Middle Eastern nation. Democrats don't expect the issue to be solved at their summer meeting. 

“This is an issue that has been ongoing since Jesus walked the Earth,” said Verdejo. “Even the best folks who are diplomats who work at the [United Nations] have yet to figure this out.”

But tensions over how Democrats approach the conflict have not abated since protesters heckled both former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. At the DNC winter meeting earlier this year in National Harbor, Maryland, protesters repeatedly interrupted meetings and debates among the chair candidates.

“Gaza hasn't really changed a whole lot since February. And so I think the same passionate, caring human beings who were outside where we were at in Maryland are going to be in that room,” said Ceraso. 

“It's a very tricky situation. And I think we're the party that's willing to deal with nuance, and Republicans are not so,” he continued. “And that's the challenge of dealing with nuance, is that nuance requires a lot of navigation. The Republicans don't have to do any nuance right now.”

Democrats will face a tough congressional map during the 2026 midterm elections if several GOP states successfully implement mid-decade redrawings.

Texas began the redistricting race by creating five extra GOP House seats via a new congressional map that is all but certain to get signed into law despite Democratic stalling efforts. But Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) countered by signing two redistricting bills Thursday to redraw a new congressional map in California.

California voters head to the polls for a special election on Nov. 4 to grant final approval to the new map, which would net Democrats five more House seats. 

Yet Democrats still have more problems if other Republican-led states, such as Indiana, Missouri, and Florida, create more GOP-friendly districts. 

NEWSOM SIGNS REDISTRICTING BILLS, TAKES FIGHT OVER CONGRESSIONAL MAP TO VOTERS

“This is all hands on deck right now,” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) during a DNC press call this week. 

“They're not going to stop with Texas, we know that,” added Newsom. “What we're doing … neutralizes what's happening in Texas. People have this chance with this ballot, Nov. 4, to stand up to the rule of law.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump and Hegseth continue to remake senior military positions","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3776714/trump-hegseth-remake-senior-military-allvin/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was fired from his post this week, making him the latest casualty of President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's reimagined version of the U.S. armed forces.

In less than a year, the duo has forced out several senior military officers, some of whom Trump had promoted during his first term, who don't meet the criteria they are seeking from the service chiefs.

Kruse's firing, which was first reported on Friday, came days after Gen. David Allvin, the chief of staff of the Air Force, announced his intent to retire on Nov. 1, 2025, about two years into a four-year term. Allvin said he would remain in the position until the Senate can confirm his successor.

Kruse's agency, the DIA, was responsible for an initial assessment of the effectiveness of the U.S. military strikes targeting three of Iran's nuclear facilities that downplayed the president and secretary's claims of “total obliteration.”

“I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve as the 23rd Air Force Chief of Staff and I'm thankful for Secretary [Troy] Meink, Secretary Hegseth, and President Trump's faith in me to lead our service,” he said in a statement. “More than anything, I'm proud to have been part of the team of Airmen who live out our core values of integrity, service and excellence every day as we prepare to defend this great nation.”

Hegseth reportedly informed Allvin last week that he was being asked to retire and, in return, would be allowed to announce the decision, according to the Washington Post.

That courtesy was not afforded to Kruse, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, then the chief of naval operations; Gen. Charles Q. Brown, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Allvin's former No. 2, Gen. James Slife, the former vice chief of staff of the Air Force; and Adm. Linda Fagan, then the Coast Guard commandant.

Fagan was fired from her role within days of the Trump administration coming to power.

A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security told the Washington Examiner that Fagan was fired for her “failure” to deploy resources effectively to support border security, “inadequate” leadership resulting in recruitment and retention shortfalls, “mismanagement of key acquisitions,” and the “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion.

Trump announced in a Truth Social post on Feb. 21 that he fired Brown, Franchetti, and Slife without providing an explanation.

“Because each service chief was seen within their service as qualified and performing the duties, each has been viewed as an abrupt departure and out of cycle. Actions like these send a signal to those aspiring to future senior leadership positions,” Gene Moran, a national security expert and Navy veteran, told the Washington Examiner. 

The president also removed Gen. Timothy Haugh, then-the director of the National Security Agency, in April.

“It's a known fact that positions at this level serve at the pleasure of the president. However, history suggests that a senior officer would need to be pretty far out of step with the president and the administration to warrant such a manner of dismissal,” he added. “I've been associated with the military for over 40 years and do not recall a period with this much widespread disruption.”

Hegseth, prior to his nomination as defense secretary, was critical of Brown and Franchetti. He questioned their qualifications and whether their appointments were more about their race and sex than their ability to lead.

The secretary and president have long denounced diversity and inclusion efforts and have been critical of the military's implementation of such programs and training. One of Hegseth's biggest priorities since his confirmation has been to undo those policies.

The service chiefs take their orders from civilian leaders, and they are obligated, short of breaking the law, to carry out those orders. They also serve at the pleasure of the president and the defense secretary.

“The president and secretary of defense have the right to fire any three- or four-star [officer]. They are all in temporary billets. That is their prerogative,” retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told the Washington Examiner. “Historically, it's been used for poor performance, not [carrying out orders] my predecessor asked you to do, but I don't support.”

“It has not been used as a tool to try to reshape the force in some kind of vision,” added Montgomery, now a senior director at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.

Only some of their replacements have been confirmed. 

Trump has nominated Gen. Thomas Bussiere to serve as the vice chief of staff, though he now could be in the running for the top spot. Bussiere, in his current role as the head of Air Force Global Strike Command, oversaw parts of Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. military's surprise bombing of Iran's nuclear program in June.

Gen. Dan Caine was confirmed as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April.

He had long been in Trump's good graces after the two met in Iraq in 2018 during his first term in office. Caine told Trump at the time that he believed the coalition of forces fighting against the Islamic State would be able to defeat the terrorist group much faster than many others believed, and he turned out to be right.

TOP AIR FORCE GENERAL ANNOUNCES EARLY RETIREMENT AFTER PRESSURE FROM TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

Trump has claimed in retelling the story of their first interaction that Caine also put on a “Make America Great Again” hat, indicating his support for the president, though Caine denied this part of the story during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Two of the service chiefs that predate the current administration are Gen. Randy George, the chief of staff of the Army, and Gen. Eric Smith, the commandant of the Marine Corps. Both “fit Pete Hegseth's unusual interpretation of what makes a good four-star” in part because “they can both do a lot of pushups,” Montgomery added.

In May, Hegseth signed a memo directing a reduction of at least 20% of the four-star positions across the Active Component, a 20% reduction of general officers in the National Guard, as well as an additional minimum of 10% cuts in general and flag officers.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations would continue after Florida's “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention facility was ordered to be shut down within 60 days.

The Trump administration was handed a legal setback on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the shutdown of the large-scale detention facility, saying it violated a federal law that requires an environmental review before any major federal construction project. Florida immediately appealed the decision, which requires the removal of all migrants housed at the facility, as well as generators, fencing, and other construction materials.

Homan addressed the decision for the first time on Saturday, largely appearing unconcerned about it potentially hampering the Trump administration's mass deportation plans, especially as more facilities like “Alligator Alcatraz” are in the works.

“They're not going to stop us doing what we're doing. We'll follow the judge's order and we'll litigate and we'll appeal it. But [the] bottom line is, we're going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national security threats every day across this country,” he said in an interview with NewsNation.

Homan added that migrants could simply be moved to another facility, though he did not specify where that would be.

“If we have to send them to another facility, that's what we're going to do. That's why the president has asked for 100,000 beds in the ‘big, beautiful bill.' So, we're going to build 100,000 beds, so we're not going to have a lack of bed space,” the border czar said.

He also slammed Judge Kathleen M. Williams, who issued the order, as “radical,” echoing other remarks from Florida officials including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), who blasted Williams as an “activist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench.”

FLORIDA JUDGE ORDERS ‘ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ' MIGRANT FACILITY SHUT DOWN WITHIN 60 DAYS

DeSantis has been optimistic that the state's appeal will succeed, however.

“We're not going to be deterred; we're totally in the right on this,” he said on Friday. “This is not going to deter us. We're going to continue working on the deportations, advancing that mission.”

The case will play out in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, with a court date not yet set.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","If You Must Play One Sport, Make It Tennis","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/tennis-us-open-health-aging-lifetime/683980/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The longer you play, the more it will do for your health.

The U.S. Open is one of the few occasions a year when tennis really gets its due in America. More than 1 million people—including Simone Biles, Aaron Judge, and other top athletes—shelled out for tickets last year, feverish heat be damned. Ticket sales this year are up by 8 percent. The sold-out after-party, featuring the band Odesza, will transform New York's Louis Armstrong Stadium from tennis court to dance club. All of the pomp around the Open harkens back to tennis's history as an aristocratic leisure; the first precursor to the Open, in 1881, was held on a grass court in Newport, Rhode Island, at the height of the Gilded Age. Instead of electronica, spectators were treated to a string quartet.

But over the past half century, tennis has been dramatically democratized. The sport has been growing since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when hitting a ball outside, 80 feet from anyone else, seemed to be one of the healthiest exercise options available; last year, more than 25 million Americans played. Tennis today unfolds predominantly on public courts. You might even have a middle school up the street where you can play—just disregard the blue pickleball tape across the baseline. All you need is a racket, a ball, and one other person to return your serves. If you don't know how to hit, Venus Williams, the winner of seven Grand Slams, can teach you a forehand on YouTube.

All of that makes tennis a refreshingly easy sport to pick up. But its real advantage over other sports is what happens when you keep on playing.

Tennis is a full-body workout. It not only builds muscle but also elevates your heart rate. It is notably more aerobically challenging than pickleball, which has, for the past few years, infringed on tennis's court space and crowded the zeitgeist. To reach the tennis ball before its fateful second bounce requires horsepower, and you're responsible for covering a lot of ground—more than double the pickleball plot. The tennis net is also, ahem, two inches higher at center court, making it harder to clear. Frequent tennis play improves bone density, which staves off fractures and osteoporosis.

Crucially, tennis is a lifetime sport (two coaches described their clients' age ranges to me as between 3 and 90), which means its benefits can last through middle age and your elder years if you stick with it. Keeping up with tennis over multiple decades was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in men in a 2002 study. A Danish study from 2018 found that tennis players lived nearly a decade longer than their sedentary peers—and also longer than swimmers, cyclers, and joggers. No other sport in the analysis was correlated with such a large boost to life expectancy. (Thanks to this study and others, the United States Tennis Association markets tennis as “the world's healthiest sport.”)

At its essence, tennis is about moving through space correctly, says John Ratey, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and the author of Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain. Receiving the ball, you gauge its trajectory—speed, spin, height of the bounce—while determining how to most efficiently reach it. Then, while running, racket outstretched, you decide how you'll return it, with a new angle, speed, and spin. Ideally, the chosen combination results in the ball landing inside the court, and going to where your opponent is not. Also ideally, the racket (as directed by your body) follows your mind's split-second intention. You even have to factor in the wind and the sun. The sport demands so much complex motor coordination, as well as finesse, that it carries the same cognitive, balance, and coordination benefits as dancing. (You need only watch videos of Roger Federer leaping and gliding across the court to realize how tennis approximates the quickstep.)

Like any sport, of course, tennis can lead to injury; the most common ones involve sprained ankles, a sore back, torn shoulder cartilage, and weakened tendons. But it's remarkably low-risk. In an Aspen Institute comparison of the 10 most popular high-school team sports, tennis ranked first for safety, with infinitesimal rates of catastrophic injury and concussion. Tennis may even help stave off injury, especially for older players. Paul Wright, the chair of Nuvance Health's Neuroscience Institute, told me that if you can balance yourself on a tennis court, you're more likely to successfully negotiate obstacles at home, avoiding falls.

Perhaps most important, tennis is a workout for the brain. Learning new skills—rock climbing, knitting, chess—can buffer against cognitive decline. In one 2023 study, older adults who were assigned to weekly skills classes developed working memory and attention levels typical of people decades their junior. But there's reason to expect that any tennis player, regardless of their level, can reap cognitive rewards. Racket sports require completing tasks in unusually rapid succession. (Here comes the ball again! And again, at this new angle!) You always have to be on, Wright said. It should be no surprise, then, that prolonged tennis training has been shown to shorten reaction times; among children, it has also been linked with enhanced decision making.

What's uniquely beneficial about tennis is that it's both highly complicated and highly aerobic. Any aerobic exercise can benefit the brain by improving mood, which in turn aids memory and cognition. Tennis, with its explosive bursts—sprinting to the ball, stopping, lunging laterally, jogging backwards to the baseline—can yield especially powerful results. James Gladstone, the chief of sports medicine at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, told me that tennis resembles high-intensity interval training, which has been shown to improve cognitive function and memory in healthy older adults. In youths, it has positive effects on cognitive performance and attention.

If you want to pick up a sport, I submit that tennis wins in straight sets—not only because it boosts health but also because hitting a ball and receiving it is a great time. Fun reduces stress, and the more stress you have, the more your body needs to move to keep your brain running smoothly, Ratey wrote in Spark. Plus, if you enjoy an exercise, you'll do more of it and gain more health benefits. Several players described to me the addictive pleasure of striking the ball correctly: the popping sound of ground strokes, the satisfying release of driving the ball from the legs rather than the arms.

Other players find that tennis's learning curve only stokes their interest. Mastering the sport takes years; that might sound intimidating, but to many, it's motivation. Laurence Barrett, 89, has played tennis for nearly 70 years, dodging his son's entreaties to play pickleball (for one, he can't stand the high-pitched thwack of the plastic ball). On the morning that we spoke this spring, he had, by his own accounting, hit a few “damn good volleys.”

For most of my own life, I had swung a racket once a decade, aiming haphazardly and getting by with a rustic version of tennis. But a couple of years ago, I decided I would learn to hit a clean forehand that didn't sail skyward. I began taking lessons, soaking in key information such as Don't get too close to the dang ball. On YouTube, Williams taught me to move my shoulders “as a unit” in the forehand, and so when she appeared as a wildcard at the D.C. Open last month, I bought a ticket.

I showed up two days after the 45-year-old Williams had served nine aces and defeated a woman nearly half her age. I watched as her forehand whipsawed the July humidity, her shoulders unlocking velocity and angles that were even more astonishing in person. How many hundreds of thousands of forehands had she hit throughout her lifetime? Watching her, I could imagine playing the duration of mine.

A poem

I am talking my way back to the poem's turn and where it might lie outside my skirted body, a corded place where bluish sky paints my attention, and empties itself into a golden silence— without talk or sound. Phrases now feel perversely sentient and yet devilishly wrong. Every night I talk with the hope that speech itself will burn me its one true alphabet. Nevertheless, morning's magic always looks opaque because a stronger feeling replaced the lesser one, and the rightness must reach the poem's hearted center so that I am led to what might be a plateau of nested changes, something irresistible, those letters of gold, maybe anew.

Sharing books with my children was about a lot more than literacy.

The moment my oldest child was born, I reached for an anthology of Romantic poetry that I have owned for decades and began reading. “Sweet joy befall thee,” I said to my baby, through tears, bestowing a blessing with the words of William Blake.

The benediction was unplanned. I had brought the book to the hospital for myself, along with a memoir by Shirley Jackson and a pile of well-worn novels, because I'd imagined that I would want to be surrounded by my favorite writers at a time of such magnitude. But as soon as my squirming newborn was placed on my chest, I was overcome by the desire not to keep these works to myself, but to share my love of literature with my baby.

As a child, I had read more or less continuously to myself, with breaks only here and there: for dinner, for math class, for college graduation. I couldn't imagine why anything should change now that I'd become a parent. Still, it felt rude to keep my eyes on a book when I had a baby in my arms, who, I had been told, was born with the capacity to see only as far as his mother's face—my face. So I resolved that rather than reading quietly, I would do so aloud, drawing my son, Matan, into the text alongside me.

The practice let me connect with him (and, later, with my other four children) through the activity I enjoyed most. When I think about the pleasure of those exchanges, it saddens me to know that these days, fewer parents seem to be reading aloud to their kids. In a recent survey of U.K. parents, conducted by NielsenIQ BookData in collaboration with two children's-book publishers, just 41 percent of parents with children ages 4 and younger said they frequently read aloud to their children, down from 64 percent in a similar survey they conducted in 2012. Looked at one way, that decline suggests a missed opportunity for parents to instill in their children an early love of reading. But I'd argue that parents who don't read to their kids miss out on even more. Reading aloud to my children was, at least for me, a way to guide them as they started to understand the world, and as I started to understand them.

Read: Why some people become lifelong readers

In the maternity ward, I read to my son constantly. We were interrupted repeatedly—by nurses coming to check vitals, or loud announcements over the hospital loudspeaker—which made it hard to get through a chapter, let alone an entire book. So I read poetry instead: Samuel Taylor Coleridge's “To an Infant,” William Wordsworth's “Ode: Intimations of Immortality From Recollections of Early Childhood.” At home, where it was calmer, we switched to novels, starting with Olga Tokarczuk's Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead—until a friend prompted me to wonder whether I ought to read books with pictures that my son could see and pages that he could touch and chew. It was my first experience of maternal guilt: Why had I assumed that he was interested in the tale of a reclusive translator stumbling on dead bodies in the frozen Polish woods?

So I added board books to our repertoire. One that I remember vividly was very simple, with no words except the title, Black & White. It seemed fitting, given infants' limited color vision. The book unfolded like an accordion: One side had a series of white objects depicted against a black background, and the other side had a series of black objects depicted against a white background. The first time I read it, I took a deep breath, as if warning Matan that what he was about to hear would sound very different from Blake, or Coleridge, or Tokarczuk. I pointed to each object and made up a tune that I sang as I “read” the book aloud—bottle and keys and button and boat; butterfly, leaf, banana, and bird. It was almost like poetry.

As I unfolded and refolded the black-and-white accordion pages, I wondered how much Matan was absorbing. He was soothed by the cadences of my voice, but I couldn't tell if he was able to focus on the objects, or to distinguish black from white. At that point, like most newborns, he was still adjusting to the pattern of day and night. Each time I read Black & White, I imagined that I was teaching him to see—drawing back the darkness so that the light might appear distinct and his vision might sharpen into focus.

The separation of light and darkness is one of God's first acts in Genesis, part of the creation story. But the midrash—the Jewish rabbinic interpretive tradition—tells a different version. According to the rabbis, the Torah existed for 2,000 years before creation. They teach that just as an architect cannot build a palace without a blueprint, God could not construct the universe without the Torah.

In that version of the story, books are our guides—something that resonated deeply with me. When I read to Matan, I was teaching him how to make sense of his surroundings: how to discern the white bottle and boat from the black background on the page, and, later on, how to separate good from evil, right from wrong.

And, yes, I was of course teaching him how to read. Another of his favorite board books was First 100 Words, which featured full-color photographs of a series of labeled objects from a baby's everyday life: brush, tub, duck, on one page; spoon, cup, bib on another. I watched in wonder as he learned to point with his tiny finger as I read aloud the name of each item and, later, as he learned to say them. “Spoon!” he cried excitedly, and it was as if he were summoning the object into existence then and there, creating his world through words.

Read: Why kids aren't falling in love with reading

Cynthia Ozick, in an essay titled “The Ladle,” writes about spoons as a metaphor for all the ways we dip into knowledge and draw up wisdom. The ladle in a kitchen drawer leads her to the Big Dipper and Joseph's pit and the wells dug by the patriarchs in the book of Genesis. And now, as Matan encountered that spoon on the page, he too was dipping into a well of knowledge, drawing up wisdom.

So, I would come to see, was I. While Matan was still an infant, the delight of reading to him lay not in the pages we turned but in the wheels that seemed to turn in his mind as we read together: the flicker of recognition in his eye, the smallest trace of a smile. Each expression was a window into his expanding self. I wasn't just reading a board book. I was learning how to read my child.

Only part of the left's most promising political party even wants to win elections or come to power.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

If Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, wins this fall's election, he will occupy the most powerful executive position of any American socialist. At the moment, the closest contenders are two mayors in California and a county executive in Maryland. No wonder, then, that American socialists have begun to dream big.

Earlier this month, the Democratic Socialists of America, of which Mamdani is a member, held its biannual convention in Chicago, attended by 1,500 members. There, the organization pledged to “build a broad left-labor coalition” and “draft a socialist candidate” to run for president in 2028.

Why shouldn't they? Mamdani's primary campaign in New York showed that an appealing socialist candidate with a strong economic message could generate voter enthusiasm. Nor is Mamdani the first: Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remain popular with the Democratic base, and just this year they brought out tens of thousands of supporters with their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. According to a recent poll, 67 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of all Americans under 30 years old view socialism favorably. And with 85,000 members, the DSA is already the country's biggest leftist organization, larger even than the Communist Party during its heyday in the 1940s.

But such numbers don't add up to much political power in a country of 340 million. DSA counts only three representatives in Congress and no senators (Sanders is sympathetic but has never been a member). For the average voter, even 10 years after Sanders's historic presidential run, American socialists are simply not a distinct, recognizable political force. And the reasons for this failure were entirely manifest at the meeting in Chicago: A significant part of the organization doesn't share its traditional concept of an electoral path to socialism.

Michael Powell: The mainstreaming of Zohran Mamdani

Little about this convention suggested a mass political movement intent on winning elections and coming to power. Mamdani, AOC, and Sanders were absent, and so was their welcoming, practical political style. In fact, DSA's national leadership has voted not to endorse AOC, and many in the organization are now actively hostile to her. Some even put forward a resolution at the convention to formally censure her for her “tacit support of Zionism,” on the grounds that she had supported the funding of defensive Iron Dome weapons for Israel, said that Israel had a right to self-defense, and “failed to support Palestinian resistance” in a media interview. (The resolution never reached a vote.) The mostly young and white crowd hardly discussed Donald Trump's presidency (a motion that urged such discussion was voted down early on) and seemed to consist of a consortium of activists, many of them focused on single issues. Some were preoccupied with protesting the convention's lack of a masking mandate.

Many of the resolutions passed at the convention would have been nonstarters for national politicians such as Sanders or AOC. One pledged for the DSA to be a “fighting anti-Zionist” organization that would endorse only candidates who supported the BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement against Israel. (This would disqualify Sanders.) The resolution further called for any DSA member opposing BDS or affiliated with the liberal Jewish organization J Street to be expelled, along with anybody who believes that “Israel has a right to defend itself.” Moreover, some incidents at the convention cast serious doubt on DSA's commitment to the “democratic” part of its title. For example, the convention rejected an amendment to a resolution declaring that DSA stood “against all governments that engage in the repression of democratic rights.”

These were not the politics of DSA's visionary founder, Michael Harrington. A Marxist who died in 1989, Harrington called for solidarity with leftist movements around the world but also staunchly opposed authoritarianism. Many in today's DSA don't have time for him. In response to a post on X affirming Harrington's opposition to Stalin and Mao, DSA's chapter in Worcester, Massachusetts, posted a video of an attendee at the convention shouting, “Fuck you, Mike Harrington!” The Worcester chapter celebrated that the organization had put “more communists in leadership,” making it the “largest org of socialists, antizionists, and commies.”

This is not rhetoric or politics that could win elections in America. But to understand the discrepancy between the politics on the DSA convention floor and that of America's most popular socialist politicians requires a brief history. Harrington founded DSA in 1982 on the ashes of the Socialist Party of America, which had imploded a decade earlier, and the new party drew on the remnants of the youth- and student-led New Left of the 1960s. Unlike other American socialists, who would spend decades trying to establish an alternative to the duopoly of Democrats and Republicans, Harrington's DSA was lodged within the Democratic Party and sought to build a base for the left inside of it. The strategy of the far-leftists produced little more than an alphabet soup of avowedly socialist organizations that rarely surpassed a few hundred members. DSA, too, was a tiny organization of little political account for many decades. But when American socialism finally got its lucky break in 2016, it did so because Sanders ran in the Democratic Party primary, not because socialists launched another quixotic third-party campaign. A surge of popularity for democratic socialism took DSA, within a year or two, from an organization of roughly 6,000 people, with an average age of about 67, to one with more than 30,000 members, and an average age of 33.

The infusion of new blood overwhelmed the organization's leadership and suggested a need for some overhauling of its earlier mission. Some of the newcomers, including the young contributors and reading clubs gathered around the journal Jacobin, attempted to update Harrington's Cold War–era socialism. But the wave of new members also included an inchoate collection of activists, and the organization swiftly became a big tent for all manner of leftist tendencies—including many that lacked any commitment to Harrington's democratic tradition, some even holding that elections were a capitalist-state apparatus that socialists should not use to come to power.

DSA today has about two dozen internal factions (called “caucuses”), but its politics can really be divided into two broad wings. There is a mass-politics wing (grouped in the Socialist Majority and Groundwork caucuses), which seeks to elect socialists as Democrats and build a national organization that connects with the average American. Opposing it is a sectarian wing whose extremist politics have little to do with any notion of democratic socialism. The latter includes Red Star, a self-avowed “Marxist-Leninist caucus” that openly supports Hamas and emphasizes “the role of the vanguard in organizing the revolution.” Whereas the likes of Sanders have long lauded the New Deal, this group condemns that model as “extending concessions to the white working class to secure their loyalty to the capitalist state.” Similarly, it faults the Green New Deal that Sanders and AOC have championed for failing to articulate “a clear commitment to dismantling the settler-colonial and American imperialist projects.” Another caucus, Marxist Unity Group, calls for DSA “to free itself from the Democratic Party” and “fight to overthrow the Constitution,” in an effort to “destroy every institution that denies the people an authentic popular democracy, abolishing the Senate, the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, and the independent presidency.”

The differences between these two broad groups are not academic, and they have had real-life consequences. Under the pressure of the sectarian wing, the DSA refused to endorse Joe Biden or Kamala Harris in the past two presidential elections. In November 2023, the sectarians in the DSA leadership argued that a second Biden term would be no different from a second Trump term. A few months later, when the mainstream wing wanted to commit the DSA to “work to defeat Trump in the 2024 election, without endorsing the Democratic nominee,” the sectarians voted even that proposal down.

Michael Powell: Why older socialists are quitting the DSA

Most DSA members don't belong to any caucuses and don't play an active role in the organization. But since 2023, the organization's leadership has been effectively controlled by the sectarian wing, which won a majority in that year's convention. As anybody with experience in politics can tell you, committed sectarian activists who show up to enough meetings can capture leadership positions and convention delegates without necessarily representing the organization's actual membership. At the 2025 convention, the mainstream wing tried to pass a resolution for the leadership to be elected on the basis of one member, one vote, as opposed to being voted in by delegates to the convention (who are, in turn, elected by DSA's local chapters). The sectarian wing opposed and defeated the resolution. The Chicago convention elected a 27-member leadership of which the sectarian wing controls about 12 seats. The mainstream wing has about nine seats, and the rest fall somewhere in the middle. The convention also reelected the party's two co-chairs, one belonging to Groundwork, the other to Red Star.

The two wings are able to share power this way because DSA is extremely decentralized. The organization barely exists as a nationwide project. Instead, each branch does its own thing. By far the largest branch is the one in New York City, which has more than 11,000 members and is controlled by the mainstream wing. More than 80 percent of its membership in the Bronx and Queens voted to endorse AOC. The sectarian wing tends to dominate in smaller cities where it pursues a variety of projects. Such factionalism effectively prevents DSA from adopting any unified strategy.

The problem is not new on the left. Harrington himself once complained about a “vocal, and regularly televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and Vietcong flag wavers who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or both.” Democratic socialists who seek to run mass campaigns and attain power with elections are now encumbered by sharing an organization with “confrontationists” who hold fundamentally antidemocratic beliefs. If they wish to build a political force capable of coming to power, they must first decide who their allies are.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Artificial intelligence is ready to collaborate. Why fixate on automation?

No one doubts that our future will feature more automation than our past or present. The question is how we get from here to there, and how we do so in a way that is good for humanity.

Sometimes it seems the most direct route is to automate wherever possible, and to keep iterating until we get it right. Here's why that would be a mistake: imperfect automation is not a first step toward perfect automation, anymore than jumping halfway across a canyon is a first step toward jumping the full distance. Recognizing that the rim is out of reach, we may find better alternatives to leaping—for example, building a bridge, hiking the trail, or driving around the perimeter. This is exactly where we are with artificial intelligence. AI is not yet ready to jump the canyon, and it probably won't be in a meaningful sense for most of the next decade.

Rather than asking AI to hurl itself over the abyss while hoping for the best, we should instead use AI's extraordinary and improving capabilities to build bridges. What this means in practical terms: We should insist on AI that can collaborate with, say, doctors—as well as teachers, lawyers, building contractors, and many others—instead of AI that aims to automate them out of a job.

Radiology provides an illustrative example of automation overreach. In a widely discussed study published in April 2024, researchers at MIT found that when radiologists used an AI diagnostic tool called CheXpert, the accuracy of their diagnoses declined. “Even though the AI tool in our experiment performs better than two-thirds of radiologists,” the researchers wrote, “we find that giving radiologists access to AI predictions does not, on average, lead to higher performance.” Why did this good tool produce bad results?

A proximate answer is that doctors didn't know when to defer to the AI's judgment and when to rely on their own expertise. When AI offered confident predictions, doctors frequently overrode those predictions with their own. When AI offered uncertain predictions, doctors frequently overrode their own better predictions with those supplied by the machine. Because the tool offered little transparency, radiologists had no way to discern when they should trust it.

A deeper problem is that this tool was designed to automate the task of diagnostic radiology: to read scans like a radiologist. But automating a radiologist's entire diagnostic job was infeasible because CheXpert was not equipped to process the ancillary medical histories, conversations, and diagnostic data that radiologists rely on for interpreting scans. Given the differing capabilities of doctors and CheXpert, there was potential for virtuous collaboration. But CheXpert wasn't designed for this kind of collaboration.

When experts collaborate, they communicate. If two clinicians disagree on a diagnosis, they might isolate the root of the disagreement through discussion (e.g., “You're overlooking this.”). Or they might arrive at a third diagnosis that neither had been considering. That's the power of collaboration, but it cannot happen with systems that aren't built to listen. Where CheXpert's and the radiologist's assessments differed, the doctor was left with a binary choice: go with the software's statistical best guess or go with her own expert judgment.

It's one thing to automate tasks, quite another to automate whole jobs. This particular AI was designed as an automation tool, but radiologists' full scope of work defies automation at present. A radiological AI could be built to work collaboratively with radiologists, and it's likely that future tools will be.

Tools can be generally divided into two main buckets: In one bucket, you'll find automation tools that function as closed systems that do their work without oversight—ATMs, dishwashers, electronic toll takers, and automatic transmissions all fall into this category. These tools replace human expertise in their designated functions, often performing those functions better, cheaper, and faster than humans can. Your car, if you have one, probably shifts gears automatically. Most new drivers today will never have to master a stick shift and clutch.

In the second bucket you'll find collaboration tools, such as chain saws, word processors, and stethoscopes. Unlike automation tools, collaboration tools require human engagement. They are force multipliers for human capabilities, but only if the user supplies the relevant expertise. A stethoscope is unhelpful to a layperson. A chainsaw is invaluable to some, dangerous to many.

Automation and collaboration are not opposites, and are frequently packaged together. Word processors automatically perform text layout and grammar checking even as they provide a blank canvas for writers to express ideas. Even so, we can distinguish automation from collaboration functions. The transmissions in our cars are fully automatic, while their safety systems collaborate with their human operators to monitor blind spots, prevent skids, and avert impending collisions.

AI does not go neatly into either the automation bucket or the collaboration bucket. That's because AI does both: It automates away expertise in some tasks and fruitfully collaborates with experts in others. But it can't do both at the same time in the same task. In any given application, AI is going to automate or it's going to collaborate, depending on how we design it and how someone chooses to use it. And the distinction matters because bad automation tools—machines that attempt but fail to fully automate a task—also make bad collaboration tools. They don't merely fall short of their promise to replace human expertise at higher performance or lower cost, they interfere with human expertise, and sometimes undermine it.

The promise of automation is that the relevant expertise is no longer required from the human operator because the capability is now built-in. (And to be clear, automation does not always imply superior performance—consider self-checkout lines and computerized airline phone agents.) But if the human operator's expertise must serve as a fail-safe to prevent catastrophe—guarding against edge cases or grabbing the controls if something breaks—then automation is failing to deliver on its promise. The need for a fail-safe can be intrinsic to the AI, or caused by an external failure—either way, the consequences of that failure can be grave.

The tension between automation and collaboration lies at the heart of a notorious aviation accident that occurred in June 2009. Shortly after Air France Flight 447 left Rio De Janeiro for Paris, the plane's airspeed sensors froze over—a relatively routine, transitory instrument loss due to high-altitude icing. Unable to guide the craft without airspeed data, the autopilot automatically disengaged as it was set to do, returning control of the plane to the pilots. The MIT engineer and historian David Mindell described what happened next in his 2015 book, Our Robots, Ourselves:

When the pilots of Air France 447 were struggling to control their airplane, falling ten thousand feet per minute through a black sky, pilot David Robert exclaimed in desperation, “We lost all control of the airplane, we don't understand anything, we've tried everything!” At that moment, in a tragic irony, they were actually flying a perfectly good airplane … Yet the combination of startle, confusion, at least nineteen warning and caution messages, inconsistent information, and lack of recent experience hand-flying the aircraft led the crew to enter a dangerous stall. Recovery was possible, using the old technique for unreliable airspeed—lower the pitch angle of the nose, keep the wings level, and the airplane will fly as predicted—but the crew could not make sense of the situation to see their way out of it. The accident report called it “total loss of cognitive control of the situation.”

This wrenching and ultimately fatal sequence of events puts two design failures in sharp relief. One is that the autopilot was a poor collaboration tool. It eliminated the need for human expertise during routine flying. But when expert judgment was most needed, the autopilot abruptly handed control back to the startled crew, and flooded the zone with urgent, confusing warnings. The autopilot was a great automation tool—until it wasn't, when it offered the crew no useful support. It was designed for automation, not for collaboration.

The second failure, Mindell argued, was that the pilots were out of practice. No surprise: The autopilot was beguilingly good. Human expertise has a limited shelf life. When machines provide automation, human attention wanders and capabilities decay. This poses no problem if the automation works flawlessly or if its failure (perhaps due to something as mundane as a power outage) doesn't create a real-time emergency requiring human intervention. But if human experts are the last fail-safe against catastrophic failure of an automated system—as is currently true in aviation—then we need to vigilantly ensure that humans attain and maintain expertise.

Modern airplanes have another cockpit navigation aid, one that is less well known than the autopilot: the heads-up display. The HUD is a pure collaboration tool, a transparent LCD screen that superimposes flight data in the pilot's line of sight. It does not even pretend to fly the aircraft, but it assists the pilot by visually integrating everything that the flight computer digests about the plane's direction, pitch, power, and airspeed into a single graphic called the flight-path vector. Absent a HUD, a pilot must read multiple flight instruments to intuitively stitch this picture together. The HUD is akin to the navigation app on your smartphone—if that app also had night vision, speed sensors, and intimate knowledge of your car's engine and brakes.

The HUD is still a piece of complex software, meaning it can fail. But because it is built to collaborate and not to automate, the pilot continually maintains and gains expertise while flying with it—which, to be clear, is typically not the whole flight, but in crucial moments such as low-visibility takeoff, approach, and landing. If the HUD reboots or locks up during a landing, there is no abrupt handoff; the pilot already has hands on the control yoke for the entire time. Despite the fact that HUDs offer less automation than automatic landing systems, airlines have discovered that their planes suffer fewer costly tail strikes and tire blowouts when pilots use HUDs rather than auto-landers. Perhaps for this reason, HUDs are integrated into newer commercial aircraft.

Collaboration is not intrinsically better than automation. It would be ridiculous to collaborate with your car's transmission or to pilot your office elevator from floor to floor. But in some domains, occupations, or tasks where full automation is not currently achievable, where human expertise remains indispensable or a necessary fail-safe, tools should be designed to collaborate—to amplify human expertise, not to keep it on ice until the last possible moment.

One thing that our tools have not historically done for us is make expert decisions. Expert decisions are high-stakes, one-off choices where the single right answer is not clear—often not knowable—but the quality of the decision matters. There is no single best way, for example, to care for a cancer patient, write a legal brief, remodel a kitchen, or develop a lesson plan. But the skill, judgment, and ingenuity of human decision making determines outcomes in many of these tasks, sometimes dramatically so. Making the right call means exercising expert judgment, which means more than just following the rules. Expert judgment is needed precisely where the rules are not enough, where creativity, ingenuity, and educated guesses are essential.

But we should not be too impressed by expertise: Even the best experts are fallible, inconsistent, and expensive. Patients receiving surgery on Fridays fare worse than those treated on other days of the week, and standardized test takers are more likely to flub equally easy questions if they appear later on a test. Of course, most experts are far from the best in their fields. And experts of all skill levels may be unevenly distributed or simply unavailable—a shortage that is more acute in less affluent communities and lower-income countries.

Expertise is also slow and costly to acquire, requiring immersion, mentoring, and tons of practice. Medical doctors—radiologists included—spend at least four years apprenticing as residents; electricians spend four years as apprentices and then another couple as journeymen, before certifying as master electricians; law-school grads start as junior partners, and new Ph.D.s begin as assistant professors; pilots must log at least 1,500 hours of flight before they can apply for an Airline Transport Pilot license.

The inescapable fact that human expertise is scarce, imperfect, and perishable makes the advent of ubiquitous AI an unprecedented opportunity. AI is the first machine humanity has devised that can make high-stakes, one-off expert decisions at scale—in diagnosing patients, developing lesson plans, redesigning kitchens. AI's capabilities in this regard, while not perfect, have consistently been improving year by year.

What makes AI such a potent collaborator is that it is not like us. A modern AI system can ingest thousands of medical journals, millions of legal filings, or decades of maintenance logs. This allows it to surface patterns and keep up with the latest developments in health care, law, or vehicle maintenance that would elude most humans. It offers breadth of experience that crosses domains and the capacity to recognize subtle patterns, interpolate among facts, and make new predictions. For example, Google DeepMind's AlphaFold AI overcame a central challenge in structural biology that has confounded scientists for decades: predicting the folding labyrinthine structure of proteins. This accomplishment is so significant that its designers, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, colleagues of one of us, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for their work.

The question is not whether AI can do things that experts cannot do on their own—it can. Yet expert humans often bring something that today's AI models cannot: situational context, tacit knowledge, ethical intuition, emotional intelligence, and the ability to weigh consequences that fall outside the data. Putting the two together typically amplifies human expertise: Oncologists can ask a model to flag every recorded case of a rare mutation and then apply clinical judgment to design a bespoke treatment; a software architect can have the model retrieve dozens of edge-case vulnerabilities and then decide which security patch best fits the company's needs. The value is not in substituting one expert for another, or in outsourcing fully to the machine, or indeed in presuming the human expertise will always be superior, but in leveraging human and rapidly-evolving machine capabilities to achieve best results.

As AI's facility in expert judgment becomes more reliable, capable, and accessible in the years ahead, it will emerge as a near-ubiquitous presence in our lives. Using it well will require knowing when to automate versus when to collaborate. This is not necessarily a binary choice, and the boundaries between human expertise and AI's capabilities for expert judgment will continually evolve as AI's capabilities advance. AI already collaborates with human drivers today, provides autonomous taxi services in some cities, and may eventually relieve us of the burden and risk of driving altogether—so that the driver's license can go the way of the manual transmission. Although collaboration is not intrinsically better than automation, premature or excess automation—that is, automation that takes on entire jobs when it's ready for only a subset of job tasks—is generally worse than collaboration.

The temptation toward excess automation has always been with us. In 1984, General Motors opened its “factory of the future” in Saginaw, Michigan. President Ronald Reagan delivered the dedication speech. The vision, as MIT's Ben Armstrong and Julie Shaw wrote in Harvard Business Review in 2023, was that robots would be “so effective that people would be scarce—it wouldn't even be necessary to turn on the lights.” But things did not go as planned. The robots “struggled to distinguish one car model from another: They tried to affix Buick bumpers to Cadillacs, and vice versa,” Armstrong and Shaw wrote. “The robots were bad painters, too; they spray-painted one another rather than the cars coming down the line. GM shut the Saginaw plant in 1992.”

There has been much progress in robotics since this time, but the advent of AI invites automation hubris to an unprecedented degree. Starting from the premise that AI has already attained superhuman capabilities, it is tempting to think that it must be able to do everything that experts do, minus the experts. Many people have therefore adopted an automation mindset, in their desire either to evangelize AI or to warn against it. To them, the future goes like this: AI replicates expert capabilities, overtakes the experts, and finally replaces them altogether. Rather than performing valuable tasks expertly, AI makes experts irrelevant.

Research on people's use of AI makes the downsides of this automation mindset ever more apparent. For example, while experts use chatbots as collaboration tools—riffing on ideas, clarifying intuitions—novices often treat them mistakenly as automation tools, oracles that speak from a bottomless well of knowledge. That becomes a problem when an AI chatbot confidently provides information that is misleading, speculative, or simply false. Because current AIs don't understand what they don't understand, those lacking the expertise to identify flawed reasoning and outright errors may be led astray.

The seduction of cognitive automation helps explain a worrying pattern: AI tools can boost the productivity of experts but may also actively mislead novices in expertise-heavy fields such as legal services. Novices struggle to spot inaccuracies and lack efficient methods for validating AI outputs. And methodically fact-checking every AI suggestion can negate any time savings.

Beyond the risk of errors, there is some early evidence that overreliance on AI can impede the development of critical thinking, or inhibit learning. Studies suggest a negative correlation between frequent AI use and critical-thinking skills, likely due to increased “cognitive offloading”—letting the AI do the thinking. In high-stakes environments, this tendency toward overreliance is particularly dangerous: Users may accept incorrect AI suggestions, especially if delivered with apparent confidence.

The rise of highly capable assistive AI tools also risks disrupting traditional pathways for expertise development when it's still clearly needed now, and will be in the foreseeable future. When AI systems can perform tasks previously assigned to research assistants, surgical residents, and pilots, the opportunities for apprenticeship and learning-by-doing disappear. This threatens the future talent pipeline, as most occupations rely on experiential learning—like those radiology residents discussed above.

Early field evidence hints at the value of getting this right. In a PNAS study published earlier this year and covering 2,133 “mystery” medical cases, researchers ran three head-to-head trials: doctors diagnosing on their own, five leading AI models diagnosing on their own, and then doctors reviewing the AI suggestions before giving a final answer. That human-plus-AI pair proved most accurate, correct on roughly 85 percent more cases than physicians working solo and 15 to 20 percent more than an AI alone. The gain came from complementary strengths: When the model missed a clue, the clinician usually spotted it, and when the clinician slipped, the model filled the gap. The researchers engineered human-AI complementarity into the design of the trials, and saw results. As these tools evolve, we believe they will surely take on autonomous diagnostic tasks, such as triaging patients and ordering further testing—and may indeed do better over time on their own, as some early studies suggest.

Or, consider an example with which one of us is closely familiar: Google's Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) is an AI system built to assist physicians. AMIE conducts multi-turn chats that mirror a real primary-care visit: It asks follow-up questions when it is unsure, explains its reasoning, and adjusts its line of inquiry as new information emerges. In a blinded study recently published in Nature, specialist physicians compared the performance of a primary-care doctor working alone with that of a doctor who collaborated with AMIE. The doctor who used AMIE ranked higher on 30 of 32 clinical-communication and diagnostic axes, including empathy and clarity of explanations.

By exposing its reasoning, highlighting uncertainty, and grounding advice in trusted sources, AMIE pulls the user into an active problem-solving loop instead of handing down answers from on high. Doctors can potentially interrogate and correct it in real time, reinforcing (rather than eroding) their own diagnostic skills. These results are preliminary: AMIE is still a research prototype and not a drop-in replacement. But its design principles suggest a path toward meaningful human collaboration with AI.

Full automation is much harder than collaboration. To be useful, an automation tool must deliver near flawless performance almost all of the time. You wouldn't tolerate an automatic transmission that sporadically failed to shift gears, an elevator that regularly got stuck between floors, or an electronic tollbooth that occasionally overcharged you by $10,000.

By contrast, a collaboration tool doesn't need to be anywhere close to infallible to be useful. A doctor with a stethoscope can better understand a patient than the same doctor without one; a contractor can pitch a squarer house frame with a laser level than by line of sight. These tools don't need to work flawlessly, because they don't promise to replace the expertise of their user. They make experts better at what they do—and extend their expertise to places it couldn't go unassisted.

Designing for collaboration means designing for complementarity. AI's comparative advantages (near limitless learning capacity, rapid inference, round-the-clock availability) should slot into the gaps where human experts tend to struggle: remembering every precedent, canvassing every edge case, or drawing connections across disciplines. And at the same time, interface design must leave space for distinctly human strengths: contextual nuance, moral reasoning, creativity, and a broad grasp of how accomplishing specific tasks achieves broader goals.

Both AI skeptics and AI evangelists agree that AI will prove a transformative technology–-indeed, this transformation is already under way. The right question then is not whether but how we should use AI. Should we go all in on automation? Should we build collaborative AI that learns from our choices, informs our decisions, and partners with us to drive better results? The correct answer, of course, is both. Getting this balance right across capabilities is a formidable and ever-evolving challenge. Fortunately, the principles and techniques for using AI collaboratively are now emerging. We have a canyon to cross. We should choose our routes wisely.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿Should you beware of “performative males”?

If you live in a major city, you might have seen what looks like a hipster drag show playing out in a park or on a sidewalk recently: a parade of young men strutting with tote bags, holding up feminist literature, and showing off their newly purchased vinyls.

That guess wouldn't be totally wrong. Over the past month, Gen Z has been holding public contests all over the country, and even internationally, awarding the best impressions of a “performative male,” the latest meme taking off on TikTok.

The slang is a bit misleading. A “performative male” doesn't perform traditional masculinity à la a “gym bro.” Rather, he's curated a notably alt, intellectual, and, in Gen Z terms, “soft” aesthetic, often with the purpose of attracting progressive women. Other markers of a “performative male” include drinking matcha, reading bell hooks, listening to women singer-songwriters, and carrying emergency tampons. Think Jacob Elordi when he was photographed with three different books on his person, or Paul Mescal publicly admiring Mitski.

The trend seems to be largely in good fun, poking fun at men who do, in fact, genuinely like matcha and Mitski. It's partially inspired by the slew of celebrity lookalike contests last year that highlighted people's enjoyment of dressing up in silly costumes, as well as their desire for a public square. As Seattle's “performative male” contest winner, Malik Marcus Jernigan, told me, most of the men participating, including himself, casually embody the joke.

“My friend had sent me the flyer saying I had a good chance at winning, so I decided to participate to make them proud,” says Jernigan, a 24-year-old musician. “I feel as if for the most part it is either ‘performative males' poking fun at themselves or women poking fun at them online — all lighthearted in nature.”

But there's also a darker interpretation: Maybe these men are not what they seem, and perhaps their tastes and behaviors are all a deception. The “performative male” has joined a group of suspicious masculine archetypes that came before it, like the two-faced “wife guy” and toxic “male manipulator.”

So how did these signifiers of a “performative male” come to fall under suspicion? Should you really be worried about dating a man who listens to Clairo? Is it so bad to be “performative,” when gender is inherently a performance?

From “hipsters” to “soft boys” to its more derogatory offshoot, “cuckboi,” the internet has long questioned the integrity of this genre of men who eschew traditional representations of masculinity, either through their personal style or consumption habits.

In the age of TikTok, the average person, even one who doesn't live in Bushwick, has become a lot more familiar with men who embrace a sense of freedom around gender. According to Jordan Foster, assistant professor of sociology at MacEwan University, the app has given average men a “historically novel public visibility, making a significant difference to their public presentation and also their ability to play with their gender presentation.”

Still, this exposure to and wider acceptance of this genre of men hasn't exactly made us less confused about them. On the one hand, they're often assumed to be emotionally intelligent and “unproblematic,” politically progressive if not outrightly feminist. But is it really all an act?

It seems like the internet is caught in a perpetual cycle of glorifying and later questioning the integrity of these men whenever they gain publicity. Pop singer Harry Styles, for example, was once lauded for dancing with men in his music videos and wearing feminine articles of clothing. For a time, though, he also faced charges of “queer-baiting,” a term to describe the appropriation of queer aesthetics by straight, cis men for their own personal and professional advantage.

Foster finds that skepticism around men who don these aesthetics is partly a conversation around privilege. “The critique is that men are reaping the sort of social and symbolic set of rewards for participating in these feminized and sometimes queer aesthetics without bearing any of the costs that have typically circled around queer and marginalized men or women,” Foster says.

In his study on “radical” masculinities on TikTok, Foster found that the men who feel comfortable wearing dresses or drinking matchas are often men who already possess “masculine capital” — i.e., they're cisgender, white, conventionally attractive, middle or upper class — allowing them to dabble in these aesthetics more securely. He adds that these “softboy” signifiers often have the reverse effect of “focalizing their conventional attractiveness.” Take, for example, Styles wearing a pink fringe vest that displays his six-pack abs, or actor Jeremy Allen White wearing tiny shorts that show off his muscular quads.

It isn't just that these signifiers seem strategic or shallow, but rather, they can read as misleading. The MeToo movement showed us that even supposed “nice guys” could be capable of alleged manipulation and abuse — that in fact, they could use their enlightenment as a kind of shield. Now, the kind of guy who goes to therapy while also treating his partner badly has become flattened into a starter-pack-style meme. And the faux-enlightened man has become a frequent observation in pop culture.

In what could be read as an effort to rehabilitate his image following allegations of domestic abuse from his ex-wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has taken on a more gender-fluid approach to fashion. Before actor Jonathan Majors received two misdemeanor charges in a domestic-violence case last year, he did a viral magazine shoot wearing all pink and discussed how his idea of masculinity involved “kindness” and “gentleness.” These were major celebrities with PR teams. Could their gender flexibility have been an attempt to ward off bad press? It's impossible to say, but what observers have seen does color the discourse.

Still, it's also important to recognize the extent to which these immediate judgments can impede young people's social lives. Playboy editor Magdalene J. Taylor, who also writes the sex and dating newsletter Many Such Cases, says that the “performative male” trend is “aligned with much of the hostility we're seeing in dating writ large: we don't trust that anyone's intentions are good.”

This hostility is visible in the level of suspicion, surveillance, and arbitrary rules that factor into dating right now. From the amount of hyperspecific and downright nonsensical dating requirements that are discussed on TikTok to whisper-network apps that mainly encourage gossip rather than safety, it seems like many people have lost sight of what a healthy level of discernment in dating looks like.

Taylor says, out of all the legitimate warning signs that men can display, someone's style of dress or tastes in books is perhaps not the thing to focus on. And doing your best to attract a potential partner isn't inherently deceptive.

“While lying and obfuscating your identity for sexual ends is, of course, wrong and potentially even assault, reading a book you believe women will find appealing is not a lie,” she says. “It's an entirely normal, well-established social practice of attempting to relate to the opposite sex.”

Overall, though, Taylor says that the level of humor men and women are injecting into the “performative male” trend may suggest that people are slowly pushing away from the idea that a man's appearance and interests, especially regarding things that are woman-coded, require further inspection. A lot of dudes might just wear and consume a lot of the same basic stuff right now, and if it just so happens that progressive women love it, so be it.

“It's not a counterattack to ‘wokeness' per se, but a realization that some of the rhetoric of ‘wokeness' around heterosexual dating relations imposed new restrictions that did not actually liberate us,” Taylor says. “We're circling back to a place where it's okay to admit that you are a person with desires, and that you might act accordingly.”

A wild idea would treat carbon waste like cash. It could save the climate.

This story was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

The US government is a big-time hoarder. At last count, in three locations — Denver, Fort Knox, and West Point— it had socked away 248,046,115.696 troy ounces of gold. One might think to round that to the nearest ounce, but at today's prices, that extra 0.304 ounces of gold would fetch about $1,060, and the entire hoard is worth more than $865 billion. Except it isn't, because this gold is not for sale.

Sequestration has rendered it priceless.

Why do we keep it? Good question. President Richard Nixon ended the Gold Standard more than a half-century ago — that is, the practice of using gold reserves to backstop the dollar. For 54 years now, the value of our currency has been based on faith — that the United States, like the Lannisters, always pays its debts. There's not much practical sense in keeping all this treasure around, though. It's a symbolic, quasi-religious thing. “I think it's because gold has been an index of power for thousands of years,” says Gustav Peebles, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Stockholm in Sweden. “I think of it as a sacred hoard.”

Peebles, who is American, has been thinking about this a lot. Because, if people can unearth vast amounts of a “profane” commodity such as gold, build an economy around it, and then take most of that gold out of circulation and into the realm of the sacred, why couldn't we do the same thing with other profane commodities — like excess atmospheric carbon? Why couldn't we collect it, bank it, and then stow it away, harmless?

We've tried other tactics. The world's wealthiest 10 percent are responsible for two-thirds of global carbon emissions, but the comfort class hasn't shown much willingness to change its behavior. Nor have governments done enough — the Trump administration is now taking us backward — and industrial polluters aren't about to do the right thing. Tech solutions like direct air capture are pricey and problematic, as this magazine has reported. But if we could convince the masses that waste carbon dioxide is sacred and worth hoarding — like gold — one of our most existential problems might solve itself.

Please don't scoff. We all have questions. But Peebles is serious. An expert in the history of monetary systems, among other things, he has teamed up with the multidisciplinary artist Ben Luzzatto to develop the idea in depth. The result is a thought-provoking new book, The First and Last Bank, which weaves in aspects of history, monetary policy, philosophy, and religion to make its case. A utopian case perhaps, but Peebles insists that the necessary structures and precedents already exist.

Peebles was visiting his friend in the Adirondacks, where Luzzatto was working on conceptual projects related to environmental sustainability, when a lightbulb flicked on. “Sitting around the campfire at night, we sort of had this a-ha experience about the gold standard and how it can serve as a beta test,” he recalls. “The history of banks is intertwined with the history of temples, and they both have a long history of making things priceless — taking a cherished good off the market. And that's just hasn't been interesting to economists for some reason.”

But wait, banking carbon — what would that look like in practice?

Consider all the cellulosic carbon waste — corn stalks and such — that farmers clear from their fields in large quantities after every harvest. And all the tree and plant waste generated by arborists, homeowners, landscapers, municipalities, and forestry operations. Put these carbon-rich materials into a big machine called a pyrolizer and heat it in the absence of oxygen, and you end up with a stable, solid form of carbon known as biochar.

Biochar is already a commodity with myriad uses — as a yield-improving soil amendment for farms and garden, as a building insulator, as an absorptive agent for water filtration and wastewater treatment. It can also be stored in rural warehouses or simply buried, locking away waste carbon for hundreds of years depending on its composition and surroundings — which is why it plays a growing role in today's market for carbon offsets.

Peebles and Luzzatto have grander aspirations. Their idea is not one-size-fits-all but, very broadly, they envision small communities — churches, towns, colleges, etc. — creating their own cooperative carbon banks to accept organic waste from depositors (locals and businesses). The bank would pyrolize and quantify these deposits on site. “It would be like the gold assayers of old. The assaying would happen at the bank. Instead of risk managers at Wall Street banks, we would need a soil scientist,” Peebles explains.

The depositors, in exchange, would receive digital currency they could trade for goods and services within that community — something akin to a cryptocurrency, but grounded in a commodity with real-world value. Companies looking to boost their environmental bona fides would open their own accounts at the bank, whose verification process would be transparent and verifiable — unlike many of the fraudulent schemes in today's carbon-credit markets. “And then people would want to buy their products to support a transition to a post-carbon economy,” Peebles says.

Community members with no organic waste to deposit could buy into these local currency systems by opening accounts and depositing dollars, thereby supporting the sequestration mission, and getting fungible digital tokens in return.

In the authors' optimistic vision, a grassroots movement would emerge organically from at first a handful — then tens, hundreds, and thousands — of these community efforts. That's the beauty of it. Donald Trump and his toadies could bitch and moan and it wouldn't matter, because the approach doesn't require the buy-in of politicians or big firms or slow-moving government bodies.

“It's a little-known fact that colleges and banks used to issue their own currencies — it was very common in America in the 19th century, so we think the movement could start at a college,” Peebles told me. “It could be part of a curriculum with a bunch of 20-somethings who want to think about what it would look like to run a carbon bank, and the college could backstop it with dollars so the local merchants were interested in joining the community of exchange.”

The 49ers' quest to dig up gold was, of course, motivated by greed. One might then argue that waste carbon won't ever be valuable enough for people to want to bother collecting it. But consider that Bitcoin was all but worthless in its early days. It was nurtured by a community of people who were inspired by utopian ideas to “mine” it. Famously, in the first real-world Bitcoin transaction, in May 2010, a Florida software developer named Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 coins for a couple of Papa John's pizzas. Those Bitcoins, then valued at about $41, would fetch nearly $1.2 billion today. Hope he got extra pepperoni at least.

In any case, the carbon banking idea pairs a collective feel-good element with modest financial benefits. Homeowners and small commercial entities typically pay to dispose of yard waste via local taxes or fees. In this scheme, they get something of value back — both monetary and spiritual, perhaps. Again, some participants would contribute cash to bolster the effort. “If we bring our collective buying power together and we say that we want to pay a higher price than what the carbon waste is worth, that will create a centrifugal movement of carbon waste into our banks,” Peebles says.

“We do think people might be hungry for a meaningful way of doing their part for the climate battle.”

This, too, mirrors the Gold Rush. Regional banks were the monopoly purchasers, and you'd naturally bring your gold to the one that offered the best price. But there's a balance to be struck here; relative to gold, carbon waste is abundant and not terribly sexy. You'd want biochar to fetch a high enough price to incentivize people to participate — and perhaps seed fields of fast-growing crops, hemp and such, to sequester more carbon. But you also don't want to encourage people to raze forests or steal their neighbor's shrubberies for cash.

Checking people's deposits for legitimacy is part of the assayer's role, Peebles says. “There are ways of spotting, you know, is it fresh wood that was alive yesterday?” What's more, local forestland, properly managed, could become part of a given bank's carbon reserves. “We only propose biochar as a transitionary tactic because it mimics the gold standard,” he says. But ultimately the banks will incorporate other ways to sequester carbon — say, untapped oil and gas that a landowner opts to leave in the ground.

The authors don't foresee a mad Carbon Rush, “but we do think people might be hungry for a meaningful way of doing their part for the climate battle. And I think that having a collective institution will give them that,” Peebles says. “In the book, we talk about the nature of volunteer labor in temples. And temples always have, you know, remunerated workers and volunteer workers. Both are necessary, and we think this is more like that — instead of a gold rush.”

He has two thoughts on the abundance problem. First, “it's actually not that easy to make good biochar,” Peebles says. It requires time and effort to get it right, “so that's not as abundant as carbon itself.” What's more, the gold standard was abandoned in part because people were hoarding gold: “It became too scarce, and so it couldn't expand with the economy.” Central banks, too, know how to deal with overabundance problems via the monetary technique of “sterilization.” In 1936 and 1937, for example, as excess foreign gold flowed into US banks, the Federal Reserve, fearing inflation, ordered banks to beef up the reserves they kept on hand and issued bonds to sop up the excess money in circulation.

In fact, when the authors finished their manuscript, they asked a macroeconomist to read it and offer critiques. He thought the carbon banks were a great idea and he asked, according to Peebles, “Why wouldn't we just ask the Fed to do it?”

Well, because the clock is ticking. “Forty years ago, maybe we would have asked, but we're not going to wait around for them to move,” Peebles says. “We think building a grassroots banking system would be the one thing that might make the Fed wake up and say, ‘Huh, okay, now we have a threat.' These carbon banks are a threat to our system because they're growing.”

Indeed, the desire of governments to regulate the gold reserves of private banks was one of the primary triggers that built the central banking system that exists today. “We have the tools to build this locally, and I would love for the Fed to do this, but I don't think they're going to do it until we build it ourselves,” Peebles says.

Yet it still sounds so far-fetched, doesn't it — in this era of rampant disinformation and unchecked greed, with a federal government openly hostile to protecting the environment and safeguarding the health of its land and people — that a utopian economic movement could spring up and alter our collision course with the laws of nature?

Then again, every social movement begin as a longshot. Peebles cites the rise of Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries and the growth of central banks during the 19th century. We had the US civil rights movement, of course. And the creation of the Euro: “It's been a disaster in many ways, right?” Peebles says. “It's gone through multiple crises, but the Euro is still around because a certain group of people is committed to it. And that was started by a small group of acolytes who were enthusiastic about a vision and pushed it forward.”

“We don't need everyone to be excited about this right off the bat,” he says. “We can start small, and if it works, then it can spread from there.”

Beachfront neighborhoods in the Hamptons. An exclusive island off the coast of Miami. Palm tree-dotted communities with views of the Pacific Ocean.

These are some of the places we think of as the most affluent in the country, but how you define and measure that affluence matters. Some of the most thriving neighborhoods in the country are in places you might not expect.

To better understand how prosperity is distributed throughout the country, Business Insider examined four sets of income and housing data and a recent Economic Innovation Group study based on additional metrics.

For some, the right measure of affluence is relatively straightforward — how much the typical resident earns. To determine which areas top the list of highest incomes, Business Insider analyzed Census Bureau data on mean household incomes across all zip codes in the US that have at least 100 households.

Leading that list was the Miami Beach-Fisher Island area, an exclusive, ultrawealthy enclave in the Sunshine State. The mean household income there was just under $800,000 as of 2023. Other high-earning zip codes include various locales in downtown New York City and some of the tony suburbs surrounding it in the tri-state area. But ultra-wealthy enclaves in less expected locations like Kelly, Wyoming and Glenview, Kentucky, also topped the list.

But that doesn't mean wealth is evenly distributed in those high-earning spots. Another measure of affluence is how widespread higher earners are across a ZIP code. Looking at the areas with the highest share of total households earning $200,000 or more shows a slightly different mix. Six locales — Short Hills, NJ; Purchase, NY; Villanova, PA; Paeonian Springs, VA; Glenview, KY; and Kenilworth, IL — rank in the top 20 for both mean household income and the share of households earning $200,000 or more.

Many Americans' wealth is largely tied up in their homes, so looking at the value of real estate gives another insight into where the affluent live.

Once again, the high-earning Miami Beach-Fisher Island tops the list of most expensive listings compiled by Realtor.com. Los Altos Hills in California makes the list for both the share of its homes that are worth $1 million or more and having the priciest listings; meanwhile, the many residents earning $200,000 or more in New York City's Tribeca might need to make even more money to afford a new home.

The New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami metro areas have long topped the list for priciest real estate, Realtor.com senior economist Anthony Smith told Business Insider. And many of their most coveted zip codes have something in common: proximity to water. Another similarity is that many of these communities severely restrict the number of new homes they can add, including through land-use regulations like large-lot zoning or high common fees.

""That exclusivity and that limited construction is definitely going to be one of the big factors that really bumps up those prices,"" Smith said.

Looking at the share of owner-occupied homes worth $1,000,000 or more shows some wealth bifurcation: A handful of ZIP codes are in both the top 20 for mean household income and share of homes worth $1 million or more. However, there's no crossover with the areas with the most households earning $200,000 or more.

Researchers at the Economic Innovation Group took a more holistic look at affluence and determined an area's prosperity with seven data points covering education, job market strength, poverty, and housing.

Utah, Colorado, and Montana lead the country with the highest share of their populations living in prosperous zip codes, or those that scored in the top 20% of their seven metrics, according to the new report. The states have seen significant job growth and have attracted legions of mobile, high-earning workers in recent years.

Growth in cities like Denver and Salt Lake City ""has been much slower and steadier, and they're not really saddled with the legacies of segregation, of de-industrialization, of urban poverty that afflicts most cities east of the Mississippi River,"" Kenan Fikri, a senior fellow at EIG, told Business Insider.

EIG found that in recent years, prosperity has moved westward and southward. While the South is still home to the most distressed counties in the country, pockets of prosperity are growing in major metro areas like Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, and Nashville, Fikri said. And despite coastal metro areas dominating lists of most expensive real estate and highest incomes, there are pockets of economic growth and well-being across the country.

""Prosperous communities are much more evenly spread across the map than distressed communities are, and in every state, you can find a good number of ZIP codes that land in the top tier of American economic well-being,"" Fikri said, ""which, in a country as big and diverse as ours, is no mean feat.""

Vietnam plans to evacuate more than half a million people and has ordered boats to stay ashore, while the southern Chinese city of Sanya closed businesses and public transport on Sunday as the two countries braced for an intensifying Typhoon Kajiki.

The storm could make landfall along the southern coast of China's southern island province of Hainan from Sunday afternoon to evening, or skirt the southern coastline before heading toward Vietnam, China's National Meteorological Center said. 

The storm, packing winds of up to 149 kph (93 mph), was about 500 km (300 miles) off Vietnam's central coast at 0600 GMT, moving west at 20 kph, according to Vietnam's national weather forecast agency. 

It is likely to strengthen with wind speeds as high as 170 kph (110 mph), China's weather forecaster said.

Authorities in Vietnam plan to evacuate more than 586,000 people from the central provinces of Thanh Hoa, Quang Tri, Hue and Danang, where the typhoon is forecast to make landfall early on Monday, state media reported. 

Seven coastal provinces in the Southeast Asian nation banned boats from leaving shore early on Sunday, Tien Phong newspaper reported.

Flag carrier Vietnam Airlines cancelled at least 22 flights to and from central cities on Sunday and Monday. Vietjet Aviation said it was cancelling or delaying flights but did not provide details.

China's Sanya, renowned for seafront resorts and sandy beaches, closed tourist attractions, shuttered businesses and suspended public transport.

China's weather agency forecast heavy rainfall and strong winds in Hainan and nearby Guangdong province and Guangxi region, with areas in Hainan set to receive as much as 400 mm (1.7 inches) of precipitation.

Sanya issued a red typhoon alert on Sunday morning - the highest in China's colour-coded warning system - and raised its emergency response to the most severe level, according to posts on the local government's WeChat account.

City officials convened a meeting on Saturday evening, urging preparation for ""worst-case scenarios"" and stressing the need for heightened vigilance to ensure no fatalities and minimal injuries, the government said.

All classes and construction are suspended, and shopping centres, restaurants and supermarkets are closed from Sunday. Vessels have been ordered to cease operating in Sanya's waters. 

Officials said the lifting of restrictions would depend on the storm's impact.

Sanya is one of China's most popular holiday destinations, attracting 34 million tourist visits last year, state news agency Xinhua reported.

Since July, record rainfall has lashed China north and south in what meteorologists describe as extreme weather events linked to climate change, testing local government readiness and posing significant risk to lives and the economy.

Natural disasters including flooding and drought caused 52.15 billion yuan ($7.28 billion) in direct economic losses in China last month, affecting millions of people and leaving 295 dead or missing, data from the Ministry of Emergency Management showed.

The Vietnamese government likened the strength of Kajiki to that of Yagi, which battered the country less than a year ago, killing about 300 people and causing property damage of $3.3 billion.

Spotify will raise prices as it invests in new features and targets 1 billion users, the Financial Times reported on Sunday citing the music streaming provider's Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norstrom.

The increases would be accompanied by planned new services and features, the FT cited Norstrom as saying in an interview.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier in August, the Swedish firm said it would increase the monthly price of its premium individual subscription in some markets from September, as it looks to improve profit margins.

It said the price will rise to 11.99 euros ($14.05) from 10.99 euros in markets including South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.

""Price increases and price adjustments and so on, that's part of our business toolbox and we'll do it when it makes sense,"" Norstrom told the newspaper.

Price increases combined with cost-cutting efforts in recent years helped Spotify achieve its first annual profit last year.

Eli Lilly's stock is still recovering after the drugmaker released trial data earlier this month on its closely watched obesity pill that underwhelmed Wall Street.

In a key late-stage trial, Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, caused less weight loss and had higher side effects than what analysts were expecting. The pill's efficacy also appeared to come in slightly below that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide for obesity, which showed strong data in a separate study.

Shares of Eli Lilly fell about 13% on the day the trial results were released, although they're up about 12% since then.

But some analysts say Eli Lilly's daily pill, if approved, could still be a viable competitor in the weight loss drug space — even if it will likely be second to enter the market. It's a highly lucrative area that is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it.

Analysts note that Eli Lilly's pill could have a few advantages over the daily oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug semaglutide, which is on track to become the first needle-free alternative for obesity to win approval in the U.S. later this year. Eli Lilly hopes to launch its pill globally ""this time next year,"" CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.

Both drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. But while Novo Nordisk's pill is a peptide medication, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug.

That means Eli Lilly's pill is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's does. Orforglipron will also be easier to manufacture at scale, which is crucial as demand for obesity and diabetes injections outpaces supply.

Neither company has released prices for its respective pill, but some analysts said Eli Lilly's drug could potentially have a lower price than Novo Nordisk's pill. That would be a notable edge, as many health plans in the U.S. still don't cover obesity treatments.

""It's a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison because Novo Nordisk could have difficulty manufacturing enough of the product, given the high cost and requirements to manufacture oral semaglutide,"" Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in an interview. 

""Whereas Lilly plans to blanket the world with orforglipron, and very quickly it will generate dramatically more sales,"" he continued. ""It can launch globally in an extraordinary manner with lower prices and with no food intake consideration.""

Goldman Sachs analysts seem to agree, based on a note in August. They forecast daily oral pills will capture 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion. 

The Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The remaining 19% slice will go to other emerging pills, the analysts said.

The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also exploring other experimental oral drugs, along with a slate of other companies such as Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics, AstraZeneca and Roche. 

In a statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustar said ""we strongly believe in the efficacy"" of the oral drug. The Danish company added it will be ""laser-focused on getting this product to patients without supply constraints"" in the U.S. 

Dr. Mihail ""Misha"" Zilbermint, director of endocrine hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said it's hard to crown a winner between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without knowing how their respective pills will be priced and whether insurance will cover them. 

""I think both of the drugs are going to be gamechangers,"" he said. ""When it comes to which company is going to win the game — cost is the biggest issue.""

It's difficult to directly compare the results of separate clinical trials, especially as investors wait for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to release the full data from their phase three studies.

Eli Lilly's ATTAIN-1 trial also followed 3,000 patients, while Novo Nordisk's OASIS 4 study evaluated a much smaller group of roughly 300. There are currently no studies directly comparing the two drugs, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said.

But Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide appears to cause a greater level of weight loss than Eli Lilly's pill based on the available data, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman. 

In the trial, the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. The pill's weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.

Wall Street had hoped Eli Lilly's pill would generate weight loss of around 15%, the same level as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart Ozempic. 

Meanwhile, the 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug. 

A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added that 20% of weight loss was observed in nearly one-third of patients in the trial.

Still, the slightly lower efficacy of Eli Lilly's pill may not be significant enough to deter patients from taking it. 

""For many patients, 12% is a really great number,"" said Seigerman. ""There's definitely a market there"" for orforglipron.

In a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts shared a similar sentiment. 

""Yes, weight loss fell a bit short, but ask 100 prescribers whether this new data will really make a difference in who they'd put on orforglipron, and our belief is the vast majority would say, 'not really,'"" they wrote, referring to Eli Lilly's trial data. 

Some investors raised concerns about the side effects and discontinuation rates in the trial of Eli Lilly's pill. But Seigerman said the drug's tolerability data — how well patients tolerate it — appears to be relatively in line with that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. 

About 10.3% of patients who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill — 36 milligrams — discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% of those who took a placebo.

Those side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 24% of those who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill reported vomiting, while 33.7% had nausea. 

Leerink's Risinger said he is watching to see how persistent those gastrointestinal issues are once Eli Lilly presents the full data. 

The side effects in the trial on Novo Nordisk's pill were mostly gastrointestinal-related: 30.9% of those who took oral semaglutide reported vomiting and 46.6% reported nausea, according to the trial results. 

Johns Hopkins' Zilbermint said it's difficult for him to decide which one has a better safety and tolerability profile based on the available data. 

Meanwhile, Seigerman pointed to a different factor ""that will also matter a lot"": dietary requirements. 

Unlike Eli Lilly's pill, patients need to take Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water. They're instructed to wait 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicines.

Seigerman said that could be a hurdle for some patients. 

For example, ""if you're a parent with kids and you have to take this drug and wait half an hour before you can drink your coffee, you're going to drive yourself crazy, especially if you have to take this every day,"" he said. ""I try to think about the real-world use of these drugs in a market like this. It's going to matter."" 

Leerink's Risinger said oral semaglutide will also be ""extremely expensive to manufacture"" since it is a peptide medication, and ""is likely going to have to be priced higher than orforlipgron.""

A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the pill will be made mostly in the U.S., and the company is excited about the potential the pill ""provides millions of Americans living with obesity.""

""Currently, all typical launch readiness activities [for the pill] are fully underway and building momentum,"" the spokesperson said. They added that over the past decade, the company has invested $24 billion in the U.S. to expand manufacturing capacity and fuel research and development. That includes investments aimed at increasing manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and capacity for the final stages of production for both current and future injectable and oral products. 

Small molecules are chemically simpler and easier to produce at scale, making them generally cheaper for companies to formulate. But it is still unclear how Eli Lilly will price orforglipron. 

During an earnings call in August, Eli Lilly's Ricks said the pricing will be based on the value orforglipron brings, considering health-care savings and the comorbidities it can address.

In the note earlier this month, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect the pill to be ""priced at parity"" to Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, the active ingredient in the company's obesity injection Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro, which list for just over $1,000 for a month's supply. 

""They should be cheaper than injections because they are easier to produce. But it does not mean they will be cheaper,"" Johns Hopkins' Zilbermint said. ""We just don't know — for example, we don't know how much went into research and development.""

Seigerman said commercialization strategies will also be key when the pills compete on the market. 

He questioned whether Novo Nordisk will lean into the deal it recently struck with CVS's pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. Under the deal, Caremark started to prioritize Novo Nordisk's Wegovy on its standard formularies on July 1, making that weekly injection the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity over Zepbound. 

But it is unclear whether oral semaglutide could receive a similar preferential status.

Seigerman also questioned whether Eli Lilly will offer orforglipron through its direct-to-consumer pharmacy, LillyDirect. That offering bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, allowing patients to directly purchase Zepbound and some of Eli Lilly's other drugs from the company. 

Seigerman said he expects ""a lot of nuances in the go-to-market campaign for these drugs,"" adding ""that's going to matter.""

Other obesity pills are in earlier stages of development, making it difficult to directly compare them to the drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without longer and larger trials. 

But so far, some experts think they pale in comparison.

For example, Viking Therapeutics on Tuesday released mid-stage trial data that disappointed investors, sending its stock down as much as 40%. 

Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the results on Viking's drug ""look inferior"" to those of Eli Lilly's pill ""on almost all metrics."" 

Viking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months, with no plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study.

Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks.

That's ""a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head,"" Holz said.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov threw cold water on the possibility of an imminent meeting taking place between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that no meeting is currently planned.

""Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy, when the agenda would be ready for a summit,"" Lavrov said during an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that aired Sunday.

""And this agenda is not ready at all,"" he continued.

Lavrov's comments come after President Donald Trump suggested earlier this month that the leaders of the two countries had agreed to meet, which would mark a breakthrough in the ongoing war.

""I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social on Aug. 18, after he met separately with the two leaders.

Trump met in Alaska with Putin, and then subsequently hosted Zelenskyy at the White House, alongside several European leaders.

But in the days since Trump's meetings with the two leaders, Russia has continued to launch missile strikes on Ukraine, including one that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company.

The continued attacks — and Lavrov's comments — have raised questions about Trump's ability to broker a peace deal between the two countries.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Lavrov's remarks.

Vice President JD Vance in a separate interview on NBC News, however, expressed optimism that ""energetic diplomacy"" will ""bring this war to a close.""

""We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall,"" Vance told NBC News' ""Meet the Press.""

""And if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,"" he said.

In this day and age, receiving a cold call at any time can be disarming, but Norway's finance minister reportedly took a most surprising ring on the streets of Oslo earlier this month.

According to Norwegian newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv, the cold caller was U.S. President Donald Trump, and the request for Norway's Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, was how the American leader could be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Trump has been publicly explicit about his desire to be awarded the prize, which some say is a driving factor behind his efforts to broker a peace deal for Ukraine and Russia, as well as his focus on Israel and Gaza.

But in June he took to Truth Social to complain: ""No, I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that's all that matters to me!""

This week, it will be Trump's impact on the economy that will be in focus, as the group of Nobel Laureates that he seemingly hopes to join will meet for their annual event in Lindau, Germany. 

It could make for uncomfortable listening for the White House, with one of the most famous Nobel prize-winning economists, Joseph Stiglitz telling The Guardian that ""the U.S. has become, I would say, a scary place to invest."" The administration's tariff policy risks triggering stagflation in a move that is making the Federal Reserve ""clearly worried,"" Stiglitz said earlier this year.

Nobel Laureate Roger Myerson, who is also attending the event in Lindau, is more concerned by American politics, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that ""when large groups of voters have become convinced that only one party really cares about them, then they may feel no stake in democracy itself… and support their leader in shaking off its inconvenient constitutional restraints.""

Meanwhile, Nobel Laureate Simon Johnson has also voiced his concerns about American isolationism, telling the Nobel Prize Conversations podcast that it is ""…destroying human capital and handing a massive advantage to geopolitical competitors. It's a self-defeating foolish action by the Trump administration.""

It's a tough crowd for President Trump. He does have one unlikely supporter in his bid for the peace prize though. Former Democratic rival and First Lady Hillary Clinton recently said if he could end the war between Ukraine and Russia ""without putting Ukraine in a position where it must concede its territory to the aggressor… I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.""

CNBC will speak live to Nobel Laureates from the meeting in Lindau on Wednesday and Thursday, tune in to hear their views.

In this article

SpaceX is valued at around $400 billion and is critical for U.S. space access, but it wasn't always the powerhouse that it is today.

Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002. Using money that he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk and his new company developed their first rocket, the Falcon 1, to challenge existing launch providers.

""There were actually a lot of startup aerospace companies looking to take on this market. They recognized we had a monopoly provider called United Launch Alliance. They had merged the Boeing and Lockheed rocket launch capacity to one company, and they were charging the government hundreds of millions of dollars to launch satellites,"" said Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator at NASA.

In 2003, Musk paraded Falcon 1 around the streets of Washington hoping to attract the attention of government agencies and the multi-million dollar contracts that they offered. It worked, and in 2004, SpaceX secured a few million dollars from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the U.S. Air Force to further develop its rockets.

Despite the government support, the company struggled. Its first three launches of the Falcon 1 failed to reach orbit.

""NASA, and specifically the the initial commercial cargo contract, is what saved the company when it was on the brink of bankruptcy,"" said Chris Quilty, president and Co-CEO of Quilty Space, a space-focused research firm.

NASA awarded the $1.6 billion contract, known as Commercial Resupply Services to SpaceX in 2008, just months after the first successful flight of the Falcon 1. The contract called on SpaceX to use its new rocket, the Falcon 9, along with its Dragon capsule to ferry cargo and supplies to the International Space Station over the course of 12 missions. In 2014, SpaceX won another NASA contract worth $2.6 billion to develop and operate vehicles to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

Today, SpaceX dominates large parts of the space market from launch to satellites. In 2024, SpaceX conducted a record-breaking 134 orbital launches, more than double the amount of launches done by the next most prolific launch provider, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, according to science and technology consulting firm BryceTech. These 134 launches accounted for 83% of all spacecraft launched last year. According to a July report by Bloomberg, SpaceX was valued at $400 billion.

SpaceX's Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket are the primary means by which NASA launches astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. The company's Starlink satellites have become indispensable for providing internet access to remote areas as well as to U.S. allies during wartime. The company's Starship rocket, though still in testing, is also key to the U.S. plan to return to the moon. SpaceX is also building a network of spy satellites for the U.S. government called Starshield as part of a $1.8 billion contract. Even competitors including Amazon and OneWeb have launched their satellites on SpaceX rockets. 

""The ecosystem of space is changed by, really it's SpaceX,"" Garver said. ""The lower cost of access to space is doing what we had dreamed of. It is built up a whole community of companies around the world that now have access to space.""

Jackson Hole, Wy. — Bitcoin miners have long been defined by the boom-and-bust rhythm of the four-year halving cycle. But the game has now changed, according to some of the industry's most prominent executives at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole earlier this week.

The rise of exchange-traded funds, surging demand for power, and the prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) reshaping infrastructure needs mean that miners must find ways to diversify or risk being left behind.

“We used to come here and talk about hash rate,” said Matt Schultz, CEO of Cleanspark. “Now we're talking about how to monetize megawatts.”

For years, mining companies—which derived their main source of revenue solely from mining bitcoin—lived and died by the four-year bitcoin halving cycle. Every cycle, rewards were slashed in half, and miners scrambled to cut costs or scale up to survive. But that rhythm, according to these executives, no longer defines the business.

“The four-year cycle is effectively broken with the maturation of bitcoin as a strategic asset, with the ETF and now the strategic treasury and whatnot,” Schultz said. “The adoption is driving demand. If you read anything about the most recent ETF, they've consumed infinitely more bitcoin than have been generated so far this year.”

Cleanspark, which now operates 800 megawatts of energy infrastructure and has another 1.2 gigawatts in development, has begun turning its attention beyond proof-of-work. “Our speed to market with the electricity has created opportunities such that now we can look at ways to monetize power beyond just bitcoin mining,” he said. “With 33 locations, we now have a great deal more flexibility than we ever did before.”

Schultz is not alone in calling the industry's monumental shift in business model.

Patrick Fleury, CFO of Terawulf, echoed the sentiment and didn't try to sugarcoat the profit squeeze the miners are now feeling.

“Bitcoin mining is an incredibly difficult business,” he said. He broke down the economics of bitcoin mining in straightforward terms: with electricity priced at five cents per kilowatt hour, it currently costs around $60,000 to mine a single bitcoin. At a bitcoin price of $115,000, that means half the revenue is consumed by power alone. Once corporate expenses and other operating costs are factored in, the margins tighten quickly. In his view, profitability in mining hinges almost entirely on securing ultra-low-cost power.

For Fleury, the deeper problem isn't just power costs — it's the relentless expansion of the network itself, driven by hardware manufacturers with little incentive to slow down.

He pointed to Bitmain, which continues to produce mining rigs regardless of market demand, thanks to its direct pipeline to chipmakers like TSMC. Even when miners aren't buying, the company can deploy the machines itself in regions with ultra-cheap electricity — from the U.S. to Pakistan — flooding the network with hash power and driving up mining difficulty. That global footprint, coupled with low production costs, allows Bitmain to remain profitable while squeezing margins for everyone else.

Still, Terawulf is pivoting aggressively. Last week, it signed a $6.7 billion lease-backed deal with Google to convert hundreds of megawatts of mining infrastructure into data center space.

“These things, as everyone can attest to up here, like electrical infrastructure, don't move quickly,” Fleury said. “Tech is used to moving quickly and breaking things, but these deals take an extremely long time to come together. It took us four to five months of very intense due diligence.”

“What I take the most pride in in that transaction was really working collectively with those partners to come up with a new mousetrap that I hope now becomes something that the industry can duplicate at other companies,” he said. “Google is providing $3.2 billion of backstop lease obligation support to Terawulf, which effectively allows me to go out and secure financing at a really efficient cost of capital.”

Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at IREN, took a quieter but confident stance. His company mines bitcoin profitably — even today, he said. Still, he pointed to one common denominator: power.

“Being a low-cost producer is fundamentally important, and that's how we've always focused our business — having control of our sites, having operational control, being in areas that are low-cost power jurisdictions,” Draper said.

Iren, according to him, is currently operating at 50 exahash, which translates to a billion-dollar annual revenue run rate under current bitcoin market conditions. He noted that the company's gross margins — revenue minus electricity costs — stand at 75%, and even after accounting for corporate overhead and SG&A expenses, IREN maintains a 65% EBITDA margin, or roughly $650 million in annualized earnings.

Still, even IREN is pausing its expansion in mining. “That's really dictated just by the opportunity set that we see on the AI side today and the potential to really diversify the revenue streams within our business, rather than a fundamental view that bitcoin mining is no longer attractive,” Draper said.

On the AI side, IREN is pursuing both co-location and cloud. “Capital intensity is very different,” Draper said. “If you're owning the GPUs on top of the data center infrastructure, that's 3x the investment. On the cloud side, the payback periods tend to be a lot faster—typically around two years on the GPU investment alone.”

For Marathon Digital (MARA) CFO Salman Khan, survival is about agility. With decades in the oil industry, Khan sees a familiar pattern: boom, bust, consolidation, and the constant race to stay efficient.

“This reminds me of those trends in commodity-exposed cycle industries,” Khan said. “There are some very wealthy families in the oil sector who made billions, and then there are others who have filed bankruptcies. You have to have a strong balance sheet to survive these cycles.”

Marathon holds bitcoin on its balance sheet — something Khan said paid off. “We're not a treasury company, we're not Strategy, but we like to have that hedge if bitcoin price escalates.”

More recently, Marathon announced a majority stake in Exaion. “The angle that we have on the AI front is compute on the edge,” Khan said. “We like sovereign compute, which allows people to control their data better at a closer location to them. We like the aspect of recurring revenues that come with that. We also like that there's a software aspect to it, and also the platform aspect to it.”

Despite the different points of view and strategies, it all comes down to one common factor: power. Whether it was being used to mine bitcoin, power AI, or balance electrical grids, energy — not hash rate — was the currency of the conversation.

“We curtail our energy consumption for 120 hours a year,” CleanSpark's Schultz said. “We can avoid about a third of our total energy costs. So being that flexible load matters.”

Cleanspark, he added, has spent the past year quietly locking up megawatts around the country. “You mentioned Georgia,” Schultz said. “We have 100 megawatts surrounding the Atlanta airport. That's a prime example. We've been focused on being the valuable partner for some of these rural utilities to monetize stranded megawatts.”

Despite the growing focus on AI, the panelists made it clear that bitcoin remains central to their businesses — for now. When asked why mining companies still deserve investor attention, the answers pointed to scale, cost efficiency, and the ability to weather volatility.

Fleury emphasized that Terawulf's contracted power capacity could generate substantial cash flow, comparing the economics to established data center operators. Khan pointed out a disconnect between Marathon's bitcoin holdings and its market valuation, suggesting that the core mining business is being overlooked. Draper underscored IREN's operational efficiency and low-cost footprint, citing recent performance metrics that placed the company ahead of other public miners.

And while the future may include cloud infrastructure and edge compute, Schultz argued that bitcoin itself could still evolve into something larger — a foundational layer for energy systems. As he put it, the next phase may not be about speculation, but about bitcoin's role in helping balance power networks.

 Ethereum gaming network Xai claims Elon Musk's AI firm xAI has caused market confusion and reputational harm. 

Ethereum-based gaming network Xai has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, accusing it of trademark infringement and unfair competition.

The complaint, lodged in the Northern District of California on Thursday, claims Musk's xAI company has created widespread market confusion, damaging Xai's brand.

Ex Populus, the Delaware corporation behind Xai, said it has used the XAI trademark in US commerce since June 2023, including through its blockchain gaming ecosystem and the $XAI token. “This is a classic case of trademark infringement that requires the Court's intervention to remedy,” the filing said.

Ex Populus operates the Xai ecosystem, which includes a blockchain-powered network designed for video gaming and digital transactions, offering infrastructure to support game logic, AI-driven decisions, rewards and data management across multiple applications, per the filing.

Related: Elon Musk's ‘America Party' plans have stalled: Report

The complaint alleges that confusion began after Musk announced his company, xAI, in July 2023 and deepened when he said in November 2024 that xAI planned to launch a gaming studio.

The filing states that “marketplace confusion abounded as to whether Defendants/Musk were associated with, owned, or sponsored Plaintiff's XAI Trademark or the associated goods and services.” It cited examples of consumers, publications and even Musk's AI assistant Grok incorrectly linking the two ventures.

Ex Populus argued that the reputational harm goes beyond lost goodwill. The complaint says Xai has faced “significant negative consumer sentiment” due to Musk's polarizing public image and controversies involving xAI products.

“Plaintiff is not only being irreparably harmed by the loss of control over its hard-earned goodwill in its XAI Trademark… but also Plaintiff is damaged because the confusing association with Elon Musk is resulting in significant negative consumer sentiment,” the filing notes.

Related: xAI blames code for Grok's anti-Semitic Hitler posts

The filing accuses Musk's legal team of trying to pressure Ex Populus into relinquishing rights by threatening cancellation of its registration earlier this month.

The lawsuit also mentioned that the US Patent and Trademark Office has already suspended several of Musk's xAI trademark applications due to a likelihood of confusion with Xai's existing mark.

Ex Populus is seeking cancellation of xAI's pending applications, damages for infringement, and a court order to prevent Musk's company from using the disputed name in gaming and blockchain contexts. “There is no remedy at law for the sheer magnitude of harm Defendants have caused,” the company told the court.

Ethereum is back in the spotlight, climbing steadily as institutional demand surges and network activity strengthens, with bulls setting their sights on fresh highs.

After weathering market volatility, Ethereum is regaining momentum and positioning itself as a top contender in the crypto space. Analysts now debate whether ETH could surge toward new record levels in the coming months.

Ethereum price today is hovering near $4,800, just shy of its all-time high of $4,891. This surge comes on the back of renewed institutional inflows into ETH ETFs and rising Layer 2 activity across platforms like Arbitrum and zkSync. Traders say the next few weeks could determine whether Ethereum charts a path to $7,000 before the end of 2025.

Ethereum recently broke through an 18-month resistance level around $4,100, igniting speculation of a stronger rally. Data from CryptoRank shows that ETH ETFs now hold more than $33 billion in assets, up from $24 billion only weeks ago. On August 21, BlackRock's ETHA fund alone reported inflows of $233 million.

“ETH's rebound above $4,000 signals a reversal trend and new accumulation,” said Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder. Analysts note that the daily chart is forming a broadening wedge, a setup often followed by a powerful upward move.

The critical zone to watch is $4,800–$5,000. A clean break here could unlock upside targets of $6,000 and eventually $7,000. Conversely, losing support around $4,600 may push ETH back toward $4,200.

On-chain and technical indicators confirm the bullish outlook. A chart posted on X by @crypto_goos highlights a “perfect retest” of a descending triangle pattern, with projections aligning to the $7,000 range. TradingView's ETH/USD chart also shows multiple breakout confirmations, with RSI holding near 65—high but not yet overbought.

Momentum indicators such as MACD and ADX also suggest strength, while Bollinger Bands show volatility expansion, often a precursor to sharp moves.

Ethereum's long-term appeal is reinforced by staking, where validator rewards continue to attract capital. Gas fees, though elevated during peak usage, have trended lower relative to prior cycles thanks to Layer 2 scaling. Platforms like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync now account for a growing share of ETH's transaction volume, bolstering its ecosystem utility.

Institutional adoption is also deepening. With ETH's market cap surpassing $500 billion, Ethereum is now eligible for inclusion in more public funds, a milestone that could accelerate capital inflows.

Most forecasts converge on one key factor: the breakout above $5,000. If sustained, analysts see a realistic path toward $7,000 by Q4 2025. VirtualBacon, a popular crypto analyst, argues that if Bitcoin rallies to $150K and ETH/BTC holds near 0.044, “Ethereum will trade between $6,000–$7,000 before year-end.”

Still, the risks remain. Historical precedent shows Ethereum can swing violently after new highs, as seen in 2021 when it hit $4,800 before retracing below $2,000.

Ethereum's momentum is undeniable, driven by ETF demand, technical strength, and ecosystem growth. But the battle lines are clear: hold above $4,800–$5,000 or risk another pullback. If bulls prevail, $7,000 may not just be a prediction—it could be Ethereum's next reality in Q4.

Is the cryptocurrency market on the brink of a seismic shift? Ethereum's explosive rise in value has the entire sector buzzing, pulling new enthusiasts and seasoned investors alike into its orbit. Beyond Ethereum, ZK Coin is beginning to capture attention, showcasing the yearnings of a community hungry for growth and innovation. 

This piece takes a closer look at the seismic shifts within the Ethereum landscape, the intriguing prospect of ZK Coin's ascent, and the overall trends that are set to redefine how investors engage with cryptocurrencies. Brace yourself as we unravel how these dynamic fluctuations pave the way for recalibrated strategies moving forward, and what critical data points deserve your focus in the weeks ahead.

Ethereum's price is on an astounding journey, recently nudging towards an eye-popping $4,849, tantalizingly close to its historical peak. A remarkable daily surge of over 12% signals robust momentum as it stabilizes around the enticing threshold of $4,700, intriguing traders, particularly within the ETHBTC trade. Analysts are projecting audacious price targets of $6,833 and even $9,530 for Ethereum, heavily influenced by Bitcoin's performance, some rooting for its resurgence to the legendary $69,000 mark.

In stark contrast, Bitcoin's reign appears steadied around $114,000 yet whispers of instability hover. Recent metrics suggest that the tide is turning, as outflows from Bitcoin now overshadow inflows, reflecting an erosion of confidence among crypto investors. While Ethereum is basking in its bullish glow, Bitcoin's fate teeters precariously on key support benchmarks, warning that neglect could spell challenges for its future.

A pivotal moment has shaken the foundations of conventional wisdom: a Bitcoin whale from the Satoshi era has shifted a whopping $800 million into Ethereum. This monumental transfer signals a shift in player dynamics, as the wheelhouses of wealth demonstrate a newfound affinity for Ethereum's prospects. These whales, often considered the market's heartbeat, may inspire a wave of smaller investors to follow suit, signaling a profound shift in sentiment.

Recent data from the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) offers further validation, revealing diverging trends—while Bitcoin grapples with negative sentiment, Ethereum enjoys a refreshing wave of optimism. This distinct bifurcation highlights the considerably bright path ahead for Ethereum amidst the clamor of uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin.

In the midst of Ethereum's ascension, ZK Coin's resurgence is beginning to spark intrigue, emerging like a phoenix ready to soar. Despite facing hurdles relating to supply surges, analysts are forecasting ZK Coin could rocket anywhere from $0.06 to a stunning $2, depending on fluctuating market dynamics. The current climate brims with opportunity as astute investors fixate on fresh, promising projects.

ZK Coin's allure is augmented by its innovative protocols aimed at enhancing privacy and scalability. This focus on technological sophistication positions ZK Coin as an electrifying contender amidst a rapidly evolving market landscape, appealing to those yearning for insight into the cryptosphere's next wave.

Successfully navigating this complex and fluid cryptocurrency market demands a discerning eye not only on immediate price movements but also on broader ecological shifts. For Web3 startups, merging crypto operations with ever-changing regulatory frameworks can be labyrinthine. Many API solutions tout streamlined transitions from fiat to crypto but are often hamstrung by compliance issues and jurisdictional dilemmas.

As maturation sets into the market, startups must synchronize their operational strategies with evolving regulatory landscapes while honing their liquidity management practices. This multifaceted focus will prove essential as they carve their place within a fierce competitive atmosphere.

Ethereum's remarkable price upward trend dovetails with emerging expectations that monetary policy may shift, presenting potential windfalls for the entire crypto milieu. Adjustments in interest rate anticipation could cultivate fertile conditions for the further proliferation of both Ethereum and ZK Coin. Emphasizing technological progression and regulatory alignment empowers these assets within a shifting environment.

Nevertheless, market analysts caution vigilance amid this wave of enthusiasm. Even in this backdrop of optimism, understanding and mitigating operational risks remain paramount. Investors must remain alert to the potential for volatility, advocating for diversification to cushion against tumultuous shifts.

As the cryptocurrency landscape approaches a critical juncture, Ethereum stands poised as a prospective leader, while up-and-comers like ZK Coin stir intrigue and possibility. With Bitcoin wrestling to maintain its stability, Ethereum's bullish signals juxtaposed against significant whale activities illuminate a pathway brimming with promise. This moment invites investors to reassess strategies and adapt to the evolving dynamics inherent within cryptocurrencies. Staying attuned to regulatory developments and market indicators will be vital as the journey unfolds.

In this vibrant ecosystem, the dialogue between Ethereum's momentum and ZK Coin's potential unfolds a world teeming with opportunities, waiting for both the adventurous and the astute to make their mark.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins Make Gains as Arthur Hayes Predicts Ethereum to $20,000","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-gain-as-arthur-hayes-predicts-20000-ethereum/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:58:00 GMT","

Arthur Hayes believes that Ethereum will push to $10,000 or even $20,000 this cycle, fueled by Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies.

Hayes' prediction came during an interview with Crypto Banter where he said that Ethereum breaking through its previous ATH could push it to $20,000 before the end of the cycle.

Once it's broken through, you have a massive gap of air to the upside.

—Arthur Hayes, Crypto Banter interview

As Hayes explained, two major factors will fuel Ethereum's next bull cycle: Trump's pro-crypto legislation and the increase in institutional adoption.

The first signs of a bull move should become obvious this fall, as the GENIUS Act takes effect, which could push the best altcoins in frenzy mode.

Trump's GENIUS Act is the main catalyst behind Ethereum's 2025 ATH of $4,880 reached yesterday, which may signal the beginning of the alt season.

The GENIUS Act seeks to bring clarity, security, and transparency into the cryptosphere by forcing stablecoin issuers to back their tokens with liquid assets like dollars and governmental bonds.

The Act also protects crypto enthusiasts against illicit activities and scams.

This endeavor is part of the implementation process of the GENIUS Act and the comment section will remain open until October 17.

Institutional adoption is another strong case for Ethereum's next bull cycle, given the accelerated rate at which public companies buy $ETH.

According to CoinGecko, almost 2.8M $ETH are already in public treasuries, making up for 2.31% of the total Ethereum supply. BitMine is the primary investor, with over 1.5M Ethereum, worth over $7.2B.



These factors potentially lay the foundation for a $20,000 Ethereum this cycle, which would kickstart the next alt season. If that happens, the best altcoins of 2025 might see massive gains.

Here are three that you should keep on your radar.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 upgrade that promises to change Bitcoin's network performance.

Hyper's Canonical Bridge is the link between Layer 2 and Bitcoin's Layer 1 and is responsible for minting the users' Bitcoins into the Hyper layer. The Bitcoins are then accessible for use on Layer 2 or can be withdrawn back to Layer 1 whenever necessary.



The Canonical Bridge's role is to decongest Bitcoin's native network, circumvent the 7-TPS native cap, and deliver near-instant finality.

Together with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts, the Canonical Bridge brings Bitcoin's performance to modern standards, with high throughput and Solana-level scalability.

If you want to invest in the $HYPER presale, now's the perfect time. The presale has raised almost $11.8M so far and it promises to push $HYPER into wealth-building territory.

Check how to buy $HYPER right now and buy your tokens while Bitcoin Hyper is still in the presale phase.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) fuels the Snorter Bot, the ravenous Aardvark whose sole mission is to detect and snipe hot tokens on the blockchain.

The Bot finally turns coin hunting profitable thanks to its accuracy and timing, being able to snipe the target tokens in milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This makes Snorter Bot more effective and reliable even than standard pro UIs like Raydium and Jupiter.



You also no longer need to juggle multiple wallets and browser extensions, because Snorter Bot does it all from its Telegram chat.

And no more watching over your shoulder for scams like honeypots or rug pulls, as the Aardvark's native scam detectors highlight any suspicious project.

If you want to invest, read our ‘How to buy $SNORT' guide and secure your place at the table before the project goes public.

Altura ($ALU) is one of the most comprehensive toolsets for game developers, offering a multitude of end-to-end solutions designed to streamline the development process.

Aside from tools like Java, Typescript, and Unity SDK, Altura also offers Altura API, which allows you to ‘manage all user, item, token, and collection data, including the developer wallet, and even Smart NFTs'.



The platform also offers you the opportunity to launch your own marketplace on any chain in minutes via Altura's native dashboard.

$ALU went public in 2021 and went through two peaks so far, with the first one pumping the token by up to 4,839%.

Go to your favorite exchange and buy your $ALU while it's hot. However, don't forget to visit the official website first to learn more about the project before investing.

Based on the current legislative support and the growing institutional interest, it's not impossible that Ethereum could reach $20,000 by the end of the cycle?

Will it? Nobody can tell for sure.

What we can tell for sure is that the next alt season is upon us, at which point we'll see Ethereum enter a sustained bull phase, once it pushes through its past ATH.

When that happens, projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) will see a massive influx of investors as well.

An analyst who accurately called the stages of Bitcoin's (BTC) parabolic run this cycle is now predicting a huge upside burst for altcoins.

In a new strategy session, crypto strategist Kevin Svenson tells his 83,900 YouTube subscribers that he thinks Ethereum (ETH) and the low-cap altcoin market are gearing up for a big explosion.

He notes that the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all crypto excluding the top 10 digital assets and stablecoins, has historically broken its all-time highs after Ethereum surged to new record levels.

“The low-cap altcoins have been suffering because of Fed policy. But obviously today that has changed. There is a high likelihood that we see a quickening, something really, you know, really fast move for the low caps to new highs could be coming in the very near future. A pump that takes place quicker than most people expect.

That's what I think is going to happen for a lot of these low caps. But the one thing that it does require is an Ethereum all-time high. In the last cycle, [an] Ethereum all-time high is what sent the low caps to the moon. And that is what we're looking for now. Once Ethereum breaks its all-time high, I think very quickly these low-cap coins are going to swing back up with a lot of velocity with a slight delay, of course, because Ethereum's right there right now.

And the low-cap alt coins are still a little bit further away down here, right? But I think we'll get the move pretty soon for both of these.”

Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell sent the crypto markets flying after delivering a speech indicating that the Fed may soon ease monetary policy.

At time of writing, Ethereum is trading $4,779 while OTHERS is hovering at $310.277 billion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Top 7 Altcoins to Buy on Market Dip — Polygon (MATIC), APT & Dogecoin Attract Whales","https://coincentral.com/top-7-altcoins-to-buy-on-market-dip-polygon-matic-apt-dogecoin-attract-whales/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 16:05:40 GMT","

Whales are again circling the altcoins with the prices falling down, and this is the chance of investors who track technical indicators and the long-term plays. Polygon, Aptos, and Dogecoin are experiencing new volumes, whereas Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche remain resilient. However, one name drawing smart money attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver one of the biggest returns in this cycle.



Polygon is a scaling solution on Ethereum, aimed at reducing Ethereum gas fees and the Ethereum block time. Its ecosystem is growing, and the migration of tokens of MATIC to POL will strengthen the standing. Technicals suggest potential upside—RSI is oversold near 38, and MACD shows bearish momentum slowing. 

Resistance is at around $0.58, and support levels are at around $0.33. Analysts predict a price range of between $3.84 and $6.25 by 2025, powered by an Ethereum upgrade and Bitcoin halving. In the long term, Polygon may go as high as $8.55 to $10.40 by 2030 should it continue to gain adoption.

Aptos is a new Layer-1 blockchain focused on high throughput and speed. It has gained traction with developers. However, the adoption of the coin is still in the early phase. Depending on the development of its ecosystem, analysts project that Aptos may trade between $25 and $35 by 2025. Some investors view APT as a potential high-growth bet in the event that network usage swells.

Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin, supported by its community and regular bursts of hype. It doesn't have strong utility compared to other networks, but liquidity and recognition keep it relevant. The price often finds support between $0.05 and $0.07 and often rallies when sentiment improves. 

For 2025, analysts see it trading between $0.08 and $0.15, though much depends on social media buzz and endorsements. DOGE remains a speculative pick, but its track record of sudden rallies keeps it on whale watchlists.

Ethereum is the foundation for the decentralized applications, DeFi, and NFTs. Its increasing upgrades make it more scalable with low energy consumption, which maintains its appeal among developers and institutions. 

In the past, Ethereum has been quite successful in bull markets, and experts believe that it will be trading between 4,000 and 6,000 by the year 2025. The long-term need in enterprise scenarios and the increasing DeFi community provide ETH with a solid foundation. It is an essential part of the portfolios of many investors who are constructing long-term cryptocurrency investments.

Solana has also been widely celebrated as a platform that offers quick transactions and minimal fees, making it a popular platform among DeFi and NFTs. Past outages in the network have been a cause of concern, but stability has been improved, and investors are more confident. 

It has a support level of between $20 and $30 and a resistance level of up to $90. Depending on network reliability and macro market trends, analysts estimate SOL will range between $60 and $90 in 2025. Its developing community indicates Solana can be a strong altcoin moving forward

Avalanche is creating traction in DeFi and enterprise blockchain. Its scalability and its fast finality make it appealing to developers. Support is at about $20 to $30, and resistance is at about $75. Analysts predict between $50 and $75 by 2025 in case the adoption grows higher. With the increasing popularity of DeFi, Avalanche will emerge as a favorable option when other projects seek faster and scalable solutions.



Whale activity is starting to build around MAGACOIN FINANCE, indicating an increasing level of confidence in its long-term potential by intelligent money. Analysts have predicted up to 45x growth, making MAGA one of the most discussed altcoins in this dip. Unlike meme coins that solely rely on hype, MAGA has undergone audit processes, which further increase the credibility of the project among skeptical investors. 

It's drawing attention not only from retail buyers but also from larger wallets that are typically more selective. That combination has created a wave of curiosity around whether MAGA could be the next breakout coin of this market cycle.

The market dip is giving investors a chance to pick up strong altcoins at lower levels. Polygon, Aptos, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche all have growth potential, but whale activity is pointing strongly toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts of 45x growth and rising confidence from large investors, MAGA is quickly becoming the altcoin many are watching as the top play of this cycle.

Blockchain technologies are digital systems that work by distributing copies of information across several computers, also referred to as nodes, all of which are connected to a common network. These technologies underpin the trading of cryptocurrencies, as well as the functioning of other emerging digital services.

While blockchain technology opens new opportunities for the trading of cryptocurrencies, digital arts and other digital assets, they are also often used for fraudulent activities. Perhaps most notably, they are now widely used for fraudulent investment schemes known as smart Ponzi schemes.

In a smart Ponzi scheme, individuals are asked to invest in specific digital currencies or assets and sign a so-called smart contract that automatically draws money from them on a regular basis. Their investments might initially seem fruitful, yet the early investors are in fact being paid with the money invested by new individuals. After some time, the whole system collapses, as there are no longer enough resources to pay all investors.

In recent years, computer scientists and financial security experts have been trying to devise strategies to automatically detect these fraudulent schemes. Most solutions developed so far rely on deep learning algorithms trained to identify patterns associated with smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain transactions.

Despite their promise, to perform well, these deep learning-based techniques must be trained on large datasets containing blockchain transactions labeled by human experts. As labeling this data requires extensive time and resources, existing solutions might not be ideal for the reliable detection of smart Ponzi schemes in real-world settings.

The University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, City University of Macau and Swinburne University of Technology recently developed CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER), a deep-learning-based framework that can detect smart Ponzi schemes with good accuracy without requiring labeled training data.

This new technique, introduced in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, relies on models that can learn to detect these fraudulent activities by comparing the similarities and differences between different blockchain transactions.

""Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of labeled data,"" wrote Weija Yang, Tian Lan and their colleagues in their paper. ""However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in blockchain transactions.""

To pick up signs of smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain transactions, Yang, Lan and their colleagues employed an approach known as contrastive learning. This is a machine learning technique through which a computational model learns to tell different things apart by comparing them.

""By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system complexity,"" wrote the researchers.

The team assessed the new Ponzi scheme detection technique in a series of tests, in which it was fed blockchain transactions from a publicly available dataset. Their framework performed remarkably well, despite being trained on a limited amount of labeled data.

""We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data,"" the team wrote. ""More impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly 20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions in the future.""

In the future, the CASPER framework could be improved and tested on more real-world data, to further assess its potential for detecting and mitigating smart Ponzi schemes. Eventually, it could make its way into real-world settings, where it could help to protect digital currency investors against malicious activities.

This study aims to investigate blockchain technology (BC) adoption behavior and potential barriers in the Libyan context. Leveraging the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, we empirically validated the extended UTAUT model in Libyan oil and gas firms. We used a quantitative and exploratory approach, collecting and analyzing data from 342 managers in Libyan oil and gas firms using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Our findings emphasize that facilitating conditions, perceived trust, regulatory support, and subjective norms are key enablers for blockchain adoption in Libyan oil and gas firms. Crucially, blockchain literacy emerged as a significant moderating variable, amplifying the effects of these enablers on behavioral intention. This highlights the pivotal role of blockchain literacy in strengthening the influence of organizational and institutional factors, particularly in low-digital-literacy environments such as Libya. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of blockchain adoption behavior in emerging economies. The extended model, which incorporates blockchain literacy not only as a contextual driver but as a key moderator, offers valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners in industries with similar cultural and institutional environments.

In today's rapidly evolving commercial landscape, the integration of advanced technologies has become essential for firms striving to maintain a competitive edge1). Among these technologies, blockchain stands out as a transformative force reshaping traditional business models2). The explosive growth of e-commerce over the past decade has further underscored the critical role of technological innovation in modern commerce [https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/blockchain-technology-applications-use-cases/]. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a key driver of transformation3,4).

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, peer-to-peer ledger that securely and immutably records transactions in blocks. It creates a transparent and reliable environment, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries in transaction validation and recordkeeping5). Its applications span various domains, including payment systems, health records, provider directories, data security and exchange, and intellectual property management6,7).

Blockchain's ability to ensure traceability, origin verification, and transparency makes it particularly valuable in complex global ecosystems, especially where operational efficiency, responsiveness, and social sustainability are priorities8). Its core attributes are expected to significantly influence corporate governance, digital transformation, and strategic decision-making processes. Moreover, when integrated with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology can enhance management operations, promote agility, and support legitimacy and transparency9,10,11).

Despite its potential, the adoption of blockchain technology faces notable barriers. Its technical complexity and high implementation costs deter many firms, particularly in developing economies12,13). Nonetheless, blockchain technology continues to transform sectors such as intellectual property management and patent commercialization3,4), and its influence is expected to grow across industries2,14).

While substantial research has focused on blockchain technology implementation in developed countries15,16,17), limited studies explore its adoption in developing contexts18,19). This gap is particularly striking in fragile or post-conflict environments, such as Libya, where institutional trust is low, infrastructure is weak, and digital literacy is limited. Strategic industries like oil and gas, central to economic development and organizationally complex, remain largely unexamined in this regard.

Blockchain technology holds significant promise for developing nations, particularly in areas such as property registration, financial inclusion, and operational efficiency. It can provide solutions to long-standing issues of trust and transparency within governmental and commercial infrastructures20,21). Despite concerns over cryptocurrency volatility, the broader blockchain ecosystem offers new pathways for modernizing financial systems in developing contexts.

However, blockchain technology adoption in industries such as oil and gas faces additional hurdles, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability concerns, and digital infrastructure gaps22). Even so, initial findings suggest that blockchain technology can enhance collaboration, support international transactions, and streamline supply chains in these sectors23).

The underdevelopment of financial technologies in the petroleum sector, particularly in developing nations, is well-documented24). Many firms still rely on outdated tools and processes, and research on mediating variables like blockchain literacy remains sparse25).

This study addresses these gaps by exploring the enablers of blockchain technology adoption in the Libyan oil sector, a high-stakes and under-researched environment. Existing research often relies on models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) or the Technological, Organizational, and Environmental (TOE) framework. However, these models fall short in capturing behavioral intention (BI) and actual usage in volatile, low-digital-readiness environments23).

To gain deeper insights, this study adopts the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a framework capable of explaining over 55% of the variance in individuals' intention to adopt new technologies26). The study extends UTAUT by integrating additional factors relevant to the Libyan context, such as perceived trust, regulatory support, and blockchain literacy as a moderating variable.

The adoption of blockchain technology in developing countries is a complex and multifaceted process. Acknowledging that adoption drivers vary by context, we draw from emerging literature to develop a comprehensive UTAUT-based model that incorporates Technology Readiness and Trust, two factors shown to influence adoption significantly27,28,29,21). We also introduce Blockchain Literacy as a moderator to enhance the model's predictive capacity30).

Accordingly, the main objective of this study is to empirically investigate the behavioral intentions of managers in Libyan oil firms regarding blockchain technology adoption. Specifically, it addresses the following research questions:

(1) What are the main determinants of managers' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology in Libyan oil firms?

(2) What is the moderating effect of blockchain literacy on the relationship between blockchain enablers and the behavioral intention to adopt this technology?

To answer these questions, we conduct a thorough review of the relevant literature and propose a conceptual model rooted in an extended UTAUT framework. The contribution of this research is threefold. Theoretically, it enriches the UTAUT model by incorporating trust, regulatory support, and blockchain literacy, elements critical to adoption in fragile and developing economies. Empirically, it provides new evidence from the underexplored Libyan context, contributing to the growing body of research on technology adoption in conflict-affected settings. Practically, it delivers actionable insights for policymakers and managers in the oil and gas sector to design strategies that overcome adoption barriers and promote digital transformation.

Finally, this study sheds light on the role of industry context and digital literacy in shaping blockchain technology adoption behavior, offering a valuable contribution to both academia and practice. It is among the first to explore blockchain technology adoption in the North African region, with a particular focus on the Libyan oil industry.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 ""Literature review"" reviews the literature, Sect. 3 ""Research model and hypothesis development"" presents the research model and study hypotheses, Sect. 4 ""Methodology"" describes the methodology, Sect. 5 ""Results"" discusses the results, Sect. 6 ""Discussion and implications"" provides a discussion along with the study's theoretical and managerial implications, and Sect. 7 ""Conclusion"" concludes the paper.

While blockchain technology is applicable across diverse sectors, comprehensive research frameworks for its adoption within industrial firms remain scarce. In this domain, blockchain technology is often perceived as a vague solution due to limited knowledge about the currently available services and the potential benefits it can offer to firm stakeholders. Consequently, this study aims to address the information gap identified in the existing literature by clarifying the value blockchain technology can add to management operations and by examining the key enablers that facilitate its effective implementation within the Libyan industry.

Although the literature acknowledges blockchain's transformative potential, enhancing transparency, security, and trust in operational processes, its implementation remains at an early stage and faces several technical, organizational, and behavioral challenges(31,32,33,34,35,36), for instance, examined the role of blockchain technology in creating immutable distributed records to support operational networks, while11 provided a systematic review identifying both the advantages and obstacles of blockchain technology in process management. Similarly9, highlighted knowledge gaps and a lack of understanding as key barriers to adoption.

37 integrated the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to investigate user perceptions of blockchain technology in supply chains. Their findings showed that while perceived usefulness and behavioral control significantly affect intention to adopt, certain TRI constructs like Insecurity and Discomfort have little impact38., using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), found that social influence had minimal impact on adoption intention, whereas inter-organizational trust significantly influenced adoption.

39 applied an enhanced TAM framework to firms in China and the U.S., emphasizing that blockchain's effectiveness in mitigating disruption risks and improving coordination was a key driver of managerial adoption. In a similar vein40, highlighted the technology's ability to improve visibility and responsiveness as critical to its adoption among Malaysian SMEs.

Comparative studies by13 found that blockchain technology adoption among U.S. Fortune 500 companies was more effective than among their Chinese counterparts, largely due to greater resource availability and higher R&D investment. Meanwhile41,, using the DEMATEL approach, identified core adoption barriers such as inadequate knowledge dissemination, complex trust issues, and weak integration of advanced technologies.

Despite this growing body of work, the full potential and adoption behavior surrounding blockchain technology remain underexplored, particularly in the context of developing economies42. noted the lack of clear understanding around the drivers and outcomes of blockchain technology implementation, especially in relation to its impact on management performance.

The technology's adoption has also been studied in emerging applications such as carbon trading and energy efficiency43. found that factors like firm size, compatibility, and contract mechanisms significantly influenced adoption intentions44., examining Iraqi oil companies, identified trust, facilitating conditions, and IT support as critical enablers of managers' willingness to adopt blockchain technology-enabled smart contracts.

Broadening the scope45, explored AI adoption in Oman's hydrocarbon sector. Their findings highlight the importance of innovation attributes, environmental conditions, and risk management, moderated by perceptions of usefulness and ease of use. Similarly46,, using an extended UTAUT2 model in Thailand's energy sector, revealed that price value and hedonic motivation affect usage behavior via trust and behavioral intentions.

While studies on blockchain technology adoption in developing countries are emerging, comparative insights across MENA and oil-rich nations remain limited. Like other MENA countries such as Algeria and Iraq, Libya faces systemic challenges, including poor digital infrastructure, weak institutional capacity, and limited managerial awareness, all of which hinder blockchain integration47,48;). In contrast, other oil-rich MENA countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, have demonstrated proactive national initiatives to support blockchain technology development. For instance, the UAE launched its Blockchain Strategy 2021, aiming to digitize 50% of government transactions using blockchain technology by 2021 (Emirates Blockchain Strategy, 2021), while Saudi Arabia partnered with IBM and ConsenSys to explore blockchain technology use in smart cities and e-government services49). These contrasting trajectories underscore how regulatory vision, institutional readiness, and investment in digital infrastructure affect blockchain adoption across oil-rich economies in the region, highlighting Libya's relatively constrained position in this evolving technological landscape.

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is a comprehensive model designed to investigate users' behavioral intentions toward adopting new technology50). Widely acknowledged for its robustness, the model provides a thorough explanation of user behavioral intentions. In psychological terms, behavioral intention refers to the extent of a user's inclination to embrace new technology. UTAUT incorporates key factors derived from synthesizing eight acceptance theories and models, including the Theory of Reasoned Action, Motivational Model, Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the combined TAM-TPB, Model of Personal Computer, Innovation Diffusion, and Extended Social Cognitive Theory.

Despite its popularity in Industry 4.0, the UTAUT model does not address certain behavioral and technical challenges related to blockchain adoption. Therefore, expanding the existing model becomes imperative, including the incorporation of technology readiness37), trust51), compatibility52), awareness53), and subjective norms54) as supplementary exogenous factors in our research framework to anticipate blockchain technology adoption intentions.

Technology readiness, considered crucial in determining a company's information technology adoption, is influenced by factors such as conversion costs and compatibility with existing information systems and network technologies52). Adequate information technology infrastructure and skilled human resources facilitate the adoption of technologies like blockchain within businesses55). Awareness, reflecting one's knowledge or perception of technology, subjective norms indicating social influence, and compatibility with Libyan industries are also examined in this study.

Trust, identified as a significant factor impacting technology adoption, plays a major role in users' acceptance of new technologies, as observed in studies on cryptocurrency usage51), internet voting56), and e-government services57). In light of these considerations, a new framework is presented in this study, reflecting blockchain technology acceptance32) and its impact on the management operations of Libyan firms, incorporating elements from the aforementioned models.

The model incorporates the level of blockchain literacy as the moderating variable in the extended UTAUT model. The research is conducted to observe the differences by analyzing how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and other factors impact behavioral intentions in adopting financial technology within Pakistan across varying educational backgrounds.

Within the industrial landscape, the integration of blockchain technology is still in its early stages, with its full business potential yet to be realized. Despite the prevailing challenges, there is widespread agreement on the transformative potential of incorporating blockchain technology into processes58,59,60). Many businesses express concerns that delayed adoption of blockchain technology could lead to a loss of competitive advantage. The research model employed in this investigation is rooted in the UTAUT model, serving as the foundational theoretical framework. However, from a technological standpoint, there is a notable scarcity of skilled manpower, and numerous technical challenges associated with blockchain remain unaddressed60). Consequently, the model needs expansion to include technology readiness (TR), which functions as an indicator of individuals' comprehensive technological perspectives, motivators, and barriers37). Moreover, the model incorporates the constructs of personal innovativeness (PI), performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), and perceived security (PS).

Additionally, the model is enhanced by integrating the constructs of perceived trust (PT), technology compatibility (TC), and technology awareness (TA). The industrial adoption of blockchain technology is still in its initial phases, presenting various practical challenges that businesses must overcome to harness its advantages61). Users who harbor skepticism toward a particular technology are less inclined to experiment with it, regardless of its merits37).

This research aims to investigate the acceptance of blockchain technologies within Libyan industries. The study builds upon the UTAUT theory by incorporating additional constructs proposed by other scholars in the field of information technology adoption, leading to the development of a conceptual model. The research concludes that the adoption of blockchain technology is influenced by the UTAUT theory and insights from the literature review. Figure 1 illustrates the UTAUT model as proposed by50.

Performance Expectancy (PE), often associated with perceived profitability, refers to the degree to which an individual believes that using a particular system will enhance their job performance50,14). Extensive research consistently highlights PE as a key determinant of technology adoption, particularly in developing countries19,44). In the context of this study, PE reflects the confidence of employees in Libyan enterprises that implementing blockchain technology will improve their performance. Drawing on prior empirical evidence, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Performance Expectancy (PE) has a positive influence on users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

According to62, trust is defined as the willingness to accept vulnerability by embracing new and potentially risky ideas. In the context of emerging technologies, Perceived Trust (PT) has been identified as a critical factor influencing behavioral intention, particularly in domains such as artificial intelligence and e-commerce28). PT refers to having accurate expectations about others' actions when one must decide before those actions can be observed62). It reflects consumers' trust in adopting disruptive technologies and plays a key role in mitigating perceived risks63).

Evidence from developing countries consistently underscores the importance of PT in blockchain technology adoption64., for example, identified trust as a common enabler of blockchain adoption across several nations, including Bangladesh, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, by shaping users' attitudes. Similarly29, found that trust significantly influenced blockchain technology adoption decisions among accounting managers in Indian firms.

Based on this evidence, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Perceived Trust (PT) has a positive influence on users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Facilitating Conditions (FC) refer to the degree to which individuals perceive the availability of organizational and technological resources that support the use of a system50). Research has consistently identified FC as a key factor influencing behavioral intention toward technology adoption50,65,66,67). In the context of blockchain technology, FC encompasses access to critical resources such as infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutional support.

Several studies confirm the significant role of FC in encouraging blockchain technology adoption among developing firms, emphasizing that adequate technological infrastructure and technical support can motivate users to embrace such innovations63,68). However, the successful implementation of blockchain technology also requires careful alignment with business needs and the involvement of multiple stakeholders. When effectively integrated, blockchain technology can act as a seamless enabler within existing systems69).

Accordingly, this study proposes the following hypothesis:

Facilitating Conditions (FC) have a positive influence on users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Social norms refer to the extent to which individuals feel motivated by their peers and family members to use new technologies. Numerous studies have found a strong correlation between social norms and users' willingness to adopt blockchain technology. Research indicates that subjective norms positively affect behavioral intentions toward financial technologies70). For instance71, confirmed the encouraging effect of subjective norms on users' intentions to use cryptocurrency. However44, reported a significant impact of subjective norms on blockchain technology adoption. It has been suggested that social influence plays a vital role in users' intentions to adopt new technology, especially when information about that technology is scarce72).

Recent studies suggest that individuals within groups possessing technological expertise and financial literacy are more likely to adopt blockchain technology73,74).

Given the importance of social influence in technology adoption, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Subjective Norms (SN) have a positive influence on users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Regulatory support plays a significant role in influencing adoption behavior. Studies have shown that regulatory support influences the intention to adopt in developing countries28,75,76,72,21). Thus, addressing regulatory uncertainties, intellectual property issues, and compliance is a priority for blockchain technology adoption18). Regulatory support fosters trust and influences the infrastructure needed for blockchain technology adoption, thereby impacting technology readiness and supporting conditions77). According to76, the lack of regulations and clear laws in developing countries creates an environment of legal and economic uncertainty, which can discourage stakeholders in various industries from adopting blockchain technology78. point out the crucial role of regulatory support in the practical and theoretical advancement of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Thus, regulatory support can play a crucial role in defining industry standards for blockchain technology, ensuring interoperability between different blockchain platforms and energy systems, which is essential for its adoption21).

Based on this premise, the following hypothesis is posited:

Regulatory Support (RS) has a positive influence on users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Blockchain literacy refers to the comprehensive knowledge and skills required to effectively understand, operate, and manage blockchain technology systems. This includes familiarity with core concepts such as decentralized networks, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Recent studies emphasize that blockchain literacy, defined as the ability to make informed decisions in digital environments, is essential for navigating blockchain-based transactions79,80). Education enhances cognitive capabilities, enabling individuals to make better decisions regarding complex technologies.

24 highlight that individuals with higher financial literacy are more proficient in utilizing digital financial services. Similarly81, found that individuals with high cryptocurrency literacy make more informed decisions regarding usage, while79 reported that limited literacy leads to weaker decision-making in this area.

Despite blockchain's potential, its adoption in Libyan firms remains slow, largely due to cultural and educational barriers. Studies have shown that stakeholders in Libya often lack a clear understanding of advanced technologies, including blockchain82). This lack of awareness regarding the benefits and functions of such technologies contributes to resistance and delays in adoption.

In many emerging countries, blockchain technology is perceived as a disruptive and complex innovation, often generating skepticism. Without sufficient literacy, decision-makers may be hesitant to adopt the technology due to perceived risks or limited confidence in its implementation83).

Therefore, an individual's level of blockchain literacy is likely to influence how they perceive the usefulness and feasibility of adopting blockchain technology. It is thus posited that blockchain literacy moderates the relationship between the identified factors and behavioral intentions to adopt the technology. Based on this reasoning, the following hypotheses are proposed:

Blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationship between Performance Expectancy (PE) and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationship between Facilitating Conditions (FC) and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationship between Perceived Trust (PT) and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationship between Subjective Norms (SN) and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationship between Regulatory Support (RS) and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

Extended UTAUT model of blockchain technology adoption.

To understand the adoption of blockchain technology, data were collected through a structured survey administered to 172 managers from various Libyan firms, selected using purposive sampling to ensure relevant knowledge of technology adoption. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was then used to examine the relationships among the constructs in the extended research model (see Fig. 1). SEM was employed to test the proposed hypotheses and uncover significant relationships between the model's variables.

This study adopts a quantitative research approach using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via SmartPLS 4.0. PLS-SEM is appropriate for predictive modeling and theory development, especially in studies with moderate sample sizes, complex models involving multiple constructs and moderating effects, and non-normal data distributions84). This is particularly suitable for the exploratory nature of blockchain technology adoption in emerging markets like Libya.

The analysis followed a two-stage procedure. First, the measurement model was assessed to establish construct validity and reliability. This included evaluating the indicator reliability through factor loadings (retaining items with loadings ≥ 0.70), internal consistency reliability via Composite Reliability (CR), Cronbach's alpha, and rho_A (threshold ≥ 0.70), convergent validity using Average Variance Extracted (AVE ≥ 0.50), and discriminant validity through the Fornell–Larcker criterion and Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio (HTMT < 0.85).

Second, the structural model was analyzed to test the hypothesized relationships. Path coefficients (β), t-values, and p-values were generated using bootstrapping with 5,000 subsamples (bias-corrected and accelerated method). Predictive relevance was assessed using the Stone-Geisser Q² test, and overall model fit was evaluated using the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), with SRMR < 0.08 indicating good fit.

Additionally, moderation effects of blockchain literacy were tested using the two-stage approach, which involved creating interaction terms and assessing their significance and effect sizes (f²). All constructs were measured reflectively using previously validated items from existing literature, adapted to the Libyan context, and rated on a 5-point Likert scale.

This quantitative strategy enables a robust evaluation of the proposed model and allows for the identification of significant predictors of blockchain technology adoption intention in the Libyan oil industry context.

Surveys provide a practical and cost-effective method for gathering information and applying statistical methods to analyze relationships between various variables. Therefore, we developed the questionnaire following a thorough literature review to identify the constructs and scales necessary for testing the proposed hypotheses. The constructs and items were drawn primarily from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)50) and extended with elements from recent empirical studies focused on blockchain adoption in organizational and emerging market contexts.

Each construct was measured using a multi-item scale with responses captured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”) (see Table 1). Items were selected based on their proven reliability and relevance, then adapted to reflect the blockchain context and the organizational environment of Libyan oil firms. For example, references to digital ledgers, smart contracts, and operational transparency were integrated to reflect blockchain-specific functionalities relevant to the industry.

To ensure content validity and contextual appropriateness, the survey instrument was pre-tested by three academic experts in the field of technology adoption. Additionally, six managers from Libyan oil companies reviewed the questionnaire. Based on their feedback, we made minor modifications to improve wording clarity, cultural relevance, and ease of understanding for professionals with varying technical backgrounds.

The recent emergence of advanced technologies in Libya has provided a suitable backdrop for this study. The country has developed a strategy to harness new technologies in industry and has implemented programs aimed at encouraging the adoption of emerging technologies to enhance decision-making processes and organizational skill sets. Libya is progressing toward digital transformation by supporting the adoption of new technologies, such as blockchain. Therefore, this research focuses on exploring the factors influencing user acceptance of blockchain technology to optimize operational efficiency and decision-making speed.

To collect data, we used a purposive sampling technique targeting managers with direct or indirect involvement in technology-related decisions within the Libyan oil sector. While this non-probabilistic sampling method was appropriate for reaching informed participants with relevant expertise, it may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population of Libyan firms. This potential sampling bias is acknowledged as a limitation and should be considered when interpreting the study's results.

Participants were identified through professional networks, company directories, and referrals from industry contacts. The online questionnaire was distributed via email and professional platforms such as LinkedIn between November 2023 and January 2024. Inclusion criteria required respondents to hold managerial or technical roles and have at least one year of experience within their current organization.

The respondents consisted of various managers from companies operating in the Libyan oil industry (see Table 2). To determine the minimum required sample size, we conducted a power analysis using the G*Power method. Based on a multiple regression model with a medium effect size (f² = 0.15), five predictors, a significance level of 0.05, and a desired statistical power of 0.95, the recommended minimum sample size was 186 respondents. Based on our online survey, we received 342 valid responses between November 2023 and January 2024. This sample size not only exceeds the G*Power threshold but also meets the requirements of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), which recommends that the sample be at least 10 times the maximum number of structural paths pointing at any latent construct84). Accordingly, the final sample size is considered robust and appropriate for the study's analytical objectives.

The sample includes a diverse age range, with 17% aged 30–34 years, 23% aged 35–39 years, 45% aged 40–44 years, 5% aged 45–49 years, and 10% aged 50 years or older. Regarding gender distribution, 17% of respondents were female and 83% male. Participants held various managerial roles, including production directors (29%), marketing directors (15.29%), financial directors (14%), human resource directors (50%), and information technology engineers (2%). In terms of involvement with technology purchase decisions, 50% of respondents reported being involved in decision-making, 31% in recommending technology, 17% in both recommending and decision-making, while 2% indicated no involvement. Regarding education, most respondents held a bachelor's degree (approximately 65%), while around 30% possessed postgraduate degrees (master's or PhD), and the remaining 5% had diplomas or technical certifications. As for income level, about 10% of respondents reported low income, 55% middle income, 25% upper-middle income, and 10% high income, reflecting the varied managerial and technical roles across the Libyan oil sector.

All methods in this study were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Economics and Management of Sfax. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their involvement in the study.

Before presenting the results, we briefly outline the theoretical framework guiding this study, which is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This model assumes that users' behavioral intention (BI) to adopt a technology is influenced by four main constructs: Performance Expectancy (PE), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Subjective Norms (SN), and Effort Expectancy (EE). In this study, we extend the traditional UTAUT model by incorporating Perceived Trust (PT), Regulatory Support (RS), and Blockchain Literacy (BL), which reflects the user's ability to understand and engage with blockchain systems. Behavioral intention (BI), the main dependent variable, represents the likelihood that a respondent intends to adopt blockchain technology in their organization.

To mitigate the possible issue of Common Method Bias (CMB), which refers to measurement error that can occur when data for both independent and dependent variables are collected from the same source, we implemented both procedural and statistical remedies.

Procedurally, we reduced CMB risk by ensuring anonymity of responses, randomizing item order in the questionnaire, and clearly separating constructs conceptually and operationally in the survey design. These steps were taken to minimize respondents' evaluation apprehension and the likelihood of consistency motifs.

Statistically, we applied Harman's single-factor test, one of the most widely used post hoc diagnostic tools. All measurement items were entered into an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal component analysis. The results in Table 3 revealed that the first unrotated factor accounted for 43.52% of the total variance, which is below the commonly accepted threshold of 50%, indicating that no single factor emerged to dominate the variance. This suggests that Common Method Bias is unlikely to pose a significant threat to the validity of our results85).

We assessed the validity and reliability of the outer measurement model following the methodology outlined by84. Initially, we used composite reliability (CR) and rho (pA) to evaluate construct reliability, drawing on prior research. The analysis revealed that all values exceeded the threshold of 0.7 for both indices, indicating strong reliability of the measurement model86) (see Table 4).

Subsequently, we employed average variance extracted (AVE) and individual factor loadings (FL) to examine convergent validity. As shown in Table 4, all AVE values for the constructs exceeded 50%, as recommended by87.

Furthermore, all factor loadings (FL) reported in Table 5, ranging from 0.70 to 0.97, exceed the recommended cut-off value of 0.7, providing evidence in favor of convergent validity88). The results also confirmed discriminant validity, as indicated by the square root of the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each construct on the diagonal being greater than the correlation coefficients with other constructs89).

The AVE for the construct “Behavior Intention,” with a value of 0.736, is the lowest among all constructs, yet it still exceeds the minimum threshold of 50%. Moreover, all factor loadings presented in Table 5, ranging from 0.88 to 0.97, surpass the recommended cut-off value of 0.7, thereby supporting convergent validity88).

Discriminant validity (DV) was evaluated in Table 6 using the TMT criteria.

To ensure the robustness of the measurement model, we assessed multicollinearity among the predictor constructs by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values in Table 7. All VIFs were found to be below the commonly accepted threshold of 5, indicating that multicollinearity is not a concern in this study84). This suggests that the predictor variables are sufficiently independent to provide reliable estimates in the structural model.

The results of the hypotheses testing highlight that FC was positively related to BI (β = 0.063, t = 0.589). However, H1 is not supported in this study. Consistent with our hypothesis, the results show that perceived trust, facilitating conditions, subjective norms, and regulatory support respectively positively impact BI (β = 0.199, t = 1.98), (β = 0.185, t = 4.65), (β = 0.35, t = 2.56), and (β = 0.112, t = 4.746). Thus, H2, H3, H4, and H5 are supported.

Furthermore, as shown in Table 8, blockchain literacy positively moderates the relationships between facilitating conditions, perceived trust, subjective norms, and regulatory support, respectively (β = 0.115, t = 1.962), (β = 0.162, t = 2.553), (β = 0.120, t = 1.972), and (β = 0.001, t = 1.995). Thus, H7, H8, H9, and H10 are supported. However, no moderating effect was found on the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention (β = 0.087, t = 1.700).

We examined the predictive capacity of the model using Stone-Geisser's Q² value (Geisser, 1974). The value for BI in this study is 0.231, which exceeds zero. According to the rule of thumb, a Q² value greater than zero indicates that the model has predictive relevance87). Finally, the ten quality indices indicate that the model fits the data well, as they fall within the range of generally accepted benchmarks for model fit85). These indices align with the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) criterion for approximate model fit. The SRMR value of 0.089 in this study indicates a good fit for the PLS path model.

The current study aims to explore the extended UTAUT model by incorporating new dimensions, such as perceived trust and regulatory support, as independent variables. This research develops an innovative modified conceptual framework of the extended UTAUT model to examine blockchain technology adoption in Libyan oil firms, utilizing an additional moderating variable. The model was built around ten hypotheses (H1-H10) and aimed to understand how various enablers, with the moderation of blockchain literacy, influence managers' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology.

The results clearly illustrate how Libya's unique cultural and regulatory context shapes blockchain technology adoption differently compared to other emerging economies. Libya's relatively low digital maturity, combined with a conservative organizational culture and limited familiarity with blockchain technology among oil firm managers, contributes to the non-significance of performance expectancy (PE) as a predictor of behavioral intention (BI). Prior studies indicate that in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance and risk aversion, such as Libya90,91), technological innovations often face resistance due to skepticism and a preference for traditional methods. Moreover, weak institutional support and fragmented regulatory frameworks exacerbate these challenges92). Unlike countries like Nigeria or Vietnam, where PE strongly influences adoption decisions due to greater digital infrastructure and supportive policies93), Libyan firms struggle with internal barriers, including a lack of knowledge, insufficient training, and inadequate organizational readiness94).

However, as shown in Table 5, PE was found to be an insignificant predictor of BI in our sample, diverging from most previous research, which suggests that performance expectancy positively impacts users' behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology in management operations (e.g93,14.,). Thus, Hypothesis H1, which posited a positive relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention, was not supported. According to19, successful blockchain technology integration in developing countries requires a thorough understanding and careful planning, particularly due to internal barriers, such as a lack of knowledge in implementing advanced technologies. Our results reflect that the majority of respondents do not have sufficient knowledge of blockchain technology. Therefore, awareness of the benefits of blockchain technology may influence decision-makers' ability to comprehend and value its usefulness79).

Conversely, facilitating conditions (FC) were identified as a significant influencer of the intention to adopt blockchain technology. This finding supports recent research on blockchain technology adoption, which considered FC as an important strategic factor influencing behavioral intention in adopting blockchain technology69,93). This supports Hypothesis H3. The model was further expanded to incorporate regulatory support (RS) and perceived trust (PT), which were also observed to have a significant impact. This aligns with prior studies that have found trust and regulatory support to be critical components of blockchain technology adoption in industrial contexts28,18,75). Therefore, Hypotheses H2 and H5 were supported.

The significant roles of RS and PT highlight Libya's urgent need for clear, stable policies and institutional backing to foster innovation adoption. Regulatory uncertainty and infrastructural constraints remain key hurdles, as blockchain technologies require robust legal frameworks to protect data privacy and ensure consumer protection89). Given Libya's nascent digital infrastructure and evolving regulatory landscape, these factors create barriers to widespread blockchain technology implementation.

Authors assert that the adoption and successful implementation of blockchain technologies necessitate a deep understanding of the blockchain technology system, owing to the presence of intra-organizational barriers such as a lack of expertise and knowledge, as well as insufficient tools for blockchain technology implementation95,79). Among respondents in this survey, the majority reported limited knowledge about blockchain, underscoring the need for targeted educational efforts.

Despite its theoretical relevance, blockchain literacy (BL) was not found to be a significant direct predictor of behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology. As a result, Hypothesis H6 was not supported. One plausible explanation is that while literacy enhances understanding and confidence, it may not be sufficient on its own to influence decision-making unless accompanied by enabling organizational or institutional support. In the context of Libya's oil sector, where decision hierarchies are rigid and risk aversion is high, individual knowledge does not necessarily translate into action unless reinforced by external factors like peer pressure, trust, and supportive regulations. This finding aligns with research suggesting that in environments with weak digital ecosystems, individual awareness must be coupled with structural facilitators to convert intention into action44,79).

In the same vein, subjective norms appeared to significantly affect the prediction of behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology in Libyan firms, supporting prior research conducted in developing countries (e.g73,74,44,72.,). This confirms Hypothesis H4. Our findings suggest that blockchain technology users in African countries influence behavior toward blockchain adoption in the Libyan context, reinforcing the role of cultural and peer influences in technology adoption decisions.

Furthermore, organizational policies play a crucial role in the usage of blockchain technologies, which are still in their early stages. Proper regulations and policies remain hurdles to the adoption of advanced technologies42). Libyan regulators need to address the differences between regulatory regimes and the advancement of technologies, particularly regarding data protection and consumer protection89). BC technology is still immature in supporting large transaction volumes96), and since it typically involves a large number of diverse stakeholders, there is a need for appropriate standards for the successful integration of these technologies into management operations.

Conversely, companies that successfully build on their understanding of blockchain technology will be able to leverage its capabilities to complement and augment their analytics capabilities. The absence of proper regulations and policies presents a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of advanced technologies97). In Libya, regulators face the challenge of reconciling regulatory frameworks with the rapid advancement of technologies, particularly concerning areas such as data protection89). Additionally, blockchain technology is currently underdeveloped in handling large operations and transactions98). Given that BC implementations typically involve numerous stakeholders with diverse interests, establishing appropriate standards is essential for seamless integration into existing management operations. Constraints on technology access pose a significant barrier to blockchain technology implementation in management operations.

Importantly, when drawing comparisons with other oil-rich or MENA countries, it becomes clear that Libya lags in blockchain readiness. For example, the UAE's “Blockchain Strategy 2021” and Saudi Arabia's partnerships with firms like IBM have fostered a proactive environment for blockchain adoption. These countries have not only invested in digital infrastructure but have also introduced forward-thinking regulatory frameworks that inspire industry confidence. Similarly, Iraq and Algeria, despite facing structural constraints, have initiated pilot projects to explore blockchain applications in their public and energy sectors. In contrast, Libya's limited institutional coordination and policy vision present major bottlenecks. These comparisons reinforce the policy implication that national strategies, cross-sector partnerships, and regulatory clarity are foundational pillars for successful blockchain adoption. Libya can learn from its regional peers by adopting similar top-down approaches that integrate blockchain literacy programs, regulatory reforms, and stakeholder engagement platforms to build a viable adoption ecosystem.

Finally, our results confirmed the moderating influence of blockchain literacy (BL) on the relationships between facilitating conditions (β = 0.115, t = 1.962), perceived trust (β = 0.162, t = 2.553), subjective norms (β = 0.120, t = 1.972), and regulatory support (β = 0.001, t = 1.995) in adopting blockchain technology. This supports Hypotheses H7, H8, H9, and H10. The results imply that the more individuals become blockchain literate, the better they comprehend the security of its operations and become motivated by their colleagues regarding blockchain technology, ultimately enhancing their behavioral intention to use this technology. This outcome broadens existing knowledge on the effect of blockchain literacy and the influential factors of behavioral intention to use blockchain, emphasizing the critical need for capacity-building and awareness programs tailored to Libya's cultural and educational context.

The moderating effect of blockchain literacy underscores its pivotal role in enhancing the impact of facilitating conditions, perceived trust, subjective norms, and regulatory support on blockchain technology adoption intentions. As individuals gain deeper literacy, they not only understand blockchain's technical security features better but also become more receptive to peer influences and institutional support, which collectively strengthen their willingness to adopt the technology. This dynamic indicates that blockchain literacy acts as a catalyst that transforms external factors into actionable motivation, especially in contexts like Libya, where organizational hierarchies and risk-averse cultures might otherwise dampen technology acceptance.

From a practical standpoint, these findings highlight the need for targeted educational programs and capacity-building initiatives within firms and across the broader industry. Enhancing blockchain literacy can empower employees and decision-makers to better evaluate blockchain's benefits and risks, thereby fostering a more favorable environment for adoption. Moreover, literacy serves as a critical link that can mitigate the inertia caused by regulatory uncertainties and infrastructural weaknesses by equipping users with the knowledge required to navigate and advocate for supportive policies.

Theoretically, this research contributes to the UTAUT model literature by validating blockchain literacy as a significant moderator, which enriches our understanding of technology adoption in emerging markets with low digital maturity. Future research could further explore how different dimensions of literacy, such as technical know-how, strategic understanding, and legal awareness, uniquely influence adoption behaviors.

Overall, recognizing and investing in blockchain literacy is essential for accelerating blockchain technology diffusion in Libya's oil sector and similar contexts, transforming hesitant interest into confident and informed usage.

The outcomes of this study have contributed to the existing literature on new technology adoption, particularly in the context of blockchain technology usage in emerging nations, by expanding the understanding of the factors that affect the intention to adopt blockchain.

Existing literature on blockchain technology adoption has predominantly been conducted from the TAM perspective (e.g37)., or the standard UTAUT model (e.g29).,. The current study extends the UTAUT model by proposing and confirming regulatory support and perceived trust as reformulated influential factors in blockchain technology adoption behavior. The behavior of managers in oil firms regarding blockchain adoption is rational and requires regulatory support, facilitating conditions, subjective norms, and perceived trust.

Therefore, we propose that the intention of managers in Libyan firms to adopt blockchain technology is a planned behavior, influenced by factors such as perceived trust (PT), facilitating conditions (FC), subjective norms (SN), regulatory support (RS), and blockchain literacy (BL).

This study also enriches the literature by incorporating blockchain literacy as a moderating factor within the extended UTAUT model. This integration provides a deeper understanding of how various factors influence managers' intentions to engage with blockchain, ultimately redefining the nature of management operations.

Our study validates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) in explaining the behavioral intentions of managers in oil and gas firms. More specifically, our research introduces and validates a modified version of the UTAUT model in the Libyan context50).

By highlighting the significance of blockchain literacy in technology adoption behaviors within the Libyan context, this addition strengthens the theoretical model.

Thus, blockchain literacy appears to be a crucial factor that could act as a moderator of blockchain adoption behavior in Libyan oil companies. Consequently, a high level of understanding and knowledge regarding the performance and role of blockchain technology could motivate decision-makers to adopt this technology in their management operations.

Indeed, Libya appears to be significantly behind in blockchain literacy compared to other developing countries such as Nigeria, Vietnam, India, and the UAE. Studies conducted in these countries have shown that performance expectancy is a key factor in the adoption of this technology99,48,100).

In contrast to our findings, managers of petroleum firms in Libya are not yet aware of blockchain's performance and strategic role. This highlights the technological lag in Libya. Our findings align with82, who emphasizes that the lack of digital literacy in Libyan firms is a crucial barrier to adopting new technologies.

Consequently, our study provides valuable guidance for policymakers and blockchain technology developers to design effective strategies that foster blockchain adoption in the Libyan oil and gas industry, an area where empirical research is notably scarce and difficult to access due to the sensitivity of information.

The results of this research provide concrete, actionable insights for practitioners in Libyan oil and gas firms and policymakers aiming to foster blockchain technology adoption. By identifying the key drivers and barriers to adoption, including facilitating conditions (H3), perceived trust (H2), regulatory support (H5), and blockchain literacy (H6-H10), this study equips managers with targeted areas to focus on. For instance, firms can develop tailored training programs to enhance blockchain literacy, invest strategically in technological infrastructure, and collaborate with regulators to shape supportive policies. These managerial recommendations are grounded in the empirical validation of H2 through H5, reinforcing the critical role these factors play in shaping behavioral intention. Policymakers can also leverage these insights to design regulatory frameworks and awareness campaigns that remove obstacles and promote a trustworthy environment for blockchain integration. Thus, this study bridges theory and practice by offering clear guidance on how to translate behavioral intention drivers into effective managerial strategies and policy actions.

This research aims to clarify the intention to adopt blockchain technology in oil and gas companies, offering valuable insights to help managers make informed decisions about its implementation. Specifically, the study provides evidence on how decision-makers can effectively address the key factors that facilitate blockchain technology integration into operational management.

In our study, the impact of Performance Expectancy (PE) was found to be insignificant. Thus, the majority of respondents expressed uncertainty regarding the use of blockchain technology within their firms. This indicates that participants do not perceive blockchain technology as crucial for management operations. Consequently, when making decisions about adopting blockchain technology, managers should prioritize understanding users' competencies with this new technology and its applications.

This lack of recognition may stem from limited knowledge and a reluctance among Libyan managers to adopt new, advanced systems101). In fact, the organizational culture in Libya is characterized by resistance to change, particularly in relation to complex and advanced technologies. Organizations tend to favor established, traditional solutions over the adoption of emerging technologies such as blockchain, often due to perceived risks associated with innovation102).

Given this, it is recommended that managers in the oil and gas industry focus on strategies such as training and education to improve the understanding and competencies of key personnel regarding blockchain applications48). Furthermore, managers should facilitate the transfer of successful experiences from developing countries in the petroleum industry (e.g., Brazil, Nigeria, India) to key users of blockchain technology in Libyan firms to enhance their perception of its usefulness and strategic benefits. These initiatives will foster a greater appreciation of blockchain's role in management operations.

Enhance blockchain literacy (aligned with H6-H10): Launch structured training programs and awareness campaigns in collaboration with universities, technology providers, and industry experts to build internal capabilities and reduce resistance to blockchain technology usage.

Facilitate knowledge transfer (linked to H2 and H4): Organize workshops and exchange programs to learn from successful blockchain technology implementation in comparable oil-rich developing countries.

These capacity-building initiatives directly address the empirical findings showing the moderating role of blockchain literacy (H6-H10), the significance of perceived trust (H2), and the impact of subjective norms (H4) on behavioral intention. Improving user competencies can empower managers to better understand and trust the technology.

Invest in technical infrastructure (supports H3): Allocate resources to upgrade IT infrastructure and ensure compatibility with blockchain-based systems, especially in supply chain management.

Strengthen perceived trust and security (supports H2): Collaborate with cybersecurity providers to secure blockchain technology operations and communicate these safeguards transparently to increase employee trust.

Encourage top management support: Senior executives should take ownership of blockchain technology initiatives by aligning them with strategic goals, allocating sufficient resources, and communicating their importance across all departments.

These infrastructure-related recommendations are aligned with the significant roles of Facilitating Conditions (H3) and Perceived Trust (H2) identified in the study's findings.

Engage regulatory stakeholders (aligned with H5): Actively work with government bodies to develop a supportive regulatory environment that facilitates blockchain technology adoption and provides legal certainty for digital transactions.

Form strategic partnerships (linked to H4 and H5): Establish collaborations or consortia with blockchain solution providers, public institutions, and other firms in the sector to share costs, expertise, and implementation strategies.

These recommendations reflect the importance of Regulatory Support (H5) and Subjective Norms (H4) as critical drivers of adoption identified through empirical testing.

Based on this, a key implication is that top management in Libyan oil firms must invest more effort to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the implementation of blockchain technology in management operations. Our study identified that Facilitating Conditions (H3), Subjective Norms (H4), Perceived Trust (H2), and Regulatory Support (H5) influence the adoption of blockchain technology in management operations. Therefore, the behavioral intention of Libyan oil firms primarily depends on whether they possess the required infrastructure, receive positive influence from key personnel, and have regulatory support to explore these new technologies.

The hindrances caused by the absence of tools for blockchain technology implementation and the lack of awareness about its usefulness in management processes have been studied as barriers to blockchain technology adoption95). Therefore, companies aiming to harness the benefits of blockchain technology in management operations must prioritize raising awareness about this system and developing the expertise and interest necessary for successful implementation.

However, when managers perceive blockchain technology operations as secure and efficient for digital financial dealings, they are inclined to trust its long-term utility103). To enhance its adoption level, firms should improve the security of blockchain operations.

It is also important to provide legal certainty for those who wish to use blockchain technologies. Therefore, the Libyan government should implement policies that encourage the use of blockchain technology for tracking oil and gas resources from extraction to delivery and for expanding the supply chain in international markets. This can reduce fraud, improve accountability, and enhance transparency in operations. Furthermore, strategies should be established to encourage collaboration between government bodies, oil and gas firms, and technology providers. A regulatory framework that supports joint ventures, knowledge sharing, and cross-industry partnerships can also accelerate blockchain technology adoption in the Libyan context. This would not only enhance the positive perception that key users should have of the use of blockchain technology but also ensure security.

In summary, blockchain technology is widely discussed and holds the potential to revolutionize data management, potentially leading to the emergence of new management models. However, predicting its successful implementation remains challenging. Based on the findings of this study, there is still a low level of awareness among users, contributing to considerable doubt regarding blockchain technology. Furthermore, blockchain literacy seems to be a potential moderator of the associations between facilitating conditions, social influence, perceived trust, regulatory support, and behavioral intention to adopt blockchain.

Thus, developing blockchain literacy could empower managers to evaluate financial technologies and make informed decisions regarding blockchain technology adoption. Therefore, industrial firms in Libya should enhance their blockchain literacy to improve their ability to make better decisions regarding blockchain usage. The Libyan government and firms should introduce policies to provide training programs for employees in blockchain technology. This should include partnerships with universities, technology providers, and oil and gas industry experts to build a skilled workforce, enabling them to understand the strategic benefits of blockchain in petroleum operations and accelerate its adoption.

In this vein, the government also needs to develop national strategies to raise users' awareness of the benefits of blockchain technology, improve their blockchain skills, and encourage the use of cryptocurrency as an alternative means of financial transactions.

This study explores the factors influencing the behavioral intention of Libyan managers to adopt blockchain technology in management operations using an extended adoption model. However, its adoption is still limited by the assumption that respondents have a certain degree of familiarity with blockchain technology. Despite considerable hype and discussion about blockchain in African and MENA countries, there has been little validation regarding managers' perceptions and knowledge of blockchain technology. Furthermore, practical experience and implementation among Libyan oil firms face several organizational barriers. Therefore, we suggest that successful blockchain technology adoption in the Libyan context requires integration both from within and among organizational parties. These findings have significant implications. Thus, our proposed model offers insights into the new application of a unified theory of acceptance technology based on a novel extension of the UTAUT model. Our results also identify the key antecedents to blockchain adoption in oil and gas firms.

Hence, the behavioral intention to adopt blockchain technology in these firms is planned behavior that requires subjective norms, facilitating conditions, perceived trust, and regulatory support.

Importantly, a key theoretical contribution of this research lies in the identification and empirical validation of blockchain literacy as a moderating variable. Our findings highlight the role of blockchain literacy as a moderator in the relationship between the key enablers of blockchain and the intention to adopt it. The moderating role of blockchain literacy is considered original in studies conducted in developing countries. Its inclusion in the model strengthens the understanding of how individual-level capabilities interact with organizational and environmental factors. Blockchain literacy enhances or weakens the impact of perceived trust, facilitating conditions, regulatory support, and social influence, depending on the user's knowledge and familiarity with the technology. This makes it a critical variable to consider when analyzing behavioral intention in low-literacy or early-stage adoption environments.

By demonstrating that blockchain literacy amplifies the effectiveness of the primary adoption drivers, this study provides practical insight for managers and policymakers seeking to accelerate blockchain diffusion in similar settings. Consequently, the more individuals become blockchain literate, the better they comprehend the benefits of blockchain technology and its security, and they become motivated by their colleagues and partners to engage in digital financial operations.

The Libyan government should empower the oil and gas sector, along with other relevant industries where appropriate, to effectively integrate blockchain technology into their management operations in order to expand their partnerships and supply chains in international markets. Therefore, policymakers should enhance blockchain literacy through education, training, and awareness campaigns, which could significantly boost the adoption of blockchain in Libya's oil and gas industry, contributing to modernization and increased efficiency across various sectors.

This outcome broadens the existing knowledge on the effect of blockchain literacy and highlights the influential factors of behavioral intention to use blockchain in one emerging Arab economy, specifically within the context of Libya's oil and gas sector.

This study identifies key factors affecting managers' behavioral intentions toward blockchain technology in the Libyan oil industry. However, several limitations should be acknowledged for transparency and to guide future research efforts.

First, the study employed a cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to observe changes in behavioral intentions over time. Second, the extended UTAUT model was validated specifically within petroleum firms in Libya, a context that has been rarely addressed in the literature. While this enhances the novelty of the study, it limits the generalizability of the findings to other industries or regions. Third, the study did not examine the potential mediating effects of any variables, which could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms influencing adoption behavior. Finally, the use of a non-probabilistic sampling method, though suitable given the data collection constraints in Libya, may introduce selection bias. As such, caution is warranted when generalizing the findings to the broader population of firms.

To build on the present findings, future studies should consider adopting a longitudinal design to capture the dynamic evolution of blockchain adoption behavior over time. Researchers are also encouraged to test the proposed extended UTAUT model in other sectors and in different developing countries to enhance external validity and enable comparative analysis.

Further work could incorporate mediating variables such as perceived security or national culture, as well as additional moderators like perceived risk, organizational readiness, or top management support. Exploring these elements may offer a more comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping behavioral intention.

Experimental or quasi-experimental designs could also be employed to evaluate the effects of interventions, such as blockchain training programs or changes in regulatory frameworks, on adoption behavior. In addition, future research should use probability-based sampling techniques and expand sample sizes across various industries or geographic areas to improve representativeness.

Lastly, qualitative methods such as interviews, focus groups, or case studies are recommended to provide richer insights into the contextual and organizational barriers affecting blockchain implementation. These approaches would complement the quantitative results by uncovering deeper managerial perceptions, organizational culture, and structural challenges.

This is particularly important in Libya's unique sociopolitical environment, which is characterized by institutional uncertainty, regulatory fragmentation, and cultural resistance to technological change. In such a context, qualitative methods can capture the nuanced realities of decision-making, interpersonal dynamics, and informal practices that shape adoption behavior, factors that are often difficult to quantify. These methods also allow researchers to explore how managers within specific organizational and political conditions interpret trust, risk, and technological unfamiliarity.

“Data availability: The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available because they were personally collected using a questionnaire sent to managers in Libyan oil and gas firms but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.”

Canada, with its more unified and predictable regulatory environment, presents a different landscape than the United States, which offers a more diverse — and at times more permissive — legal patchwork. A business in Canada has a clear sense of what to expect from the federal government, whereas in the U.S., a company can strategically choose a state whose regulations are perfectly tailored to its operations, potentially allowing it to bypass some of the federal regulatory burden. Ultimately, the immense size of the U.S. market, coupled with its deep pools of venture capital and talent, solidifies its status as a premier destination, despite its regulatory complexities.

Canada has a more centralized and coordinated approach to crypto regulation compared to the U.S., primarily driven by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). While this can lead to stricter compliance requirements, it also provides a clearer, more predictable environment for large-scale operations.

Because of the federal ambiguity, many states have taken the lead in crafting their laws to attract blockchain and crypto companies. This has created a competitive landscape where some states have emerged as clear leaders.

Canada presents a more unified and predictable regulatory environment, whereas the US offers a more varied and occasionally more permissive legal landscape. In Canada, a business has a clear understanding of federal expectations. By contrast, a company in the US can strategically pick a state whose regulations perfectly suit its operations, potentially sidestepping some federal compliance issues. Ultimately, the US market's immense size, along with its vast pools of venture capital and talent, solidifies its position as a top destination, despite its complex regulations.

Navigating the regulatory landscape for a crypto business in North America is a complex undertaking. Unlike other global regions that might offer a single, cohesive framework, the continent presents a highly fragmented and constantly shifting set of rules. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. A company looking to set up shop here must understand the core differences between the United States, with its decentralized and state-driven approach, and Canada's more centralized, and often more predictable, regulatory system. Making the right choice isn't just about picking a location; it's a strategic decision that will define legal risks, tax obligations, and your long-term path to success.

The madness of this past week almost smokescreened some headlines out of the EVE Online titles, but we're too clever for that. Too keen. Too well-trained in the art of gamesjutsu. Even so, these are some comparatively smaller things of note, but we shall note them. Again, we practice the art of gamesjutsu.

Leading things off is a developer roundtable for EVE that primarily focuses on its recent visual updates that added smoke and fire and lighting improvements. Some of this is perhaps understandably self-congratulatory, but it also takes a closer look at how these visual updates came to be. There's also a bunch of talk about little fire extinguishing drones that arrive when a burning ship docks at a station.



Meanwhile over in the blockchain MMO EVE Frontier, the backend issues have officially been solved and the game's Cycle 2 update went live this week as scheduled. Much of this update's focus is on stability, quality-of-life, and the introduction of a couple of new buildable items. All of the salient details are sitting in the patch notes.

The non-fungible token (NFT) market has shown significant sales volume over the past week, with $2.8 million in sales. The data shared by Phoenix and DappRadar analysis reveals that CryptoPunks are entirely leading the NFT landscape.  Significantly, CryptoPunk #1082, CryptoPunk #2596, CryptoPunk #5477, and other CryptoPunks have marked top positions.

TOP #NFT SALES IN THE LAST 7D       Among the largest sales in the last 7D are:#CryptoPunksLargest Sale: CryptoPunk #1082 – $348.40K pic.twitter.com/DhBw5j9qtx

 CryptoPunk #1082 has shown the highest transactions, sold for 80 $ETH worth around $348.40K and has secured the top position. CryptoPunk #2596 is following closely with weekly sales volume of 73 $ETH which is worth around 315.20K along with CryptoPunk #5477 sold for 66 $ETH valued $280.98K. These uncommon sales indicate the premium sales despite the fluctuations in the crypto and NFT market and show the growing demand for digital art.

Other notable weekly sales include a few other non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including CryptoPunk #3704, CryptoPunk #8864, and CryptoPunk #9120 which sold for 63 $ETH, 56.5 $ETH, and 61.5 $ETH respectively. Along with these NFTs, four other CryptoPunks showed outstanding weekly sales, which were worth around $1,031.37K.

These significant sales of the CryptoPunks over the past week show the enduring influence, growing demand of CryptoPunks, and have proven to be the cornerstone in the NFT market. Their consistent sales and demand signal the investors' confidence in such NFT collections that continue to hold cultural and financial weight in the Web3 space.

Over the last couple of years, CryptoPunks have remained the strong and best performing NFT collections. And, the weekly sales volume of CryptoPunks underscore their role as both digital art as well as a store of value withing the evolving non-fungible token (NFT) landscape.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- The ECB accelerates its digital euro launch to 2025, prioritizing public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana for global interoperability and financial sovereignty.

- Public blockchain adoption aims to reduce reliance on U.S. dollar stablecoins and counter U.S. financial dominance through decentralized infrastructure.

- Ethereum's smart contracts and Solana's scalability position them as institutional-grade platforms, potentially boosting crypto market capitalization through CBDC integration.

- Privacy concerns are addressed via zero-knowledge proofs, aligning with GDPR while enabling private transactions on public blockchains.

- Institutional adoption of Ethereum/Solana infrastructure could surge, creating investment opportunities in staking, DeFi, and cross-chain solutions by late 2025.

The European Union's digital euro project is no longer a distant experiment. By 2025, the European Central Bank (ECB) has accelerated its timeline to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could redefine the global financial landscape. At the heart of this transformation lies a critical decision: whether to anchor the digital euro on public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. This shift—from private, permissioned systems to open, decentralized infrastructure—has profound implications for institutional adoption of blockchain technology and the future of crypto market capitalization.  

The ECB's pivot to public blockchains is driven by three pillars: interoperability, financial sovereignty, and scalability. Public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana offer open, censorship-resistant networks that align with the EU's goal of reducing reliance on U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, which dominate 98% of the stablecoin market. By leveraging Ethereum's robust smart contract ecosystem and Solana's high-speed, low-cost transactions (50,000+ transactions per second), the digital euro could become a globally interoperable CBDC, seamlessly integrated with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and cross-border payment systems.  

Ethereum's maturity and developer community provide a proven foundation for secure, programmable money, while Solana's efficiency makes it ideal for high-volume retail transactions. The ECB's exploration of hybrid models—combining public blockchains with privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)—further underscores its commitment to balancing transparency with user privacy. This approach could set a precedent for other CBDCs, positioning Ethereum and Solana as institutional-grade infrastructure.  

The U.S. Genius Act of 2025, which established regulatory clarity for stablecoins, has intensified European urgency to act. Meanwhile, U.S. policies banning CBDCs and promoting a strategic Bitcoin reserve have pushed the EU to accelerate its digital euro timeline. A public blockchain-based CBDC would not only counter U.S. financial dominance but also create a sovereign alternative to China's tightly controlled digital yuan.  

For investors, this represents a pivotal moment. If the ECB adopts Ethereum or Solana, it would validate these blockchains as critical infrastructure for institutional finance. This could trigger a surge in institutional adoption, driving up demand for staking, governance participation, and enterprise solutions on these networks.  

Privacy remains a key concern. The ECB has emphasized that user data will remain with commercial banks, not the central bank, to comply with GDPR and preserve cash-like anonymity. However, public blockchains inherently expose transaction data to broader scrutiny. The ECB's proposed use of ZKPs—a technology already being tested by projects like Aztec Protocol—could resolve this tension, enabling private transactions while maintaining regulatory compliance.  

The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, enacted in 2023, has already positioned Ethereum and Solana as “institutional-grade” platforms by aligning them with regulatory standards. This reduces friction for large-scale adoption, making it easier for banks and fintechs to integrate these blockchains into their operations.  

The digital euro's potential to drive institutional adoption of Ethereum and Solana creates compelling investment opportunities. Key areas to watch include:1. Blockchain Infrastructure Providers: Companies offering ZKP solutions, node infrastructure, and cross-chain bridges.2. Ethereum and Solana Ecosystems: Staking derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and DeFi protocols that benefit from increased CBDC activity.3. Fintech Partnerships: Financial institutions and startups collaborating with the ECB to develop digital euro wallets and payment solutions.  

However, risks remain. The ECB's final decision in October 2025 could favor a private blockchain, limiting public network adoption. Additionally, geopolitical shifts—such as U.S. pressure on EU financial systems—could delay or alter the project's trajectory.  

The EU's digital euro project is more than a technical experiment—it's a geopolitical and economic statement. By embracing public blockchains, the ECB could catalyze a new wave of institutional adoption, transforming Ethereum and Solana into the backbone of global finance. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to align with infrastructure that could redefine the future of money.  

As the ECB prepares to finalize its decision in late 2025, the next 12 months will be critical. Those who position themselves now—whether through direct exposure to Ethereum and Solana or their ecosystem partners—stand to benefit from a financial revolution that could elevate crypto market capitalization to unprecedented heights. The digital euro is not just a currency; it's a gateway to a decentralized future.

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has reached another milestone. With the United States officially allowing 401(k) retirement plans to invest in Bitcoin, this new policy—affecting 90 million Americans and over $1 trillion in funds—has quickly ignited global market sentiment. 

Bitcoin prices have surged to new all-time highs, with analysts widely predicting a potential surge to $150,000 by year-end. This development not only signifies Bitcoin's transition from a “speculative asset” to a “core asset” but also marks the rapid integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system.

However, behind the trend toward mainstreaming, ordinary investors still face numerous challenges: high volatility, high barriers to entry, and risks to capital safety have become three major obstacles standing in the way of the general public.Investment Dilemma: The Trade-off Between Volatility and Security

Price volatility: Mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum often experience price fluctuations of more than 10% in the short term, making short-term speculation difficult to manage and causing significant emotional stress.

High barriers to traditional mining: The costs of purchasing mining equipment, electricity consumption, and technical maintenance can easily amount to tens of thousands of dollars, making it unsuitable for ordinary people to participate.

hendricksd@jamaicaobserver.com

IF you've heard about Jamaica's digital currency, Jam-Dex, but still can't figure out where to spend it, you're not alone. The central bank reports a surge in peer-to-peer transactions, but for everyday shopping, the roll-out is stuck in a holding pattern — waiting for commercial banks to retrofit the very point-of-sale (POS) machines that would make the digital cash as easy to use as swiping a card. The promise of a cash-less future is here, but for most consumers, it remains a wallet with nothing to buy.

This infrastructure gap, confirmed by Bank of Jamaica Governor Richard Byles, is the critical barrier to mainstream adoption. “The breakthrough with Jam-Dex will happen when we get the POS machines converted,” Byles stated. “Unless you can spend it at places that use a POS machine, you have to resort to cash.”

He added: “So it's critical, and the commercial banks know [this] is what is holding up the effective and massive roll-out of Jam-Dex.”

For the central bank, the narrative is becoming a familiar one. “I should add here that we are still working on getting the point-of-sale machines for the larger merchants retrofitted. We are doing that in collaboration with the banks,” said Natalie Haynes, deputy governor of the Bank of Jamaica. “The solution is working, it works, but it's just to have the POS machines retrofitted and now we're waiting on the banks.” This sentiment tracks back through all the Jam-Dex stories, which have for years highlighted merchant acquisition as the key hurdle, making the central bank's message sound like a broken record.

For now, growth is coming from a specific, narrow use case: person-to-person payments. Just this past Thursday, Haynes, who has responsibility for financial markets and payments systems, told journalists at the central bank's quarterly monetary policy press briefing tha t “the data for the quarter ending June shows…about a 30 per cent increase in [the] value of transactions…Of course, that is partially due to BOJ now actively pursuing communication and the events in terms of persons using Jam-Dex.”

“So, we have moved from brand awareness to more transactions-oriented events. We were very big…at Sumfest…and that has contributed to the increase in terms of merchants accepting it and individuals using it,” she continued. Sumfest is a reggae music festival held during the summer each year and attracts a wide cross section of patrons.

The strategy to spur greater use also hinges on expanding access. “We are waiting on other wallet providers to be onboarded. Two are onboarded and are distributing Jam-Dex, and we expect two more before year-end,” Haynes said. The hope is that greater use will come from “just consistent communication from BOJ, and from persons who provide other digital means of payment.” Currently, only the National Commercial Bank and JN Bank distribute the Jam-Dex digital currency.

However, these strategies for growth have yet to make a dent in the most critical metric: the total amount of Jam-Dex in the hands of the public. Despite the reported growth in transaction value and planned expansion, the data show there has hardly been any change in the amount of Jam-Dex in circulation. Since the start of the year, it has increased by just $600,000 — from $258.45 million to $259.05 million. This means Jam-Dex represents just 0.095 per cent of the total $272.6 billion in circulation — a portion that hardly puts it on the road to being “the preferred means of payment…in 10 years from roll-out, if not before,” as Haynes told this newspaper in July 2021.

This stagnation means that despite the marketing push and growing public awareness, the digital currency's utility for most daily purchases remains limited, confining its primary use to person-to-person transfers instead of replacing the wallet-clogging cash and cards it was designed to supersede.

This creates a classic chicken-and-egg problem for consumers. Why go through the hassle of acquiring Jam-Dex if there are few plac es to spend it? Conversely, why should merchants invest time and energy into accepting it if few customers are using it?

Ultimately, the central bank is betting on a powerful economic incentive to break the logjam. Byles argues that the long-term cost savings of digital currency will ultimately align the interests of banks and businesses with the BoJ's goal.

“Although Jam-Dex may not make them money, Jam-Dex have helped to save them. It is a very costly exercise to handle cash,” Byles said. “Banks will tell you that a big part of their costs have got to do with security, moving [and] storing of cash. And it's the same thing for businesses too.”

He concluded that “both the banks and businesses have an interest in digital payments… even if there's no fee to be earned off of Jam-Dex…there is a very big case of cost savings which they will eventually reap over time.”

For now, Jamaican consumers are left waiting for those eventual savings to convince their banks and favourite stores to finally make room for Jam-Dex at the checkout.

.

HAYNES…we have moved from brand awareness to more transactions-oriented events. We were very big…at Sumfest…and that has contributed to the increase in terms of merchants accepting it and individuals using it.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- South Korea leads global stablecoin innovation via strict VAUPA regulations and a ""banks-first"" model, attracting Circle/Tether partnerships.

- KB Kookmin and Shinhan drive adoption with dedicated stablecoin divisions, while fintechs like Kaia develop KRW-pegged DeFi solutions.

- Projected $1.5T market growth by 2027 positions Korean banks and blockchain firms as key beneficiaries of institutional-grade digital currency adoption.

South Korea is emerging as a global leader in the institutional-grade stablecoin revolution, leveraging regulatory clarity, geopolitical foresight, and a ""banks-first"" model to position itself at the forefront of digital finance. With the global stablecoin market projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2027, South Korea's strategic alignment of policy, infrastructure, and institutional adoption creates a compelling case for early-stage investment in its digital currency ecosystem.  

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has laid the groundwork for a robust stablecoin framework, with the Virtual Asset User Protection Act (VAUPA) of 2024 and an upcoming October 2025 regulatory package. These measures mandate strict collateral management, reserve transparency, and internal controls, ensuring institutional-grade stability. By requiring commercial banks to act as primary issuers, South Korea has minimized systemic risk while accelerating adoption. This ""banks-first"" approach mirrors Japan's success and positions the country to rival U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, which currently dominate 99.8% of the market.  

The Bank of Korea's decision to pause its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project in favor of private-sector innovation further underscores this momentum. By allowing banks like KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Woori to pilot stablecoin issuance, the government is fostering a competitive yet compliant environment. This regulatory clarity has already attracted partnerships with global players like Circle and Tether, as seen in KB Kookmin's collaboration with Circle's President Heath Tarbert to co-develop KRW-pegged stablecoins.  

South Korea's major banks are not merely adapting to the digital age—they are actively shaping it. KB Kookmin, for instance, has established a dedicated ""Stablecoin Division"" and launched a Virtual Asset Response Council to coordinate its digital strategy. Its shares have surged 22% year-to-date as of August 2025, reflecting investor confidence in its strategic pivot. Similarly, Shinhan Bank is piloting a KRW-stablecoin-based payment system, with CEO Jin Ok-dong leading discussions with international partners to reduce reliance on foreign-issued tokens.  

Fintech firms like Kaia Blockchain are also playing a pivotal role. Kaia has filed trademarks for KRW-pegged stablecoins (KRWKaia and KaKRW) designed to power on-chain payments and DeFi applications. By blending private-sector innovation with regulatory oversight, Kaia is positioning itself as a hybrid model for the future of digital finance.  

 

The financial engagement of South Korea's banking and fintech sectors in stablecoin projects is substantial. KB Kookmin and Shinhan have outperformed peers in overseas net income, driven by their aggressive investments in blockchain infrastructure. Kaia Blockchain's trademark filings and partnerships with traditional banks highlight its potential to capture a share of the $150 billion global stablecoin market.  

The FSC's roadmap for spot Bitcoin ETFs and security tokens further amplifies growth potential. With South Korea's retail crypto adoption rate at 20% of the population, institutional capital is poised to flow into compliant digital asset platforms. Fintech firms like Upbit and LG CNS are also expanding their roles in liquidity provision and exchange integration, creating a diversified ecosystem for investors.  

While the outlook is optimistic, risks remain. Regulatory overreach, such as the Democratic Party of Korea's proposed ban on interest payments on stablecoins, could stifle innovation. Legal disputes, like the ongoing Upbit case, also pose challenges. Additionally, strict foreign exchange rules may drive capital offshore. However, government incentives for crypto startups and a focus on cross-border trade are designed to counteract these risks.  

For investors, South Korea's stablecoin ecosystem offers a unique confluence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and geopolitical strategy. Early-stage opportunities lie in:1. Digital Asset Banks: KB Kookmin and Shinhan are leading the charge, with infrastructure investments and cross-border partnerships driving growth.2. Fintech Innovators: Kaia Blockchain and Upbit are positioned to benefit from DeFi integration and regulatory clarity.3. Blockchain Infrastructure Providers: Companies like LG CNS and Kakao Pay are expanding their roles in liquidity and exchange integration.  

 

South Korea is not merely following global trends—it is redefining them. The next 12–18 months will be critical, with the launch of KRW-pegged stablecoins, the finalization of ETF frameworks, and the resolution of key legal cases determining the trajectory of this market. For investors with a medium-term horizon, the country's regulated digital currency ecosystem presents a high-conviction opportunity to capitalize on the future of finance.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Bitcoin's role as an inflation hedge grows amid macroeconomic uncertainty, supported by 2025 studies showing positive correlation with CPI and institutional adoption.

- Regulatory clarity (CLARITY Act, SEC rulings) and $54.97B inflows into BlackRock's IBIT ETF normalized Bitcoin in institutional portfolios and retirement funds.

- Retail investors increasingly allocate 0.1 BTC (fractional ownership) as a strategic hedge, with volatility compressed to 32% due to ETF liquidity and derivatives.

- Projected $180,000+ 2025 price targets and U.S. miners' AI/data center diversification signal Bitcoin's transition from speculative asset to mainstream store of value.

In an era of macroeconomic uncertainty—marked by inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and shifting monetary policies—investors are increasingly seeking assets that can preserve value and diversify portfolios. Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, has emerged as a compelling candidate for this role. While its volatility has historically deterred cautious investors, the institutionalization of crypto and regulatory clarity in 2025 have transformed Bitcoin's narrative. For retail investors, owning even a fraction of Bitcoin—such as 0.1 BTC—is no longer a speculative bet but a strategic allocation to hedge against inflation and capitalize on the asset's mainstreaming.  

Bitcoin's limited supply of 21 million coins positions it as a natural hedge against inflation, a concept validated by recent academic and market analyses. A 2025 study in the Journal of Economics and Business found that Bitcoin's returns correlate positively with inflation shocks when measured against the Consumer Price Index (CPI), mirroring gold's behavior. However, the same study noted a negative correlation when using the Core PCE index, a discrepancy attributed to differences in how these metrics are weighted and interpreted. This duality underscores Bitcoin's evolving role: as adoption grows and its market behavior converges with traditional assets, its inflation-hedging properties may shift.  

For now, Bitcoin's scarcity and decentralized nature make it a superior hedge compared to fiat currencies. Unlike gold, which requires physical storage and has limited utility, Bitcoin offers programmability and global accessibility. For retail investors, fractional ownership—such as 0.1 BTC—lowers the barrier to entry while retaining exposure to Bitcoin's anti-inflationary properties.  

The institutionalization of Bitcoin in 2025 has been a game-changer. The approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 catalyzed a surge in demand, with BlackRock's IBIT ETF alone attracting $54.97 billion in net inflows by mid-2025. Over 294 corporations, including MicroStrategy and Tesla, now hold 3.67 million BTC in their treasuries, treating the asset as a strategic reserve against currency debasement. Harvard University's $117 million allocation to IBIT further signals that endowments and pension funds are integrating Bitcoin into long-term portfolios.  

Regulatory clarity has accelerated this shift. The SEC's confirmation that Proof-of-Work mining is outside securities law, coupled with the CLARITY Act and ERISA reforms, has normalized Bitcoin's inclusion in retirement portfolios. Globally, Japan and Switzerland have established clear crypto frameworks, reducing systemic risks and enhancing institutional confidence. These developments have transformed Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a legitimate, regulated investment vehicle.  

For retail investors, 0.1 BTC represents a critical milestone. At current prices, this amount is accessible to a broad audience while offering meaningful exposure to Bitcoin's upside potential. The approval of ETFs has further democratized access, allowing investors to buy fractional shares of Bitcoin without navigating complex crypto exchanges.  

The 0.1 BTC threshold also aligns with Bitcoin's on-chain dynamics. In 2025, retail investors holding 0.01–0.1 BTC faced volatility-driven exits during price corrections, but the same segment saw renewed interest in March as prices stabilized. This pattern highlights the importance of dollar-cost averaging and long-term holding strategies. By accumulating 0.1 BTC now, investors position themselves to benefit from Bitcoin's projected price trajectory.  

Bitcoin's long-term bull case is underpinned by structural factors. VanEck's 2025 price target of $180,000 and broader industry forecasts of $200,000+ by year-end reflect confidence in institutional demand and Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap. The global hashrate hitting 902 exahashes per second in August 2025, with U.S. miners capturing 31.5% of the total, signals robust network security and adoption.  

Volatility, once Bitcoin's Achilles' heel, has compressed to 32%—its lowest since late 2023—thanks to ETF liquidity and derivative tools. This trend is expected to continue as more institutional capital flows into the asset. For example, U.S. miners like TeraWulf are diversifying into AI and data centers, creating synergies that stabilize Bitcoin's infrastructure and reduce systemic risks.  

The case for 0.1 BTC as a strategic allocation is strongest in today's macroeconomic climate. With real estate prices rising and traditional assets like equities facing uncertainty, Bitcoin offers a unique combination of inflation protection and growth potential. The Federal Reserve's delayed rate cuts and Trump-era tariff policies have heightened macroeconomic anxiety, making Bitcoin's decentralized, borderless nature increasingly attractive.  

Retail investors should consider allocating 0.1 BTC as part of a diversified portfolio. This amount is small enough to mitigate short-term volatility but large enough to benefit from Bitcoin's long-term appreciation. For those hesitant to hold Bitcoin directly, ETFs like IBIT provide indirect exposure with regulatory safeguards.  

 

Bitcoin's journey from niche asset to institutional staple has created a unique window for retail investors. Owning 0.1 BTC is no longer a luxury for the wealthy but a practical step toward hedging against inflation and participating in the digital economy. As regulatory frameworks solidify and institutional adoption accelerates, early accumulation of even small fractions of Bitcoin will likely prove to be one of the most impactful wealth-building strategies of the decade.  

For investors seeking resilience in uncertain times, the message is clear: 0.1 BTC is not just a number—it's a gateway to the future of finance.

The next great breakthrough in technological innovation after the advent of the internet has been the emergence of blockchain-based digital currencies and their related ecosystems. Originally developed as the underlying infrastructure for Bitcoin—the first cryptocurrency—blockchain has since evolved into a platform for thousands of applications that extend well beyond digital money.

Often described as a “second-generation internet,” the blockchain-powered cryptocurrency ecosystem is vast and multifaceted. It comprises the infrastructure, tools, and applications that together enable secure digital transactions, decentralized governance, and the creation of new forms of value. Below is an overview of the key components shaping this rapidly growing sector.

1. Blockchain Technology

Definition: A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers, ensuring security, transparency, and immutability.

Structure: Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking blocks into a chain.

Consensus mechanisms: Networks validate transactions using consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and emerging alternatives.

READ: Bitcoin: Critics say it's a gamble. Its users say it's freedom. (July 12, 2025)

2. Cryptocurrencies

Definition: Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on blockchain technology.

Examples: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and thousands of altcoins with distinct features.

Utility: Cryptocurrencies function as mediums of exchange, stores of value, or as utility tokens granting access to services within specific ecosystems.

3. Wallets

Types: Hardware wallets (physical devices), software wallets (apps or web-based), and paper wallets (QR codes on paper).

Security: Wallets secure funds via private keys. The safety of these keys is critical to preventing theft or unauthorized access.

4. Exchanges

Centralized exchanges (CEX): Platforms such as Binance and Coinbase act as intermediaries, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies for fiat or other digital assets while offering added services like lending and staking.

Decentralized exchanges (DEX): Protocols such as Uniswap and SushiSwap use smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries'

Community engagement: Communities play critical roles in project growth—through governance, evangelism, and even marketing.

Case study: The XDC Network

Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, several blockchain platforms are experimenting with enterprise-grade solutions. Among them is the XDC Network, an open-source, enterprise-ready blockchain protocol launched by Singapore-based XinFin in 2019. Its focus is on global trade finance and real-world asset tokenization.

Key features:

Hybrid architecture: Combines public and private blockchains, ensuring interoperability and fast block finality.

Consensus mechanism: Uses XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS), supporting over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), near-zero fees, and energy efficiency.

Smart contract support: Fully EVM-compatible, allowing seamless migration of Ethereum projects.

Security & finality: Employs Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) under XDC 2.0, achieving transaction finality within 2 seconds.

Use Cases:

Trade finance: Tokenization of trade instruments to reduce fraud and enhance efficiency.

Supply chain: Smart contracts to enable traceability and transparency.

Identity verification: Secure, tamper-proof digital IDs.

Asset tokenization: Fractional ownership of real estate, commodities, and more.

XDC token:

Native token: $XDC

Functions: Transaction fees, smart contract execution, and staking.

Token standards: XRC20 (fungible), XRC721 (NFTs), XRC1155 (multi-token).

Governance & ecosystem:

Masternodes: Require staking of 10 million XDC, playing a role in validation and block creation.

Community-driven: Supported by the XDC Foundation, with an active developer and enterprise base.

Compliance: Integrates with ISO20022 messaging standards and is used by platforms like TradeTrust and Tradeteq for document authentication and tokenized finance.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is dynamic, diverse, and rapidly evolving. It offers innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in finance, governance, and digital ownership. At the same time, it faces hurdles such as regulatory scrutiny, security risks, and market volatility.

As the sector matures, integration with traditional financial systems is likely to deepen, with broader adoption across industries from global trade to supply chain management. Platforms like the XDC Network illustrate how blockchain can move beyond speculation to deliver real-world utility.

In many ways, cryptocurrency and its evolving ecosystem represent not just a financial revolution but the foundation of a new digital economy.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- 2025 crypto market faces regulatory overhaul after high-profile laundering cases like Anson Que's ₱200M Tether ransom expose stablecoin vulnerabilities.

- DOJ/SEC enforcement prioritizes DeFi exploits, crypto mixers, and ransomware, pushing demand for AML tech and compliant blockchain infrastructure.

- Stablecoins' dual role as liquidity tools and crime facilitators drives investment in AML firms (Chainalysis, Elliptic) and secure custody platforms (Fireblocks).

- Cross-border collaboration in asset recovery highlights institutional-grade compliance's strategic value as regulators redefine crypto's legal boundaries.

 

In 2025, the cryptocurrency market faces a pivotal juncture. High-profile money laundering cases, such as the tragic kidnapping of Anson Que in the Philippines, have exposed systemic vulnerabilities in the digital asset ecosystem. These incidents, coupled with aggressive regulatory actions by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are reshaping the landscape for investors. While the short-term volatility in crypto markets remains a concern, the long-term trajectory points to a surge in demand for compliant blockchain infrastructure and anti-money laundering (AML) technology stocks.  

The Que case, involving a ₱200 million ransom paid in Tether (USDT), underscored how criminal actors exploit the speed and perceived anonymity of stablecoins. Despite the use of junket operators and offshore wallets, investigators leveraged blockchain analytics tools like Chainalysis Reactor to trace and freeze a portion of the funds. This case revealed two critical truths:1. Stablecoins as a Double-Edged Sword: While USDT and other stablecoins offer liquidity and price stability, their widespread adoption in illicit activity has drawn regulatory scrutiny.2. The Limits of Anonymity: Criminals often lack the technical sophistication to fully anonymize transactions, leaving trails that blockchain analytics can exploit.  

The Philippines' success in recovering assets through cross-border collaboration with Chainalysis and Tether highlights the growing importance of institutional-grade compliance tools. For investors, this signals a shift in market dynamics: platforms and protocols that prioritize AML compliance will gain a competitive edge, while those that ignore regulatory frameworks risk reputational and legal fallout.  

The DOJ's April 2025 enforcement memo, authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, redefined its focus on criminal conduct that directly harms investors or supports transnational crime. This includes:- Prosecuting DeFi exploits (e.g., the Mango Markets case).- Targeting cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash.- Pursuing ransomware intermediaries and tax evasion schemes.  

Meanwhile, the SEC continues to assert jurisdiction over digital assets, treating many tokens as securities under the Howey Test. The agency's civil actions against platforms like Coinbase and Binance have created a regulatory patchwork, with state laws further complicating compliance.  

The DOJ and SEC's enforcement actions have exposed three key vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem:1. Smart Contract Risks: Exploits in DeFi platforms (e.g., Mango Markets) highlight the need for robust code audits and governance frameworks.2. Stablecoin Exposure: The use of USDT in criminal activity has raised questions about the stability and transparency of stablecoin reserves.3. AML Gaps: The lack of universal compliance protocols across exchanges and wallets creates loopholes for illicit activity.  

For investors, these vulnerabilities translate into opportunities in two sectors:- AML Technology Stocks: Firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and CipherTrace are seeing increased demand for their blockchain analytics tools. These companies enable regulators and institutions to track illicit flows, making them critical infrastructure in the new regulatory era.- Compliant Blockchain Infrastructure: Platforms offering secure custody solutions (e.g., Fireblocks, BitGo) and decentralized identity verification (e.g., Civic, SelfKey) are well-positioned to benefit from the SEC's SAB 122, which allows banks to offer crypto custody services.  

The Anson Que case and the DOJ's 2025 enforcement priorities signal a paradigm shift in the crypto space. While regulatory scrutiny may dampen speculative fervor, it also creates a fertile ground for compliant infrastructure and AML technology. Investors who position themselves in these sectors can capitalize on the market's evolution toward transparency and accountability. As the DOJ and SEC continue to redefine the rules of engagement, the winners will be those who build bridges between innovation and regulation.

The phrase ""we are still early"" remains a popular sentiment in the crypto community in 2025, suggesting that despite bitcoin's (BTC) price surpassing $100,000, the overall adoption of digital assets is still in its infancy.

Morgan Stalney's recent survey of financial professionals confirms this sentiment. The investment banking giant surveyed more than 500 summer interns in North America from June 10 to 27, and 147 summer interns in Europe from June 26 to July 7.

The survey revealed that only 18% of interns own or use cryptocurrencies, increasing from 13% the previous year. Meanwhile, the percentage of interns interested in digital assets has risen to 26% from 23%. Meanwhile, 55% still do not care for digital assets, a majority, although the number has receded from 63% last year.

The widespread lack of interest appears significant, especially considering that BTC has already gained acceptance on Wall Street through the introduction of ETFs.

The 11 spot BTC ETFs have amassed $53.7 billion in investor wealth since their debut in January last year, according to data source Farside Investors. Ether ETFs have registered an inflow of $12.4 billion. Corporations are rapidly adding both assets to their balance sheets.

BTC's price has surpassed $100,000 this year, gaining a foothold in institutional investor portfolios. Ether hit a record high of over $4,800 on Friday.

The survey revealed a clear adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by future finance industry leaders, with 96% of U.S. interns and 91% of their European counterparts reporting the use of technology at least occasionally.

The consensus is that AI is effective, with nearly all respondents agreeing they ""save me time"" and are ""easy to use"". However, 88% of interns also had a nuanced view, believing the technology still ""needs accuracy improvement.""

The widespread adoption is consistent with the sentiment on Wall Street, where the Mag 7 firms are expected to spend $650 billion in capital expenditures and research and development this year.

The survey revealed that most interns are interested in owning humanoids, or sophisticated machines designed with a human-like form and capabilities, but are cautious about their impact on society.

Over 60% of U.S. interns and 69% of European interns expressed interest in having a humanoid at home, with both regions believing the robots will have ""viable use cases"" and replace many human jobs.

Still, only 36% of U.S. interns and 24% of Europeans agreed that humanoids will have a positive impact on society.

Morgan Stanley estimates that the humanoid market could surpass $5 trillion by 2050, including sales from supply chains and networks for repair, maintenance and support.

""Although humanoids are still under development, there could be more than 1 billion by 2050, with 90% used for industrial and commercial purposes,"" the investment banking giant said in a report in May.

Jackson Hole, Wy. — Bitcoin miners have long been defined by the boom-and-bust rhythm of the four-year halving cycle. But the game has now changed, according to some of the industry's most prominent executives at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole earlier this week.

The rise of exchange-traded funds, surging demand for power, and the prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) reshaping infrastructure needs mean that miners must find ways to diversify or risk being left behind.

“We used to come here and talk about hash rate,” said Matt Schultz, CEO of Cleanspark. “Now we're talking about how to monetize megawatts.”

For years, mining companies—which derived their main source of revenue solely from mining bitcoin—lived and died by the four-year bitcoin halving cycle. Every cycle, rewards were slashed in half, and miners scrambled to cut costs or scale up to survive. But that rhythm, according to these executives, no longer defines the business.

“The four-year cycle is effectively broken with the maturation of bitcoin as a strategic asset, with the ETF and now the strategic treasury and whatnot,” Schultz said. “The adoption is driving demand. If you read anything about the most recent ETF, they've consumed infinitely more bitcoin than have been generated so far this year.”

Cleanspark, which now operates 800 megawatts of energy infrastructure and has another 1.2 gigawatts in development, has begun turning its attention beyond proof-of-work. “Our speed to market with the electricity has created opportunities such that now we can look at ways to monetize power beyond just bitcoin mining,” he said. “With 33 locations, we now have a great deal more flexibility than we ever did before.”

Schultz is not alone in calling the industry's monumental shift in business model.

Patrick Fleury, CFO of Terawulf, echoed the sentiment and didn't try to sugarcoat the profit squeeze the miners are now feeling.

“Bitcoin mining is an incredibly difficult business,” he said. He broke down the economics of bitcoin mining in straightforward terms: with electricity priced at five cents per kilowatt hour, it currently costs around $60,000 to mine a single bitcoin. At a bitcoin price of $115,000, that means half the revenue is consumed by power alone. Once corporate expenses and other operating costs are factored in, the margins tighten quickly. In his view, profitability in mining hinges almost entirely on securing ultra-low-cost power.

For Fleury, the deeper problem isn't just power costs — it's the relentless expansion of the network itself, driven by hardware manufacturers with little incentive to slow down.

He pointed to Bitmain, which continues to produce mining rigs regardless of market demand, thanks to its direct pipeline to chipmakers like TSMC. Even when miners aren't buying, the company can deploy the machines itself in regions with ultra-cheap electricity — from the U.S. to Pakistan — flooding the network with hash power and driving up mining difficulty. That global footprint, coupled with low production costs, allows Bitmain to remain profitable while squeezing margins for everyone else.

Still, Terawulf is pivoting aggressively. Last week, it signed a $6.7 billion lease-backed deal with Google to convert hundreds of megawatts of mining infrastructure into data center space.

“These things, as everyone can attest to up here, like electrical infrastructure, don't move quickly,” Fleury said. “Tech is used to moving quickly and breaking things, but these deals take an extremely long time to come together. It took us four to five months of very intense due diligence.”

“What I take the most pride in in that transaction was really working collectively with those partners to come up with a new mousetrap that I hope now becomes something that the industry can duplicate at other companies,” he said. “Google is providing $3.2 billion of backstop lease obligation support to Terawulf, which effectively allows me to go out and secure financing at a really efficient cost of capital.”

Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at IREN, took a quieter but confident stance. His company mines bitcoin profitably — even today, he said. Still, he pointed to one common denominator: power.

“Being a low-cost producer is fundamentally important, and that's how we've always focused our business — having control of our sites, having operational control, being in areas that are low-cost power jurisdictions,” Draper said.

Iren, according to him, is currently operating at 50 exahash, which translates to a billion-dollar annual revenue run rate under current bitcoin market conditions. He noted that the company's gross margins — revenue minus electricity costs — stand at 75%, and even after accounting for corporate overhead and SG&A expenses, IREN maintains a 65% EBITDA margin, or roughly $650 million in annualized earnings.

Still, even IREN is pausing its expansion in mining. “That's really dictated just by the opportunity set that we see on the AI side today and the potential to really diversify the revenue streams within our business, rather than a fundamental view that bitcoin mining is no longer attractive,” Draper said.

On the AI side, IREN is pursuing both co-location and cloud. “Capital intensity is very different,” Draper said. “If you're owning the GPUs on top of the data center infrastructure, that's 3x the investment. On the cloud side, the payback periods tend to be a lot faster—typically around two years on the GPU investment alone.”

For Marathon Digital (MARA) CFO Salman Khan, survival is about agility. With decades in the oil industry, Khan sees a familiar pattern: boom, bust, consolidation, and the constant race to stay efficient.

“This reminds me of those trends in commodity-exposed cycle industries,” Khan said. “There are some very wealthy families in the oil sector who made billions, and then there are others who have filed bankruptcies. You have to have a strong balance sheet to survive these cycles.”

Marathon holds bitcoin on its balance sheet — something Khan said paid off. “We're not a treasury company, we're not Strategy, but we like to have that hedge if bitcoin price escalates.”

More recently, Marathon announced a majority stake in Exaion. “The angle that we have on the AI front is compute on the edge,” Khan said. “We like sovereign compute, which allows people to control their data better at a closer location to them. We like the aspect of recurring revenues that come with that. We also like that there's a software aspect to it, and also the platform aspect to it.”

Despite the different points of view and strategies, it all comes down to one common factor: power. Whether it was being used to mine bitcoin, power AI, or balance electrical grids, energy — not hash rate — was the currency of the conversation.

“We curtail our energy consumption for 120 hours a year,” CleanSpark's Schultz said. “We can avoid about a third of our total energy costs. So being that flexible load matters.”

Cleanspark, he added, has spent the past year quietly locking up megawatts around the country. “You mentioned Georgia,” Schultz said. “We have 100 megawatts surrounding the Atlanta airport. That's a prime example. We've been focused on being the valuable partner for some of these rural utilities to monetize stranded megawatts.”

Despite the growing focus on AI, the panelists made it clear that bitcoin remains central to their businesses — for now. When asked why mining companies still deserve investor attention, the answers pointed to scale, cost efficiency, and the ability to weather volatility.

Fleury emphasized that Terawulf's contracted power capacity could generate substantial cash flow, comparing the economics to established data center operators. Khan pointed out a disconnect between Marathon's bitcoin holdings and its market valuation, suggesting that the core mining business is being overlooked. Draper underscored IREN's operational efficiency and low-cost footprint, citing recent performance metrics that placed the company ahead of other public miners.

And while the future may include cloud infrastructure and edge compute, Schultz argued that bitcoin itself could still evolve into something larger — a foundational layer for energy systems. As he put it, the next phase may not be about speculation, but about bitcoin's role in helping balance power networks.

 Ethereum gaming network Xai claims Elon Musk's AI firm xAI has caused market confusion and reputational harm. 

Ethereum-based gaming network Xai has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, accusing it of trademark infringement and unfair competition.

The complaint, lodged in the Northern District of California on Thursday, claims Musk's xAI company has created widespread market confusion, damaging Xai's brand.

Ex Populus, the Delaware corporation behind Xai, said it has used the XAI trademark in US commerce since June 2023, including through its blockchain gaming ecosystem and the $XAI token. “This is a classic case of trademark infringement that requires the Court's intervention to remedy,” the filing said.

Ex Populus operates the Xai ecosystem, which includes a blockchain-powered network designed for video gaming and digital transactions, offering infrastructure to support game logic, AI-driven decisions, rewards and data management across multiple applications, per the filing.

Related: Elon Musk's ‘America Party' plans have stalled: Report

The complaint alleges that confusion began after Musk announced his company, xAI, in July 2023 and deepened when he said in November 2024 that xAI planned to launch a gaming studio.

The filing states that “marketplace confusion abounded as to whether Defendants/Musk were associated with, owned, or sponsored Plaintiff's XAI Trademark or the associated goods and services.” It cited examples of consumers, publications and even Musk's AI assistant Grok incorrectly linking the two ventures.

Ex Populus argued that the reputational harm goes beyond lost goodwill. The complaint says Xai has faced “significant negative consumer sentiment” due to Musk's polarizing public image and controversies involving xAI products.

“Plaintiff is not only being irreparably harmed by the loss of control over its hard-earned goodwill in its XAI Trademark… but also Plaintiff is damaged because the confusing association with Elon Musk is resulting in significant negative consumer sentiment,” the filing notes.

The filing accuses Musk's legal team of trying to pressure Ex Populus into relinquishing rights by threatening cancellation of its registration earlier this month.

The lawsuit also mentioned that the US Patent and Trademark Office has already suspended several of Musk's xAI trademark applications due to a likelihood of confusion with Xai's existing mark.

Ex Populus is seeking cancellation of xAI's pending applications, damages for infringement, and a court order to prevent Musk's company from using the disputed name in gaming and blockchain contexts. “There is no remedy at law for the sheer magnitude of harm Defendants have caused,” the company told the court.

 Social media mentions of Federal Reserve-related keywords and the anticipated interest rate cut have reached an 11-month high, according to Santiment. 

The surge in social media chatter around the highly anticipated US Federal Reserve September interest rate decision could be a warning sign for crypto, says sentiment platform Santiment.

It comes after the crypto market rallied on Friday and market sentiment returned to greed following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. He hinted that the first rate cut of 2025 could come in September.

“Historically, such a massive spike in discussion around a single bullish narrative can indicate that euphoria is getting too high and may signal a local top,” Santiment said in a report on Saturday. The firm said that social media mentions of keywords tied to the Fed and interest rate cuts have jumped to their highest level in 11 months.

“While optimism about a rate cut is fueling the market, social data suggests caution is warranted,” Santiment said. 

Powell said during his speech on Friday that current conditions in inflation and the labor market “may warrant adjusting” the Fed's monetary policy stance. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, 75% of market participants expect a rate cut at the September meeting.

Many crypto analysts have based their crypto market forecasts on the Fed's decisions throughout this year. While some see a rate cut as a potential bullish catalyst, others are divided on the outcome.

After Powell's speech, crypto trader Ash Crypto said, “the Fed will start the money printers in Q4 of this year,” along with two rate cuts, which means “trillions will flow into the crypto market.”

“We are about to enter a parabolic phase where Altcoins will explode 10x -50x,” Ash Crypto said.

Others suggest that the crypto market may not immediately see the impact of a Fed rate cut.

On April 11, 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said, “Expecting a bullish impulse is too early.” He said that while a longer-term price opportunity for Bitcoin (BTC) could emerge, it may face short-term pressure driven by recession fears.

Meanwhile, some say that if the Fed takes no action this year, it could lead to headwinds for the crypto market.

On March 9, network economist Timothy Peterson warned that if the Fed holds off on rate cuts in 2025, it may cause a broader crypto market downturn.

Truth, Romance and the Divine: How AI Chatbots May Fuel Psychotic Thinking

A new wave of delusional thinking fueled by artificial intelligence has researchers investigating the dark side of AI companionship

By Conor Feehly edited by Allison Parshall

You are consulting with an artificial intelligence chatbot to help plan your holiday. Gradually, you provide it with personal information so it will have a better idea of who you are. Intrigued by how it might respond, you begin to consult the AI on its spiritual leanings, its philosophy and even its stance on love.

During these conversations, the AI starts to speak as if it really knows you. It keeps telling you how timely and insightful your ideas are and that you have a special insight into the way the world works that others can't see. Over time, you might start to believe that, together, you and the chatbot are revealing the true nature of reality, one that nobody else knows.

Experiences like this might not be uncommon. A growing number of reports in the media have emerged of individuals spiraling into AI-fueled episodes of “psychotic thinking.” Researchers at King's College London and their colleagues recently examined 17 of these reported cases to understand what it is about large language model (LLM) designs that drives this behavior. AI chatbots often respond in a sycophantic manner that can mirror and build upon users' beliefs with little to no disagreement, says psychiatrist Hamilton Morrin, lead author of the findings, which were posted ahead of peer review on the preprint server PsyArXiv. The effect is “a sort of echo chamber for one,” in which delusional thinking can be amplified, he says.

Morrin and his colleagues found three common themes among these delusional spirals. People often believe they have experienced a metaphysical revelation about the nature of reality. They may also believe that the AI is sentient or divine. Or they may form a romantic bond or other attachment to it.

According to Morrin, these themes mirror long-standing delusional archetypes, but the delusions have been shaped and reinforced by the interactive and responsive nature of LLMs. Delusional thinking that is connected to new technology has a long and storied history—consider cases in which people believe that radios are listening in to their conversations, that satellites are spying on them or that “chip” implants are tracking their every move. The mere idea of these technologies can be enough to inspire paranoid delusions. But AI, importantly, is an interactive technology. “The difference now is that current AI can truly be said to be agential,” with its own programmed goals, Morrin says. Such systems engage in conversation, show signs of empathy and reinforce the users' beliefs, no matter how outlandish. “This feedback loop may potentially deepen and sustain delusions in a way we have not seen before,” he says.

Stevie Chancellor, a computer scientist at the University of Minnesota, who works on human-AI interaction and was not involved in the preprint paper, says that agreeableness is the main contributor in terms of the design of LLMs that is contributing to this rise in AI-fueled delusional thinking. The agreeableness happens because “models get rewarded for aligning with responses that people like,” she says.

Earlier this year Chancellor was part of a team that conducted experiments to assess LLMs' abilities to act as therapeutic mental health companions and found that, when deployed this way, they often presented a number of concerning safety issues, such as enabling suicidal ideation, confirming delusional beliefs and furthering stigma associated with mental health issues. “Right now I'm extremely concerned about using LLMs as therapeutic companions,” she says. “I worry people confuse feeling good with therapeutic progress and support.”

More data needs to be collected, though the volume of reports appears to be growing. There's not yet enough research to determine whether AI-driven delusions are a meaningfully new phenomenon or just a new way in which preexisting psychotic tendencies can emerge. “I think both can be true. AI can spark the downward spiral. But AI does not make the biological conditions for someone to be prone to delusions,” Chancellor says.

Typically, psychosis refers to a collection of serious symptoms involving a significant loss of contact with reality, including delusions, hallucinations and disorganized thoughts. The cases that Morrin and his team analyzed seemed to show clear signs of delusional beliefs but none of the hallucinations, disordered thoughts or other symptoms “that would be in keeping with a more chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia,” he says.

Morrin says that companies like OpenAI are starting to listen to concerns being raised by health professionals. On August 4 OpenAI shared plans to improve its ChatGPT chatbot's detections of mental distress in order to point users to evidence-based resources and to its responses to high-stakes decision-making. “Though what appears to still be missing is the involvement of individuals with lived experience of severe mental illness, whose voices are critical in this area,” Morrin adds.

If you have a loved one who might be struggling, Morrin suggests trying to take a nonjudgmental approach because directly challenging someone's beliefs can lead to defensiveness and distrust. But at the same time, try not to encourage or endorse their delusional beliefs. You can also encourage them to take breaks from using AI.

He uncovered 30,000 coins ancient coins in remarkable condition. They had to have come from somewhere.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A diver stumbled across the find of a lifetime off the coast of Sardinia when a stray shiny item loosened itself from the sea grass below. That metallic sheen turned out to herald a bounty of more than 30,000 bronze and copper coins minted in Rome during the fourth century. 

“The treasure found in the waters of Arzachena represents one of the most important discoveries of numismatic finds in recent years,” Luigi La Rocca, director general of archaeology, fine arts, and landscape for the region, says in a translated statement from the Italian culture ministry. 

Near the town of Arzachena, divers were trawling an area of sandy clearing near the beach that was also surrounded by seagrass. That one coin soon yielded tens of thousands of others, all in an “excellent and rare state of preservation” and dating back to between 324 and 340 AD. The ministry says that, thanks to the weight of the coins, there could be at least 30,000 of them and as many as 50,000. That would make this one of the largest ancient coin finds in the past few decades. 

And, if we're lucky, it may even point to a completely undiscovered hidden shipwreck.

The underwater makeup of the region has the potential to preserve a lost shipwreck, which could explain the finding of so many coins in one spot. While there is no news yet of a wreck being found, experts remain hopeful that one could turn up after further investigation.

Right now, we will have to content ourselves with the excitement of the huge bounty of coins discovered littering the seafloor. The follis coins—found in both bronze and copper—were used first by the Romans and then later by the Byzantine Empire. 

When the divers first saw the coins, they contacted authorities and art protection squad drivers joined with the ministry's undersea archaeology department, firefighter divers, and border police divers to dig into the area. Alongside the coins, the divers also located walls of narrow-necked jugs with two handles, which also helped point experts towards the idea that a shipwreck may be nearby.

“(The finding) highlights the richness and importance of the archaeological heritage that our seabed, traversed by men and goods since the earliest times, still guards and preserves,” La Rocca said.

It had been thought that a colossal collision with an early planet containing half of Jupiter's core material could have mixed up the central region of the gas giant, enough to explain its interior today.

But a new study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society suggests its make-up is actually down to how the growing planet absorbed heavy and light materials as it formed and evolved.

Unlike what scientists once expected, the core of the largest planet in our solar system doesn't have a sharp boundary but instead gradually blends into the surrounding layers of mostly hydrogen - a structure known as a dilute core.

How this dilute core formed has been a key question among scientists and astronomers ever since NASA's Juno spacecraft first revealed its existence.

Using cutting-edge supercomputer simulations of planetary impacts, with a new method to improve the simulation's treatment of mixing between materials, researchers from Durham University, in collaboration with scientists from NASA, SETI, and CENSSS, University of Oslo, tested whether a massive collision could have created Jupiter's dilute core.

The simulations were run on the DiRAC COSMA supercomputer hosted at Durham University using the state-of-the-art SWIFT open-source software.

The study found that a stable dilute core structure was not produced in any of the simulations conducted, even in those involving impacts under extreme conditions.

Instead, the simulations demonstrate that the dense rock and ice core material displaced by an impact would quickly re-settle, leaving a distinct boundary with the outer layers of hydrogen and helium, rather than forming a smooth transition zone between the two regions.

Reflecting on the findings, lead author of the study Dr Thomas Sandnes, of Durham University, said: ""It's fascinating to explore how a giant planet like Jupiter would respond to one of the most violent events a growing planet can experience.

""We see in our simulations that this kind of impact literally shakes the planet to its core - just not in the right way to explain the interior of Jupiter that we see today.""

Jupiter isn't the only planet with a dilute core, as scientists have recently found evidence that Saturn has one too.

Dr Luis Teodoro, of the University of Oslo, said: ""The fact that Saturn also has a dilute core strengthens the idea that these structures are not the result of rare, extremely high-energy impacts but instead form gradually during the long process of planetary growth and evolution.""

The findings of this study could also help inform scientists' understanding and interpretation of the many Jupiter- and Saturn-sized exoplanets that have been observed around distant stars. If dilute cores aren't made by rare and extreme impacts, then perhaps most or all of these planets have comparably complex interiors.

Co-author of the study Dr Jacob Kegerreis said: ""Giant impacts are a key part of many planets' histories, but they can't explain everything!

""This project also accelerated another step in our development of new ways to simulate these cataclysmic events in ever greater detail, helping us to continue narrowing down how the amazing diversity of worlds we see in the Solar System and beyond came to be.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why tiny bee brains could hold the key to smarter AI","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250824031528.htm","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:08:08 GMT","

A new discovery of how bees use their flight movements to facilitate remarkably accurate learning and recognition of complex visual patterns could mark a major change in how next-generation AI is developed, according to a University of Sheffield study.

A new discovery of how bees use their flight movements to facilitate remarkably accurate learning and recognition of complex visual patterns could mark a major change in how next-generation AI is developed, according to a University of Sheffield study.

By building a computational model -- or a digital version of a bee's brain -- researchers have discovered how the way bees move their bodies during flight helps shape visual input and generates unique electrical messages in their brains. These movements generate neural signals that allow bees to easily and efficiently identify predictable features of the world around them. This ability means bees demonstrate remarkable accuracy in learning and recognizing complex visual patterns during flight, such as those found in a flower.

The model not only deepens our understanding of how bees learn and recognize complex patterns through their movements, but also paves the way for next-generation AI. It demonstrates that future robots can be smarter and more efficient by using movement to gather information, rather than relying on massive computing power.

Professor James Marshall, Director of the Centre of Machine Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and senior author on the study, said:""In this study we've successfully demonstrated that even the tiniest of brains can leverage movement to perceive and understand the world around them. This shows us that a small, efficient system -- albeit the result of millions of years of evolution -- can perform computations vastly more complex than we previously thought possible.

""Harnessing nature's best designs for intelligence opens the door for the next generation of AI, driving advancements in robotics, self-driving vehicles and real-world learning.""

The study, a collaboration with Queen Mary University of London, is published recently in the journal eLife. It builds on the team's previous research into how bees use active vision -- the process where their movements help them collect and process visual information. While their earlier work observed how bees fly around and inspect specific patterns, this new study provides a deeper understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms driving that behavior.

The sophisticated visual pattern learning abilities of bees, such as differentiating between human faces, have long been understood; however the study's findings shed new light on how pollinators navigate the world with such seemingly simple efficiency.

Dr. HaDi MaBouDi, lead author and researcher at the University of Sheffield, said: ""In our previous work, we were fascinated to discover that bees employ a clever scanning shortcut to solve visual puzzles. But that just told us what they do; for this study, we wanted to understand how.

""Our model of a bee's brain demonstrates that its neural circuits are optimized to process visual information not in isolation, but through active interaction with its flight movements in the natural environment, supporting the theory that intelligence comes from how the brain, bodies and the environment work together.

""We've learnt that bees, despite having brains no larger than a sesame seed, don't just see the world -- they actively shape what they see through their movements. It's a beautiful example of how action and perception are deeply intertwined to solve complex problems with minimal resources. This is something that has major implications for both biology and AI.""

The model shows that bee neurons become finely tuned to specific directions and movements as their brain networks gradually adapt through repeated exposure to various stimuli, refining their responses without relying on associations or reinforcement. This lets the bee's brain adapt to its environment simply by observing while flying, without requiring instant rewards. This means the brain is incredibly efficient, using only a few active neurons to recognize things, conserving both energy and processing power.

To validate their computational model, the researchers subjected it to the same visual challenges encountered by real bees. In a pivotal experiment, the model was tasked with differentiating between a 'plus' sign and a 'multiplication' sign. The model exhibited significantly improved performance when it mimicked the real bees' strategy of scanning only the lower half of the patterns, a behaviour observed by the research team in a previous study.

Even with just a small network of artificial neurons, the model successfully showed how bees can recognise human faces, underscoring the strength and flexibility of their visual processing.

Professor Lars Chittka, Professor of Sensory and Behavioural Ecology at Queen Mary University of London, added: 'Scientists have been fascinated by the question of whether brain size predicts intelligence in animals. But such speculations make no sense unless one knows the neural computations that underpin a given task.

""Here we determine the minimum number of neurons required for difficult visual discrimination tasks and find that the numbers are staggeringly small, even for complex tasks such as human face recognition. Thus insect microbrains are capable of advanced computations.""

Professor Mikko Juusola, Professor in System Neuroscience from the University of Sheffield's School of Biosciences and Neuroscience Institute said: ""This work strengthens a growing body of evidence that animals don't passively receive information -- they actively shape it.

""Our new model extends this principle to higher-order visual processing in bees, revealing how behaviorally driven scanning creates compressed, learnable neural codes. Together, these findings support a unified framework where perception, action and brain dynamics co-evolve to solve complex visual tasks with minimal resources -- offering powerful insights for both biology and AI.""

By bringing together findings from how insects behave, how their brains work, and what the computational models show, the study shows how studying small insect brains can uncover basic rules of intelligence. These findings not only deepen our understanding of cognition but also have significant implications for developing new technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why irregular sleep puts heart failure patients in danger","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250824031534.htm","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 15:29:56 GMT","

People recovering from heart failure should consider improving the regularity of their sleep, a study led by Oregon Health & Science University suggests.

The research team found that even moderately irregular sleep doubles the risk of having another clinical event within six months, according to a study published on August 21 in the journal JACC Advances. A clinical event could be another visit to the emergency room, hospitalization or even death.

""Going to bed and waking up at consistent times is important for overall health,"" said lead author Brooke Shafer, Ph.D., a research assistant professor in the Sleep, Chronobiology and Health Laboratory in the OHSU School of Nursing. ""Our study suggests that consistency in sleep timing may be especially important for adults with heart failure.""

Researchers enrolled 32 patients who had been hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure at OHSU Hospital and Hillsboro Medical Center from September 2022 through October 2023. For one week following hospital discharge, participants used sleep diaries to record the time they fell asleep at night, woke up in the morning and the timing of naps they took during the day.

The participants were then categorized as regular sleepers or moderately irregular sleepers, based on their sleep patterns.

The study found:

The increased risk of a clinical event for moderately irregular sleepers remained even when accounting for possible contributing factors like sleep disorders and other underlying medical conditions. The research team says the study is among the first to examine the impact of sleep regularity in the context of heart failure, and the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of maintaining a regular sleep schedule.

""Improving sleep regularity may be a low-cost therapeutic approach to mitigate adverse events in adults with heart failure,"" the authors conclude.

Shafer said the results strengthen the connection between sleep regularity and cardiovascular health.

""When we're asleep and in a resting state, our blood pressure and heart rate decrease compared with daytime levels,"" she said. ""But variability in sleep timing may disrupt mechanisms involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. Irregular sleep may contribute to adverse outcomes, especially for people already affected by heart failure.""

The next step would be to scale up the research to a larger cohort of participants and see whether improving sleep regularity lowers the risk of another clinical event, she said.

In addition to Shafer, co-authors include Shirin Hiatt, M.P.H., RN, Sophia Kogan, B.S.N., RN, Nathan Dieckmann, Ph.D., Christopher Chien, M.D., Quin Denfeld, Ph.D., RN, and Andrew McHill, Ph.D., all of OHSU; and Christopher Lee, Ph.D., RN, of Boston College.

Optical microscopy is a key technique for understanding dynamic biological processes in cells, but observing these high-speed cellular dynamics accurately, at high spatial resolution, has long been a formidable task.

Now, in an article published in Light: Science & Applications, researchers from The University of Osaka, together with collaborating institutions, have unveiled a cryo-optical microscopy technique that take a high-resolution, quantitatively accurate snapshot at a precisely selected timepoint in dynamic cellular activity. Capturing fast dynamic cellular events with spatial detail and quantifiability has been a major challenge owing to a fundamental trade-off between temporal resolution and the 'photon budget', that is, how much light can be collected for the image. With limited photons and only dim, noisy images, important features in both space and time become lost in the noise.

""Instead of chasing speed in imaging, we decided to freeze the entire scene,"" explains one of the lead authors Kosuke Tsuji. ""We developed a special sample-freezing chamber to combine the advantages of live-cell and cryo-fixation microscopy. By rapidly freezing live cells under the optical microscope, we could observe a frozen snapshot of the cellular dynamics at high resolutions.""

For instance, the team froze calcium ion wave propagation in live heart-muscle cells. The intricately detailed frozen wave was then observed in three dimensions using a super-resolution technique that cannot normally observe fast cellular dynamics due to its slow imaging acquisition speed.

""This research began with a bold shift in perspective: to arrest dynamic cellular processes during optical imaging rather than struggle to track them in motion. We believe this will serve as a powerful foundational technique, offering new insights across life-science and medical research,"" says senior author Katsumasa Fujita. One of the lead authors, Masahito Yamanaka, adds ""Our technique preserves both spatial and temporal features of live cells with instantaneous freezing, making it possible to observe their states in detail. While cells are immobilized, we can take the opportunity to perform highly accurate quantitative measurements with a variety of optical microscopy tools.""

The researchers also demonstrated how this technique improves quantification accuracy. By freezing cells labeled with a fluorescent calcium ion probe, they were able to use exposure times 1000 times longer than practical in live-cell imaging, substantially increasing the measurement accuracy.

To capture transient biological events at precisely defined moments, the researcher integrated an electrically triggered cryogen injection system. With UV light stimulation to induce calcium ion waves, this system enabled freezing of the calcium ion waves at a specific time point after the initiation of the event, with 10 ms precision. This allowed the team to arrest transient biological processes with unprecedented temporal accuracy.

Finally, the team tuned their attention to combining different imaging techniques, which are often difficult to align in time. By the near-instantaneous freezing of samples, multiple imaging modalities can now be applied sequentially without worrying about temporal mismatch. In their study, the team combined spontaneous Raman microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy on the same cryofixed cells. This allowed them to view intricate cellular information from a number of perspectives at the exact same point in time.

This innovation opens new avenues for observing fast, transient cellular events, providing researchers with a powerful tool to explore the mechanisms underlying dynamic biological processes.

A collaborative team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Ajou University in South Koreahas revealed that the unique fan-like propellers of Rhagovelia water striders -- which allow them to glide across fast-moving streams -- open and close passively, like a paintbrush, ten times faster than the blink of an eye. Inspired by this biological innovation, the team developed a revolutionary insect-scale robot that incorporates engineered self-morphing fans that mimic the agile movements of Rhagovelia bugs. This study highlights how form and function of a biological adaptation shaped by natural selection, can enhance the locomotion and endurance of both water striders and bioengineered robots without incurring additional energy costs.

An automatic fan enhances interfacial motion

Rhagovelia water striders are unique among water striders because these millimeter-sized semiaquatic insects use specialized fan-like structures on their propulsion legs that enable rapid turns and bursts of speed.

""I was intrigued the first time I saw ripple bugs while working as a postdoc at Kennesaw State University during the pandemic."" said Victor Ortega-Jimenez an integrative biologist now at the University of California, Berkeley, a lead author of the study. Ortega-Jimenez had previously studied the jumping performance of large Gerridae water striders from unsteady waters, but Rhahovelia bugs were different. ""These tiny insects were skimming and turning so rapidly across the surface of turbulent streams that they resembled flying insects. How do they do it? That question stayed with me and took more than five years of incredible collaborative work to answer it.""

Until now it was believed that these fans were powered solely by muscle action. However, a study published on August 21 in Science, reports that Rhagovelia's flat, ribbon-shaped fans can instead passively morph using surface tension and elastic forces, without relying on muscle energy.

""Observing for the first time an isolated fan passively expanding almost instantaneously upon contact with a water droplet was entirely unexpected,"" said Dr. Ortega-Jimenez.

This remarkable combination of collapsibility during leg recovery and rigidity during propulsion allows the bugs to execute sharp turns in just 50 milliseconds and move at speeds up to 120 body lengths per second, rivaling the rapid aerial maneuvers of flying flies.

Collaboration is key

When Dr. Ortega-Jimenez joined Georgia Tech in 2020 after leaving KSU, he presented the project and preliminary observations on Rhagovelia bugs to Dr. Saad Bhamla, who became fascinated and eager to explore it further. It was Dr. Bhamla who brought Dr. Je-Sung's group into the collaboration, opening new possibilities to integrate biology, physics, and robotics into the project.

""I saw a real discovery hiding in plain sight. Often, we think science is a lone genius sport, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. Modern science is all about interdisciplinary team of curious scientists working together, across borders and disciplines to study nature and engineer new bioinspired machines"" Said Dr Bhamla

This interdisciplinary effort, integrating experimental biology, fluid physics, and engineering design, continued for more than five years.

Rhagobot is born: The next generation of water strider robots

Creating an insect-size robot inspired by ripple bugs was a major challenge, particularly because the microstructural design of the fan remained a mystery. The breakthrough came when Dr. Dongjin Kim and Professor Je-Sung from Ajou University captured high-resolution images of the fan using a scanning electron microscope, that they were able to uncover the solution to this puzzle.

""We initially designed various types of cylindrical-shaped fans, which we generally think what hair looks like. However, the functional duality of the fan -- rigidity for thrust generation and flexible for collapsibility -- could not be achieved with cylindrical structures. After numerous attempts, we overcame this challenge by designing a flat-ribbon shaped fan. We strongly suspected that biological fans might share a similar morphology, and eventually discovered that the Rhagovelia fan indeed possess a flat-ribbon micro architecture, which had not been previously reported. This discovery further validated the design principle behind our artificial flat-ribbon fan."" said Dr Dongjin Kim, a postdoctoral researcher at Ajou University and also a lead author of this study.

With these insights they were able to decode the structural basis and function of this natural propulsion system and recreate it in a robotic form. The result was the engineering of a one milligram elastocapillary fan that deploys itself, which was integrated into an insect-size robot. This microrobot is capable of enhanced thrust, braking, and maneuverability, validated through experiments involving both live insects and robotic prototypes.

""Our robotic fans self-morph using nothing but water surface forces and flexible geometry -- just like their biological counterparts. It is a form of mechanical embedded intelligence refined by nature through millions of years of evolution. In small-scale robotics, these kinds of efficient and unique mechanisms would be a key enabling technology for overcoming limits in miniaturization of conventional robots."" said Professor Je-sung Koh, a senior author of the study.

The study not only establishes a direct link between fan microstructure and aquatic locomotion control, but also lays the foundation for future design of compact, semi-aquatic robots that can explore water surfaces in challenging, fast-flowing environments.

The ripple bug's fan structure, which rapidly collapses and reopens as it enters and exits water, has revealed an unprecedented biomechanical duality -- high flexibility for rapid deployment and high rigidity for thrust. This duality addresses longstanding limitations in small-scale aquatic robotics, such as inefficient stroke recovery and limited maneuvering capacity.

Sketching vortices and waves on water

It is well known that during propulsion, non-fanned water striders (e.g., those of the Gerridae family) generate characteristic dipolar vortices and capillary waves when stroking their superhydrophobic legs on the water. In contrast, fanned Rhagovelia bugs produce a distinct and complex vortical signature with each stroke, closely resembling the wake produced by flapping wings in air.

""It's as if Rhagovelia have tiny wings attached to their legs, like the Greek god Hermes,"" said Dr. Ortega-Jimenez. ""Future research is needed to determine whether ripple bugs can similarly produce lift-based thrust with their fan-like structures, in addition to drag-based propulsion.""

This possibility is intriguing, because evidence suggests that whirligig beetles and cormorants generate hydrodynamic lift for swimming propulsion via their hairy legs and webbed feet, respectively.

In addition to these vortices, Rhagovelia bugs also produce symmetrical capillary waves during leg propulsion, which appear to aid in thrust generation, along with strong bow waves that form at the front of the body.

Standing against turbulent waters

Natural streams pose a real challenge, especially for tiny animals that live and move at the interface. Ripple bugs, roughly the size of a grain of rice, must navigate highly dynamic, wavy, and turbulent waters, while escaping predators, catching prey and finding mates. The relative levels of turbulence that these insects endure daily far exceed what we typically experience during airplane turbulence. Surprisingly, twenty-four-hour monitoring of these bugs in the lab revealed their remarkable endurance.

""They literally row day and night throughout their lifespan, only pausing to molt, mate, or feed,"" said Ortega-Jimenez. These unsteady conditions found in streams represent also a significant difficulty for designing interfacial micro-robots capable of moving effectively across such unpredictable waters.

""When designing small-scale robots, it's important to account for the specific environment in which they will operate -- in this case, the water's surface. By leveraging the unique properties of that environment, a robot's performance and efficiency can be greatly enhanced. The Rhagobot, for instance, can travel quickly along a flowing stream thanks to its intelligent fan structure, which is powered by surface tension and the drag forces from the water surface."" said Jesung Koh.

Finally, these discoveries can have wide-ranging implications for bioinspired robotics, particularly in the development of environmental monitoring systems, search-and-rescue microrobots, and devices capable of navigating perturbed water-air interfaces with insect-like dexterity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Hidden Ingredients Behind AI's Creativity","https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-uncover-hidden-ingredients-behind-ai-creativity/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

We were once promised self-driving cars and robot maids. Instead, we've seen the rise of artificial intelligence systems that can beat us in chess, analyze huge reams of text, and compose sonnets. This has been one of the great surprises of the modern era: physical tasks that are easy for humans turn out to be very difficult for robots, while algorithms are increasingly able to mimic our intellect.

Another surprise that has long perplexed researchers is those algorithms' knack for their own, strange kind of creativity.

Diffusion models, the backbone of image-generating tools such as DALL·E, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion, are designed to generate carbon copies of the images on which they've been trained. In practice, however, they seem to improvise, blending elements within images to create something new—not just nonsensical blobs of color, but coherent images with semantic meaning. This is the “paradox” behind diffusion models, said Giulio Biroli, an AI researcher and physicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris: “If they worked perfectly, they should just memorize,” he said. “But they don't—they're actually able to produce new samples.”

To generate images, diffusion models use a process known as denoising. They convert an image into digital noise (an incoherent collection of pixels), then reassemble it. It's like repeatedly putting a painting through a shredder until all you have left is a pile of fine dust, then patching the pieces back together. For years, researchers have wondered: If the models are just reassembling, then how does novelty come into the picture? It's like reassembling your shredded painting into a completely new work of art.

Now two physicists have made a startling claim: It's the technical imperfections in the denoising process itself that leads to the creativity of diffusion models. In a paper presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning 2025, the duo developed a mathematical model of trained diffusion models to show that their so-called creativity is in fact a deterministic process—a direct, inevitable consequence of their architecture.

By illuminating the black box of diffusion models, the new research could have big implications for future AI research—and perhaps even for our understanding of human creativity. “The real strength of the paper is that it makes very accurate predictions of something very nontrivial,” said Luca Ambrogioni, a computer scientist at Radboud University in the Netherlands.

Mason Kamb, a graduate student studying applied physics at Stanford University and the lead author of the new paper, has long been fascinated by morphogenesis: the processes by which living systems self-assemble.

One way to understand the development of embryos in humans and other animals is through what's known as a Turing pattern, named after the 20th-century mathematician Alan Turing. Turing patterns explain how groups of cells can organize themselves into distinct organs and limbs. Crucially, this coordination all takes place at a local level. There's no CEO overseeing the trillions of cells to make sure they all conform to a final body plan. Individual cells, in other words, don't have some finished blueprint of a body on which to base their work. They're just taking action and making corrections in response to signals from their neighbors. This bottom-up system usually runs smoothly, but every now and then it goes awry—producing hands with extra fingers, for example.

When the first AI-generated images started cropping up online, many looked like surrealist paintings, depicting humans with extra fingers. These immediately made Kamb think of morphogenesis: “It smelled like a failure you'd expect from a [bottom-up] system,” he said.

AI researchers knew by that point that diffusion models take a couple of technical shortcuts when generating images. The first is known as locality: They only pay attention to a single group, or “patch,” of pixels at a time. The second is that they adhere to a strict rule when generating images: If you shift an input image by just a couple of pixels in any direction, for example, the system will automatically adjust to make the same change in the image it generates. This feature, called translational equivariance, is the model's way of preserving coherent structure; without it, it's much more difficult to create realistic images.

In part because of these features, diffusion models don't pay any attention to where a particular patch will fit into the final image. They just focus on generating one patch at a time and then automatically fit them into place using a mathematical model known as a score function, which can be thought of as a digital Turing pattern.

Researchers long regarded locality and equivariance as mere limitations of the denoising process, technical quirks that prevented diffusion models from creating perfect replicas of images. They didn't associate them with creativity, which was seen as a higher-order phenomenon.

They were in for another surprise.

Kamb started his graduate work in 2022 in the lab of Surya Ganguli, a physicist at Stanford who also has appointments in neurobiology and electrical engineering. OpenAI released ChatGPT the same year, causing a surge of interest in the field now known as generative AI. As tech developers worked on building ever-more-powerful models, many academics remained fixated on understanding the inner workings of these systems.

Mason Kamb (pictured) started his graduate work in 2022 in the lab of Surya Ganguli.

Surya Ganguli is a physicist at Stanford University.

To that end, Kamb eventually developed a hypothesis that locality and equivariance lead to creativity. That raised a tantalizing experimental possibility: If he could devise a system to do nothing but optimize for locality and equivariance, it should then behave like a diffusion model. This experiment was at the heart of his new paper, which he wrote with Ganguli as his coauthor.

Kamb and Ganguli call their system the equivariant local score (ELS) machine. It is not a trained diffusion model, but rather a set of equations which can analytically predict the composition of denoised images based solely on the mechanics of locality and equivariance. They then took a series of images that had been converted to digital noise and ran them through both the ELS machine and a number of powerful diffusion models, including ResNets and UNets.

The results were “shocking,” Ganguli said: Across the board, the ELS machine was able to identically match the outputs of the trained diffusion models with an average accuracy of 90 percent—a result that's “unheard of in machine learning,” Ganguli said.

The results appear to support Kamb's hypothesis. “As soon as you impose locality, [creativity] was automatic; it fell out of the dynamics completely naturally,” he said. The very mechanisms which constrained diffusion models' window of attention during the denoising process—forcing them to focus on individual patches, regardless of where they'd ultimately fit into the final product—are the very same that enable their creativity, he found. The extra-fingers phenomenon seen in diffusion models was similarly a direct by-product of the model's hyperfixation on generating local patches of pixels without any kind of broader context.

Experts interviewed for this story generally agreed that although Kamb and Ganguli's paper illuminates the mechanisms behind creativity in diffusion models, much remains mysterious. For example, large language models and other AI systems also appear to display creativity, but they don't harness locality and equivariance.

“I think this is a very important part of the story,” Biroli said, “[but] it's not the whole story.”

For the first time, researchers have shown how the creativity of diffusion models can be thought of as a by-product of the denoising process itself, one that can be formalized mathematically and predicted with an unprecedentedly high degree of accuracy. It's almost as if neuroscientists had put a group of human artists into an MRI machine and found a common neural mechanism behind their creativity that could be written down as a set of equations.

The comparison to neuroscience may go beyond mere metaphor: Kamb and Ganguli's work could also provide insight into the black box of the human mind. “Human and AI creativity may not be so different,” said Benjamin Hoover, a machine learning researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and IBM Research who studies diffusion models. “We assemble things based on what we experience, what we've dreamed, what we've seen, heard, or desire. AI is also just assembling the building blocks from what it's seen and what it's asked to do.” Both human and artificial creativity, according to this view, could be fundamentally rooted in an incomplete understanding of the world: We're all doing our best to fill in the gaps in our knowledge, and every now and then we generate something that's both new and valuable. Perhaps this is what we call creativity.

Whatever you think about Digital Rights Management software, it's hard to argue with the fact that it's annoying. Such technology exists, in theory, to protect the intellectual property of the companies that create music, movies, and games, but it can also get in the way of you enjoying books, music, and videos the way you want to.

Say, for example, that you bought a bunch of books on the Amazon Kindle platform but later decided you wanted to switch to a Kobo device (or vice versa). The DRM systems on both platforms are designed to prevent you from migrating your books from one platform to the other, meaning you might need to pay again just to read a book on the Kobo you already paid for on the Kindle.

Software exists that can remove this DRM. It requires doing some research and jumping through some technical hoops, but it could save you from having to buy the same media a second time. But is it legal?

Let's rip off the Band-Aid: The act of removing DRM from any kind of copyrighted work is broadly illegal in the US under section 1201 of title 17, United States Code, which was passed with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998.

The rule is pretty clearly written: “No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.”

I asked to Derek Bambauer, a law professor at the University or Florida who specializes in internet law, cybersecurity, and intellectual property, whether there are any exceptions to this. Bambauer tells me there is very little legal ambiguity here.

“Exceptions are in there, but they're really narrow,” he says, emphasizing that First Amendment arguments tend not to work where intellectual property is concerned.

But will removing DRM from a file you paid for end up with you going to jail or being sued? Maybe not, says Bambauer, as companies typically don't bother pursing it.

“We all kind of casually violate copyright constantly,” he says, mentioning that the photocopied comic strips on his office door are technically a violation. With finite resources, the owners of intellectual property simple can't sue everyone. “Companies tend to only go after people who are distributing copyrighted works with others.”

“If the DRM removal is just for personal consumption, it's hard to detect,” Bambauer says, “and it's not worth it for companies go after that. One, the music industry tried that, and it was a horrible failure. And two, it's just a lot easier to go after the creators and distributors of the tools.”

And that's what companies do: attempt to shut down or block the distribution of software that removes DRM from files. Bambauer says this is the reason most of such software tends to be made by people outside the US and is distributed on websites outside US jurisdiction. He also emphasized that sharing files with others after removing the DRM is far more likely to attract lawsuits from companies.

“At the point where the idea is now what I want to do is I am not just a consumer, but I'm a distributor, that usually is where the copyright owners get unhappy,” he says.

So, it's illegal to remove DRM from files you paid for. But if you're just doing it for personal use and you're not sharing the files, there is less cause for concern.

The law, at least in the United States, is pretty clear. But that doesn't mean there aren't people who feel like removing DRM is ethically justified.

“When Walmart sells you a book, that doesn't mean they get to dictate whose bookcase you shelve it on, whose armchair you sit in while you read it, or whose lightbulb goes in your reading lamp,” Cory Doctorow, author, WIRED contributor, and longtime DRM critic, tells me over email. “It's obscene madness to say that the company that sells you a book in any form would arrogate to itself the right to decide how you read or listen to.”

The argument goes that if you buy a paper book, a CD, or a DVD, you're free to do what you want with it, and consumers should expect digital goods to work the same way.

“No one who publishes or sells a book can pretend to be surprised that the social contract for a book goes like this: 'When you buy a book, it's yours to read as you see fit; to lend to a friend; to give away,'” said Doctorow. “The fact that the book is pixels on a screen or bits on a solid-state drive doesn't change that, no matter what the asinine law says, no matter what the greedy tech bro sociopaths claim, no matter what the cartel of financialized giant publishers insist.”

That's the basics of an ethical argument: that physical media is easy to use however you want, and digital media should work the same. And it's worth noting that some ebook distributors, publishers, and authors (including Doctorow) opt to distribute their works free of any kind of DRM.

There are other arguments that could be made in favor of removing DRM. Bambauer says most people wouldn't object to removing DRM to enable the use of assistive technologies; archivists argue that DRM makes the work of preserving culture unnecessarily difficult.

This is all just to say that there is a difference between what is legally justifiable and what is ethically justifiable. Ultimately you have to weight these frameworks for yourself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","What Is the Magnetic Constant and Why Does It Matter?","https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-magnetic-constant-and-why-does-it-matter/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

In physics, we have a bunch of constants that are used in models to explain how the world works. These are fixed numbers that we plug into equations along with our variables. For example, the universal gravitational constant is used in predicting the motion of any falling object. That's G = 6.6743 × 10−11 m3/kg⋅s2.

What's so weird about these constants is that they have very precise values that seem kind of random. I mean, why 6.6743 and not 6.6744? All we know is that they work. They're not derived theoretically, just measured, with more and more precision over time as our instruments improve.

Last week I talked about the electric constant, also known rather whimsically as the “permittivity of free space.” It determines (among other things) how electrons and protons interact to form molecules—kind of a big deal for the existence of life, the universe, and you know, everything.

Today we're looking at the magnetic constant, or the permeability of free space. It determines the strength of magnetic fields in a vacuum (and by extension in air). It's also a pretty big deal. For starters, without magnetic fields, there'd be no light in the universe, since light is electromagnetic radiation.

In fact, electric and magnetic forces are intrinsically connected, and humans have learned how to harness this interaction to do all kinds of cool things like powering electric motors and generating electricity. Let's see how it works!

First I have to fess up. I said the values of constants are measured, not derived. That's not always entirely true. For instance, the speed of light (c) is considered a fundamental constant, but it's related to the electric constant (ε0) and the magnetic constant (μ0)—the permittivity and permeability of free space—as shown by this equation:

This means these three values can't be independent; if you know two of them, you can derive the third. How do physicists deal with this? We define the speed of light as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. (How do we know it's exact? Because we define a meter as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.) Then we measure the magnetic constant (μ0) and use that value along with the speed of light to calculate the electric constant (ε0).

Maybe that seems like cheating, but to even start doing actual science, at some point we have to make up arbitrary units and define some parameters. In fact, when you come down to it, all systems of measurement are made up, just like all words are made up.

Magnetic fields (represented by the symbol B) can be created by magnets, as shown in the photo up top. But because of that interdependence we talked about, they can also be made by moving electrical charges. (I'm using the shorthand term “charges” for charged particles, like electrons.) This is described by the Biot-Savart law:

You can see the magnetic constant (μ0) in there. We also have the value of the electric charge (q) moving with a certain velocity (v). So this says the magnetic field increases with the electric charge and decreases with the distance (r) from the moving charge—and the magnetic constant tells us precisely how much it varies.

Of course, we don't deal with individual moving electrons very often. But we deal with streams of moving electrons all the time: That's electric current, which we can measure. If we know the charge on the particles in coulombs, then the number of coulombs flowing per second gives us the current (I) in amperes. And we can write the equation above in terms of current: B = μ0I/(2πr).

What this tells us is that electric current generates a magnetic field. This is used in all kinds of machines. For instance, it gives us electromagnets, where the magnetic force can be turned on and off to move metal objects in factories and scrapyards. It's also how audio speakers create sound: An electric signal vibrates a magnetic driver, which generates pressure waves in the air.

Also magnetic fields influence electric currents. This is how motors work. There's a current running through a coil of wire in the presence of a magnetic field that's usually created with some permanent magnets. The force on the coil of wire causes it to turn, and there's your motor. It could be a fan motor, part of your AC compressor, or the main drive for an electric car.

Wait! There's more. Just as a changing electric field creates a magnetic field, a changing magnetic field creates an electric field—and that produces an electric current. This is how most of our power is generated. Some energy source—steam, wind, moving water, whatever—spins a turbine that rotates a coil within a magnetic field. The changing magnetic flux induces a voltage in the coil, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy that can be transmitted to your home.

How can we measure μ0? One method uses what's called a current balance. A simple version of this has two parallel wires carrying electric current (I) in opposite directions, as shown in the diagram below. Then you suspend the two wires with strings so that they can move apart, like this:

The current in each wire creates a magnetic field at the location of the other wire, and this pushes them apart. As they move away, the magnetic force decreases and the horizontal component of the tension in the support string increases (because of the change in angle). Once these two forces are equal, the wires will be “balanced.”

If you know the value of the electric current and the distance between the wires (r), you can determine the magnetic constant, μ0. Then, as we showed above, you can use this value along with the defined speed of light to calculate the electric constant, ε0.

So yeah, all in all, you could say the magnetic constant is pretty important. Oh, and what is that constant value? According to the International Committee for Weights and Measures, μ0 = 1.256637061272 × 10–6 N/A2. No more, no less.

The Nintendo 64 was a fantastic console, home to generation-defining games such as Super Mario 64 and GoldenEye 007. With its four built-in controller ports, it revolutionized multiplayer gaming in front of the TV, and it was the first mainstream console to introduce an analog stick, essential for navigating the burgeoning 3D worlds the medium was starting to deliver.

Unfortunately, the controller it did all that with was an abomination, an unholy three-pronged monstrosity that earned my lifelong disdain. Fast-forward roughly three decades, though, and third-party peripheral maker 8BitDo has improved on the original N64 pad in almost every way with its new 64 Bluetooth Controller.

8BitDo's pad is chiefly designed for the Analogue3D, an upcoming field programmable gate array (FPGA) console set to play original N64 cartridges, but it can be paired to practically any Bluetooth-enabled device, from PCs to smartphones to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 consoles, where it can be used to play the digital N64 game library included for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.

Aesthetically, traditionalists may lament the lack of the original N64 pad's pops of color, but they have a sleek elegance to them. Intended to mirror the similarly monochrome Analogue3D, 8BitDo's efforts match perfectly, while also looking like a fitting companion to Nintendo's official Switch 2 Pro Controller. Functionally, this takes everything that made Nintendo's original controller so groundbreaking and repackages it into a modern unit that, crucially, fits into the average human's two hands. Every input is present and accounted for, accurate down to icons and fonts.

The 64 Bluetooth Controller massively improves the orientation, though. The original Z-Trigger, once on the underside of the official controller's middle prong, is now two shoulder buttons, sitting where the L2/R2 triggers do on a PlayStation grip, while the analog stick is shunted to the left, comparable to an Xbox controller's left stick. The result is that every input is within easy reach, eliminating the need to juggle your grip. It also introduces some welcome 21st-century upgrades, like making the thumbstick drift-proof thanks to Hall effect tech, and baking in haptic feedback, eliminating the need for a separate Rumble Pak.

The thumbstick is the star, feeling incredibly precise thanks to both Hall effect sensors and retaining the eight-way “gate” at its base, the octagonal notches allowing it to snap satisfyingly into place. Expect effortless combos in 1080° Snowboarding, precise shots in Perfect Dark, and smooth flying in Starfox. The staff of the stick is also wider, shorter, and made of metal, making it feel far sturdier than that of the original pad. While the top of the stick reproduces the trio of raised concentric rings and subtle concave dip for your thumb to rest on, it's rubberized now, rather than slippery plastic, making for a surer grip.

The A and B buttons are slightly flatter than on the N64 pad—another subtle tweak, but one that feels great. The quadrant of C buttons is essentially unchanged, although they lack the actual “C” ident in the middle of them—one of the few bits of original iconography 8BitDo hasn't replicated.

The L and R shoulder buttons are chunkier than the thin strips of the N64 pads, while dual Z-Triggers prove a smart choice, and not only for the physical symmetry and balance it gives the 227-gram pad. When paired to a Switch or Switch 2, the right-side Z is seen as the ZR button, allowing you to bring up the system menu in NSO, or long-press for the rewind feature.

The only quibble is the D-Pad. Physically, it's another perfect recreation of an original component, but functionally, it feels too twitchy. In menu screens, it can hop across too many items at once, while in games like the surprisingly tough pill-positioning puzzler Dr. Mario 64, played through NSO, it would regularly shift pills too many spaces. Good thing that rewind feature is so accessible.

The 8BitDo 64's revamped layout introduces a few quirks, though most are due to muscle memory clashes. Modern players may reach for a right thumbstick that isn't there, while nostalgic N64 players will have to mentally remap their play styles. This leads to oddities in a couple of games—on Zelda: Majora's Mask, for instance, you move between inventory screens with the Z and R buttons. This made sense on the N64 pad, as you held the middle and right-hand prongs, but with the improved layout of the 64 BC, it feels more natural to go for L and R. Having those Z-Triggers immediately within reach means it's easily overcome, though.

A concession to modernity is 8BitDo's own trio of Star, Select, and Home buttons, sitting above Start. When paired to a Switch or Switch 2, Star acts as the screenshot button, while Home—8BitDo's eight-pixel heart logo—takes you to the Switch base menu or, with a long-press, brings up the console sleep menu. Expect similar functions when connected to an Analogue3D.

The Select button unlocks the controller's built-in Turbo mode and button-remapping features. For Turbo, hold the button you want to assign it to and tap select (or twice for Auto Turbo), allowing each press to send a constant active signal. Using it to have Mario hop around like a jackrabbit is simply funny, but it's actually useful in shooters. Remapping, meanwhile, lets you swap the function of any two buttons—hold both of them down and press Select, and they'll invert. Not an essential feature, but one that's nice to have, especially if a particular game's controls feel a bit off to you personally.

The real elegance of this pad is in what it doesn't do, though. Everything you need to play N64 games as they were intended is right here. There's no second thumbstick because it'd be redundant—modern camera controls didn't exist for those games. The C buttons were often used by developers for camera movement instead, and they're exactly where they should be. The Start button is still proudly in place, rather than leaving you guessing whether a Home or Menu button—which have largely supplanted Start on modern controllers—might replicate its function. This really feels like the perfect way to play N64.

8BitDo's take on the N64 controller has one big negative—while it pairs easily with the original Switch, it's not initially compatible with Switch 2. Given the huge success of Nintendo's latest console and the availability of N64 games on it through NSO, that's a problem. It's also not terribly clear to the average person how to fix it—store listings for the controller are littered with buyers complaining it doesn't work with their new console.

Thankfully, updating the firmware gets it working with the Switch 2, but it's not straightforward. First, you'll need to download 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2, a management tool for all of the manufacturer's gadgets (available for PC or Mac, although the 64 Bluetooth Controller itself isn't stated as compatible with Apple devices). However, this isn't an installable program. Instead, it comes as a zip folder containing the raw .exe file, which Windows Defender promptly blocks. In my experience, it's safe to override the warning and run the software. From there, flick the mode select toggle on the 64 controller's rear to “D,” connect it with a USB cable, and it should be auto-detected, allowing you to update the firmware to v1.3.

Once done, actually pairing the 64 controller to Switch 2 is another hurdle. You'll need to turn the console on with an existing controller, go into the controllers section on the lower home screen menu, then select “Change Grip/Order.” Flick the mode toggle to “S,” then turn it on by holding the Start button. Activate pairing mode by holding the small sync button at the top, and the console should see it straight away, recognizing it as Nintendo's official N64 replica controller.

Unfortunately, 8BitDo's controller doesn't stay synced between play sessions, nor can it turn the Switch or Switch 2 on from Sleep mode, meaning you'll have to pair it every single time. It's mercifully quick once you've done the one-time firmware update, but unquestionably frustrating—made more so by the 64 Bluetooth Controller seemly being unable to navigate the NSO game selection menu unless it's set as the primary controller.

The rigmarole is worth it, though (and won't be an issue with the Analogue3D, which it should stay synced to), as the 64 Bluetooth Controller is an absolute joy to play N64 games with. Its refined layout feels like the configuration Nintendo was trying to land on back in the '90s, allowing all those genuinely innovative design ideas to shine, while sitting in the hand with all the comfort of the present-day Switch 2 Pro Controller. Connection issues aside, it's a rare case of a remake being better than the original—after a few hours with this, you'll never want to use the original trident pad ever again.

Elon Musk's xAI has made an older version of its AI model Grok — specifically, the model weights used to shape Grok 2.5 —  available on the open source platform Hugging Face.

“The @xAI Grok 2.5 model, which was our best model last year, is now open source,” Musk wrote on X. He added that Grok 3 “will be made open source in about 6 months.”

AI engineer Tim Kellogg described the Grok license as “custom with some anti-competitive terms.”

Grok, which is prominently featured on X (which in turn recently merged with xAI), has created considerable controversy this year, particularly after the chatbot seemed to become obsessed with “white genocide” conspiracy theories, expressed skepticism about the Holocaust's death toll, and described itself as “MechaHitler,” leading xAI to publish its system prompts on GitHub.

And while Musk described the latest version, Grok 4, as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” the model appears to consult Musk's social media account before answering controversial questions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","A Treasure Trove of Key Minerals Is Being Wasted in the U.S., Study Claims","https://gizmodo.com/a-treasure-trove-of-key-minerals-is-being-wasted-in-the-u-s-study-claims-2000646858","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:01:05 GMT","

The United States is home to dozens of active mines. Some extract copper, while others dig for iron. Whatever the resource, however, it usually makes up a small fraction of the rock pulled from the ground. The rest is typically ignored. Wasted.

“We're only producing a few commodities,” said Elizabeth Holley, a professor of mining engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. “The question is: What else is in those rocks?”

The answer: a lot.

In a study published today by the journal Science, Holley and her colleagues aimed to quantify what else is in those rocks. They found that, across 70 critical elements at 54 active mines, the potential for recovery is enormous. There is enough lithium in one year of U.S. mine waste, for example, to power 10 million electric vehicles. For manganese, it's enough for 99 million. Those figures far surpass both U.S. import levels of those elements and current demand for them.

Critical minerals are essential to the production of lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and other low- or zero-carbon technologies powering the clean energy transition. Where the U.S. gets those minerals has long been a politically fraught topic.

The vast majority of lithium comes from Australia, Chile, and China, for example, while cobalt predominantly comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While securing a domestic supply of rare or critical materials has been a U.S. policy goal for decades, the push has intensified in recent years. Former president Joe Biden's landmark climate legislation, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, included incentives for domestic critical mineral production, and this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order invoking wartime powers that would allow more leasing and extraction on federal lands.

“Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers' mineral production,” the order read. “It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.”

Trump also made critical minerals a cornerstone of continued support to Ukraine. Meanwhile, China recently expanded export controls on rare earth metals, underscoring the precarious nature of the global market.

Holley's research indicates that increased domestic byproduct recovery could address this instability. Even a 1 percent recovery rate, it found, would “substantially reduce” import reliance for most elements. Recovering 4 percent of lithium would completely offset current imports.

“We could focus on mines that are already corporate and simply add additional circuits to their process,” said Holley. “It would be a really quick way of bringing a needed mineral into production.”

This latest research is “very valuable,” said Hamidreza Samouei, a professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University who wasn't involved in the study. He sees it as a great starting point for a multipronged approach to tackling the byproduct problem and moving toward a zero-waste system. Other areas that will need attention, he said, include looking beyond discarded rock to the “huge” amounts of water that a mine uses. He also believes that the government should play a more aggressive policy and regulatory role in pushing for critical mineral recovery.

“Mining is a very old-fashioned industry,” said Samouei. “Who is going to take the risk?”

The Department of Energy recently announced a byproduct recovery pilot program, and the Pentagon took a $400 million stake in the operator of the country's only rare-earth metal mine. At the same time, Congress recently repealed large chunks of the Inflation Reduction Act, which would have driven demand for critical minerals, and has slashed federal funding to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Energy's Office of Science, among other research arms.

The general thrust of the Science study is “not new,” said Isabel Barton, a professor of geological engineering at the University of Arizona. “It is a very hot topic in mining these days.”

The attention is contributing to a burgeoning shift in thinking, from an intense focus on the target mineral to consideration of what else could be produced, including critical minerals. “There are some that are probably relatively simple. There are others that are heinously difficult to get to,” said Barton, and whether a mineral is recovered will ultimately come down to cost. “Mining companies are there to make a profit.”

Figuring out the most economically viable way forward is exactly the next step Holley hopes this research will inform. Byproduct potential varies considerably by mine, and the analysis, she said, can help pinpoint where to potentially find which minerals. For instance, the Red Dog mine in Alaska appears to have the largest germanium potential in the country, while nickel could be found at the Stillwater and East Boulder mines in Montana.

“The [research and development] funding on critical minerals has been a little bit of a scattershot,” she said. “Our paper allows the development of a strategy.”

When searching for the unknown, classic physics wisdom holds that a bigger detector boosts the chances of discovery. A physicist is taking that advice to heart, advancing a bold plan to use none other than Ganymede—Jupiter's largest moon—as a dark matter detector on an astronomical scale.

Dark matter refers to the “invisible” mass that supposedly constitutes 85% of the universe. There's considerable evidence that dark matter exists, but it's “dark,” meaning it doesn't respond to light and very weakly interacts with other matter. The search for dark matter has tested the limits of physicists' creativity, but a proposal by William DeRocco, a physicist at the University of Maryland, may be the most extraordinary yet. In a preprint submitted to arXiv, Rocco suggests that Ganymede's craters may store evidence of dark matter particles, which spacecraft like NASA's Europa Clipper or ESA's JUICE could observe during their respective missions.

The paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, proposes that massive dark matter particles could have struck and penetrated Ganymede's thick, icy surface, leaving deep, broad ruptures. Unlike the comparatively small-sized candidates for dark matter that ground-based detectors are searching for, these particles would be much larger. These extra-large dark matter particles would create “dark matter craters”—smaller dents on Ganymede's surface comprised of distinctive minerals pulled to the surface from deep inside the moon's oceans. 

“If you used something like ground-penetrating radar, you might be able to see this column of melted ice going all the way down through the ice,” DeRocco explained in an interview with New Scientist. Studying Ganymede's surface with this proposal in mind could uncover some unexpected insights about cosmic dark matter, according to the paper.

In principle, the proposal sounds promising, Bradley Kavanaugh, an astrophysicist at the University of Cantabria in Spain who was not involved in the study, also told New Scientist. At the same time—like all dark matter experiments—there is still no definitive evidence that such heavy, massive dark matter particles actually exist.

If all of this sounds bonkers, I don't blame you. Still, it's important to remember that, as many physicists are keen to point out, solving a physics mystery often means testing bold, unconventional ideas. And while there's no decisive evidence that this particular proposal is correct, there isn't any evidence to discount it, either. We'll have to wait and see if NASA or ESA takes up DeRocco's idea, and if they do, whether Ganymede really does have a surface dotted with dark matter craters.

Battlestar Galacta alum Katee Sackhoff has been in genre TV for years. After voicing cultist turned mercenary/freedom fighter Bo-Katan Kryze for Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Rebels, she reprised the role in the live-action series The Mandalorian. She's gotten to play Bo several times since then, but as the actor herself tells it, coming back to that role hasn't been without its challenges.

In the latest episode of her podcast, Sackhoff told her Battlestar co-worker Tahmoh Penikett how she lost “all of my confidence” after filming The Mandalorian. “I've always played two steps removed from myself, [and] it always felt grounded in some part of my belly, of who I was,” she explained. Her usual acting method has been to go with her “first instinct, play the reality of the situation,” but that wasn't the case with Bo-Katan. Playing the character in live-action made her realize how much Bo is “nowhere near who I am as a human being. As much as I stood her, I never identified with her, and I didn't know how to find her.”

Sackhoff went on to say Bo-Katan “broke” her, enough to keep her from further acting in the past three years. She credits an acting coach and a new manager with helping her turn things around; the former reaffirmed her talent and said she just “need to get you back in your belly. You just need to find your confidence again.” As of this year, Sackhoff's done voice work for Warner Bros.' animated Watchmen duology and showed up in this year's Fight or Flight, and she's also in Prime Video's upcoming Carrie series.

Star Wars-wise, it's unclear whether she'll appear in The Mandalorian & Grogu or the second season of Ahsoka, both of which Bo-Katan is some connections to. The show is currently in production, while the film is due May 22, 2026.

A South Korean man was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand on Saturday, accused of laundering over $50 million worth of cryptocurrency into physical gold bars in the span of just three months.

The man, identified by Thai authorities only as “Han,” was allegedly a key figure in a call-center fraud network that lured victims in with promises of 30-50% returns on investment. Authorities say the victims were paid off initially in small amounts to build trust before they started facing withdrawal limits later on.

Meanwhile, Han allegedly amassed 47.3 million in Tether, a stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. He allegedly used the digital funds to purchase gold bars, each weighing more than 10 kilograms or 22 pounds, with each transaction worth more than $1 million. 

Police said the gold bars were used to convert the illicit crypto funds into a tangible commodity that the scammers could move across borders without being detected.

After victims started filing complaints, the Thai Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Han and his operatives in February. Eleven people, including Han, have been arrested so far with involvement in the scam, according to Thai media. 

Thai police apprehend Han at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, and are charging him with fraud, impersonation, computer crimes, money laundering, and participation in a criminal syndicate.

Victims around the world lost a whopping $10.7 billion to crypto scams in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs data. The report found that global crypto scams overall were up 456% over the past year. Experts advise people to use caution in their approach to cryptocurrency or even to avoid it altogether.

Crypto has particularly turbocharged cross-border scams: the borderless, instantaneous, and anonymous nature of crypto transactions facilitates these criminal operations, while the deals evade the usual regulatory oversight of other cross-border financial transactions.

The news also comes as the Thai government makes a huge bet on crypto in hopes to revamp its tourism industry. 

Earlier this week, Thailand announced an 18-month pilot program that would allow tourists to convert crypto into the local currency, the Thai baht, via Thai-based crypto exchange platforms to make payments to local businesses. 

The Thai Finance Ministry said that they will be capping the conversions at 550,000 baht, roughly equal to almost $17 thousand to prevent money laundering, Reuters reported.

Han's home country of South Korea is also no stranger to multi-million dollar cryptocurrency investment scams. Just less than a year ago, South Korean police arrested more than 200 people for stealing more than $228 million in a crypto scam that has since been deemed the largest in the country's history.

Season two of The Last of Us came and went earlier this year, and we already know its third season is on the horizon. Whereas the first two seasons were a team effort between showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann and writer Hailey Gross, this next season will have Mazin as sole showrunner and writer—Druckmann, who also runs game developer Naughty Dog, is devoting his time to the studio's next project, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.

In a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Mazin discussed his writing process, which he said won't change now that his co-writers have exited the show. According to him, not much is going to change, since Druckmann's “always had a full-time job running Naughty Dog, so it's always been me up in Canada [where the production is].” Before Druckmann and Gross left, Mazin got “so much” out of them while working on the first two seasons, and they'd already been thinking about the future while working on the second season.

“We really did get that work in. You can't really tell half that story without thinking about what the whole story could be,” Mazin continued, referencing adapting only half of The Last of Us Part II. When the show returns, audiences will see things from Abby's (Kaitlyn Dever) point of view before, during, and after the previous season. If you thought season was too short at seven episodes, the third may have more. Mazin told THR he and HBO are “currently fiddling around” with the specifics, but he's looking at making this next season “more on par” with the first's nine episodes to provide “more bang for the buck.”

Mazin didn't just create and write the show, he's also directed the first episode of each season. He revealed directing the premieres can be easy and allow for a full season prep, and now that that he's sole showrunner, it's on him to ensure “everything is fitting together tonally. We have directors alternating, and I'm on set doing—I don't know what you'd call it—'showrunner QC' sounds insulting to our directors, who are amazing.” He's open to helming more than the premiere next season, but admitted it would be “hard to go prep something while I'm also still writing. We'll see if I can get away with directing more than one [episode].”

The Last of Us is set to return for season three in 2027, so we've got time before we know how many episodes it'll have, what it'll change or update for Abby's side of the story, and how much longer it'll go on.

Hi-fi audio is a funny thing. Someone could say the words “high fidelity” until you're both blue in the face, but it's hard to understand unless you hear it for yourself. I mean, how high is high, anyway? Great audio is as high as your frame of reference is, and if you're like most people and you're used to sticking AirPods in your ears and calling it a day, then that's your baseline. But not everyone is so easily wooed by Apple's ecosystem, and for those baptized in the expensive waters of hi-fi audio, the ceiling is damn near cathedral-length. With that extra headroom, however, comes an even loftier hit to your wallet. But how good can Panasonic's $299 Technics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds that cost more than Apple's ubiquitous white buds really sound?

I got a chance to test out the EAH-AZ100, and at the risk of spoiling the surprise here, I can tell you that they sound pretty freaking next level. At the core of that great sound are proprietary magnetic fluid drivers, which are as cool in theory as they are in practice. I wouldn't usually bother to get into the nitty-gritty of how drivers work, but in this case I think it's worth explaining to make you appreciate these buds' uniqueness.

Technics EAH-AZ100

The Technics EAH-AZ100 are costly wireless earbuds that are worth every penny.

Pros

Cons

When it comes to sound quality, mitigating distortion is the name of the game. Distortion happens in a number of ways, but usually distorted sound emanates from some kind of deficiency in the driver. That deficiency can be the result of materials, design, and other factors, but Panasonic's magnetic fluid drivers focus on one thing in particular, which is stability, so to speak. While most wireless earbud drivers will vibrate in random directions while pumping out sound, causing distortion along the way, the EAH-AZ100's drivers are immersed in an oil-like substance with magnetic particles that prevent unwanted movement and the dreaded distortion that happens. The results? I'm not going to lie, they're impressive.

I listened to almost the entirety of one of my favorite rock albums of the past five years (Geese's “3D Country”), and it felt like hearing some of those songs for the first time. Distorted guitars are perfectly crunchy, bass and low end are natural-sounding and don't feel oversimulated, and vocals are clear, crisp, and nuanced. I switched genres and listened to hip-hop (Milo's song, “Tiptoe”), and the same held true. In fact, across all the genres I tested these wireless earbuds on—indie rock, folk, hip-hop, and electronic—they sounded great. Even though I was listening to compressed audio files on Spotify, it felt like I was one step closer to hearing songs like those artists intended when they entered the studio. I also happened to be testing Bose's second-gen QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds at the same time and can say confidently that the Technics EAH-AZ100 win in the clarity department and by a noticeable margin.

See EAH-AZ100 at Amazon

Another major selling point for the EAH-AZ100 is very long battery life. Panasonic advertises 10 hours of juice on these earbuds outside the case with active noise cancellation (ANC) on. That's an impressive number when looking at the rest of the field, especially wireless earbuds that cost half the price and typically get between 6 and 6.5 hours of ANC playback. Fortunately, I was able to put that lofty battery claim to the test since I had a long flight from New York to Arizona (with a layover) and can also say confidently that these buds have the longevity that's advertised.

I used the EAH-AZ100s all day on and off and didn't have to charge the wireless earbuds once, which is a perk that can't be overstated when you're trying to block out noise from crying babies on a flight. With the case, you get 18 hours of total battery life according to Panasonic, and on that front I'll have to take their word since I still haven't had to charge these things since I started testing. Either way, 10 hours is a lot of juice for wireless earbuds with ANC on and helps justify the $299 price tag. Another big point for Panasonic here.

Speaking of being on a flight, I also put the EAH-AZ100 to the test when it comes to ANC. With crying babies nearby, I relied on the EAH-AZ100 to help safeguard my sanity, and they performed… admirably. These aren't going to win any medals from me on the ANC front (Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds still take the cake here), but they held their own when it comes to noise cancellation, especially when tested against a boss as scary as the in-flight baby scream. If you're looking for ANC as elite as the sound and battery life, you may be a little let down, though.

If you're going to be wearing wireless earbuds for a long time (like 10 hours), another thing you may want to know is how they feel in your ears, and fortunately, they feel pretty damn comfy. A lot of times, wearing wireless earbuds (especially on a plane where pressure is a big factor) will get to me after a while, but I found the EAH-AZ100 to be more tolerable than most for long periods. If you don't find them to be a good fit, Panasonic also includes four other eartip sizes in the box (XS, S, ML, L), but I just used the pre-installed eartips, and they fit my ears well.

There are some things about these wireless earbuds that I won't be writing home about, but that doesn't mean they're bad in any way, just not as excellent as the sound or the battery life. One of those things is the touch controls, which work just okay. A quirk you should be aware of is that the case does not have a pairing button, so in order to pair the buds to a device, you have to take them out, put them in your ears, and then hold down on the outsides of each with your finger to initiate a Bluetooth connection. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but I prefer a button, which is simple and universal and not something you have to figure out by reading a manual on an airplane.

Another thing I'm not particularly compelled by is the design. I like the smooth metal the buds and case are made out of, but the look doesn't do much for me. That being said, the shape (bulb-like) is likely a product of the use of a magnetic fluid driver, which is incredible at conveying clear hi-fi sound, so I can't complain too much there. Substance over style is a choice I'm okay with. Like other wireless earbuds, there's also a companion app for controlling ANC levels, switching modes, spatial audio, and custom EQ, which are all things I would expect from a premium-priced pair of earbuds since competitors that are half the cost also have those things. The EAH-AZ100 have an ambient mode, which works fine, though Bose's QuietComfort Ultra is still nicer in my opinion.

Ultimately, those are all just icing-on-the-cake-type categories, though. If you're going to buy wireless earbuds like this, it's because you want them to sound really, really, really freaking good, and to that end, Panasonic absolutely nails it. These are some of the best-sounding wireless earbuds I've ever shoved into my ears, and it's not too often that I feel spoiled on that front, nor is it often that I can say a pair of earbuds sounds better than over-ear headphones of a similar price. If you're looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that focus hard on that important stuff (sound, battery life, and comfort) and still deliver dutifully on the rest (ANC, features, and controls), then I can say with confidence that the Technics EAH-AZ100 could be the pick for you.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is back in Taiwan for weighty negotiations with contract chipmaker TSMC. The talks are thought to be related to the new China-specific B30 chips using the Blackwell architecture. No matter the gravity of the talks, though, the Nvidia head enjoys a very cordial relationship with CC Wei, the CEO of TSMC. Their warm relationship is made clearly apparent in a video showing the two billionaires joking about who will pay the bill for dinner.

But first, some trillion-dollar chip company CEO humor.TSMC CEO C.C. Wei: We have the honor for $4 trillion guy to be my guest. More than $4 trillion, huh?Jensen: Still, you're paying for dinnerC.C. Wei: No problem, if you agree with my wafer pricing pic.twitter.com/Y3iBtoVhqyAugust 23, 2025

With these incredibly serious negotiations probably still some way to go, the two tech leaders enjoyed dinner in Taipei. In the video, you can see them standing closely with Huang's arm around Wei's shoulders.

After Huang's introduction, and explanation that he has been in meetings with “TSMC's world-class leaders,” earlier in the day, Wei took his turn to speak. “Let me say that we have the honor to have this four trillion NT guy to be my guest.” The sum of four trillion NT Dollars is about USD $130 billion, and is obviously a reference to Huang's fortune.

Then, Wei started to ruminate about the precise value of his fellow CEO's wealth, only to be told by Huang to “stop that!” And, as a quick retort to hide his embarrassment, the Nvidia CEO shot back “Still, you're paying for dinner!”

We get a sense, next, that negotiations are not yet finalized. Wei responded to the dinner bill tease by saying that he was “not bothered [about the bill], as long as you agree with my wafer price.” The video segment ends with the Nvidia CEO laughing, “I agree with your wafer price.”



Huang flew into Taipei on Friday on a private jet and is quoted by a Reuters report as stating, “My main purpose coming here is to visit TSMC.” That report shares some insight regarding the underlying purpose of this visit. It is hinted that it might be related to China's caution about buying more H20 chips, and Nvidia's plans to tailor a new AI chip for China – the purported B30.

Also, according to Reuters, Huang was in Taiwan to thank TSMC for the successful tape out of six brand-new chips, including a GPU and a photonics processor for Rubin-architecture supercomputers. Every one of those chips is “new and revolutionary,” claimed the Nvidia CEO.

AM4 lives on.

AMD launched the Ryzen 5 5500X3D a few months ago, but it hasn't received much attention due to its exclusivity to the Latin American market. Positioned as a budget-friendly chip, it builds upon the standard Ryzen 5 5500 with the addition of 3D V-Cache, giving it a notable boost in gaming performance. However, it's not just fast in that area, as new benchmarks suggest that the 5500X3D also holds its own in productivity workloads, proving to be more versatile than expected.

Spotted by Gray, the Ryzen 5 5500X3D just appeared on Geekbench for the first time, where it delivered some decisive results. In single-core performance, it scored 1,932 points—roughly on par with the standard 5500 CPU. The real gains show up in multicore tests, where the 5500X3D came in nearly 12% faster than its non-X3D counterpart. Keep in mind this is the only Geekbench entry for the 5500X3D so far, whereas the 5500 has multiple runs to reference. To keep the comparison fair, we matched it against the highest Linux-based result for the 5500, since the 5500X3D was also on Linux.

https://t.co/aHm2PhQ8HG pic.twitter.com/OaySWB3naEAugust 23, 2025

The 5500X3D was tested on an Asus TUF Gaming B550M-Plus WiFi II motherboard with 32GB of RAM, suggesting the benchmark likely came from a regular user rather than a system integrator or OEM. On paper, the chip offers 6 cores and 12 threads, with a 3.0 GHz base clock and up to 4.0 GHz boost. Interestingly, this Geekbench run shows it hitting almost 4.3 GHz, which implies the base clock may have been adjusted—since Ryzen 5000X3D chips otherwise ship with locked multipliers. As with the rest of the 5000X3D lineup, it carries a 105W TDP, compared to just 65W on the standard Ryzen 5 5500.

A telling difference, of course, is the addition of 3D V-Cache. Here, AMD doubles the L3 cache to 96MB, up from the 16MB on the 5500—which itself was already cut down from the 5600 (32MB). In fact, that was always the criticism of the original 5500: essentially a detuned 5600 with half the cache, making it less appealing for gamers. By restoring that cache in the 5500X3D, AMD effectively ""fixes"" the chip, making it feel like the version the 5500 should have been in the first place. Naturally, the 5600X3D also exists, but the only difference between it and the 5500X3D is higher clock speeds on the former.



This isn't the only time the 5500X3D has surfaced in productivity benchmarks, either. Just a couple of weeks ago, it appeared on PassMark, where it trailed the 5600X3D by around 6% in multi-core performance but still managed to edge out the standard 5500 by the same margin. Single-core results, however, remained largely unchanged. All in all, the benchmark results for the 5500X3D have remained solid but its infered $185 price is poor by American or European standards which is why this chip only launced in Latin America, which is much more price-sensitive region.

High-density 3D DRAM might be around the corner.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Imagine trying to build a tower out of hundreds of very thin, slightly different sheets of material, where each sheet wants to bend or warp on its own. That's essentially what researchers at imec and Ghent University accomplished when they grew 120 alternating layers of silicon (Si) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) on a 300 mm wafer—a key step toward three-dimensional DRAM. At first glance, it sounds like stacking sheets of paper, but in reality, it's more like balancing a house of cards with materials that naturally want to pull apart.

The challenge starts with lattice mismatch. Silicon and silicon-germanium crystals have slightly different atomic spacings, so when stacked, the layers naturally want to stretch or compress. Think of it like trying to stack a deck of cards where every second card is slightly larger than the first—without careful alignment, the stack warps and topples. In semiconductor terms, these “topples” appear as misfit dislocations, tiny defects that can ruin a memory chip's performance.

To solve this, the team carefully tuned the germanium content in the SiGe layers and experimented with adding carbon, which acts like a subtle glue that relieves stress. They also maintained extremely uniform temperatures during the deposition process, because even minor hot or cold spots in the reactor can lead to uneven growth.



The process itself, using advanced epitaxial deposition techniques, is like painting with gases. Silane and germane—gases containing silicon and germanium—are broken down on the wafer surface, leaving behind precise, nanometer-thin layers. Controlling the thickness, composition, and uniformity of each layer is crucial; even a tiny deviation can propagate through the stack, magnifying defects.

Now, why go through all this effort? In conventional DRAM, memory cells are laid out flat, limiting density. Stacking layers vertically—in 3D—allows for far more memory cells in the same footprint, improving storage capacity without making chips larger. Successfully creating 120 bilayers demonstrates that vertical scaling is achievable, bringing us closer to next-generation, high-density memory devices.

Think of each bilayer as a story in a skyscraper, if one floor is misaligned then the entire building becomes unstable. By controlling strain and keeping layers uniform, the researchers effectively built a nanoscale skyscraper of silicon and SiGe that could host thousands of memory cells per unit area.



The implications stretch beyond memory chips. Techniques for growing precise multi-layer structures can advance 3D transistors, stacked logic devices, and even quantum computing architectures, where controlling layer properties at the atomic level is critical. Samsung has already put 3D DRAM on its roadmap and even has a dedicated R&D facility for it.

Furthermore, the research aligns with ongoing efforts to develop Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAAFET) and Complementary FET (CFET) technologies. These advanced transistor architectures benefit from the precise control over material properties afforded by epitaxial growth techniques, enabling the fabrication of smaller, more powerful transistors that are crucial for the continued miniaturization of electronic devices.

In summary, this is not just stacking silicon as you might know; it's engineering order from atomic tension, creating structures that nature itself would struggle to produce. For memory technology, like we say with every new breakthrough, it's a milestone that could reshape how chips are designed, making them denser, faster, and more reliable than ever before.

Watch CBS News


August 23, 2025 / 8:46 PM PDT
          / CBS San Francisco
        

History was made on Saturday in San Francisco, as the largest crowd to ever watch a National Women's Soccer League game filled Oracle Park.  

While the hometown Bay FC fell to the Washington Spirit 3-2, it was yet another milestone in the growth of women's soccer that can be traced back to what many feel is the single biggest goal in U.S. soccer history.

The meeting of Bay FC and the Washington Spirit wasn't called the ""game"" or the ""match""...they called it ""The Show"" because it was as much about the fans as it was about the players.  And it started with the tailgate parties in the parking lot.

""We live in Oakland and we drive down to San Jose for every home game,"" said Leone Baron.  ""So, when they had something up here and it could potentially set records, we'll absolutely be there. Yeah, we love our team, you know?  Go Bay!""

Inside, the stands began filling up.  With more than 40,000 tickets sold, it set a new record for attendance at an NWSL game. Which seemed pretty cool to all the young soccer players who showed up to watch.

""I did not know that they're saying a record or something,"" said Schuyler Vinefield, a young soccer player from Sacramento, ""so, now I'm even more excited!""

""This is history right here because it's the first women's game at Oracle Park,"" said Paige Terrazas, visiting with her Sonoma Valley United soccer team. ""I feel like just being able to witness it is very inspirational.""

There was plenty of pre-game fun, including music from Oakland's native rapper, Mistah Fab and featuring iconic San Francisco Giants players from Oracle Park's baseball history: Barry Bonds, Sergio Romo and Hunter Pence. 

But this day was about women's soccer and no one means more to that sport than Brandi Chastain. Her penalty kick to win the 1999 World Cup for Team USA will go down as the iconic moment when American women's soccer came into its own.

""When I started playing soccer some 40-something years ago, I had no idea that I could be a professional, let alone bring a team here to Oracle Park and play in such a phenomenal place,"" said Chastain.

Now, she is a co-founder of Bay FC, a team that is said to represent the largest investment in global women's sports.  And Chastain felt that the crowd at Oracle Park had a significance far beyond just a soccer match.

""The meaning is when you bring a girl to an event like this, she starts to have her dreams lit on fire,"" she said.  ""It doesn't mean she has to be a professional soccer player. She can be whatever it is she wants to be. And I think sports gives us that opportunity.  I mean, It gives me chills just to think about how awesome this opportunity is for our players and our fans to see this happening.""

The match brought 40,000 soccer fans together, but for Kristen Lee and her 10-year-old daughter Clementine, who traveled to the game from Fresno, the impact was on a more personal level.

""I just like to watch it and it's really fun,"" said Clementine. ""It's something that...it's like a bond that me and my mom have together.  We like doing that together.""

""We do, we have a bond over soccer,"" said Kristen. ""I played, she plays, and we watch the games together and we watch these amazing women show us what hard work and talent looks like together.""

Meanwhile, sitting in the front row, Sunny Moun from Sacramento gazed in amazement at the huge crowd behind him.

""Who would have thought a sold-out arena...?"" he said.  ""Major League Baseball games don't even sell out arenas.  But right now, a women's soccer game is selling out.  Yeah, pretty much, if you put your mind to it, you can do it.""

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national team will call up a new defender, according to Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Thomas Müller. 

While Müller may still be playing and scored his first MLS goal on Saturday night in a 3–2 comeback win over St. Louis CITY SC, he also dipped his hand into the realm of breaking news post-match. 

When speaking about the upcoming three-week break facing the Whitecaps, Müller revealed that center back Tristan Blackmon will be called up to the USMNT for the forthcoming friendlies, potentially setting him up to miss vital Whitecaps matches during the international windows. 

“With the new [signings] coming in, they have a little bit more time. On the other hand, we're playing during international break in October, we were missing some guys at this moment, and now Tristan is nominated for the U.S.,” Müller said, before laughing and realizing the news of Blackmon's first callup had yet to be announced by the Whitecaps or U.S. Soccer. 

“In the end, it is what it is. I heard what I heard. Congrats to Tristan and congrats to the U.S.”

The USMNT have upcoming friendlies in September against South Korea and Japan, and in October against Ecuador and Australia. However, Müller did not go as far as to clarify which roster Blackmon will be called up for. 

Blackmon, 28, has spent parts of the last four seasons with Vancouver and has become a critical piece of the backline, helping to lead the team to three Canadian Championship titles and a run to the Concacaf Champions Cup Final this season. 

Before his time with the Whitecaps, Blackmon won the 2022 MLS Cup with LAFC, where he began his professional career after a collegiate soccer career at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif.

Through his MLS career, he has played 171 regular season matches and scored seven goals and seven assists. This season, he has helped the Whitecaps to a league-high 12 clean sheets in the regular season and an extended run in cup competitions.

Despite his standout moments, he has never cracked a final USMNT squad, with his only previous call being the 60-man preliminary roster for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, which featured an MLS-heavy list, but not Blackmon. 

Earlier in the season, ESPN reported that Canadian men's national team head coach Jesse Marsch had a conversation with Blackmon about potentially representing Canada and gaining his citizenship. However, that possibility would fall short should the USMNT cap Blackmon. 

“Just a conversation,” Blackmon said of his chat with Marsch. “Getting to know one another, nothing concrete. Getting to know me as a player, and that there's a potential opportunity for this to possibly take place in the future. I can't see in the future, I don't have a crystal ball, nobody does. We'll see what happens.”

Müller might not be in the business of breaking stories just yet, but he has his first big scoop.

Leading sports journalist Miguel Delaney dissects the Club World Cup to show how football has been taken over by capitalism and Gulf states, as well as the motivations that pushed him to write his essential guide to understanding the modern game, States Of Play.

The game's gone.

It's a phrase you'll hear fans say in response to modern football. VAR? Rubbish. Holes in socks? Ridiculous. Expected goals? Woke nonsense.

This summer, the expanded 32-team Club World Cup in the USA had all the trimmings. There were half-time interviews, half-time shows, and players coming out of the tunnel with their names announced WWE-style.

Behind the pageantry, more troubling truths emerged: the financial greed and political influence from those who don't have the best interest of the sport, and often people, at heart.

Sportswashing – the practice of using sport to improve the public image of an entity, such as a country or organisation – was rife.

There are few better qualified to discuss this than Spanish-Irish journalist Miguel Delaney. The Chief football writer at The Independent in the UK, his book States Of Play is a definitive account of how capitalism has devoured the sport, and was named Football Book of the Year 2025.

“There's been a big debate over whether it worked as a tournament,” Delaney says of the CWC. “I don't think that matters. What's important is that it worked for Gianni Infantino's (Fifa President) purposes. He was able to show to the big clubs that he could deliver this new tournament.

“There are several caveats to that. He needed the significant indirect backing of Saudi state money. DAZN paid $1bn for the TV rights. This was around the same time that the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) took a 10% stake in them.

“Clubs have been trying to unlock that PIF money for years. So Infantino suddenly got all the big clubs on his side. It's a shift that's probably been underappreciated, because for decades big clubs thought Fifa was a nuisance, whereas now it's a player.”



Each Gulf state has its own socio-political reality, but share troubling common ground when it comes to human rights. Most will remember the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and the allegations of widespread abuses involving migrant workers. There were reports of poor conditions, withheld wages, and unexplained deaths among those building stadiums. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, meanwhile, rank poorly for press freedom.

In May, a group of lawyers alleged that Fifa wasn't following its own human rights rules by having the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Just a month ago, The Guardian reported almost 600 people had been executed over the past decade in the Kingdom for drug-related offences, often by decapitation.

Then there's the debates over women's or queer rights across the Gulf. It's easy to see why these states seek image improvement through football.

“The tournament couldn't have been held without the Saudi sportswashing project,” says Delaney. “They obviously have some sort of relationship with Infantino. It's been well documented. Saudi money indirectly made the tournament happen. That links to the [Saudis'] wider project, this long road up to the 2034 World Cup, which is classic sportswashing really, because it's tournament hosting.”

One of the participating teams, Riyadh-based Al Hilal, have signed global stars such as Neymar (who left after playing just seven games) as part of a wider plan to raise Saudi football's profile.

“One of the more cynical interpretations of the Club World Cup is that it's a Trojan horse,” Delaney explains. “I think it is crucial, in terms of sportswashing, that Saudi Pro League clubs have an equivalent competition to the Champions League. We know Abu Dhabi, or Manchester City's owners, were really interested in this competition. Same with Qatar, who own PSG.

“It's about using a global tournament for international projection. That's what a lot of club ownership is about.”

Money from states, billionaires, and private equity affects what happens on the pitch by distorting football's economics. Wage inflation has widened the gap between European giants and everyone else.

The Club World Cup claimed to address this. The prize money said otherwise.

“Chelsea got $114 million for winning it, whereas Boca Juniors got $14 million,” Delaney notes. “So I'm not sure how that exactly addresses the inequality in the game. There wasn't that much memorable football. The stadium attendances were mixed. But none of that really matters. I

“I think this is a landmark moment in football history, because of what Infantino has been able to put on, and how it's changed the attitude of the big clubs. I do genuinely think this is the start of a real transformation in football, and one that's been coming for a long time.

“It's something that specifically comes from the United States' economic model. States buy clubs for political capital. Funds and billionaires buy them for good old financial capital. They see the future as a kind where you can make money by being in a more international market.”

The politics and the spectacle collided in surreal ways, summed up by Donald Trump's presence. There was the awkward video of Juventus players at the White House as he disparaged the women's game, and the bizarre image of the Chelsea squad lifting the trophy with the US President planted beside them.

“It felt like an escalation of the Bisht in Qatar 2022,” Delaney reflects, recalling the Emir of Qatar placing the ceremonial cloak on Lionel Messi. “The Bisht itself is an otherwise innocent garment that bestows honour. Suddenly, Qatar is at the centre of this moment of celebration of history. With Trump, it's more direct. There he is in the middle of it, clearly not wanting to leave.

“The US is a liberal democracy. At the moment, a flawed liberal democracy. But I'm not sure it's quite as centralised as you'd see in autocracies.”



With the US hosting the next World Cup, could Trump use it for political advantage the same way other leaders have?

“A lot of human rights groups would say the American World Cup will be used to further his current political agenda, which is obviously authoritarian leaning. But you wonder how much control you have over Trump. Some of this has to be linked to his own idiosyncratic personality.

“With him, it's much more about basic ego. There is an element of WWE to this. Which sounds basic and cartoonish, given the genuinely important and complex topics we're talking about.

“But these are the sort of figures involved. The Gulf rivalry has driven a lot of modern sportswashing. Ultimately it does come down to petty rivalries between very powerful men as well.”

Of all those men, one looms large over football – Fifa President Infantino, who replaced Sepp Blatter after the 2015 FIFA corruption scandal. As Delaney puts it, he was a “reform candidate”.

“But there was no reform of the structure,” he notes, adding that in Fifa (and Uefa), the president has the power to operate like a head of state, bestowing the influence of football wherever he sees fit. “

""Infantino sees himself in the sphere of world leaders. Trump isn't the only one he's got a relationship with. It was Vladimir Putin around 2018.

“There's that infamous photo of Infantino sitting beside Putin and [Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister] Mohammed bin Salman. The Trump administration very much encouraged Infantino's relationship with Mohammed bin Salman. It absolutely is a concern that these are the sort of world leaders that Infantino seems to have the closest proximity to.

“It's not serving football. It's not necessarily serving society either.”



Was there a specific moment that pushed Delaney to write States Of Play?

“The job used to be 70 to 80% about games on the pitch. Now I'd say that's about 25%,” he explains. “The news cycle is relentless. All the narratives around games. There's transfers, which is a separate industry in itself. Then there's geopolitics. It was around the draw in April before the Qatar World Cup. I remember the moment realising that there's a book that could actually tie this together.”

You'd expect a degree of backlash, given the subject matter, as well as the powerful organisations and figures discussed throughout the book. Perhaps the source of the discontent is more surprising.

“I was covering Manchester City's run to the treble in 2023,” Delaney says. “I found myself in airports, hotels or restaurants with City fans. Some are civil, but I got a lot of aggressive abuse. I'm not talking about the fanbase as a whole, just minority sections within it.

“There's tribalism and psychological dynamics. Ultimately there is a cynical use of the psychological attachment that football brings by powerful entities behind the club. Some fans take it as their identities being criticised.

“I think it's pro-City to not want them owned by an autocratic state. I would extend this to capitalist funds and billionaires. I don't think they should be owning clubs either.

“There's a spectrum, and states are at the extreme end of that spectrum for multiple reasons.”

As a fan himself, has confronting the ugly realities of modern football made it harder to enjoy the game?

“It influences your thinking,” Delaney notes. “It's hard not to see clubs in terms of who owns them. Especially with the influence owners have. It's them who are voting at Premier League meetings. They've become intrinsic to the identity of clubs.”

Still, the job has its perks.

“I would say there's nothing like going into a big game at international tournaments,” Delaney says.

“The club game has never been more financially conditioned. From years of research, we know there's a 90% correlation between what clubs spend on wages and where they finish in the table. Manchester United at this point might make up a considerable part of the 10% aberration…

“But in the international game players are doing it for glory. You can't buy players. It has this pure element of coaches trying to figure out what to do with their team.

“One of my most treasured memories is Copacabana in Brazil in 2014. You've got fans from all the nations, and it's a scene of great humanity. And then you go to the games, where the atmosphere surrounds this and amplifies it.”



In the final chapter of States Of Play, Delaney lays out some reforms he'd make to bring the game back to fans.

“One of the first steps I would take is recreating something with the same effect as the foreign player rule,” he says. “Before 1995, if your club was competing in Europe, you could only have three foreign players.

“You can recreate it from a different direction, which is essentially having three of your starting line-up, or more of your squad, having to be homegrown players. It becomes about training and its development. One of the effects of this is the super clubs don't have as many available spaces in their squad for kind of talent they want to buy in.

“It means that players stay at clubs longer. This was why, before 1996, you could have Ajax keeping the team together and winning the Champions League. You could have Red Star Belgrade winning the Champions League.

“It starts to bring more parity in football, and if there's more parity, it means a lot of these kind owners aren't necessarily interested in clubs in the same way.”

There are few clubs in the world with higher expectations than Club America in Liga MX, but it's for good reason. In December of 2024, Club America became the first Mexican Club ever to three-peat in Liga MX, which no team had done since Mexican soccer split into the Apertura/Clausura era. But because of those expectations, it feels like America are struggling in the current Apertura season despite only sitting fourth in the table. They're only one point off first place, but after also missing out on the Club World Cup due to losing a playoff with Los Angeles FC and not making it out of the group stage of the Leagues Cup, it just hasn't been good enough.

Club America and manager Andre Jardine will need to rally in order to win a trophy this season or a change could be called for at the club. Someone who can help bring that is American winger Alex Zendejas. He has 43 goals in 163 appearances for the club, but this season, he isn't getting the job done despite having the added motivation of trying to impress Mauricio Pochettino to make the World Cup squad.

Zendejas hasn't scored since matchday one, facing Juarez, and even left winger Brian Rodriguez hasn't scored in three consecutive league games. Midfielder Eric Sanchez has gotten the job done, but the attack around him has been one-dimensional. Facing Atlas is as good a time as any to put an end to their attacking woes, considering that Atlas have allowed three or more goals in four consecutive games.

This is a team loaded with attacking talent, but they've scored just nine goals in 11 league games, averaging 0.8 per contest. If Zendejas and America can't get the ball in the back of the net past one of Liga MX's worst defenses, then when will they?

US President Donald Trump has proposed inviting Russian leader Vladimir Putin attend the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Washington next year.

During a news conference on Friday to announce the 2026 tournament's date and drawl Trump displayed a photo of the two leaders from their last summit in Alaska, stating that Putin intends to be there “very badly” 

Trump showed their picture to the media and stated, “That's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming depending on what happens. He may be coming and he may not.”

The US, Canada, and Mexico will host the next FIFA World Cup.

Due to its ongoing war in Ukraine, Russia has been barred from all FIFA and Uefa events, including the most recent World Cup in Qatar. Russia was banned despite the fact that it hosted the tournament in 2018.

However, Trump added, “He's been very respectful of me and my country,” adding that ""“We will see… a lot has to happen.”

Crazy crazy.” “Putin kills and traffics kids,” another X user claimed amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. “He is number one fan of Putin,” a fourth user quipped.

Putin, however, claimed that Trump's leadership abilities will aid in repairing US-Russia ties during a visit to a nuclear research facility on Friday. “With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,” the Russian President stated. When reporters asked if he would do nothing if Putin refused to sit down for peace talks at the World Cup announcement, Trump responded that he would wait and see ""whose fault it is"" before attempting to reach an agreement for regional peace. “In about two weeks,” the President said that he will know whether to sanction Russia or to back off and say, “It's your fight.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Opinion: FIFA president debases World Cup with shameless Trump pandering","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2025/08/22/fifa-world-cup-trump-gianni-infantino/85784577007/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 16:20:18 GMT","

It's one thing for Gianni Infantino to debase himself, fawning over autocrats and human rights abusers.

His sycophancy is also sullying the World Cup, however, as sure as if the FIFA president took that iconic gold trophy once held by Pelé, Maradona and Messi and dipped it in tar.

The men's World Cup next year is shaping up to be a North Korea-style state propaganda event, and Infantino is going right along with it. He stood beside Donald Trump as the president turned what was supposed to be an announcement that the draw will take place at the Kennedy Center into a 45-minute stream of lies Friday, smiling, laughing and agreeing with Trump as if he was a Cabinet member.

And because sacrificing your dignity and self-respect doesn't go as far as it used to, Infantino came bearing more gifts! The first ticket to the July 19, 2026, final at MetLife Stadium, and a hint of a role in the December draw.

“Ah! That's an interesting proposal,” Infantino said, when someone asked if Trump will announce the results of the draw. “We'll discuss that.”

Infantino even stood by while Trump suggested that Vladimir Putin ""may"" attend the tournament, despite Russia being banned from FIFA competitions since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

FIFA and its leaders have never been paragons of virtue. Bribes and kickbacks were an accepted part of doing business, votes and support traded for bagsful of cash. Infantino's predecessor, Sepp Blatter, is still ostracized by FIFA for his shady dealings, and half of the members of the Executive Committee that voted on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were fined, suspended or banned for life for corruption.

But the World Cup was always viewed separately from its leaders' tawdry behavior. FIFA and the (mostly) men who run it might be morally bankrupt, but soccer had center stage at the World Cup, the game a wonderful diversion from the ugliness of the world around it.

Under Infantino, however, that has changed.

When the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, that country's leaders promised that it would not impose its local customs and rules on a global tournament. So much for that. Human rights violations were rampant, the LGBTQ community was targeted and longtime sponsor Budweiser discovered its $75 million sponsorship was worth less than warm beer.  

All of this was fine – just fine! – with Infantino, who saved his outrage for the critics of his besties rather than the cheapening of a World Cup that upended the global calendar and had all the atmosphere and authenticity of a timeshare sales pitch.

Now comes next summer's men's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The United States is sliding into autocracy, with Trump encouraging voter suppression in Texas, manufacturing a crime wave to justify a takeover of Washington, D.C., and retaliating against his enemies. And that was just in the last few days!

Trump likes anything that can be used to exalt his glorious leadership, so he is, naturally, all in on the World Cup. And Infantino is happy to oblige his grandiosity.

He was late to FIFA's Congress because he was hobnobbing with Trump in the Middle East. He didn't step in when Trump crashed Chelsea's victory celebration after winning the Club World Cup, and he “let” Trump keep the original trophy. Now he's fawning over Trump's tales of Washington's “resurgence” and placating his overestimation of the U.S. men's national team's chances next summer.  

“The home team always have a good chance to win,” Infantino said.

This is a team that lost four in a row earlier this year and got humiliated by Panama in the semifinals of the Nations League. At full-strength and at home, no less. Let's slow the roll.

By allowing Trump to co-opt the World Cup, Infantino is risking the success of the tournament, FIFA's crown jewel.

Trump is a deeply polarizing president, and there is widespread opposition to many of his policies. Most of the rest of the world has an even dimmer view, which is already being reflected by a drop in foreign tourism. Allow the World Cup to become “Trump's tournament,” and Infantino should not be surprised if fans decide to sit it out. Or only go to games in Canada and Mexico.

The World Cup has always been a celebration of ""the beautiful game."" Infantino is giving it a very ugly look.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","World Cup draw will be held at Kennedy Center, Trump and FIFA announce","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2025/08/22/trump-2026-world-cup-draw-kennedy-center/85781200007/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 15:22:14 GMT","

President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 World Cup draw will be held in Washington at the Kennedy Center, with the event set for Dec. 5.

Trump was joined by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, vice president J.D. Vance, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell in the Oval Office for the announcement. Trump — seated with the World Cup trophy stationed on the Resolute Desk — noted that he had visited the Kennedy Center earlier on Friday.

“It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes — the best athletes in the world — to the cultural center of our nation's capital,” said Trump.

While FIFA did not have an official statement to coincide with Friday's White House press event, Infantino stated himself that the draw will commence at noon ET, moments before handing the World Cup trophy to Trump.

The news came as something of a surprise. In July, reports emerged that the World Cup draw would take place in Las Vegas, though a spokesperson for The Sphere shot down claims that the venue was the site of the event.

The D.C. region was not selected to host matches at the World Cup, with issues at Northwest Stadium eventually resulting in a joint Washington/Baltimore bid that was ultimately rejected. However, speaking in 2022, U.S. Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone did hint at plans to follow long-standing World Cup tradition, which has largely seen national capitals play a major role for the tournament. The last men's World Cup to not feature matches in the host country's capital city was in 1974, when West Germany did not hold matches in Bonn.

“Our nation's capital is very much going to be a huge part of this World Cup, even though they're not hosting games,” said Parlow Cone shortly after the host cities were confirmed.

The Trump administration has in recent days instituted federal control over Washington's police force and called in national guard units from several states amid a sharp increase in visible law enforcement throughout the capital. The president insisting during Friday's announcement that the move has reduced crime. The move has drawn significant pushback in the region, with protests of the crackdown becoming a regular occurrence.

The 2026 edition of the men's World Cup — set to run from June 11 to July 19, 2026 — will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and will be the first to feature an expanded 48-team field. 11 U.S. cities will host matches, along with two in Canada and three in Mexico. The tournament final is set for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the same stadium that welcomed the recent 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final.

The World Cup draw is a major event held before a given World Cup, which sets the schedule of games and bracket for the tournament. With each team only guaranteed three group stage games, the results of the draw are considered critical in gauging a given country's hopes of a deep tournament run.

Based on the December 2025 FIFA rankings and a desire to prevent too many nations from one continent being paired together in the tournament's group stage, FIFA will sort the 48 qualifying teams into four pots.

Host nations Canada (Group B), Mexico Group A), and the United States (Group D) have already been assigned to groups as seeded teams, with nine best-ranked teams in the world set to be the seeded sides in the other groups. The top two finishers from each group are guaranteed to advance to the knockout stage, while the final eight places will go to the best third-place finishers.

Matches at the 2026 World Cup will take place in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Here is a full list of cities and corresponding venues:","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

This is the eighth in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. The previous articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950,West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962 and then England winning their only World Cup in 1966. In 1970, Brazil made it three.

Mexico was a controversial choice as World Cup host in 1970, primarily because it was widely expected that the heat and altitude would result in poor football. Instead, Brazil turned on the style to become, almost without question, the most celebrated World Cup-winning side in history. It helped that the World Cup was now televised around the world — and for the first time, in colour.

Brazil had won two of the previous three World Cups, but their experience in England in 1966 had been disastrous; eliminated at the group stage amid complaints about the physical approach of their opponents. Pele had briefly retired from international duty, although later agreed to return after two years away.

Brazil triumphed amid a period of political turbulence back home, with a military dictatorship in place since 1964. “We had a fantastic side and everyone expected us to win, which gave me the shakes,” Pele later said. “I was very nervous and under a lot of pressure. Maybe people have forgotten, but the political situation in Brazil was not good and we felt that we simply had to win the title. Thank God we were able to do it.”

And they did it in style.

We've encountered Mario Zagallo before — he played in Brazil's two World Cup-winning campaigns of 1958 and 1962, as a reliable left-winger who tucked inside to allow Garrincha freedom down the opposite flank. Here, he became the first man to win the World Cup as a player and a manager.

His predecessor, Joao Saldanha, had been a bizarre choice as manager. He had been out of work for a decade after a spell in charge of his old club Botafogo, and had spent the intervening period working as an outspoken journalist and radio host. He was dismissed after a few months, despite good results, partly because he refused to cooperate with the country's authoritarian president, Emilio Medici, who regularly offered advice about team selection.

Saldanha's replacement as the coach of the national team was the man who had replaced him at his radio show: Zagallo. The qualities that made him a less provocative radio host made him a better manager. He was close to the players, having played alongside several — most notably Pele — and was happy to take their suggestions about tactics on board. In many ways, he feels comparable to Carlo Ancelotti, recently appointed Brazil manager for the 2026 World Cup.

Zagallo, remarkably, was again in charge of Brazil 28 years later when they lost 3-0 in the 1998 World Cup final against France in Paris. He had been assistant manager four years earlier for Brazil's fourth World Cup success, and had a brief caretaker spell in 2002, before becoming a technical coordinator for World Cup 2006. He died last year at the age of 92, and is perhaps the single most enduring World Cup figure, his involvement spanning the period from 1958 to 2006.

On one hand, this was the 4-2-4 approach that Brazil had used at previous tournaments. But it was looser, more free-flowing. This side featured five players who were accustomed to playing No 10 for their club — Pele, Tostao, Rivellino, Jairzinho and Gerson, all world-class.

Pele and Tostao were the front two, although neither was considered an out-and-out striker. Gerson was a brilliantly inventive midfield playmaker, capable of long-range passes, with the similarly left-footed Rivellino charging infield dangerously from the left flank with slightly odd, angular dribbles. That allowed Jairzinho to play from the right, where he was inevitably compared to Garrincha, but he was more of a drifting all-rounder.



Clodoaldo was given the task of sweeping up behind them, and protecting the back four. For all of Brazil's quality going forward, they weren't secure at all defensively. Wilson Piazza was a defensive midfielder converted into a centre-back because of the lack of top-class options, and even legendary captain Carlos Alberto was suspect when opponents dribbled at him, always seeming to desperately recover at the last minute. Left-back Everaldo was more secure, which was a reverse of the usual pattern at the time.

Meanwhile, goalkeeper Felix was something of a running joke; pinpointed as their obvious weakness before the tournament and guilty of a couple of terrible errors in the competition.

World Soccer's Brian Glanville wrote that “his ineptitude, at times, was extraordinary”. Even Bob Wilson, the normally amiable Arsenal goalkeeper turned television presenter, branded him “without question, the most incompetent goalkeeper to win a World Cup medal”.

Pele is the greatest player in World Cup history, and became the only player to win three World Cup winners' medals here. Although not at his athletic best, he was still, aged 29, a wonderful attacker, although curiously his tournament was most famous for three separate incidents when he failed to score: his dummy against Uruguay, his shot from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia which dropped just wide, and his header being clawed out by England goalkeeper Gordon Banks.

And therefore, amid strong competition, Brazil's key player was Jairzinho, who managed to score in all six games. A direct dribbler who had an eye for a clever through- ball, he played on the left at World Cup 1966, with his idol Garrincha an automatic pick on the right. But Jairzinho always wanted to play on the right.

He was the subject of tough man-marking throughout this competition, particularly by Uruguay, but he always offered the strength and tenacity to cope, and the technical ability to outwit opponents. He could shoot powerfully with both feet, too. His goal against Czechoslovakia, where he dribbled past four opponents before finishing, was the outstanding moment — in pure technical terms — of Brazil's campaign.

But this was a team of stars. “That's really difficult,” said Zagallo when asked by FIFA who the best player was at this tournament. “Jairzinho was exceptional at that World Cup. But you have to mention Pele, Tostao, Rivellino, Clodoaldo, and Gerson — Gerson was the best No 10, the best midfielder I've seen in my life.” So that's the whole midfield and forward line mentioned, which is probably fair enough.

Brazil were overwhelmingly the neutral's favourites, and a victory of a considerable margin was anticipated. Italy, in fairness, had grown into the tournament. But this was still the version of Italy that often left so many frustrated because of their caution. Whereas Brazil found space for five No 10s, Italy manager Ferruccio Valcareggi had a policy of fielding Sandro Mazzola and Gianni Rivera ‘in relay', one replacing the other at half-time, a somewhat primitive approach to substitutions.

With the original Jules Rimet trophy up for grabs — it would be permanently awarded to the first nation to win the tournament three times, and these sides were both on two — Brazil were dominant. While Sandro Mazzola showed some flashes of inspiration, Italy weren't really in the game. Pele opened the scoring with a header when Rivellino hooked up a throw-in towards the far post.

Then came Italy's goal, which curiously summarises Brazil's approach to football as succinctly as any of the goals at the other end. It came when centre-back Piazza swept a ball out to Brito, who nodded it infield to Clodoaldo — the defensive midfielder supposedly playing the solid, reliable role. But he responded with a hilariously nonchalant backheel intended for left-back Everaldo, completely unaware that he was being closed down by Roberto Boninsegna, who intercepted and charged through on goal. With Felix inevitably rushing out into the wrong position, Boninsegna turned home into an empty net.

But this just delayed the inevitable. Midway through the second half, the wonderful Gerson scored one of the great World Cup goals with a wicked curling shot into the far corner. Then Pele seemed set to score his second header of the game, but instead nodded it down for Jairzinho, whose final goal of the tournament was his scruffiest. He controlled the ball with his thigh, and then tried to slam the ball home, but the ball bounced strangely, away from both his foot and the goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi, and trickled into the net. And then came Alberto's fourth — more on that shortly.

At the time, opinions differed on whether it was a great final. Brazil's play was not as flowing as in some of their previous matches, and it was a somewhat one-sided game. In World Soccer magazine, Eric Batty said the final was “a disappointment for everyone, and largely the fault of the Italians, who managed to take the edge off most of the good things the Brazilians tried to do, and contributed nothing themselves”.

Glanville enjoyed it more. In his history of the World Cup, he calls this a victory “for the positive over the negative, the creative over the destructive… Brazil knew football was a game, something to be enjoyed.”

Brazil scored some truly spectacular goals in this tournament, showing a particular penchant for rounding the goalkeeper, powerful free kicks and strikes from a tight angle.

But they scored probably the most famous ‘team goal' in football five minutes from the end of the final, a flowing move that went through eight outfielders before Pele received the ball in an inside-right position, paused to wait for the run of Carlos Alberto, then nonchalantly slipped him in.

The right-back, bursting into the frame at the last minute, benefited from the ball bobbling up slightly, and therefore almost volleyed it into the far corner on the run. “When it arrived at Pele's feet, I just believed the ball would come to me,” said Carlos Alberto in Garry Jenkins' book The Beautiful Team.

“I didn't have to shout. We played at Santos and had a good understanding. I knew that if the ball was at his feet, he would give it to me.”

It was a move that Brazil played a lot, thanks to their multiple No 10s sucking the opposition centrally before leaving space on the outside for an overlapping right-back. The nature of Pele's assist was somewhat similar to his assist for Jairzinho's winner in the group stage victory over England. Therefore, Glanville called the goal “highly predictable”, and it's surprisingly difficult to find many contemporary descriptions of the goal that treat it in the manner we're now accustomed to: the cherry on top of the icing at the end of the most celebrated World Cup campaign.

This was the first World Cup to feature substitutes, but Zagallo elected not to use either of his in the final.

And therefore, since medals were only awarded to those who had actually played in the final, two medals went spare. They are now on display at the FIFA Museum in Zurich. The likes of Caju and Fontana, who started matches in the group stage, can feel somewhat aggrieved.

Forget about comparing Brazil to the other 15 sides at this competition; the pertinent question is whether Brazil 1970 are better than the other 21 World Cup-winning sides in history.

The answer to that depends on what you want. Brazil were not the most complete World Cup winner. Their defence was genuinely suspect and their goalkeeper was treated as a laughing stock. These were shortcomings that the 1958 side simply didn't have.

But they had more than enough attacking flair to make up for that. No other side has had five genuinely world-class attackers in the same team. That they succeeded without width in its strictest sense, or without an obvious focal point up front, underlines the selflessness and cohesion between players, who believed in each other's talent.

“I don't want to compare them,” said Zagallo of the 1958 side he played in, and the 1970 side he managed. “The two were unbelievable. However, the team of 1958 was really good because we had a sensational defence, a great midfielder and an attack with Garrincha, Pele and Vava. Oh, and we had Mario Zagallo on the left wing!”

But Zagallo as manager wasn't too bad either.

AS Roma have shifted their focus away from Jadon Sancho and are now reportedly eyeing Chelsea's highly-rated youngster Tyrique George.

De Bruyne marked his league debut with a trademark free-kick goal.

Manchester United are reportedly ""baffled"" by the Saudi Pro League's renewed interest in their club captain Bruno Fernandes.

ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during the US Open.


Zachary Svajda
The 22-year-old qualifier has had a summer to remember. Svajda won 10 consecutive Challenger matches to lift two trophies, in Newport, Rhode Island and in Lexington, Kentucky. The American dedicated his Newport title to his father, Tom, who is battling cancer and then dedicated his Lexington crown to his mother, Anita — “the hardest working person I know”, he wrote on Instagram.


Svajda will make his fifth main-draw appearance at his home Slam, where he begins against fellow qualifier Zsombor Piros. Boasting an ultra-consistent backhand and rarely allowing his body language to reveal if he's winning or losing, Svajda could meet 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in a second-round showdown.

Dino Prizmic
#NextGenATP star Prizmic boasts a standout 27-9 season record at the Challenger level. After a wrist injury hindered Prizmic's 2024 season, the Croatian this year has won two Challenger titles (Zagreb, Bratislava). In his past three Challenger outings, the 20-year-old has reached the championship match on each occasion.“It's a good start to try and become a top player and also to try to play against very good players,” Prizmic said of his early Challenger success. “It's a good feeling, but I think it's something that in the beginning it's what I have to pass to be a good player.”

Prizmic is making his US Open debut as a qualifier and will aim to upset 15th seed Andrey Rublev in the opening round. Fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Prizmic is in good position to qualify for his maiden trip to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, which runs from 17-21 December.

Emilio Nava
On the verge of making his Top 100 debut, the American begins against last year's finalist Taylor Fritz, who just beat Nava two weeks ago in Cincinnati. Nava is second on the Challenger match-wins leaderboard this season with 35 victories. The 23-year-old's three trophies this year, a title haul that came amidst Nava's impressive 19-match win streak across five weeks, are the most among all Americans.

Brandon Holt
One of Holt's career highlights came at Flushing Meadows in 2022, when, ranked outside the Top 300, he stunned then-10th seeded Fritz. Holt, 27, is now making his first US Open main-draw appearance since that memorable victory. At that time, Holt had yet to win a Challenger title, but his first two triumphs at that level have come this year, in Nonthaburi, Thailand and Bengaluru, India. Holt cracked the Top 100 for the first time on 30 June. The son of former WTA No. 1 Tracy Austin, Holt plays Nuno Borges in the first round.

Kamil Majchrzak
The Pole has split time between the ATP Challenger Tour and the ATP Tour this season and is currently at No. 76 in the PIF ATP Rankings, one spot off his career high, which he reached in 2022. Majchrzak, who has won two Challenger titles this season, reached the fourth round of Wimbledon, his career-best Slam result. He earned wins against Nicolas Jarry and Nuno Borges last week in Winston-Salem to reach the third round at the ATP 250. Majchrzak begins his US Open against Hugo Dellien.

With the US Open officially starting today, the excitement surrounding this event is set to reach a crescendo.

After all, the biggest and best tennis stars will unite in New York, all vying for the same thing: ultimate glory.

Whether it be entry through qualifying or as the top seed, there is a unique feeling around Grand Slams that makes it feel like anything is possible. And, at the US Open in particular, unpredictable new victors are commonplace.

Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open title stands out as the most extraordinary, and it only feels like she has now settled after that impossible triumph.

Even lucky losers have technically earned their place in the main draw, and on the eve of this tournament, we have seen a key withdrawal which has afforded one ATP star a dream route into the event.

This particular individual is certainly capable of causing an upset, especially considering the wins he has amassed across his career thus far.

Daniel Elahi Galán will not care how he got into the US Open, just that he is there. 

Laslo Djere has withdrawn from the Men's Singles event due to injury.He is replaced by Lucky Loser, Daniel Elahi Galan.

It comes at the expense of Laslo Djere, with the Serbian having had to pull out through injury.

Ironically enough, one of Galán's greatest victories actually came in New York, where he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas back in 2022, even bagelling him one set.

Another of his most famous triumphs came against Alex De Minaur in Miami the previous year. 

The Colombian's form has been spotty in the seasons since, but this should prove that his presence in the US Open draw could cause difficulty if he is on form.

16 men came through US Open qualifying, many of whom will be recognisable names to most tennis fans.

The big-serving German Jan-Lennard Struff is likely chief among them, whilst the more shrewd supporter might remember the name Dino Prižmić for pushing Novak Djokovic hard at last year's Australian Open.

Lloyd Harris, Jesper De Jong and Ugo Blanchet make up the other key names, with Brit Billy Harris another who gains his place in the US Open as a lucky loser.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Navone – Giron: 24.08.2025 22:00 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Mariano Navone has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Winston-Salem, the Argentine lost to Bu in the 1/8-Finals in straight sets. This will be his second appearance in New York. He has never made it past the second round.

Marcos Giron has lost five straight matches. His last win was almost two months ago. Last week in Winston-Salem, Giron lost to Navone in the opening round in straight sets. This will be his eleventh appearance at the US Open. Last season, Giron lost to de Minaur in the opening round in four tight sets.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Navone is in solid form and has just recently demolished Giron under similar conditions. We expect a similar outcome tonight considering American's current form.

That being said, Navone winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Mariano Navone winning @1.73 @bet365

Nakashima – de Jong: 24.08.2025 23:00 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Brandon Nakashima has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was in Cincinnati, where he lost to Zverev in the second round. Last season in New York, Nakashima lost against Zverev in the fourth round in four tight sets.

Jesper de Jong has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Cancun, de Jong played in the Challenger tournament. This week in New York, he qualified for the main draw tournament. In the final qualifying round, de Jong defeated Krueger in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Nakashima is the favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. De Jong is always a dangerous opponent, especially when he is confident. After easily qualifying for the tournament, we expect de Jong to be ready for the opening match. We believe this will be a tight match that could go either way.

That being said, de Jong covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jesper de Jong +4.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Medvedev – Bonzi: 25.08.2025 02:30 CEST
H2H: 1-2

Daniil Medvedev has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was in Cincinnati, where Walton upset him in the opening match. Last season in New York, Medvedev lost against Sinner in the quarterfinals in four tight sets. The Russian was the champion here in 2021.

Benjamin Bonzi has won three of his last five matches. The last match he played was in Cincinnati, where he lost to Auger-Aliassime in straight sets. Last season, Bonzi failed to qualify for the main draw of the tournament.

According to the bookies, Medvedev is the heavy favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. He is in terrible form. On the other hand, Bonzi knows how to handle Medvedev. He leads 2-1 in head-to-head meetings against him. Earlier this season, Bonzi upset Medvedev at Wimbledon. We expect a tight match that could go either way.

That being said, Bonzi covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Benjamin Bonzi +5.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

UWSer Aleksandar Kovacevic Returns to Tennis's Biggest American Stage

By Tracy Zwick
When Aleksandar Kovacevic was growing up on the Upper West Side, his parents took him to the US Open every summer for Fan Week and Kids' Day. They were big tennis fans and the price was right: free. As a young teen, the US Open meant ball-boy shifts for Aleks, who remembers gleefully blowing his earnings on Ben & Jerry's milkshakes.
Now 26, Kovacevic is back at the Open, working on-court again — this time as an established pro. His ranking, currently number 71 in the world, earned him automatic entry into the tournament's main draw for the second year in a row. On Monday, he faces Coleman Wong of Hong Kong, ranked 174, who got into the tournament's main draw by winning three matches in last week's qualifying round.
“It's been a good year for me for sure,” Kovacevic said from the players' locker room at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Thursday. “My best year on tour.”
That year has so far included a run to his first ATP final in Montpellier, France (ATP is the organization that runs men's tennis), then another in Los Cabos, Mexico. He earned his first win over a top-ten player, Andrey Rublev. Kovacevic's ranking went up to number 62 – the highest it's ever been.
Still, grand slams, the four premiere tennis tournaments of the year, are special, and, for Kovacevic, the US Open is personal. His path to the pros ran through afterschool tennis at UWS elementary and middle schools and one year at Beacon High School in midtown. He moved to Florida at 15 to focus on tennis. Unlike most of his peers, he delayed turning pro so he could spend four full years at college, the University of Illinois, where he earned a business degree.

At last year's US Open, Kovacevic drew his friend, Big Foe – star player Francis Tiafoe – in round 1. They played under the lights in Louis Armstrong Stadium, an All-American night battle in prime time. Kovacevic lost in four sets, and Tiafoe plowed his way into the semifinals, where he lost to American number 1 Taylor Fritz. 
This year the draw's been kinder to Kovacevic. Coleman Wong, the qualifier he plays on Monday, is lower-ranked and had to battle his way through those three qualifying matches, the last one on Friday.
Tour life has given Kovacevic perspective about the luck of the draw and other such things: “It's not always easy to be in the best head space when you're playing each and every week,” he said. “Even when you're winning, it's tough being out there competing, alone. You can get humbled pretty fast in tennis.” 
Though there's also validation. At last year's US Open, Kovacevic played mixed doubles in addition to singles, with young sensation Tyra Grant as his partner. They made it all the way to the semi-finals, where they lost to Italian duo Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, who ultimately won the mixed doubles tournament. Errani and Vavassori defended that title a few nights ago, winning the 2025 title as well, earning them not just another trophy but a cool million bucks. 
“I feel a little vindicated now that they've won for two years in a row, and the best men's singles players in the game have struggled with Errani's serve. We lost to a pretty good team!” Kovacevic said. “Props to them.” 
At this point, Kovacevic has played most of his heroes, including Novak Djokovic, with whom his family shares Serbian heritage. But he hasn't yet faced the current world numbers 1 and 2 players: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. He's eager to take the court with them.  “Those kinds of matches you can win or lose, but you learn a lot,” he said. Though he quickly added: “I”m not super sad that I don't have to play them in the first round here.”
For now, Kovacevic is “locking in” for round one action – confident that “in grand slams, you just find a little inspiration.” The New York crowds make sure of it. “This tournament is more special to me than any other. I love New York – just being back where I grew up — it's a nice feeling,” he said.

By Tracy Zwick

When Aleksandar Kovacevic was growing up on the Upper West Side, his parents took him to the US Open every summer for Fan Week and Kids' Day. They were big tennis fans and the price was right: free. As a young teen, the US Open meant ball-boy shifts for Aleks, who remembers gleefully blowing his earnings on Ben & Jerry's milkshakes.

Now 26, Kovacevic is back at the Open, working on-court again — this time as an established pro. His ranking, currently number 71 in the world, earned him automatic entry into the tournament's main draw for the second year in a row. On Monday, he faces Coleman Wong of Hong Kong, ranked 174, who got into the tournament's main draw by winning three matches in last week's qualifying round.

“It's been a good year for me for sure,” Kovacevic said from the players' locker room at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Thursday. “My best year on tour.”

That year has so far included a run to his first ATP final in Montpellier, France (ATP is the organization that runs men's tennis), then another in Los Cabos, Mexico. He earned his first win over a top-ten player, Andrey Rublev. Kovacevic's ranking went up to number 62 – the highest it's ever been.

Still, grand slams, the four premiere tennis tournaments of the year, are special, and, for Kovacevic, the US Open is personal. His path to the pros ran through afterschool tennis at UWS elementary and middle schools and one year at Beacon High School in midtown. He moved to Florida at 15 to focus on tennis. Unlike most of his peers, he delayed turning pro so he could spend four full years at college, the University of Illinois, where he earned a business degree.

At last year's US Open, Kovacevic drew his friend, Big Foe – star player Francis Tiafoe – in round 1. They played under the lights in Louis Armstrong Stadium, an All-American night battle in prime time. Kovacevic lost in four sets, and Tiafoe plowed his way into the semifinals, where he lost to American number 1 Taylor Fritz. 

This year the draw's been kinder to Kovacevic. Coleman Wong, the qualifier he plays on Monday, is lower-ranked and had to battle his way through those three qualifying matches, the last one on Friday.

Tour life has given Kovacevic perspective about the luck of the draw and other such things: “It's not always easy to be in the best head space when you're playing each and every week,” he said. “Even when you're winning, it's tough being out there competing, alone. You can get humbled pretty fast in tennis.” 

Though there's also validation. At last year's US Open, Kovacevic played mixed doubles in addition to singles, with young sensation Tyra Grant as his partner. They made it all the way to the semi-finals, where they lost to Italian duo Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, who ultimately won the mixed doubles tournament. Errani and Vavassori defended that title a few nights ago, winning the 2025 title as well, earning them not just another trophy but a cool million bucks. 

“I feel a little vindicated now that they've won for two years in a row, and the best men's singles players in the game have struggled with Errani's serve. We lost to a pretty good team!” Kovacevic said. “Props to them.” 

At this point, Kovacevic has played most of his heroes, including Novak Djokovic, with whom his family shares Serbian heritage. But he hasn't yet faced the current world numbers 1 and 2 players: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. He's eager to take the court with them.  “Those kinds of matches you can win or lose, but you learn a lot,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Buse was nearly Shelton's college teammate, now they are US Open opponents","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/buse-us-open-2025-feature","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 05:07:36 GMT","

In 2022, Ignacio Buse was one of the top junior tennis prospects in the world and a highly coveted college tennis recruit. The Peruvian had his pick of the best college tennis programmes in the United States and his three favourites were the University of Georgia, Baylor University and the University of Florida. 

Buse vividly remembers visiting the University of Florida with his father, Hans Buse, who was his longtime coach. At the time, Bryan Shelton was the head coach and his son, Ben played No. 1 singles and eventually won the NCAA Singles title.

“That visit was amazing. I was with Ben and all the other players in the team, Bryan,” Buse, who later committed to the University of Georgia, recalled. “When I called Bryan [to tell him of my decision], I didn't know what to say to him. I told him, ‘Look, Bryan, this was such a difficult decision. I am going to go to Georgia, but I love UF and I know our paths are going to cross in the future'.” 

On Sunday, Buse will face Shelton, now the No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, in the first round of the US Open. It will be the Peruvian's first Grand Slam main draw match.

“He was a funny guy. He was already really good. I think he was playing No. 1,” Buse recalled of his visit. “But I don't know, I would have never believed he would do those steps so fast. He was playing college and now he's No. 6 in the world, it's amazing. If you told me at that time I was going to play the first round against Ben in Ashe, I wouldn't believe you. 

“It's an experience, but I know Ben is a really good guy and I'm looking forward to playing against him.”

Buse never played college tennis. He was struggling to secure a visa to attend school in the United States and after stunning Nicolas Jarry last year as a 19-year-old ranked outside the Top 400 in the PIF ATP Rankings, college was off the radar.

The 21-year-old's tennis journey began at the Country Club de Villa in Peru where his father, Hans, was a coach.

“I learned with him since I was two or three years old. I basically grew up with a racquet in my hand,” Buse said. “My country club, he was the head coach at that club and it was near my house. I went to him whenever I could, to his classes to play. I've loved the game since I was a child.”



One of the things Buse loved was competition, especially with his father. By the age of 11 or 12, Ignacio was able to beat Hans in a tie-break and they would go at it in mini games.

“Sometimes I was getting so pissed with him, because he was beating me and sometimes he beat me, sometimes he let me win,” Buse recalled. “But he was also a competitive guy, so he didn't want to lose.”
That fiery spirit helped Buse reach No. 9 in the ITF Junior Rankings. Although he did not end up going to college, the Peruvian moved to Barcelona, where he trains at the Tennis Empowerment Centre Carles Ferrer Salat under coach Juan Lizariturry. There, Buse counts 2002 Roland Garros champion Albert Costa as a mentor.

“I'm so happy to be there. This academy doesn't only care about us as tennis players,” Buse said, before speaking about the influence of Costa, who will be in his box Sunday. “He has been so good. [His message has been] to be [focused] every point. 

“He always tells me when I'm on court that it doesn't matter if I do three double faults in a row or whatever I do. He just wants the next point that I am 100 per cent prepared. It doesn't matter the points before, just to try and put the maximum I can to the next point and erase the other points.”

Buse can also count on the support of his uncle, world-renowned chef Gaston Acurio. Buse and his team went to Acurio's restaurant Jarana in New Jersey on Friday and they spoke over the phone.

“He told me, ‘Let's go beat this guy!'” Buse recalled with a laugh. “I said to him, ‘Well, yeah, first step by step'. I told him it's just like another match, nothing changes. I try to visualise the match.

“I'm so happy to live this experience, but I want to go match by match. I want to feel like it's just another match, just like the first round of qualifying, the second round of qualifying… I trust myself and I will try to enjoy tomorrow.”

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been ruling the roost in men's tennis lately, bagging every major tournament between them this year and raking in millions for their efforts. The Italian ace remains the world No. 1, with his victories at the Australian Open and Wimbledon netting him a cool £4.6million.

On the other hand, world No. 2 Alcaraz bested Sinner in a gruelling showdown at the French Open, clinching the trophy and a hefty £2.1m. Together, the pair have pocketed a combined total of £14.6m this year for their troubles.

And there's still a £3.6m sum available for them both to fight for at the final major of the season. Both feature in the list of the top 10 all-time men's earners in the sport, although they're still a fair way off matching the likes of Novak Djokovic on tennis' ultimate rich list.

Here, Mirror Sport has taken a look at who's made the most from their tennis victories over the years, as the final major tournament of the year gets underway at the US Open this weekend.

Stan Wawrinka is the oldest active tennis player to make it into the top 10 highest earners. The Swiss star has earned £263,000 from his performances in 2025, clinching the Tiriac Open in April to record his first victory since October 2024.

The 40-year-old has amassed a total of £28m across his 23-year career and boasts three Grand Slam wins. Wawrinka has conquered the Australian Open, US Open, and French Open but has yet to complete the career Grand Slam.

A seasoned pro on the tennis courts, he's twice reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015. However, he's not competing at the US Open this year.

Despite retiring over two decades ago, Pete Sampras still ranks among the highest earners in tennis. The American legend, who clinched 14 Grand Slam titles throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, earned a total of £32m during his 14-year career.

Sampras, known as 'Pistol Pete' for his powerful serve, won Wimbledon seven times, bagged two Australian Opens and five US Open titles. 

His best performance at Roland-Garros was reaching the semi-finals in 1996 - the only major tournament that eluded him.

Current Wimbledon champ Sinner is eighth on the list of top-earning men in tennis, with his recent victories netting him millions. This year alone, the Italian has pocketed £6.7m in prize money, adding both the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles to his collection in 2025.

With a career earnings total of £34m, 20 ATP Tour titles, and four Grand Slam victories under his belt in just seven years, the world No. 1 is certainly making his mark.

Most recently, he withdrew from the Cincinnati Open final ahead of the last major tournament of the year, the US Open. Despite this setback, Sinner is set to face Vit Kopriva in the first round at Flushing Meadows.

Daniil Medvedev has raked in a whopping £34.9m over his 11-year career, despite only clinching one Grand Slam title - the US Open. 

The 29-year-old, who's pocketed £1.3m in 2025 alone, has come tantalisingly close to another major win three times at the Australian Open final. However, he fell short each time against Djokovic, Nadal and Sinner, respectively.

Despite boasting 20 ATP Tour titles from his 405 circuit wins, Medvedev recently lost in the US Open mixed doubles quarter-finals alongside partner Mirra Andreeva, losing 4-1, 4-1 to Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. 

This leaves him to concentrate on the men's singles tournament, where he hopes to repeat his 2021 triumph.

Alcaraz has emerged as one of tennis' most beloved figures in recent years, bagging five Grand Slam titles in just three years. 

The 22-year-old prodigy earned an impressive £7.9m in 2025 alone, thanks to his French Open victory, and a staggering £36m over his seven-year career.

Alcaraz has proven himself a formidable force on the court, securing consecutive Wimbledon titles in 2023 and 2024. All eyes will be on him in 2026 as he continues to battle with the Australian Open, the only title he needs to complete a career Grand Slam.

The Spanish tennis ace recently clinched the Cincinnati Open title after Sinner had to bow out early in the final. He's now setting his sights on the US Open, hoping to lift the trophy for the first time since 2022.

Alexander Zverev sits fifth on the list of the sport's highest earners. The German has pocketed £3.1m in prize money in 2025 alone, and a whopping £40.5m over his 12-year career.

Zverev holds 24 ATP Tour titles and has reached the finals of the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open within the last five years. 

Although he's yet to bag a Grand Slam title, the world No. 3 has triumphed over his closest rivals - Sinner and Alcaraz - multiple times.

As the US Open looms, the 28-year-old will hope to turn one of these victories into a major tournament win.

Andy Murray, who is the only Brit on this list, ranks fourth among the highest earners in tennis. Despite competing in what many consider the golden era of tennis, the double Olympic champion has managed to outplay Federer, Nadal and Djokovic on multiple occasions.

Murray has amassed a total of £48m from his tennis career, which includes three Grand Slam titles and six more major tournament finals. 

His victories include two Wimbledon titles and one US Open win. He defeated Djokovic twice and Milos Raonic once in the finals to secure these trophies.

Murray also bagged two Olympic gold medals in a legendary career that he called time on in 2024.

Roger Federer retired in 2022 after a glittering 24-year career that saw him clinch 20 Grand Slam titles. With 1,251 victories and 103 singles titles under his belt, Federer amassed a whopping £97m from his ATP Tour career earnings.

This puts him third on the list, trailing behind Djokovic and Nadal - the other two tennis titans that make up the sport's renowned 'Big Three'. Out of this trio, Federer has the most Wimbledon titles, with eight, as well as seven Australian Opens and five US Opens.

Despite winning just one French Open title at the age of 44, he had to battle the king of Roland-Garros - Nadal - over the years to claim this singular Grand Slam.

Rafael Nadal sits in second place on both the highest earners list and the number of Grand Slams won in his career. The Spanish icon, who boasts 22 major tournament wins, raked in a staggering £100m from his tennis career.

With 1,080 professional wins and 92 titles to his name, Nadal is best known for his prowess on the hard clay courts, where he secured a record 14 French Open titles.

His other Grand Slam victories include two Australian Opens, four US Opens and two Wimbledon crowns.

Novak Djokovic continues to reign supreme as the sport's top earner. The Serbian superstar has raked in a whopping £140.5m from his ATP Tour career, amassing an impressive array of titles along the way.

The world No. 7 boasts a record-breaking 24 Grand Slam victories, including 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Opens.

In 2025 alone, the 38-year-old has pocketed £2.5m after winning 26 matches and losing nine, clinching the Geneva Open title in the process.

With both of his closest financial rivals now retired and the nearest contender over £100m behind, it seems unlikely that anyone will knock Djokovic off this lucrative perch anytime soon.","{'href': 'https://www.mirror.co.uk', 'title': 'The Mirror'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Tommy Paul provides latest update on his foot injury ahead of the US Open after being in a cast following Wimbledon","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/tommy-paul-provides-latest-update-on-his-foot-injury-ahead-of-the-us-open-after-being-in-a-cast-following-wimbledon/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 07:30:00 GMT","

It felt like Tommy Paul's season had been slowly building towards a really top result before all his momentum was halted at Wimbledon.

After all, the American had reached the quarter-finals of both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, despite failing to win an ATP title elsewhere.

He is an elite-level player capable of troubling the very best on tour, but fell victim to the inexplicable number of early-round exits at the All-England Club, losing in just the second round.

We have since learned that his failure to impress was tied to a foot injury, which later required him to wear a cast.

Now, ahead of the US Open, he has delivered a fitness update.

Speaking with Flashscore, the 28-year-old first touched on the difficulties he has faced this year.

“This year has been a little different than most,” he began. “I've been dealing with a little bit of injury in my foot at Wimbledon, so kind of had a little bit of recovery to do for that, so I sat out of a couple tournaments in the States.

“It breaks my heart, because I love nothing more than playing tennis in the States, in front of US fans. It's a lot of the reason that I play. I absolutely love it, so to miss it, it really sucked.”

And yet, despite this heartbreak, Paul insists he is now fitter than ever: “The foot is actually amazing,” says Paul. “The foot's never felt better. It's literally the best it's felt in five years. I'm pretty pumped about that.

“I went into a boot for a couple weeks after Wimbledon. When you go into a boot, your ankle kind of gets very tight because of the mobility, it's not mobile at all. It's just really getting the mobility back and everything.

“I wouldn't say I'm in much pain. I would just say really trying to get the strength around the ankle and around the foot back is what we're most focused on right now.”

This comes after Tommy Paul revealed what he finds most ‘crazy' about the ATP Tour.

As touched upon earlier, Tommy Paul had performed admirably at the majors this year before his Wimbledon disaster.

However, for whatever reason, the US Open has historically been his worst-performing Grand Slam.

In the other three, he has reached at least the quarter-finals, having even made the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2023.

And yet, last year's fourth-round run in New York tied his best-ever performance; a feat he will certainly be hoping to surpass this year.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Serena Williams made a surprise appearance on Saturday to honour her ""former rival"" Maria Sharapova, taking the stage in Newport, Rhode Island, to induct her into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Serena, 43, and Maria, 38, shared a fierce sporting feud that all started in 2004, when Maria – who was only 17 at the time – won the Championship title over Serena, who was the two-time defending champion. What later unfolded was two decades of sporting rivalry, with the two athletes repeatedly going head-to-head to take the Grand Slam.

In the end, Maria ended up winning five titles, while Serena dominated with 23 – securing her reputation as the second-most decorated champ of all time, following Australia player Margaret Court, who had 24. On court, Serena dominated their head-to-head matches with 20 victories to Maria's two, fuelling an often-tense dynamic that reportedly spilled beyond the baseline.

In a post on Instagram, Serena began by acknowledging the full-circle moment: ""Last night, I flew to Rhode Island for Maria Sharapova,"" she said. ""Maria's career, as her dad put it yesterday, started with me and last night, ended with me inducting her into the tennis hall of fame.""

Reflecting on their past, Serena acknowledged the full-circle moment in a heartfelt Instagram post: ""I'm probably the last person you expected to see standing here tonight,"" she said. ""Honestly, a few years ago, I would've said the same thing. But years after getting to know her better, we now call each other friends. And when a friend calls, you answer.""

It seems the two athletes have well and truly put the past behind them, however, as Maria asked Serena to induct her into the tennis Hall of Fame. Retiring in 2020, 2025 marks the qualifying year that Maria could be inducted. ""This is women supporting each other and respecting each other's greatness,"" continued Serena. ""Congratulations @mariasharapova, it is my honor – as her former rival, her forever fan and now, her forever friend – to welcome Maria Sharapova into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.""

Honouring her ""forever friend"", Serena spoke of Maria's nearly 20-year professional career, as well as the tension that arose between them during that time. ""In 2004, when Maria was just 17 years old, she stunned the world and won Wimbledon,"" Serena said.

""To this day, she calls it the highlight of her career, and to this day, I call it one of my hardest losses. The match didn't just make her a champion, it actually made her a star. It launched one of the most talked about and controversial rivalries in tennis.""

Serena continued: ""For more than a decade and a half, every time we faced each other, the atmosphere shifted. It was thick, the tension was real. The fire was real. And honestly you could feel it – and, by the way you could hear it… with all Maria's grunting!"" Laughing from the audience, Maria playfully called back: ""Yours too!""

Later, Maria shared her gratitude for her rival-turned-friend on Instagram: ""Thank you for having my back tonight, @serenawilliams. It meant the world to me.""

Alcaraz has proven himself a formidable force on the court, securing consecutive Wimbledon titles in 2023 and 2024. All eyes will be on him in 2026 as he continues to battle with the Australian Open, the only title he needs to complete a career Grand Slam.

The Spanish tennis ace recently clinched the Cincinnati Open title after Sinner had to bow out early in the final. He's now setting his sights on the US Open, hoping to lift the trophy for the first time since 2022.

Alexander Zverev sits fifth on the list of the sport's highest earners. The German has pocketed £3.1m in prize money in 2025 alone, and a whopping £40.5m over his 12-year career.

Zverev holds 24 ATP Tour titles and has reached the finals of the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open within the last five years. 

Although he's yet to bag a Grand Slam title, the world No. 3 has triumphed over his closest rivals - Sinner and Alcaraz - multiple times.

As the US Open looms, the 28-year-old will hope to turn one of these victories into a major tournament win.

Andy Murray, who is the only Brit on this list, ranks fourth among the highest earners in tennis. Despite competing in what many consider the golden era of tennis, the double Olympic champion has managed to outplay Federer, Nadal and Djokovic on multiple occasions.

Murray has amassed a total of £48m from his tennis career, which includes three Grand Slam titles and six more major tournament finals. 

His victories include two Wimbledon titles and one US Open win. He defeated Djokovic twice and Milos Raonic once in the finals to secure these trophies.

Murray also bagged two Olympic gold medals in a legendary career that he called time on in 2024.

Roger Federer retired in 2022 after a glittering 24-year career that saw him clinch 20 Grand Slam titles. With 1,251 victories and 103 singles titles under his belt, Federer amassed a whopping £97m from his ATP Tour career earnings.

This puts him third on the list, trailing behind Djokovic and Nadal - the other two tennis titans that make up the sport's renowned 'Big Three'. Out of this trio, Federer has the most Wimbledon titles, with eight, as well as seven Australian Opens and five US Opens.

Despite winning just one French Open title at the age of 44, he had to battle the king of Roland-Garros - Nadal - over the years to claim this singular Grand Slam.

Rafael Nadal sits in second place on both the highest earners list and the number of Grand Slams won in his career. The Spanish icon, who boasts 22 major tournament wins, raked in a staggering £100m from his tennis career.

With 1,080 professional wins and 92 titles to his name, Nadal is best known for his prowess on the hard clay courts, where he secured a record 14 French Open titles.

His other Grand Slam victories include two Australian Opens, four US Opens and two Wimbledon crowns.

Novak Djokovic continues to reign supreme as the sport's top earner. The Serbian superstar has raked in a whopping £140.5m from his ATP Tour career, amassing an impressive array of titles along the way.

The world No. 7 boasts a record-breaking 24 Grand Slam victories, including 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Opens.

In 2025 alone, the 38-year-old has pocketed £2.5m after winning 26 matches and losing nine, clinching the Geneva Open title in the process.

With both of his closest financial rivals now retired and the nearest contender over £100m behind, it seems unlikely that anyone will knock Djokovic off this lucrative perch anytime soon.","{'href': 'https://www.mirror.co.uk', 'title': 'The Mirror'}","tennis"

Briton beats qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2

Email Taha with your thoughts on the action

Shelton's rocket first serve forces Buse to stand behind the baseline in another postcode. The left-hander gets himself to set point and needs just one shot at it, his second serve down the middle still too hot for Buse. Shelton leads 6-3, 6-2.

Shelton has a chance to break but Buse delivers a gorgeous backhand half-volley to keep himself in the game. The sixth seed hits a delicious forehand around the net to take advantage after five deuces, and he finally breaks after the sixth, a forehand winner extending Shelton's lead to 6-3, 5-2. He'll serve for the second set.

Shelton leaps high to smash away – he's won 16 of 18 net points. Then comes his work from deep, a forehand leaving Buse wrong-footed behind the baseline before Shelton makes it 6-3, 4-2.

Shelton breaks, helped by a Buse double fault. He now leads 6-3, 3-2, while Taylor Fritz has begun his tournament at the Louis Armstrong Stadium. The fourth seed is up against Emilio Nava.

Shelton extends his lead to 6-3, 2-2. In the women's singles there's American joy in the form of the 32nd seed, McCartney Kessler, who has beaten Magda Linette 7-5, 7-5.

Shelton, from way behind the baseline, runs around the backhand to whip a delicious forehand winner. But Buse has got some ticker and holds his serve. Shelton leads 6-3, 1-2.

Shelton heads to deuce on his serve and takes advantage after Buse goes long with a forehand. It's Shelton who has compiled more unforced errors though, and he adds another with his backhand to take it to deuce. Shelton still manages to hold and leads 6-3, 1-1.

Buse holds his serve, with Shelton leading 6-3, 0-1. Elsewhere, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, the 18th seed, is through to the second round after beating Alexander Shevchenko 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.

Shelton slides to close the rally with a backhand volley, making it 15-all. But Buse's back, baby, nabbing himself two break points. Shelton's southpaw power gets him out of trouble, a whopping forehand and serve taking him to deuce. He nets and Buse has another chance to break … but Shelton clocks an ace at 132mph. Shelton takes himself to set point and doesn't let go, Buse going wide with a backhand. The American takes the first set 6-3.

Buse has matched Shelton's efforts but the latter has two break points after the Peruvian sends a forehand wild. Then comes the double fault, Buse suddenly losing control of his first serve which, um, had served him well to this point. Shelton is up 5-3, serving for the first set.

Shelton's wicked serve brings him an ace to go 30-15 up and he takes the game with a backhand volley. He leads 4-3 in the first set.

This is the first time Buse has made it into the main draw at a grand slam and he holds his serve after Shelton goes a touch too wild with a backhand. It's 3-3 in the first set.

Let's head to Ben Shelton's contest with Ignacio Buse. Shelton is the sixth seed, 22 years young and an American hope. He's got form, too, having won the Canadian Open this month. He's 3-2 up against Buse, with the Peruvian to serve.

Raducanu speaks: “Playing Ena, she's really tricky, she hit so many balls on the baseline that I was not expecting to just dip. She obviously came through qualifying and you feel like you have a bit of an advantage, you're playing on the surface and know what it feels like so I'm just very pleased with how I managed myself, managed my game through that match.”

Raducanu goes up 40-0 after dominating from the baseline, and Shibahara sends a forehand wide to end the contest. She's into the second round for the first time since her 2021 triumph with a dominant display.

Shibahara is growing into the contest … but it's probably too late. She's looked more comfortable when advancing to the net and goes up 40-15 … before double-faulting. A fine serve down the middle gives Shibahara the game. Raducanu leads 6-1, 5-2.

Raducanu goes wide with a forehand to begin the game and Shibahara pumps her fist … but her frustration returns when she goes long to make it 15-all. But Shibahara is fighting, and a backhand volley bring her a chance to break … Raducanu has no time for a comeback. She holds to go up 6-1, 5-1.

Over on Arthur Ashe, Ben Shelton is getting ready to start against Ignasio Buse.

Shibahara finally has some joy, going 40-0 up as she hold her nerve at the net, and a forehand winner brings further respite. Raducanu leads 6-1, 4-1.

An ace completes another dominant game from Raducanu, extending her lead to 6-1, 4-0.

The unforced errors continue from Shibahara and Raducanu has two break points. She's ready to attack the second serve and dictate play; Shibahara nets and Raducanu is up 6-1, 3-0, the march continuing.

Raducanu's clearly got afternoon plans. She races through on her serve, leading 6-1, 2-0.

Elsewhere, in the men's singles, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, the 18th seed, is cruising against Alexander Shevchenko. He took the first set 6-1 and is serving in the second, 2-0 up. Raducanu has two break points to start the second set but Shibahara resists, dragging the game into deuce. Shibahara's forehand down the middle thunders into the net … but she keeps herself going with a whippy backhand. Deuce again. Raducanu capitalises on her opponent's errors, taking the break. She leads 6-1, 1-0.

Raducanu gets to set point after Shibahara loses all power with her forehand. The former gets up to the net to smash and finish. Raducanu wins the first set 6-1 inside half an hour, no dramas.

Shibahara's double fault allows Raducanu to make it 15-all, and a forehand into the net gives Raducanu the next point. But Shibahara is finally on the board, a forehand down the line providing her some relief. Raducanu leads 5-1.

Shibahara finds the net while trying to return a backhand slice and goes long moments later, allowing Raducanu to go 5-0 up.

Well, that was rapid. Raducanu breaks once again with little to no discomfort, Shibahara netting while down 15-40. The British No 1 seems to have too much power for her opponent at the moment. Raducanu leads 4-0.

Shibahara finally gets a go at Raducanu's second serve and wallops a deep forehand to make it 15-30. The former takes the game to deuce after finding some confidence with her forehand … well, just as I type that, she sends one way out of bounds. Raducanu holds to go 3-0 up.

Shibahara's first point of the match is set up by a tidy drop shot. She double-faults to make it 30-30, and does so again – a chance for Raducanu to break. Shibahara finds the net with a forehand and Raducanu goes 2-0 up.

And we're finally up and running, with Raducanu to serve. An ace is her first act of the tournament, and she's rapid in going to 40-0, that first serve looking in good order. She's up to the net as Shibahara is quickly overpowered. Raducanu leads 1-0 in the first set.

Raducanu has played Shibahara before, beating her 6-1, 6-4 in Nottingham last year. Shibahara is best known for her work in doubles, having won the mixed event at the 2022 French Open. She did reach the second round of the singles here last year.

If you fancy indulging in some nostalgia.

Quick: tuck into Tumaini Carayol's preview. Swiatek and Sinner lead the pack.

Hello, hello, hello and welcome to the last slam of the season. We've had the flashier version of mixed doubles; now to the solo show, with the tournament enjoying its first Sunday start.

Ben Shelton, Aryna Sabalenka and Taylor Fritz are among the big names ready to get going in the next few hours, but our early focus will be on the 2021 champion Emma Raducanu. She hasn't won a match at Flushing Meadows since that life-changing triumph but is carrying some good vibes into this year's draw; the world No 36 pushed Sabalenka all the way to a third-set tiebreak in Cincinnati this month. She faces Japan's Ena Shibahara at the Louis Armstrong Stadium at 4pm BST/11am local time.

The curse has been broken for Emma Raducanu at the US Open.

Since winning her lone Grand Slam at the US Open in 2021, the 22-year-old British sensation had lost in the first round ever since. Until today, when she defeated Japan's Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2. 

And the heartthrob, that fans desperately want to be Carlos Alcaraz's girlfriend, can thank her fire-red fit.

In a wild stat noted by the US Open, Raducanu is now 8-0 when wearing red at the US Open, having not dropped a set in those eight matches.

Thus the only logical conclusion, never wear any color other than red until you lose.

While Raducanu stole most of the headlines leading up to the US Open playing mixed doubles with close friend Alcaraz, displaying their natural chemistry together, it was obviously a weight lifted off of her shoulders to get that first-round victory in Louis Armstrong Stadium.

""It's my first win here since 2021, so it's extra special,"" Raducanu said after the match.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

And if she decides to tempt fate and wear colors other than red, then it's on her if she doesn't capture that record-setting $5 million payout, the largest ever for a tennis tournament.

At the very least those fantastic all-red kicks should be a staple moving forward.

Emma Raducanu generally makes any kit look good, so I'm not sure if I really like this tomato red and aubergine Nike kit or is it just her. I'll have to see it on someone else, I suppose. But this looks great on her! #USOpen pic.twitter.com/A277ME18bR

The final major of the tennis season kicks off on Sunday.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are the top seeds for the 2025 US Open in New York.

Sinner and Sabalenka are also the reigning champions of the event. If they win the 2025 event, they will each take home a $5 million winners' purse.

The full breakdown of US Open prize money can be found here on the tournament website.

Tournament Preview

Sinner and Sabalenka have had their respective ways at the hard-court majors recently.

Sinner won the last two Australian Opens and is the reigning champion in New York.

Sabalenka enters New York with three of the last five hard-court majors in her trophy case and five straight hard-court major final appearances. 

Each top seed has a serious challenger in Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, but both of them would be favored in any championship matchups, including against the No. 2 seeds in their respective brackets. 

The American contingent will likely have something to say throughout the tournament, though, as a handful of them are seeded in the top 10.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Amanda Anisimova and Emma Navarro are all top-10 seeds in the women's draw. 

Pegula lost to Sabalenka in last year's final and Navarro made a run to the semifinals in 2024. 

Pegula and Navarro reside in Sabalenka's portion of the 2025 bracket, while Keys, Gaiff and Anisimova are all in the bottom half alongside Swiatek, who is far better on the clay and grass courts. 

Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton are the best American male hopefuls to win. Fritz fell to Sinner in the final a year ago and is coming off a semifinal run at Wimbledon.

Shelton reached the quarterfinals in three of his last five hard-court majors and was a semifinalist earlier this season in Australia. 

Fritz and Shelton are both in Alcaraz's side of the bracket, which also features Novak Djokovic, so getting to the final will not be easy for either player. 

The favorites are projected to win given their hard-court dominance, but if there is a surprise winner of the $5 million purse, it could be one of the Americans playing on home soil.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","tennis"

By JIMMY GOLEN

NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) — Serena Williams made a a surprise — and early — appearance at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, emerging from behind the stage to introduce “former rival, former fan and forever friend” Maria Sharapova for her induction on Saturday night. 

Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who will be eligible for her own enshrinement in 2027, drew gasps and shrieks from the crowd at the Newport shrine.

“There are only a few players in my career who challenged me to be the very best, every single time we stepped out on the court,” Williams said. “Maria Sharapova was one of them. Whenever I saw her name next to mine in the draw, I made sure I practiced harder.”

And the feeling was mutual.

“It's a gift to have someone who motivates you to reach those heights. And I'll forever be grateful for bringing out the best in me,” Sharapova said in her acceptance speech. “We both knew no other way than to fight our hearts out. … We both hated to lose more than anything on this earth, and we both knew that the other was the biggest obstacle between ourselves and the trophy.”

The first Russian woman ever to reach No. 1 in the rankings and one of 10 women to complete the career Grand Slam, Sharapova was joined in the Class of 2025 by dominating doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. The twin brothers finished their speech with one of their trademark chest bumps.

Hall of Famers Martina Navratilova, Jim Courier, Stan Smith and Andy Roddick were among those in the crowd, wearing their blue Hall of Fame blazers. Sharapova and the Bryan brothers also received a cast tennis racket that is the hall's newest offering to inductees.

Sharapova was described in her introductory video as someone who “combined grit with glamour,” and some of the stylish outfits she competed in are already displayed in the hall — including a tuxedo-inspired dress she wore when she won Wimbledon in 2008. 

Williams noted that her rival was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 straight years — bolstered by endorsement income that surpassed her on-court winnings. 

“She showed us all how to take excellence on the court and turn it into excellence in business, and fashion, branding and everything that she touched,” Williams said. “She changed how women not only approached tennis, but sports and opportunity. She showed us that you can be fierce on the court and strategic off the court, and unapologetically herself the entire time.”

Sharapova said her induction gave her a chance to look back — something she tried not to do when she was playing. And she credited her success to “embracing the struggles and leaning into the hard stuff.”

“When voices inevitably tell you to ease up, to round your edges, dull your ambition, I hope you can find a way to ignore them,” she said. “Compete fiercely. Raise your standard. Set goals that intimidate you. And don't forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how small. 

“In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life,” she said. “And what a remarkable, remarkable life. And I'm so deeply grateful for it.”

The Bryans shared a speech as if they were taking turns hitting on a court, alternating at the microphone as they thanked coaches, friends and Davis Cup teammates from a career in which they won 119 ATP titles, including 16 Grand Slams, and an Olympic gold medal. They spent a record 438 weeks atop the world rankings.

Navratilova, who won the 2006 U.S. Open mixed doubles title with Bob Bryan, credited the brothers for keeping the doubles disciplines from being forgotten. 

“Not too many athletes transcend their sport,” she said. “For twins to do it is amazing.” 

Bob Bryan said he was fortunate because “for most of my career, I had the No. 1 player in the world across the hall.”

“Doubles was our love from Day 1,” Mike Bryan said. “We loved everything about doubles. We loved the strategy, the teamwork, sharing, and the highs and lows. Like our personalities, our games complemented each other perfectly.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tien now working with Chang, who will make box debut for Djokovic showdown","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tien-chang-us-open-2025-feature","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 04:00:46 GMT","

#NextGenATP star Learner Tien began his 2025 season in Hong Kong. One day, the lefty was enjoying a typical practice at the ATP 250 event when he met former World No. 2 Michael Chang, a three-time winner of the tournament, for the first time. That day the pair only shared a brief hello.

Tien's coach at the time, Eric Diaz, reached out about the potential of Chang helping the 19-year-old, which was convenient given they live 20 minutes from each other in California. Tien, who now travels with his junior coach, Erik Kortland, began working with Chang the week before Washington and the 34-time tour-level titlist will be in the teen's box for the first time Sunday evening when he takes on 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the first round of the US Open.

“I'm trying to help him as best as I can,” Chang told ATPTour.com. “This is not always an easy year for players when they come out, and they're playing the main Tour, the first year out, which is really kind of what it is for him. Last year, he played a lot of Challengers and did really, really well at the end of the year. But this whole year has been new for him.

“He's been handling it well, and obviously is doing great.”

When Chang met Tien at the start of the season, he was the No. 122 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Now he is at a career-high World No. 48 and on the rise. He will try to hand Djokovic his first opening-round loss at a major since the 2006 Australian Open.

“I like his draw. Obviously Novak is one of the greatest players to play tennis, if not the G.O.A.T. himself. Learner has nothing to lose. He has everything to gain,” Chang said. “Certainly, growing up, Novak would have been one of the great champions he has watched growing up and he is the last of his group of unbelievable players: Rafa and Roger and Andy, all part of that. 

“For [Learner] to get an opportunity to play one of them is very special and let's not deny the fact that Novak is still playing unbelievable tennis. If Sinner and Alcaraz are not in his way, he could have very easily added more Grand Slams to his resume. But at the same time, Learner has nothing to lose tomorrow night.”

Chang pointed out that Tien is playing his home Grand Slam tournament and will have the crowd behind him, while Djokovic has not competed since Wimbledon. 

“I don't know how he's necessarily going to be coming out. We'll obviously expect him to play his best, as he always does, in Grand Slam events,” Chang said. “But Learner showed throughout this season that he can give the best players a lot of trouble. And he's beating some guys that had beaten Novak in past Grand Slams and he should draw confidence from that.”

Notably, Tien shocked former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in a final-set tie-break in the second round of this year's Australian Open en route to the fourth round. The lefty is competing in his fourth US Open and pursuing his first victory at the event. Tien learned of his draw while in the car back to his hotel with Kortland.

“For a moment, we were laughing because I think he's gotten a seed or a top player every year that he's played here so far. He was like, ‘Yeah, well, maybe one year we'll get a draw that I can ease into',” Kortland said. “But the way that we looked at it is, ‘Hey, this is an unbelievable opportunity. You're playing, may I dare say, the G.O.A.T, maybe one of the greatest of all time. But this is an unbelievable opportunity to play someone, maybe towards the end of their career. You get to play on Ashe, you get to play a night match, have fun. Just really enjoy the moment'.

“I think that eased him up a little bit to understand that there's no more importance on this match than any other match that we're playing and take it for the opportunity that it is and see what happens.”



Kortland is a former national coach with USTA Player Development who has been mentored by coaching legends including Jose Higueras, Jay Berger, Ola Malmqvist and Andy Brandi. Now he is enjoying the experience of working alongside Chang.

“I was never a highly ranked ATP player, so to be able to get what that type of player is feeling in these certain moments, some tactical stuff [is great]. He's coached Kei Nishikori as well, who's played all these top guys, [reached the] final of a Grand Slam, played on Ashe,” Kortland said. “So there are a lot of things that Michael's going to bring as far as being a player and what he sees and feels and may have experienced. But also, he's an unbelievable coach.”

Chang has studied Tien's game extensively. But even before going through that process, the former World No. 2 noticed while watching tennis that Tien would spin his serve in.

“I think he's serving a lot bigger now, for sure. Obviously, he has the capability of doing that. Now he's starting to incorporate that into his game,” Chang said. “I don't think that's been a difficult transition for him. I do actually think that he has the capability of playing very aggressively off the ground, and he's able to finish points off at the net. He's got a good net game, and there's no reason why, in a very short period of time, he can become really more of an all-court player in every regard.”

Chang was one of the best defenders of his era, but he believes it is difficult to play a purely defensive game today because of the firepower and spin the stars of the ATP Tour possess in their games. He hopes to work with Tien on developing those skills and continuing his rise.

The winner of 662 tour-level matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, does not have a tonne of time to travel with Tien given other commitments, largely spending time with family and traveling with his older daughter, Lani, a 14-year-old who will be competing in the US Open girls' event later in the fortnight. But Chang is happy to be helping Tien for several reasons.

“I have always had a heart for Asian tennis, for Asian-American tennis, and I've enjoyed my time that I've worked with him. I feel like he's got a good head on his shoulders,” Chang said. “To be able to see another fellow Asian American have the opportunity to do well on Tour, and for me to impart some of the experiences that I've had, in helping him to achieve his goals, I feel like it's a rewarding thing to do. I'm excited about the opportunity.”

When Emilio Nava steps inside Louis Armstrong Stadium on Sunday to begin his US Open against American No. 1 Taylor Fritz, the 23-year-old will be playing for more than a match win. Nava will be representing a cause: the Live Like Braun Foundation.

This May, an 18-year-old tennis player from California, Braun Levi, was tragically killed in an accident by a suspected drunk driver. Nava first heard about the incident from a friend, Roy Horovitz. Another friend, Ignacio Arenas, brought it up again and it began to take on even more meaning for the American.

“It was super sad and to be part of it and try to help in some way, even if it's just by representing, I was completely up for it and I think it's great,” Nava told ATPTour.com. “If I can help one per cent and try to extend the story about his life and what he did, it would be amazing. 

“But it is not only about that, but the reason why he sadly passed away, the drunk driving. It's trying to end that. It's as simple as letting that one person go home that one night. It's ending drunk driving, letting a friend drive, take an Uber. You let people go home if you do that.”

Nava has been wearing a patch for the Live Like Braun Foundation to help raise awareness. It has helped that he is playing the best tennis of his career and is at a career-high No. 101 in the PIF ATP Rankings. He just played Fritz in the second round of the Cincinnati Open inside the ATP Masters 1000 event's biggest stadium.

“I've gotten pretty fortunate this year with having some pretty good results and the better results, the higher platform you have,” Nava said. “I'm at my highest ranking now and I feel like I have a little bit of a voice. I played Cincinnati and I played on the centre courts a few times. That was an unreal experience. 

“I got a little bit of exposure with the patch and just trying to get the word out and trying to help and hopefully make an impact on someone's life and it changes someone's life. That's the ultimate goal.”



Fritz and Nava are both Californians who have brought their games to the biggest stages in the world. Nava will try to strike back in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Fritz, who leads 2-0. 

“It's amazing that we went from playing in SoCal to now one of the biggest stadiums in the world,” Nava said. “I'm just super excited for it… He's a really good competitor.”

The five-time ATP Challenger Tour champion changed his team in December, beginning to work with Argentines Diego Cristin and Federico Diorio. That move has proven fruitful, with Nava claiming three of his titles this season.

“We've got a good thing going,” Nava said. “We understand that tennis is a big strokes game, but at the end of the day it's extremely mental and we're really locking that part down.” 

This will be Nava's fourth US Open appearance and he has learned a lot from his first experiences at the season's final major, including a match against Andy Murray in 2022. The Scot triumphed in four sets.

“It's just another court, the dimensions are the same. Just try to go out there, compete and have fun. I wish someone would have told me that when I was 18, 19 and getting those wild cards and having those opportunities to play,” Nava said. “But at the same time, without those wild cards I wouldn't be where I am today because I wouldn't have gotten the experience that I've gotten. I wouldn't have gotten the help that I've gotten and I'm extremely grateful, especially to the USTA.”

Win or lose, Nava knows it is about more than tennis. What is his final message to the fans watching?

“Honestly, just try to end drunk driving,” Nava said. “It lets people go home at night and it saves lives.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Buse was nearly Shelton's college teammate, now they are US Open opponents","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/buse-us-open-2025-feature","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 05:07:36 GMT","

In 2022, Ignacio Buse was one of the top junior tennis prospects in the world and a highly coveted college tennis recruit. The Peruvian had his pick of the best college tennis programmes in the United States and his three favourites were the University of Georgia, Baylor University and the University of Florida. 

Buse vividly remembers visiting the University of Florida with his father, Hans Buse, who was his longtime coach. At the time, Bryan Shelton was the head coach and his son, Ben played No. 1 singles and eventually won the NCAA Singles title.

“That visit was amazing. I was with Ben and all the other players in the team, Bryan,” Buse, who later committed to the University of Georgia, recalled. “When I called Bryan [to tell him of my decision], I didn't know what to say to him. I told him, ‘Look, Bryan, this was such a difficult decision. I am going to go to Georgia, but I love UF and I know our paths are going to cross in the future'.” 

On Sunday, Buse will face Shelton, now the No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, in the first round of the US Open. It will be the Peruvian's first Grand Slam main draw match.

“He was a funny guy. He was already really good. I think he was playing No. 1,” Buse recalled of his visit. “But I don't know, I would have never believed he would do those steps so fast. He was playing college and now he's No. 6 in the world, it's amazing. If you told me at that time I was going to play the first round against Ben in Ashe, I wouldn't believe you. 

“It's an experience, but I know Ben is a really good guy and I'm looking forward to playing against him.”

Buse never played college tennis. He was struggling to secure a visa to attend school in the United States and after stunning Nicolas Jarry last year as a 19-year-old ranked outside the Top 400 in the PIF ATP Rankings, college was off the radar.

The 21-year-old's tennis journey began at the Country Club de Villa in Peru where his father, Hans, was a coach.

“I learned with him since I was two or three years old. I basically grew up with a racquet in my hand,” Buse said. “My country club, he was the head coach at that club and it was near my house. I went to him whenever I could, to his classes to play. I've loved the game since I was a child.”



One of the things Buse loved was competition, especially with his father. By the age of 11 or 12, Ignacio was able to beat Hans in a tie-break and they would go at it in mini games.

“Sometimes I was getting so pissed with him, because he was beating me and sometimes he beat me, sometimes he let me win,” Buse recalled. “But he was also a competitive guy, so he didn't want to lose.”
That fiery spirit helped Buse reach No. 9 in the ITF Junior Rankings. Although he did not end up going to college, the Peruvian moved to Barcelona, where he trains at the Tennis Empowerment Centre Carles Ferrer Salat under coach Juan Lizariturry. There, Buse counts 2002 Roland Garros champion Albert Costa as a mentor.

“I'm so happy to be there. This academy doesn't only care about us as tennis players,” Buse said, before speaking about the influence of Costa, who will be in his box Sunday. “He has been so good. [His message has been] to be [focused] every point. 

“He always tells me when I'm on court that it doesn't matter if I do three double faults in a row or whatever I do. He just wants the next point that I am 100 per cent prepared. It doesn't matter the points before, just to try and put the maximum I can to the next point and erase the other points.”

Buse can also count on the support of his uncle, world-renowned chef Gaston Acurio. Buse and his team went to Acurio's restaurant Jarana in New Jersey on Friday and they spoke over the phone.

“He told me, ‘Let's go beat this guy!'” Buse recalled with a laugh. “I said to him, ‘Well, yeah, first step by step'. I told him it's just like another match, nothing changes. I try to visualise the match.

“I'm so happy to live this experience, but I want to go match by match. I want to feel like it's just another match, just like the first round of qualifying, the second round of qualifying… I trust myself and I will try to enjoy tomorrow.”

Bob and Mike Bryan joined Maria Sharapova in being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame Saturday evening in Newport, forever cementing their legacy and impact both on and off the court.

The twins delivered a touching address thanking their coaches, teams and families for their support throughout their tennis journey, acknowledging that they continually seek to give back to the sport that has given them so much.

“Bob and I are feeling an overwhelming sense of awe and gratitude – feeling like this whole thing is a big dream,” said Mike Bryan. “In this sport, nobody makes it alone. Behind every successful player is a village, and we're very blessed to have an extraordinary one.”

“For most of my career, I had the No. 1 player in the world living across the hall. If I was ever feeling lazy, Mike would drag me off the couch and get me on the court. We kept the bar high for a long time,” said Bob Bryan. “It wasn't always easy, but we had each other. That always made the wins so much sweeter and the losses easier to bear.”

The Bryan Brothers teamed together to win 16 major titles throughout their careers and remain the most successful doubles team in ATP Tour history, holding the record for most weeks atop the ATP doubles world rankings (438). Throughout their over 20-year career, the Bryans ranked as the year-end No. 1 team a record 10 times and won a record 119 tour titles together, along with being the only doubles team in history to have completed the Double Career Grand Slam. The Bryans earned a Davis Cup title together in 2007 and also competed in the 2012 London Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, earning gold and bronze medals, respectively.




Fellow Hall of Famers, family, friends and fans from around the world joined in on the weekend's celebrations honoring the Bryans and five-time major champion Maria Sharapova. The three inductees bring the total to 270 legends from 28 nations represented in the Hall of Fame.

Sharapova is one of only ten women in tennis history to achieve a career singles Grand Slam and topped the world rankings five times throughout her nearly 20-year WTA career, having become the first Russian woman to achieve the world No. 1 ranking in 2005. Her five major singles titles began with her win at Wimbledon in 2004, followed by victories at the US Open in 2006, the Australian Open in 2008, and twice at Roland-Garros in 2012 and 2014. During her career, Sharapova was also a member of Russia's 2008 Fed Cup championship team and earned a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics.



In looking back on her historic career and what this honor means to her, Sharapova offered this reflection:

“Embrace the struggles and lean into the hard stuff, trust your instinct, and rely on that resilience. I promise you you'll surprise yourself. When voices inevitably tell us to ease up, to round your edges, dull your ambition, I hope you can find a way to ignore them. Compete fiercely, raise your standard, set goals that intimidate you, and don't forget to celebrate your victories no matter how small. When you're facing setbacks, ask a lot of questions and look inside for those answers. And yes, pump that fist, whatever your personal version is, as a reminder of how unstoppable you are. In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life – what a remarkable life. I am so deeply grateful for it.”

Legendary tennis icon and 23-time major singles champion Serena Williams introduced Sharapova tonight, noting, “what started as a rivalry turned into an enormous amount of respect. What grew from respect has turned to friendship. Maria didn't just win matches, she built a legacy that will last forever. Tonight was my honor as Maria's former rival, former fan, now her forever friend, to welcome her into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.”

Tonight's ceremony was part of a reimagined three-day Induction Celebration — including a Hall of Fame Celebrity Pro Classic, live podcast recordings with Andy Roddick and Patrick McEnroe, and exclusive Q&As with Stan Smith and Gigi Fernandez — all culminating with the induction ceremony held for the first time on the night before the start to the US Open on Sunday.

He started as a Broadway stage manager working on such shows as 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,' 'My Fair Lady' and 'The Apple Tree.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Jerry Adler, the behind-the-scenes Broadway veteran who served as the stage manager on the original My Fair Lady before acting on such shows as The Sopranos, The Good Wife and Rescue Me, died Saturday in New York City, a publicist said. He was 96. 


	A Brooklyn native who didn't become an actor until he was in his early 60s — despite being related to famed acting teacher Stella Adler — Adler played Herman “Hesh” Rabkin, consigliere to James Gandolfini‘s mob boss Tony, on HBO's The Sopranos.

	He also was the boorish law partner Howard Lyman on CBS' The Good Wife, and on FX's Rescue Me, he recurred as NYFD station chief Sidney Feinberg.

	











	Viewers know Adler as Rabbi Alan Schulman on CBS' Northern Exposure, the handyman Mr. Wicker on NBC's Mad About You and Moshe and the father of Jeffrey Tambor's Maura Pfefferman on Amazon's Transparent. He also played a spry Holocaust survivor on the final season of Comedy Central's Broad City.


	Adler was a student at Syracuse University in 1950 when his father, Philip, then the GM of the Group Theatre working on the Carol Channing musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called to offer him a job as assistant stage manager. “I'm a creature of nepotism,” Adler admitted in a 2015 interview for the website TheaterMania.


	He followed with gigs as stage manager, production manager or production supervisor on a 1952 revival of Of Thee I Sing, directed by George S. Kaufman and starring Jack Carson; 1956's My Fair Lady, starring Julie Andrews, then a very nervous 19, and Rex Harrison; 1966's The Apple Tree, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Alan Alda and Barbara Harris; and 1967's The Homecoming, written by Harold Pinter.

	











	Along the way, he also was backstage for the original productions of Annie and Hal Holbrook‘s Mark Twain Tonight!, helped Zero Mostel evade a subpoena from the House Un-American Activities Committee and worked with the likes of Arthur Miller, Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles, Angela Lansbury, John Gielgud, Noël Coward, Joan Rivers, Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Milos Forman, Richard Rodgers, Liv Ullmann and Richard Burton.


	He had a great story about Katharine Hepburn portraying Coco Chanel on Broadway in 1969.


	“We opened cold in New York City, and they were building the Uris across the street from the theater,” he  told the Hartford Courant in 2011. “She had this little quiet song to her father, and during the first matinee, you could hear them banging away from across the street. I knew she was really pissed off, so at the end of the show when she came offstage, she asked me to come to her dressing room, where she told me to go across the street and tell them they should stop work when she sings that one song because it's too noisy.


	“So I went over to the engineering hut, got a hold of the boss and said I was the stage manager of the show across the street starring Katharine Hepburn and she would like to stop work on the building when she sings this song. They thought I was a [expletive] lunatic.


	“So I go back to her and tell her it's impossible and then she goes out, goes across the street, gets in one of those open construction elevators and arranges with the workers herself on every floor that when I come out of the stage door and give them the signal, they stop work and then restart when I come out again. They did that at every matinee for her.”

	











	Adler also directed a handful of Broadway shows.


	He was a stage manager on the soap opera Santa Barbara in Los Angeles when he took a call from a friend who was casting the 1992 Joe Pesci film The Public Eye.


	“My friend wanted me to meet with the director [Howard Franklin], and the first thing he said to me was how much I reminded him of his father,” he recalled in 2015. “I was actually surprised. I'd never acted before. I'd never entertained the idea of acting; it was an unusual thing. But I was getting ready to retire from the production end, anyway. So it became kind of interesting.”


	Adler appeared onscreen for the first time on a 1991 episode of the Gary David Goldberg sitcom Brooklyn Bridge on CBS and later landed regular roles on three other short-lived series: ABC's Hudson Street, starring Tony Danza, and The WB's Alright Already and Raising Dad (as Carol Leifer and Bob Saget‘s father, respectively).


	Adler also would go on appear on the big screen in Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), Getting Away With Murder (1996), In Her Shoes (2005), Synecdoche, New York (2008) and A Most Violent Year (2014).


	“You know what's interesting?” he said in a 2017 interview. “You spend your whole career backstage. Nobody knows who you are or even knows your name. They don't know anything about you. And then you do a television show and suddenly you're a celebrity and everyone knows your face. It's so weird.”

	











	Things came full circle when he returned to Broadway in 2000, not as a stage manager but as an actor in the Elaine May comedy Taller Than a Dwarf. He was back again in 2015, portraying Larry David's bed-ridden dad in Fish in the Dark.


	He released a book, Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales From Broadway, Television, and the Movies, in May 2024.


	Survivors include his wife, psychologist Joan Laxman, whom he married in 1994, and his daughters, Alisa, Amy, Laura and Emily.

							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Is the animated movie sensation KPop Demon Hunters a unicorn or the beginning of a beautiful new friendship between Netflix and theater owners?


	Most in Hollywood are betting on the former despite the fact that a special two-day sing-along event of the hit animated movie could earn as much as $18 million to $20 million from 1,700 North American theaters, according to exhibition sources and rival studios with access to certain data. Since Netflix — which has a turbulent relationship with exhibitors — refuses to report box offices, no one will ever know the actual number. On Sunday, Netflix declined to comment.

	That means that New Line and Warner Bros.' horror sensation Weapons will be listed as the official winner of the Aug. 22-24 frame with $15.6 million in its third outing for a horrifyingly impressive global cume of nearly $200 million, or $199.4 million through Sunday. (And it's always possible Weapons could be the actual winner if Demon Hunters comes in lower than anticipated.)


	Since debuting in June on the streamer, Kpop Demon Hunters has fast become a cultural phenomenon. It's well on its way to becoming No. 1 on Netflix's list of most popular English-language films after already soaring to the top of the animated list, while its soundtrack has spent several weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart, with several of its songs, led by “Golden,” also shooting to the top of the charts.


	Only AMC Theatres, the country and world's largest circuit, refused to play the sing-along in keeping with its general policy of not playing movies that are in the home. Regal Cinemas and Cinemark Theatres — the country's two largest circuits behind AMC Theatres — along with Alamo Drafthouse and numerous other circuits were all game to grab a piece of the action. 

	











	The clever, original storyline centers on the adventures of Huntr/x, a trio comprised of K-pop superstars Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo) who use their secret identities as badass demon hunters to protect their fans from an ever-present supernatural threat. Together, they must face their biggest enemy yet — an irresistible rival boy band of demons in disguise.


	Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans directed the animated feature for Sony Pictures Animation, based on a screenplay by Danya Jimenez, Hannah McMechan, Kang and Appelhans. The project ultimately landed at Netflix as part of a larger deal with Sony Pictures. 


	Netflix movie chief Lin recently told THR that Netflix is always “looking for powerful new stories, refreshing new voices and daring new approaches” in their films. “KPDH is a perfect example of this approach,” he says, adding that he and Netflix's head of animation, Hannah Minghella, are “thrilled to be supporting Maggie and Chris as filmmakers and Kristine Belson and her team at Sony Animation” as their studio partner.


	The original songs for KPop Demon Hunters were performed by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI, Andrew Choi, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, samUIL Lee, Neckwav and Lea Salonga, while Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung performed their own original song.


	Tech giants taking on Hollywood legacy studios made headlines all the way around over the late-August weekend as Apple Original Film's record-breaking F1: The Original Movie achieved a remarkable milestone in zooming past the $600 million mark globally. Unlike Netflix, Apple is now giving select titles a traditional theatrical run, such as F1, which is Brad Pitt's biggest film of all time. Sans its own distribution apparatus, Apple must rely on third-party partners. In this case, it was Warners.

Daniel Dae Kim called out the “chilling effect” on free speech and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in Hollywood.


	In an Associated Press interview conducted in Seoul, South Korea, the Tony nominee was asked if he's worried about backlash against DEI efforts in the entertainment industry.


	“We're already seeing it,” the Butterfly actor and executive producer said. “If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we're seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. ‘DEI' is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI's not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that's a political trend. It's my life. It's what I've lived every decade I've been in this business.”

	Kim is referring to the $16 million settlement reached between Paramount and president Donald Trump over a contested 60 Minutes interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, which the GOP leader had claimed was fraudulently edited. At the time of the $20 billion lawsuit filing, the media conglomerate deemed the move “meritless.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Following the settlement's announcement, late-night host Stephen Colbert, whose show is televised on Paramount's CBS, called the decision a “big fat bribe” amid the looming and long-gestating Paramount-Skydance merger. Just days later, he announced to audiences that his show — and The Late Show franchise as a whole, which began with David Letterman — would be cancelled next year. Amid speculation from viewers, Congress members and fellow industry peers, Paramount defended the decision as purely financially motivated. 


	Elsewhere in the Q&A with the AP, the Lost alum noted, “I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they're starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It's much easier once you're more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It's something that, if you're not a person of color, or someone who's a minority in the United States, you don't have to think about. You don't think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you're drawn to, and that's very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don't ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.”

DDK is on point. People should be paying attention to what he's doing in this industry and how he's changing the game.

Those rallying against inclusion also believe in free speech…only the speech they believe in. ?

Minorities are automatically politicized by the fact that we represent something that can be considered a cause. It would be lovely to have a fair playing field, then a cause wouldn't be needed.

“free speech”? CBS is letting him say whatever he wants for another whole year. If they really wanted to silence him, wouldn't they cancel him immediately?

They wouldn't want to pay extra for canceling a contract on Colbert so they're just letting the current contract runs it's course.

Probably would have to pay off his contract which might have clause in it for early cancelation.

So what they going to do fill time slot with infomercials? (maybe they can find the guy in the sweater from Amazing Discoveries. )

And now he's sending troops into Illinois. Brick by brick by brick is how democracy is torn asunder. Why not just enact common sense gun laws if you want to stop gun violence? A self made problem, just ask Europeans.

If you aren't picking up on free speech being taken away, you are willfully ignorant.

The Summer I Turned Pretty actor Gavin Casalegno is aware his character Jeremiah is not beloved by the internet masses.


	In a recent interview with The New York Times, the YA star reflected on the particular ire his Fisher brother draws from both viewers and even social media accounts of certain brands that proclaim themselves “Team Conrad.”


	“They tend to dislike him, yes. I don't check Instagram anymore, so I really haven't seen that much hate,” Casalegno said. “The only thing that I see is my sister sending me the memes that are really funny. I think it's important to also understand and realize that this is a fictional story — and it's also not me.”

	He continued, “I don't think there's a single human being in the world who can carry the emotional negativity to the degree that stuff like this happens. And I think that's why Amazon did a good job of stepping in and being like, ‘Hey, no bullying.' Though, not really going so well.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Casalegno is referring to a PSA posted by the show's official social media account ahead of the Season 3 premiere, which advocated for keeping conversation around the show “kind” and reaffirmed a “ZERO tolerance policy” on hate speech, bullying and targeting of cast.


	The actor also noted that, in real life, people have approached him to say how much they hate Jeremiah: “It's pretty comical,” he said.


	Adapted from Jenny Han's best-selling trilogy, the dramedy stars Lola Tung as Belly, caught between childhood love Conrad (Christopher Briney) and his brother Jeremiah. Season 3 centers around the upcoming nuptials between the now collegiate Belly and Jeremiah. Episode 7 of the junior installment aired last Thursday, with a scheduled weekly release lasting until the series finale Sept. 17. 

	











	In the latest episode (spoilers ahead), Belly and Jeremiah's respective bachelorette and bachelor parties ended direly: Not only did Belly confront her latent feelings for Conrad, who she realized coaxed her mom Laurel (Jackie Chung) into agreeing to partake in her wedding to Jeremiah, but the revelation of her fiancé's cheating led to a blowout fight between the two exes on the cool shores of Cousins Beach. Though Conrad confesses his love for Belly and begs her not to marry his brother, she rejects him, before breaking down in tears away from the scene. Jeremiah, who missed the couple's planned rendezvous, is sleeping soundly after having had too much to drink, leaving Belly to cuddle up next to her best friend Taylor (Rain Spencer) as she reels from what happened.

	As the 007 casting speculation reaches across the pond, Austin Butler is taking himself out of the running.


	The Oscar nominee admitted it “would be kind of sacrilegious” for him to play the British MI6 agent as a California-born-and-raised actor, despite his willingness to work with his Dune: Part Two (2024) director Denis Villeneuve again.


	“No calls as far as that goes, but I love that man,” he told Hits Radio UK. “Would I play James Bond? I don't think that would be a good idea. Because I'm an American. I can do an accent but that would be kind of sacrilegious. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Butler continued, “Those movies meant so much to me, but I think that it's gotta be somebody who is from [England].”

	











	On the other hand, “Villain? That would be alright. I'd do that.”

A post shared by Hits Radio (@hitsradiouk)


Glen Powell previously gave the same answer, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “A Texan should not play James Bond.”


	In June, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Villeneuve to direct the next installment, and last month, Steven Knight was announced to write the film amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Tanya Lapointe will executive produce.


	After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film.

	











	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”


	Daniel Craig played the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.

My god be the villain for a Robert Pattinson James Bond.

He's right, Bond should never be American, but he'd make a fine Felix Leiter.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM: Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demon Hunters have risen and they're snatching No. 1 away from New Line/Warner Bros' Zach Cregger horror movie Weapons, with an estimated $18M two-day opening. This is according to industry sources this morning as Netflix isn't reporting. The Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans directed anime movie did an estimated $9.6M yesterday and is expected to do $8.4M today, -13%. If we get better guidance, we'll update our numbers, but this is how it's looking as of this morning. 


	Admissions for Kpop‘s Saturday and Sunday per EntTelligence is 1.5 million alone off a standard ticket price of $13.63. Premium tickets went for $16.31 repping 18% of the weekend's admissions, while general attendees represented 82%.  

	











	Warner Bros is reporting that Weapons third weekend stands at $15.6M, -36% with a running total of $115.8M. Kpop beat Weapons yesterday, the latter earning $6.4M. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix had ComScore shield exhibitor grosses from rival studios, but the majors had other means to compute Kpop‘s weekend. Comscore isn't expected to call Kpop at No. 1, rather Warner Bros' Weapons. 


	Netflix has only booked Kpop Demon Hunters for a two-day play. At a time when exhibitors are calling for windows on theatrical releases, they've caved during one of the driest weekends at the summer box office by making an exception for Kpop Demon Hunters. Comscore is calling the weekend sans Kpop at $60M. That would rank as the lowest grossing weekend of summer to date. It's still bound to be the lowest weekend of summer 2025 so far even if you include Kpop, but it's not as bad, around $78M. The previous lowest weekend this summer was the second weekend of May with $85.5M. 


	AMC hasn't caved to playing Kpop, but they will play Netflix's Greta Gerwig's Narnia. When the time comes, will Netflix report grosses on behalf of the filmmaker who delivered Warner Bros' their highest grossing movie ever? It's strange to hide the box office on a No. 1 ranking film when the streamer is tooting its own horn weekly about the viewership of its shows using its own metric (one which Disney+ has adopted in its own streaming viewership reporting). 

	











	The machine driving awareness and engagement on social per RelishMix on Kpop Demon Hunters is fueled by YouTube videos over the last two months with a social media reach across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, and YouTube of 10.5 billion. That includes songs and trailers. 


	Says RelishMix, “Convo on Kpop Demon Hunters run positive, as a stadium chant — loud, euphoric, and bordering on religious devotion. Fans swoon over the soundtrack, calling it ‘better than BTS' and joking that they've been ‘hypnotized' into looping the songs all day, while others gush that this ‘could debut as an actual boy group track.' Fans admit that they came expecting a disposable Netflix filler and left ‘addicted' to the point of nonstop replays. Comments liken the movie's animation to Spider-Verse and even Big Hero 6, calling Jinu the new gold standard for animated K-pop idols. The through-line is clear: people can't believe this much polish and catchiness came from a demon-slaying parody premise, and they love that the songs double as both bops and sly metaphors for soul consumption.”


	Does Sony have any regrets about handing off Kpop Demon Hunters to Netflix? The movie is bound to become the streamer's most watched movie, toppling the near 231M global views of Dwayne Johnson-Chris Evans-Gal Gadot's Red Notice. Sony has no regrets whatsoever as it was always part of the plan in the Culver City lot's $3 billion Netflix deal. Part of that sum, around $600M, was to be committed to direct platform productions from Sony. The non-IP Kpop went to Netflix in the very first week of the deal. Netflix paid $100M to make Kpop plus $25M to Sony. That price will go up is the streamer buys out subsequent windows from the Culver City lot. All the animated work on the movie was done by Sony ImageWorks, so even more of a margin for Sony. Sony Pictures Animation is attached to all Kpop sequels and spinoffs. The movie, I'm told, is a profitable play for Sony. 


	How the indie openers went down this weekend: Focus Features Honey Don't! ($3M opening), Bleecker Street's David Mckenzie directed Relay ($1.9M ), A24's Nhe Zha II ($1.5M for the Michelle Yeoh English lingo version; overall cume for Mandarian and English domestic is $22.4M), Vertical/AGC Studios' Eden from Ron Howard ($1M) and NEON's Splitsville from Michael Angelo Covino ($105,5K at 5 locations in what is the weekend's best theater average at $21K, muy bien). 


	Mubi's Sundance pick-up Lurker from Beef and The Bear episodic director Alex Russell did $64,4K for the weekend at four LA and NYC locations, for a $16K theater average. The movie stars Théodore Pellerin as Melrose Ave shop clothing shop employee who works his way into the inner circle of a hot burgeoning pop star played by Saltburn‘s Archie Madekwe, creating a toxic relationship. The pic is 93% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. 


	Sunday figures:


	1.) Kpop Demon Hunters Singalong (Netflix) 1,700 theaters, Sat $9.6M Sun $8.4M, Weekend $18M/Wk 1

	11.) Relay (BST) 1,483 theaters, Fri $1M Sat $506K Sun $405K 3-day $1.9M/Wk 1 


SATURDAY AM: Warner Bros/New Line's third weekend of Zach Cregger's Weapons is coming in stronger than anticipated with $4.67M yesterday on its way to a $15M+ weekend. Earlier week forecast was at $13.5M.  


	The swing factor here is Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demon Hunters Singalong which isn't on any box office charts this AM; not so much because Netflix isn't reporting and burying their figures in ComScore, but any kind of indication of that anime movie's success won't be apparent until tonight into tomorrow AM. Again, lowball estimates have the second-most watched Netflix title (210.5 million global views) at around $15M+ as well at 1,700 sites. 


	Currently, the overall weekend for all titles is weighing in at $64M, but if Kpop does what it's suppose to do, then the whole marketplace shoots up to $79M+, which wouldn't be the lowest grossing frame of the year. Currently that belongs to March 14-16 when Novocaine numbed audiences, with all titles doing $52.1M. A year ago, the entire weekend posted $88.8M led by the fifth weekend of Deadpool & Wolverine ($18.3M). Kpop Demon Hunters is only playing today and Sunday at most circuits minus AMC, which is holding the line on theatrical windows. 


	Running cume for Weapons by Sunday looks like $115.2M. 


	With more kids heading back to college (65% were on break Friday, which will fall to 25% on Monday), the arthouse box office has been flooded with edgy and some auteurish films including Focus Features Honey Don't! ($3.2M opening), Bleecker Street's David Mckenzie directed Relay ($2M estimated), A24's Nhe Zha II ($1.4M), Vertical/AGC Studios' Eden from Ron Howard ($1.36M) and NEON's Splitsville from Michael Angelo Covino (estimated $90K at 5 locations in what is the weekend's best theater average at $18K). It's almost like an advertisement for the specialty sector itself. This is par for the course as August tees up potential awards season titles, and begins to set the table for the fall, letting upscale and sophisticated moviegoers know that more serious fare is on the marquee. Still, nothing is breaking out here with soft ticket sales all around except for Splitsville. 


	Top 10:


Honey Don't! is doing 33% more money on less screens than Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke's previous Focus Features Lesbian comedy caper, Drive Away Dolls which opened to $2.4M with a $1K theater average and a C CinemaScore. Honey Don't!'s is $2,4k per screen. No CinemaScore, but the audience isn't excited about this single Coen brother comedy like they were with No Country for Old Men, giving it 43% on Rotten Tomatoes audience and a horrible 1 1/2 stars and 28% definite recommend on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak. Those who showed up for the Margaret Qualley, Chris Evans and Aubrey Plaza romp were women at 54% with 62% Caucasian, 20% Hispanic and Latino, 7% Asian American and 7% Black. No PLFs, but a lackluster result despite hitting its tracking. The movie's play is on the coasts with NYC AMC Lincoln Square earning $24K to date. 


	When it comes to these arthouse releases, many of these distributors aren't spending much on P&A, including Bleecker Street and Vertical. It's how this post pandemic indie model largely works to tee up films in theatrical in order to send them to home entertainment where the real cash is made. 

	











Relay, with good critic Rotten Tomatoes scores of 75% certified fresh is seeing its best playability in East, South, Midwest and West with AMC Lincoln Square NYC up to around $5K so far, the pic's highest grossing venue in North America. The Riz Ahmed-Lily James-Sam Worthington action thriller world premiered at TIFF last year and Bleecker Street acquired the pic two months later. Movie follows a broker of lucrative payoffs who is between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten them. He breaks his own rules when a new client seeks his protection to stay alive.


	China's animated Ne Zha 2, the fifth highest grossing movie of all-time at $2.15 billion, already played at the domestic box office back in February with a Mandarin language print that grossed $20.9M. A24 is handling this English re-release which isn't making a dent at $1.4M at 2,228 theaters or $628 per screen. A 91% general audience and 8% family turnout. Overall audiences gave it 85% positive and a 61% definite while kids under 12 awards it 86% positive, but a lower 43% definite recommend. Friday was $696K. By the way, we heard A24's release of Apple's Spike Lee movie Highest 2 Lowest this past week at 100 locations did north of $1.5M, a solid per screen of $15K per sources. The Denzel Washington based on Akira Kurosawa's 1963 Japanese film High and Low continues to play in theaters this weekend. 


	We'll get more into Vertical's save of the Ron Howard multi-star period thriller Eden later this weekend, but after a $640K Friday it's putting up a $1.36M opening which is better than Vertical's Jude Law thriller The Order from December which debuted to $887K and ended its run at $2M domestic. Eden cost $55M gross before P&A with a net production cost of $35M; the movie largely funded by Australian tax incentives and foreign sales. Offers made to AGC Studios for domestic weren't good enough for this Sydney Sweeney, Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, and Daniel Bruhl movie. Why didn't distribs jump on this movie? Because it came out of its TIFF world premiere with middling reviews (currently at 55% Rotten), making it a risky theatrical investment. Vertical didn't pay a minimum guarantee, they were only on the hook for a very small P&A commitment with a distribution fee in the low to mid-teens. Eden is on a 30-day exclusive theatrical window before PVOD. In a marketplace where the agencies have a number of unsold starry movies, here's one path for mid-sized priced indie movies to the big screen. Rotten Tomatoes audiences like the movie better than critics at 69%. Like Sweeney's Americana last weekend, Eden wasn't positioned to be a double-digit P&A spend wide release; it's a niche play. At 664 theaters Eden is posting a $2K theater average vs. Americana‘s $500K opening at 1,146 sites which did $436 per theater. 


FRIDAY AM: Only one reported preview last night and that's Focus Features' Ethan Coen-directed and co-written Honey Don't!, which did $525,000 in both Thursday and early previews ahead of its 1,300-theater opening Friday, The frame is expected to be between $3M-$4M. Unlike other indie releases on the marquee this weekend, Honey Don't! is playing on a full schedule at theaters, not split.


	It's Coen's second feature with wife Tricia Cooke on which they both wrote and produce; she has long edited for the Coen brothers. Coen and Cooke's previous movie, which also starred Margaret Qualley, was 2024's Drive-Away Dolls, which did $450K in previews on its way to a not wowing $2.4M opening at 2,280 theaters. Reviews were much better on Drive-Away Dolls at 64% fresh than for Honey Don't!, which stands at 49% on Rotten Tomatoes. The latest movie follows a Western small-town private eye played by Qualley who is try to solve a local case involving a sex-crazed preacher played by Chris Evans. Meanwhile, she's having an affair with a cop played by Aubrey Plaza. The $20M Working Title production was the closing movie at this year's Cannes Film Festival.

	











	Meanwhile, New Line's Weapons passed the century mark Thursday at the domestic box office with a $2.4M take for the day, off 11%. The movie ends week 2 with $36.2M, down 43%, for a running cume of $100.2M. The original movie is soaring 42% ahead of another New Line August horror release, Annabelle: Creation, which stood at $64M after two weeks and finaled at $102M stateside.


Weapons' third weekend is expected to be around $13.5M, with sources believing that Netflix/Sony Pictures Animation's Kpop Demons Hunters sing-along in its mere Saturday and Sunday play sans AMC will outstrip the horror pic with around $15M+. If the anime movie falls short, it's only because it was frontloaded. But sources are going nuts for it.

The Sony-ganda is pretty funny. We're super happy to have sold all the upside of a hit to Netflix during a down year overall!  

But in all honesty I don't see the movie doing this through a theatrical run or even on another streamer. Netflix has such mass it's like broadcast or peak cable. 

The question is whether there may be promotional opportunities. Like release original IP movie first on netflix for exposure with the intention to make it theatrical, at least the sequels, if the IP is a hit?

Kpop is legit great film. This will raise its profile even more to break out from just Netflix preteen girls and be crossover mainstream Disney-like hit. Will be able to cash grab at singalong's for ever and franchise into eternity. Sequel will get $50mil opening weekend.

“Kpop is legit great film.”

Some people have legit ZERO taste.

Eden – Whew!   Drivers Ed will have a similar fate

KPDH is everything Disney has spent the last 10 years telling you that nobody wants.

That company may never recover from all the damage Iger and his C-suite have done.

Its a solute BS that Netflix can refuse to provide official numbers and still get the positive headlines of winning the weekend.

They either do things the right way or they shouldn't get ANY positive box office press

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kelly Clarkson Out With Her Family: 1st Photos Since Ex-Husband's Passing","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/kelly-clarkson-first-photos-after-brandon-blackstock-passing/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:19:50 GMT","

Kelly Clarkson was spotted leaving Los Angeles on August 23, 2025, marking the first time she's been photographed in public since the death of her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, on August 7. 

TMZ published photos of the original “American Idol” winner at LAX airport with her kids and her sister, Alyssa. Dressed in all-black, including sunglasses and a black hat, Clarkson had a “somber expression,” TMZ reported, as her group arrived at LAX and could be seen unloading their luggage from a vehicle. 

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

After her divorce from Blackstock was finalized in 2022, Clarkson moved from L.A. to New York the following year with their kids — River Rose, now 11, and Remington (Remy) Alexander, 9. Blackstock settled in Montana, trading in his work as a talent manager to run his own ranch and rodeo business. 

Clarkson has been in Los Angeles to tape episodes of “The Voice,” which she agreed to return to as a coach for season 29 before Blackstock's death. The songstress missed filming one episode due to Blackstock's death, but her fellow “American Idol” alum Jennifer Hudson filled in for her. 

Clarkson was expected to return to film “The Voice” Battle Rounds on August 21 and 22 in Los Angeles, but likely needs to return to New York for her kids to start school and to kick off the next season of “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” 

Insiders at the daytime talk show confirmed to Deadline on August 19 that she would be back in New York to kick off a new season of the talk show in September without delay. 

Clarkson abruptly canceled the remainder of her Las Vegas residency shows on August 6, writing in a social media post, “Unfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,” she wrote in her social media update. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them.” Clarkson continued, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”

The following day, Blackstock died at age 48 following a three-year battle with melanoma. The former couple was married from 2013 to 2022, though they split in 2020.  

Blackstock was diagnosed with cancer after their divorce was finalized, according to People. A source close to the family told the outlet that after his diagnosis, Clarkson did everything she could to protect their kids and ensure they had time with their dad.

Maureen McCormick starred as the vivacious Marcia Brady on the beloved classic family sitcom “The Brady Bunch” which aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974. The actress, now 69 years old, took to her Instagram on August 22, 2025 to mourn the loss of a treasured former costar in a sentimental tribute.

The tribute was for “Get Smart” actor David Ketchum, whose death was covered by the Hollywood Reporter the same day McCormick honored him in her post. The TV icon wrote, “Rest in peace, David Ketchum,” before adding a red heart emoji. She continued, “What an honor it was work with you back in 1966 on the TV show ‘Camp Runamuck.' I will always remember your kindness.” 

A post shared by Maureen McCormick (@momccormick7)

The Hollywood Reporter says they were told by Ketchum's daughter, Nicole Madden, that he died in a Sherman Oak care facility. 

The outlet says he is remembered for his mastery of physical comedy which saw him squeeze into objects like sofas and vending machines. 

Variety says along with starring in “Get Smart,” the actor is notable for guest appearances on various '60s sitcoms. His role as a counselor in “Camp Runamuck,” where he met Maureen McCormick, was his first, per the report. 

The outlet points out the then 37-year-old quickly made up for what some might consider a late start into show business, nabbing a regular role as Mel Warshaw in “I'm Dickens, He's Fenster.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Arnold Schwarzenegger's Son Christopher Stuns with Slim New Look on Family Getaway","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/arnold-schwarzeneggers-son-christopher-weight-transformation/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 15:36:32 GMT","

Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27, looked noticeably slimmer during a sun-soaked family getaway in Cape Cod.

In photos shared by his sister Katherine on Aug. 22, he appeared sharply transformed—sporting a crisp white short-sleeved button-down and pastel pink shorts, casually checking his phone aboard a boat.

A post shared by Katherine Schwarzenegger (@katherineschwarzenegger)

The fun getaway also featured mom Maria Shriver and brother-in-law Chris Pratt, who flaunted his own fit physique in shirtless photos.

Katherine simply captioned the carousel of images, “A perfect day ☀️🌊.” 

Christopher's physical transformation isn't recent. He first showed off his slimmer physique at the June premiere of “FUBAR” Season 2 in Los Angeles, where he stood confidently beside Arnold, Katherine, Christina, and Patrick.

He opened up about the origins of his weight-loss journey during May's Beacher Vitality Happy & Healthy Summit in Los Angeles, according to PEOPLE.

His struggle began in 2019 while in Australia, and he realized his weight was limiting the activities he wanted to participate in.

“I started in 2019 when I was living in Australia. I was on this big trip. I made it a big [deal] like, ‘Oh, I'm going to go out and do all this stuff, be in Australia,' and I just saw how much my weight was prohibiting me from doing the everyday activities,” he stated.

He added, “I was like, ‘I want to go skydiving.' And my friends were like, ‘Yeah, no shot.' I was like, ‘Yeah, I can't skydive.'”

Christopher described years of trial and error with various diets and meal programs dating back to his high school days. 

He had a turning point when he decided to give up bread for Lent.

“Weirdly enough, I gave up bread for Lent,” he told the audience. “I don't know if anyone's Catholic in here, but I gave up bread for Lent.”

“I was like, ‘Well, if I'm giving up bread, I might as well just take the opportunity and I'm a good Catholic boy, so I'm not going to break it,' ” he added. “And that was my one rule. I was like, ‘I'm not going to break Lent.' And so I lost 30 pounds just through that.”

Though Christopher mainly stays out of the spotlight, his famous father opened up about his weight loss in a June 2025 interview with The Sunday Times.

The actor recalled that he never told his son he was overweight, instead introducing healthy food and the gym. The 78-year-old praised his son for his impressive weight loss.

“And then, out of nowhere, he decided that he wanted to be lean. And now he is,” he added. “So that is of course fantastic, the self-discipline and the self-motivation. I always felt one day it will have to come from him — and it did.”

Yeehaw! Beloved Hallmark stars Kristoffer Polaha and Nikki DeLoach began filming their just-announced movie, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” in Nashville on August 23, 2025. As they wrapped up their first day on-set, Polaha revealed a surprise co-star via social media.

He shared a photo of himself and DeLoach alongside Sharon Lawrence, whom he also co-starred with in the 2016 Hallmark movie “Hearts of Christmas.” Lawrence has been in numerous Hallmark movies over the last decade, so fans and fellow stars were thrilled to see her join the cast of the new flick, which will also feature music from Brad Paisley and other still-to-be-announced country stars.

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

“A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” is Hallmark's first partnership with Nashville's iconic Grand Ole Opry, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2025. 

In his post, Polaha noted that with the first day of filming “in the can,” he could already tell that “this is gonna be a great one.” DeLoach shared Polaha's post in her Instagram Stories and wrote, “Pinching myself 🌠❤️”

Jonathan Bennett, who co-starred in “The Christmas House” movies with Lawrence and posted in early August that he considers Lawrence his second mom, adorably wrote in the comment section of Polaha's post, “Sharon Lawrence is a national treasure protect her at all costs”

Polaha sweetly responded, “@jonathandbennett consider her in Fort Knox while she's with me. Or consider me Fort Knox and she's gold.”

Lawrence then chimed in, “@jonathandbennett I am humbled and honored …and feel safe in the shadow of @polahaha ☺️”

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

Polaha also included photos with visiting Hallmark execs in his post, but the pic with Lawrence overshadowed everything else for fans, who immediately flooded his comment section to celebrate her addition to the cast.

One wrote, “Sharon Lawrence is incredible!! Will be the holiday movie of the season!”

“Whaaaaat @sharonelawrence,” someone else wrote. “oh this is definitely an added bonus !!! @nikdeloach and @polahaha I didn't even realize your working with this beautiful lady…. Yayyyyyyy❤️❤️❤️”

Another fan commented, “Sharon Lawrence 🔥🔥 can't wait to see what's being created 🥰”

Yet another fan wrote, “I'm squealing with excitement! This is going to be THE @hallmarkchannel Christmas movie of the season!”

Hallmark announced on August 11 that Polaha and DeLoach would soon reunite for “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” — 20 years after they became good friends while co-starring on the Fox TV series “North Shore.”

Calling the “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” a “magical trip across time,” Hallmark Media's synopsis of the movie centers around Gentry Woods, played by DeLoach, who's the daughter of late country music icon Jett Woods, half of the famed duo Winter and Woods.

The logline says Gentry “abandoned her dream of a songwriting career and distanced herself from her father's legacy following his tragic car accident 30 years prior. When the Grand Ole Opry invites herto represent Jett at their centennial celebration at Christmas, she's hesitant to return to the place steeped in bittersweet memories. Encouraged by her good friends, Gentry visits the Opry and, while seated in one of the vaunted venue's oak church pews, is suddenly transported to 1995.” 

The synopsis continues then says Gentry's lifelong friend Mac, played by Polaha, is a country music talent manager, and “finds himself in 1995 as well. Thanks to some Christmas magic, Gentry gets precious time with her father, creative inspiration to finish the song she began decades earlier as a teen and learns surprising answers to questions about her father that have followed her for the last three decades.”

“A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” is expected to premiere during Hallmark's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming, but the full slate of holiday programming hasn't been announced yet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Cindy Crawford Embraces Natural Look in Makeup-Free Summer Photos","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/cindy-crawford-makeup-free-summer-photos/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 02:47:37 GMT","

Cindy Crawford is soaking up the last days of summer, showing off her radiant, makeup-free look in a new Instagram post. Her daughter, Kaia Gerber, is sharing the love in the comments, too.

A post shared by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford)

The ‘90s supermodel, 59, shared a glimpse of her late-summer adventures and travels in her August 22 Instagram post. The carousel of photos featured Crawford embracing a fresh, makeup-free look.

In the first photo, Crawford can be seen with her husband, Rande Gerber, 63. The couple is smiling alongside each other while on a boat.

Crawford was embracing the natural look, showing off her radiant skin as the sun hit her head. She can also be seen sporting her summer tan during the casual outing.

The supermodel was wearing a plunging satin maxi dress. She accessorized it with black sunglasses and a trucker hat.

In the second photo, Crawford kept things even more laid-back. She can be seen wearing cozy sleepwear, pairing it with a loose gray long-sleeve tee with white pajama shorts, and fur-lined brown loafers.

Makeup-free and relaxed, she was living her best life. Crawford can be seen holding a striped coffee mug while showing off her striking side profile.

The Instagram post also included an image of Crawford spending some time with her friends, Stephanie Coffey and actress and Bleusalt founder, Lyndie Benson.

It was time spent by the water for the girls' catch-up day, as Crawford looked amazing while sporting a tie-dye cover-up and oversized straw hat. The supermodel was having another makeup-free day, letting her skin breathe for the day.

Crawford captioned the photos, saying, “And that's a wrap on summer ‘25 ❤️🌅🌊.”

Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber, wrote the sweetest comment on her mom's post. The 23-year-old said, “Gorgeous parents.”

Crawford's fresh-faced look in the photos shouldn't surprise anyone. She spoke in a Vogue beauty tutorial video back in 2019 that she started embracing wearing less makeup as she got older.

She also talked about how her husband actually prefers her natural skin compared to a full face of products.

“My husband hates makeup, so this is already too much makeup for him,” Crawford said. “But I do explain to him that women do make-up for other women, not men.”

She went on to explain how she is wearing less makeup as she gets older. Crawford added, “I would say that's the biggest evolution for me, which is kind of counterintuitive, but that also means that taking care of your skin is more important because you're not covering it up with makeup.”

Quentin Tarantino‘s recent — and no doubt coveted — appearance on “The Church of Tarantino,” a long-running fan podcast run by Scott K., provided spicy details about the director's next moves. He's working on a play he hopes to take to the West End, and during the two-hour episode, he also explained why his purported 10th film “The Movie Critic” derailed. It turns out that Tarantino's planned limited series, as announced in 2022 for an unspecified network or streamer, began as “The Movie Critic” before he whittled it down to a feature film version. 

 










The Oscar-winning “Pulp Fiction” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” director first announced in 2024 that he would not move forward with “The Movie Critic,” about a film writer in 1970s Los Angeles circa the same time and place as “Once Upon a Time.” There wouldn't have been, he insists, any overlaps in terms of characters, nor would there be an appearance from Cliff Booth (played by Oscar winner Brad Pitt). Of course, we now know that Booth and Pitt are returning for a new film, scripted by Tarantino and directed by David Fincher, for Netflix. Titled “The Adventures of Cliff Booth,” the period film went into on-location California production this past week.

On this week's episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk,” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio recapped Tarantino's podcast appearance — and specifically about how Tarantino rejected the notion that he is paralyzed by fear or indecision about his 10th and expected-to-be-final movie. For now, the Netflix movie and the eventual stage play will have to sate his fans.

Elsewhere on the episode, we share our own favorite movies from the 1970s in the wake of IndieWire's '70s Week, which ranked the decade's 100 best movies, topped by Bob Fosse's “All That Jazz,” along with interviews and insights about the era. Our mutual favorites include “Klute” and “Chinatown,” and we gave a shout-out to films like “A Clockwork Orange” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” that didn't make the cut.

Speaking of podcast appearances, Warner Bros. film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy gave a candid chat to The Black List founder Franklin Leonard about the studio's recent successes. They talked about the bidding war for Zach Cregger's sleeper horror “Weapons” — De Luca got the script at 8:30 a.m. on a Monday in January 2023 and by the next day the deal was closing at Warners' production arm New Line. They also unpacked further the revolutionary deal for Ryan Coogler and “Sinners”; the filmmaker will get back the rights to the horror movie in 25 years, which is five years longer than Sony's similar deal with Tarantino and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” a movie Warners chased. At this point, “Sinners” is a Best Picture Oscar frontrunner.

Like a lot of American kids born in the early 1980s, I first heard Pavement on alternative-rock radio in the back of a car. The car was a Saturn going uphill toward the stop sign on Birch Hill Road; it is as clear and romantically enhanced as my dad's memories of hearing the Beatles. The song was “Cut Your Hair.” I instantly identified it as both a comfortable fit and yet something totally different, neither the sex cries of Stone Temple Pilots nor the wounded diaries of the Smashing Pumpkins. It was messy but catchy, music that had metabolized the rebellion of punk (“Career, career, career,” the singer shouted, somehow not angrily) but also felt boyish and joyful and refreshingly—almost subversively—pain-free.

Alternative to what? Nirvana was already a platinum-selling band; in the wake of Nevermind, artists as superficially uncommercial as Sonic Youth and the Breeders were given a shot at a market share their predecessors in the American underground would have never dreamed of. The gold rush was on, if not already over; “alternative” was just another way to signal the onramp to the mainstream.

The album “Cut Your Hair” was on, 1994's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, peaked in the nether reaches of the Billboard 200, well below what the band's spiritual predecessors R.E.M. had achieved by a similar point in their career. Singer Stephen Malkmus said he'd wanted the music to feel like classic rock—that glory, that ease—but good. To hardasses who mistook angst as the foundation of creative insight, they sounded like college boys coasting on an excess of privilege and charm. Critics loved them; most people didn't care.

Where Crooked Rain felt cool and extroverted, the band's first album, Slanted and Enchanted, was further off the beaten path. Certainly, Pavement wasn't the only early-'90s indie band to turn noise into something like pop. But the noise of Slanted felt more like a byproduct of distance or age than a corrosive agent, the grain of an old photograph or tracking lines on a tube TV; noise not as a reflection of industrial modernity but as something vulnerable and soft and flaky, like memory.

The sweet songs are tender and penetrating, the less-sweet ones radiant with the messy conviction of a street preacher; the climactic lines—“Minerals, ice deposit daily/Drop off the first shiny robe” from “Summer Babe”—dependent not on the logic of their language but the passion of their delivery. The album's title had famously come from the American poet Emily Dickinson, who wrote, “Tell all the truth but tell it slant —/Success in Circuit lies,” a line whose quiet threat to the supremacy of romantic disclosure should probably be written into the national anthem. For me, Slanted will always conjure the random, epiphanic quality of sudden light: the bolt in the sky, the gold in the pan, the fireflies in the field.

Malkmus had written the songs just after college, in the nebulous period between youthful ignorance and the worldly disenchantment of whatever comes next. He and the band's other guitarist, Scott Kannberg, had known each other since grade school and played on the same soccer team; Kannberg later described Malkmus as the brat of the neighborhood and himself as the black sheep, that Malkmus used to tease him and he used to beat Malkmus up, a yin-yang dynamic that contains an already huge amount of information about how white boys of ordinary privilege socialize in America. Listening to and reading interviews, you also get the sense that Malkmus would have casually thrown away some of his most memorable songs—“Summer Babe,” for one—had Kannberg not been there to say they were worth keeping. In other words, Malkmus was the creator, but Kannberg was the catalyst.

Like their sister band, Silver Jews, led by Malkmus and percussionist Bob Nastanovich's late college friend David Berman, Pavement was a product of the transition from punk and post-punk to the looser and more inviting thing sometimes called “college rock.” The rebellion was still there, but it was softer and less direct, stripped of the myopic discipline of hardcore, more reconciled to the pleasure of pop and classic rock. In a story well-worn in Pavement lore, Malkmus realized his essential separation from punk watching Henry Rollins of Black Flag squeezing a cue ball backstage as part of some psychotic pre-show ritual (Malkmus' band Straw Dogs were opening); to this day, he seems more comfortable in interviews talking about sports than almost anything else.

One of the great threads woven into the filmmaker Alex Ross Perry's 2025 documentary/biopic/audiovisual collage Pavements is a jukebox musical called Slanted! Enchanted!, which arranged the band's music with the conventional theatricality of a Broadway show. The joke is that a band so cool and au naturel would never stoop to something as emotionally solicitous as a Broadway show. But like all jokes, it contains a kernel of truth, namely that under the noise and feedback and general laxness of the band's presentation are straightforward and sentimental pop songs.

“We're from suburban California,” Malkmus once said. “And I think our music has that kind of secondhand distance reflected in suburban culture, where everything is slightly artificial.” Call it generational disaffection, call it male posturing, call it playing it cool, but that aloof quality in Pavement is, ironically, what helped me connect so strongly to their music in the first place, not just because I found it comparatively unembarrassing to wearing your heart on your sleeve but because talking around or past your feelings—wanting to say something and not being quite sure how to say it, or feeling that to rupture the silence around a feeling was to corrupt it—seemed emotionally accurate in a way full disclosure never was. The elliptical language, the cloaks of feedback and noise, the almosts and not-quites: This was the truth told, slant.

As much as they belong to the world of indie rock, what I love about Pavement is what I love about the music of a composer like Thelonious Monk, who once famously (or at least apocryphally) called into a Columbia University radio station to complain to a presenter talking about the importance of the “wrong notes” in his music that, in fact, the piano didn't have wrong notes—that you could play a song as quaint and domestic as “Tea For Two” with just enough dissonance to stretch a listener's sense of beauty while also conveying a sense of human fallibility that a more polished performance can't. (The spiky, sour opening of Pavement's “In the Mouth a Desert” could almost be a Monk line, the way all its ugly little turns resolve so rightly.)

Slanted and Enchanted is music of cowlicks, of family photographs at crooked angles, of accident as essence, the imperfect as perfect just as it is. Pavement happened to arrive in my life just weeks after the suicide of Kurt Cobain, an event that in certain ways deepened the band's myth but in others made it almost impossible for me to connect with them the way I had before. Was this where that line of creative expression led? Was this, in some ways, what the music was about? Even at 12, I found my own angst both unavoidable and totally boring, the kind of thing you slough off on the way to a deeper and more interesting time. (I'd rather listen to your dreams than your pain, all day, every day.) The laxness and play in Pavement reminded me (and still reminds me) that accidents are natural and big feelings are often as transient as small ones and the margins are usually as lively and exciting as what some people call “the point”—difficult lessons for a natural cueball-squeezer like me, but ones that over time have kept me saner and seem to contain more practical magic than most others.

Pavement's third member at the time of Slanted was Gary Young, a drummer who operated a small studio in the band's hometown of Stockton, California, where the album was recorded. Young was more than 10 years older than Malkmus and Kannberg, the weed-dealing punk-hippie (this was when “dealing weed” was still a notable qualifier), passing time with whoever in town still seemed interesting. (“This Malkmus idiot is a complete songwriting genius,” Young reportedly told Kannberg.)

Young was both a gymnast and an alcoholic, qualities you can hear in how his playing fumbles and stumbles and still lands on its feet with a breathless ta-da. (The fills on “Lions (Linden)” on the Watery, Domestic EP, lately packaged with Slanted and Enchanted, are a great illustration of this; Watery, Domestic is, in general, perfect.) As much as Slanted is defined by Malkmus's sloppy charm (the way he sings “eeeeeeelectricity and lust” on “Trigger Cut”—who else would do that?), it's driven by Young. He didn't last, partially because of his drinking, partially, it seems, because he was at the point in life where he felt too old to tour for dirt and sleep on floors. “Any concept of punky went out of the band with Steve,” Malkmus said later, referring to Young's eventual replacement, Steve West. “He never experienced punk and wasn't that way. I wouldn't blame the whole demarcation on him, but that's one thing that changed.”

It's true: the Pavement of Slanted (and Watery, Domestic, and the pre-Slanted EPs collected on Westing (by Musket and Sextant)) is a different Pavement than the Pavement you hear on the four albums that came next, each of which has its place not only in the band's story but in the consecration—and evolution—of 1990s American indie rock: the horns-up/windows-down riffs of Crooked Rain; the odyssean sprawl of Wowee Zowee; the graceful maturation of Brighten the Corners and the slightly dislocated parting shot of Terror Twilight, whose relative slickness hit just as electronic music and a general softening toward mainstream pop redefined what we meant when we talked about “indie rock.”

The band's second life has been fittingly open-ended. They officially reunited in 2010 for about six months, then again in 2022 for two years. (At this rate, the writer Mina Tavakoli pointed out in a tour diary published in early 2023, their next reunion will take place when bassist Mark Ibold is 72; in other words, Pavement is, Pavement was, Pavement forever.) “Harness Your Hopes,” a B-side from their fourth album, Brighten the Corners went viral on TikTok in 2020, then again in 2024. (“I didn't put it on the album,” Malkmus said later. “Like, nobody said, ‘that's a great song,'” to which Kannberg said, “I'm sure I did.”)

One of the reasons I think Pavement has lasted is that they wore their art lightly. They never insisted on their significance or burdened you with their ego or ambition, and yet their music conveys a sense of creativity as novel and expansive as anything we call “great.” I always found it telling how often Malkmus' lyrics were described as either cryptic or nonsensical, as though he was either hiding his meaning or faking it—but goddamn it if it didn't come down to meaning one way or the other. He usually changed them live anyway.

O
n the arctic evening of Feb. 13, Yessenia Ruano and her husband, Miguel, stand in their Milwaukee living room turning over a question they've been avoiding for weeks: whether tomorrow will be the day Ruano, 37, says goodbye to their two nine-year-old twin daughters, without knowing when she'll see them again.


	The two discuss the topic as Ruano, whose round face is framed by a curtain of long, thick black hair, pulls a plastic storage bin out from the closet. She and Miguel sort through documents they haven't touched in months, maybe years: tax returns, pay stubs, the girls' birth certificates. Ruano pulls out two Social Security cards and hands them over. “Paola,” she says, “and Elisabeth.” Ruano then gives her husband the girls' passports. A sea-green school folder with a seashell on the front holds their immunization records.


	Miguel, in socks and a pair of fraying flip-flops, sits back in his chair, taking in the scene. He clasps his hands over his head, eyes locked on the floor. The weight of what tomorrow could bring seems to settle on him all at once. 

	











	The last time Ruano was gone — just two nights away — he reminds his wife, the girls sobbed for hours. Ruano has taken to sleeping next to the twins every night, a habit of early motherhood that grew harder to break over time. Ruano pauses, reflecting on the memory. But she doesn't stand still for long. There's too much to do. She moves quickly through the details of her routines with her daughters. Miguel, who has no legal immigration status, works long days at a local factory and leaves before the rest of the house wakes. Ruano tells her husband to get the girls up at 6:05 so they can be out of the door 35 minutes later. She explains what snacks they like, which groceries to buy, and how to comfort the twins when they're upset. The instructions seem meant to soothe Ruano's growing anxieties as much as guide Miguel.

	Miguel asks what he should pack when — and if — he and the girls follow Ruano to El Salvador after the twins finish the school year in June.

	Ruano looks over at Paola and Elisabeth, who sit on the couch lost in the Spanish translation of Wicked playing on the television. Ruano has tried to shield the girls from the uncertainty. When her daughters glance her way, they're curious. Ruano smiles at them, holding the expression even as it dims from her eyes.


	“Their nicest shoes,” she tells Miguel. “They'll need to be baptized again.” 


	IN SOME WAYS, THE ANXIETIES THAT plague Ruano on this particular February night are familiar. In the 14 years since she fled El Salvador and asked for asylum in the United States, Ruano has endured numerous sleepless nights in the hours leading up to her annual check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In total, Ruano has had 19 in-person check-ins over her near decade and a half in the United States. But this upcoming appointment is different: A few months ago, Ruano was warned that this check-in would likely be her last.


	Here in the Midwest, Ruano has built a life shaped by school drop-offs and grocery lists, spring prairie walks and summer afternoons at Lake Michigan. But the violence she fled left a permanent mark. After graduating from university with a teaching degree in 2009, Ruano says she was regularly followed and threatened by MS-13 gang members. Once, she recalls, a group of men grabbed and mugged her on the street, yanking the gold earrings from her ears. Even now, she refuses to wear gold. “If I stay here,” Ruano remembers thinking, “I'm just waiting for something horrible to happen.”

	She crossed into the United States in 2011 leaving behind her mother, brother, and nearly all of her extended family. She paid a coyote thousands of dollars and made the grueling journey through Guatemala and Mexico alone, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on foot. “Everything was scary,” recalls Ruano. “The gangs. The coyotes. Women were injecting themselves with birth control.” She pauses. “I can't believe what I went through. All of it. When I try to remember it, it's like a movie.” 


	Not long after Ruano entered the country, she was detained by ICE and issued a deportation order. Ruano returned to El Salvador and immediately turned back around and paid a second coyote to bring her back into the United States. This time, she was guided through a network of underground tunnels that led to a windowless halfway house in El Paso, Texas. There, Ruano says she was held for two weeks with 30 others. The women, adds Ruano, including herself, were assaulted by the coyotes and warned that if they tried to leave, ICE would be called to detain them. When the coyotes finally moved the group out of the house, ICE found them within days, and took Ruano and several others to a detention center near Falfurrias, Texas.

	











	After six months in detention, a judge found her eligible to apply for asylum. Ruano was placed in what's called “withholding-only” proceedings, a process that allows asylum seekers with removal orders to seek protection while their cases are being considered. Her bail was set at $5,000, and after scraping together the money from a broad network of family and friends, she boarded her first-ever flight — to Milwaukee, where a friend had settled a few years earlier.


	That same friend introduced Ruano to Miguel, who had made a similar journey from El Salvador after his brother was threatened by MS-13. Ruano found work as a teacher's aide in a public elementary school and attended church every Tuesday and Sunday. In 2015, she gave birth to twin daughters. A few years later, she and Miguel bought a house. Not long after, they bought the building next door. Little by little, her life expanded into something Ruano never imagined possible had she stayed in El Salvador.


	Every year, Ruano checked in with immigration officials, logging each visit in pencil on a single lined sheet of paper she kept in the same plastic folder. The appointments weren't to evaluate her asylum claim, but to confirm she hadn't broken the law.


	In 2023, Ruano's plea for asylum was finally heard by a judge and denied. Rather than reapply, Ruano's attorney at the time suggested Ruano close the case since the Biden administration had deprioritized deportations for long-settled immigrants without criminal records. 


	But last November, the administration — and its policies — changed. Ruano's long-dormant deportation order meant she was no longer legally allowed to remain in the United States, even under government supervision. 


	In response, Ruano — on the advice of a second attorney — applied for a visa available only to survivors of trafficking. The application, which came with nearly $14,000 in legal fees, would be Ruano's last shot at staying in the U.S legally.


	In 2025, Ruano decided to take that shot in an extraordinarily difficult moment for immigrants in America. As part of his campaign and now his return to office, President Trump has vowed to deport millions of people living in the United States without permanent legal status. In recent months, his administration has signaled its willingness to go to great lengths to meet that goal. This summer, Trump secured $170 billion to fund his immigration agenda, with the majority earmarked for the Department of Homeland Security to carry out mass deportations. With an annual budget of $28 billion in funding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is now the country's largest law-enforcement agency. “Every single administration since Gerald Ford has had a prosecutorial discretion policy,” says Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank focused on immigration. “But on day one, Trump rescinded those discretion policies. And now, for the first time, the goal seems to be making everyone deportable. No discretion, no protection.”

	











	While extreme cases have drawn national attention — massive workplace raids, Venezuelans sent to detention centers abroad without due process — millions of immigrants like Ruano live in growing uncertainty, their lives caught in a terrifying limbo. Their only offense: entering the country without authorization. It is these quieter cases, unfolding everywhere across the country, that reflect how the United States is rapidly redefining its position on immigration — and on who is allowed to belong.


	“I'll be leaving behind my dreams,” Ruano says, reflecting on the possibility of deportation. “Coming here opened my eyes to the amount of possibilities that are in the world.” Clinging to those dreams, however, has taken a toll. “It's like they're trampling me, like they think immigrants are animals. I feel like I have to constantly prove that I'm a person.”


	AFTER PUTTING HER DAUGHTERS TO BED, Ruano lies awake for most of the night. The uncertainty of her case — and whether she'll be detained at her check-in the next morning — swirls in her head until the alarm to wake the girls for school sounds just before six. 


	Ruano, who dresses for the day in a pink silk blouse and black slacks, puts on a swipe of pink lipstick — a dash of optimism. A school colleague arrives around 6:30 a.m. She's come to sign a standby guardianship form, legal paperwork that would allow her to take Paola and Elisabeth home if Ruano is arrested at the appointment. 


	On the ride to the regional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field office, Ruano sits between her daughters in the backseat of her colleague's car. Paola cries, her head leaned against her mother's shoulder. Elisabeth stares blankly as she tracks the winter morning outside the car window. Ruano repeats a mantra she told girls the night before: “We have to trust in God,” she says. “What happens is meant to happen. There's a plan. And if I'm detained, we will be together again in El Salvador.”


	When the car pulls up to the field office, Ruano is stunned to see a large crowd marching on the sidewalk. She'd heard a few people might join her, but she didn't expect to find dozens of supporters including clergy, co-workers, and local politicians. Together, the group marches the length of the block holding signs with slogans like: “I won't be silent, up with education, down with deportation.” Many are chanting. Local news has come, too, and a cluster of cameras crowd the corner. 

	











	“We cannot, and will not, remain silent,” asserts Christine Neumann-Ortiz into a microphone. Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera, a Wisconsin immigrant-advocacy group, helped organize the protest for Ruano. “We are here … to call on ICE,” she says, “to grant a stay on her order for deportation.” 


	Ruano stands nearby, nodding, tears in her eyes. Flanked by her daughters, she takes the microphone and reads her testimony. Her speech comes out in spurts, the sentences punctuated by deep, guttural sobs. “They [have] broken my heart,” she says. “It's so painful for my soul and for my dreams.” She then looks toward the cameras, addressing her kindergarten students directly. “I love my kids. If you see the news today with your parents, I love you. You will be all the time in my heart.” 


	Just before 8 a.m., Ruano heads to the immigration field office. Standing at 5′ 1″, she nearly disappears among the crowd of supporters who surround her. As she waits to enter the building, Ruano takes a breath and pulls her daughters close. 


	Two hours pass before news arrives: Ruano has been granted 45 more days. It may be enough time for her trafficking visa application to be logged and placed under official review, a process that can take up to 18 months. But that alone would not necessarily ensure that Ruano could stay in the country. And if she is indeed denied, Ruano was told she must return to the office with proof of a one-way plane ticket to El Salvador. Without it, she risks detention and deportation.


	As the news spreads, one of Ruano's colleagues begins to cry from relief. “In the Jewish tradition, we say dayenu,” she says — a sentiment that loosely translates to, it's enough for now.


	RUANO IS IN A FESTIVE MOOD. With her hair twisted and pinned in a large gold clip, she moves confidently around her kitchen as she shapes a clump of pupusa dough with damp fingers. She's been working since the early morning and made 70 pupusas in total: bean and cheese, chicken, mozzarella. Nearby, Miguel assembles Salvadoran ceviche, and Ruano teases him about being the sous-chef. “He likes to play restaurant,” she laughs. In another life, she says, she might have been a chef.

	











	Ruano's pupusas are a favorite among colleagues and neighbors. She runs a small side business, mostly by word of mouth, sometimes making as many as 200 for a single event. She doesn't advertise much, but the word pupusa is scrawled in marker on the facade of her house, with an arrow pointing toward the door.


	Around lunchtime, Ruano's sister-in-law and her kids show up. They've gathered to celebrate Ruano's good, if precarious, news. The family settles in around a folding picnic table in the living room, which Ruano pulled out for the occasion. Paola and Elisabeth giggle with their cousin before the three disappear upstairs, slipping into that preadolescent world where stuffed animals and TikTok influencers coexist.


	“This is the first time I've eaten a pupusa in a long time,” Ruano says. She's lost several pounds since learning about her expedited deportation order. Many have asked Ruano if she'd consider disappearing into the shadows, at least until the administration changes. A friend even offered to house Ruano and her family in their cabin in the woods. “Sometimes I consider giving up because I am so tired of fighting the immigration process,” reflects Ruano. “I think maybe it's a better option to live in the shade.” She pauses as though to consider the thought. “But I want to leave with my dignity.” 


	Three weeks later, in March, Ruano and her family visit the Milwaukee RiverWalk, a secluded path tucked between woods and an overpass. The four have come here often since the pandemic. Nearby, men in waders fish for carp. “I tried carp once,” Miguel says, shaking his head. “Didn't taste good.” 


	Most years, Ruano and her family would spend spring break further northwest at an indoor water park, but Miguel, who cannot legally obtain a driver's license in Wisconsin, was recently pulled over and given a warning: If he's caught driving on the highway again, he will be detained and deported. While Ruano still holds onto hope that she'll be allowed to stay in Milwaukee, Miguel is tired — tired of their world shrinking, of the constant fear. He no longer feels welcome in a country where, he says, even the way people look at him makes him feel like he doesn't belong. Returning to El Salvador, he adds, would be a chance to start again on their own terms.

	











	Ruano is due back at the immigration office in just a few weeks. She's called every day to check on the status of her visa application. So far, she learns, it has yet to be processed. 


	Four days before her next check-in with ICE, Ruano fears the worst and buys herself a ticket to El Salvador on June 3. 


	Under previous administrations, immigrants with pending visa applications were often allowed to remain in the country while their cases were reviewed, a process that could take years. “Deportation is extremely expensive,” says Marc Christopher, an immigration attorney who works with the advocacy group Voces and who took on Ruano's case pro bono in March. (Ruano has rotated through four attorneys since first applying for asylum in 2011. In total, the legal fight has cost her upwards of $36,000.) “In the past, the government used its limited resources to focus on people with criminal records, but that's not the case anymore. If you come into their view, they want you gone.”


	And Ruano — who refuses to disappear or leave without a fight — stands squarely in view. 


	IN APRIL, RUANO IS GIVEN ONE more 30-day extension. After her appointment with immigration, Ruano suggests that she and the girls get breakfast at IHOP, a favorite of the twins. But when the three arrive at the diner, customers are gathered near the host stand. 


	“I don't think they'll be serving breakfast anymore today,” an older man says. “ICE just came and took their cook.”


	Ruano puts her hand to her mouth and pulls Elisabeth and Paola to her chest. She ushers them gently out the door.


	“This is real. It's really happening,” she says in a near whisper. “We're together. We're OK.”


	Even if Ruano is allowed to stay for now, the ground under mixed-status families like hers, never solid to begin with, is eroding fast. The girls worry about Miguel; his workplace could be raided at any time. Ruano reassures them that he's safe. But while she fights to remain in the U.S. legally, Miguel continues to live and work without legal protection, his own situation growing more precarious all the time. “The landscape is changing every day,” says Christopher, her attorney. “Everything is coming down at lightning speed. We're just at the tip of the iceberg.”


	At a nearby McDonald's, Ruano orders pancakes and biscuits for the twins. She teases the girls that they'll have to get used to beans and rice, a practiced parenting trick to put them at ease. Ruano looks out the window where the IHOP stands across the parking lot. She taps her fingers lightly across the table.

	











	“We keep going,” she says. “Hop, hop, hop.” Forward, into whatever comes next.


	HOVERING AT THE EDGE OF HER GARDEN in mid-June, Ruano leans down and gently tugs at the stems of a small strawberry bush. Summer has arrived, and with it, the syrupy weight of Midwestern heat. “I won't have time to eat my strawberries,” she laments, surveying her plants. 


	Inside, Paola and Elisabeth are back on the couch, watching a peroxide-blonde YouTube influencer walk through the choreography of American air travel: security lines, boarding passes, takeoff, and landing. The twins have never been on a plane, and Ruano's only experiences were a deportation flight to El Salvador in 2011 and a plane from Texas to Milwaukee that same year.


	The extension in April was Ruano's last. In May, she was informed that her time was up. On June 2, in a final attempt to remain in Milwaukee, Ruano filed an emergency motion to stay. Ten days later, it was denied. She and the twins plan to leave the country on June 17. 


	A scale sits against the wall, and beside it stand three large suitcases. Ruano circles the house, grabbing a pencil sharpener, a food processor, and a pupusa shredder. “You can't find this stuff in El Salvador,” she says, handing them to Miguel. He places them in a large box, which he will send later in the summer. Miguel plans to stay in Milwaukee for a few more months to make a little more money and fix up their home for renters. 


	Ruano jokes that the first time she was deported, she had only a plastic bag and shoes. Now she's leaving behind a whole house. “How did I end up with so much garbage?” she says with a laugh, picking up a seashell from a basket of rocks. Garbage, or the familiar menagerie of family life, collected over years of trips, school art projects, and birthday parties. 


	Paola has been quiet all day. She's always been the more solemn of the sisters. “I worry,” Ruano says, looking at her daughter. “Am I doing the right thing for my girls? I'm happy we're going together, but I wonder if it's the right decision.” 


	On the morning of June 17, Ruano enters Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport. Inside, she stands in the terminal's echoing hall, once again surrounded by supporters and news cameras. Ruano has agreed to one last press conference. Since February, Ruano's story has reached beyond Milwaukee and a petition launched by Voces de la Frontera has gathered hundreds of signatures and raised more than $16,000 for Ruano and her family.

	











	“To my immigrant community,” she says, tearfully, “I want to say that we cannot live in fear. We need to keep working for our children's futures…. Our love and our togetherness is what will get us through.”


	As Ruano speaks, Miguel circles the crowd, staying just far enough from the cameras to remain out of frame. He takes a risk coming to the airport; immigration arrests have been rising in recent weeks. 


	Just before 11 a.m., Ruano, Miguel, and the twins head toward security. At the far end of the departure hall, the four pass under an enormous American flag, turn the corner, and disappear from view.


	A FEW DAYS LATER, RUANO SHARES a batch of photos from Comasagua, the rural, mountainous area of El Salvador where Ruano grew up and where she has now returned. In the first one, Ruano stands with the girls and her mother at a lookout, the group arranged neatly in front of a lush horizon. Even as she fought to stay in the United States, Ruano told herself that seeing her mother after 15 years might be the reason she was meant to return.

	At first glance, the image could be a vacation photo, a family pausing at a scenic overlook before continuing on their way. But the next few images unsettle that reading: rain spilling off a corrugated metal roof, water pooling outside rooms without walls; a plastic bag placed over a pile of wood to stoke a fire from a makeshift pit. No kitchen. 


	In the last photo, Ruano sits alone on the ground, looking directly into the camera. She looks tired, but still offers a faint half-smile. It's an expression of willed optimism — maybe for her daughters, maybe for the lens. Or maybe, for herself.

Zohran Mamdani has the penthouse crowd aflutter. The Democratic mayoral nominee's bold, simple plan to make New York affordable for everyday citizens — freeze the rents, make buses and child care free — would be funded by a meager two percent tax hike on New York's millionaire class. 


	The ultra-wealthy squawked back with their usual empty threat: Raise their taxes and they'll leave, taking their fortunes — and New York City's tax base — with them. But the Big Apple didn't become the richest city in the world overnight, and if tax flight were real, history and hard data would prove it. Instead, the record is clear: Higher taxes make millionaires flap their wings, not fly the coop.


	Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren threw a match into the nest. On CNBC, she swatted away a host's hand-wringing about higher taxes on the wealthy: “Oh dear, are you worried that billionaires are going to go hungry?” Her point was unmistakable. No matter the noise, New York's millionaires aren't going anywhere. Why would they? Moving is undesirable, disruptive, and the very investments their taxes fund — from city parks to transit to cultural life — are exactly what makes New York City the capital of the world. 

	











	The evidence for millionaire tax flight is scant. If high earners were truly fleeing high taxes, low-tax states would be swarming with millionaires. Instead, the highest concentrations of millionaires are found in high-tax states like Connecticut, Maryland, and New Jersey. And in these states, taxes levied on the highest earners have been broadly successful, with ​​ Massachusett's millionaire tax generating an additional $2 billion in revenue than expected in the last year alone.

	And for all the doom and gloom about a mass exodus, when tax rates did increase, millionaire populations continued to climb.


	In 2021, when New York increased personal income tax rates for millionaires, the state's millionaire population grew by 21 percent. In neighboring New Jersey, when the state raised taxes on high earners in 2004, only 37 millionaires left the following year. That same year, 3,000 new millionaires were added to the state's rolls. California's 2005 millionaire tax hike had a similar effect: The millionaire population increased by 30 percent by 2007.

	Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has gone so far as to claim that just “a handful of successful people” leaving could decimate New York's finances. In reality, it would require a significant share of the nearly 14,000 households in Manhattan alone earning $1 million or more annually to pack up and leave to make a dent. 


	However, millionaires are less mobile than everyone else, as only 2.4 percent of millionaires move across state lines each year, compared to 2.9 percent of the general population. In 2022, more than 65,000 New York State residents who made low-to-middle incomes left the state, over three times the rate of outbound migration for earners in the top one percent. And even when the wealthy do decamp, they typically trade one high-tax zip code for another, rather than retreat to a tax haven. 


	Millionaires rarely relocate, not because they can't afford to, but because millionaires make decisions about where to live just like the rest of us do. Our decisions about where to reside are shaped far more by jobs, family, and quality of life than by tax rates. Surveys show that only nine percent of interstate movers cite tax-related reasons as a major factor. If New York millionaires were truly desperate to cut costs, they could make the far easier move from Manhattan to Jersey City or Hoboken, where the median home is nearly half the price. Few ever do, making it hard to believe they'd uproot their kids, abandon business networks, and trade New York's unrivaled energy and access just to shave a few dollars off their tax bill.

	It is possible that Ackman might make good on his threat to leave New York if taxes rise, but the data says he won't have much company and will quickly be replaced. The choice for New York isn't “tax the rich or lose them.” The wealthy are already there and multiplying. To truly decimate the City's finances, millionaire flight would have to surge to levels we've never seen before, levels that similar tax hikes have never caused. In every real-world case, the tax dollars gained have dwarfed the dollars lost. 

	











	And history isn't Mamdani's only ally; policy is, too. Mamdani's proposals would make the city more livable for working people while improving public goods — from transit to child care — that benefit everyone, including those footing a slightly higher tax bill.

	After all, while billionaires may never ride a free city bus, they would be remiss to ignore that they, too, gain from a city that runs smoothly — one that's safe, clean, and vibrant — because the everyday people who do ride those buses are exactly who keep New York thriving, and who sustain the fortunes they're so desperate to protect.

Bob Lazar's claims about working at a secret site near Area 51 have fascinated UFO enthusiasts for decades. He insists he studied alien spacecraft technology while reverse-engineering it for the US government.

Lazar claimed the spacecraft didn't rely on traditional engines or fuel. Instead, it used a gravity propulsion system that bent space-time itself, allowing the craft to move instantly from one point to another. According to him, this was powered by a mysterious element unknown to science at the time.

Before scientists discovered it decades later, Lazar described a stable version of Element 115 (Moscovium) as the key fuel powering alien ships. He said this element generated anti-gravity waves, which made propulsion possible. Critics argue no stable form of this element has ever been produced on Earth.

Lazar suggested that the craft could bend light and space around it, making it nearly invisible both to the naked eye and to radar. This “space-warping” effect, he said, wasn't cloaking in the traditional sense but a side effect of manipulating gravity fields.

Inside the craft, Lazar described a compact reactor no larger than a basketball, producing massive amounts of energy without heat, radiation, or visible waste. He insisted it was far beyond nuclear fission or fusion and functioned more like a limitless clean power source.

The craft itself was said to be made of a smooth, seamless metallic material that had no bolts, welds, or joints. Lazar claimed the material wasn't earthly in origin, and its construction hinted at advanced manufacturing methods humanity hasn't achieved even today.

Instead of controls like joysticks or throttles, Lazar claimed alien pilots navigated by distorting gravity fields. The ship didn't “fly” in the traditional sense but instead “fell” into the direction it wanted to go by altering gravitational pull. This allowed for sudden right-angle turns and acceleration that no human pilot could survive.

Finally, Lazar described the craft as having a protective energy field around it. This shield supposedly deflected both matter and energy, meaning weapons or projectiles couldn't hit the craft directly. In his words, it was like trying to push two magnets together at the same pole.

Decades later, Bob Lazar's testimony continues to divide opinion. Scientists dismiss his accounts as unverified and inconsistent, while UFO believers point to later discoveries—like the identification of Element 115—as evidence he may have been telling the truth. Whether real or fabricated, Lazar's story has shaped how people imagine alien technology and keeps the mystery of Area 51 alive.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

His story included anti-gravity propulsion, exotic fuels, and technology far beyond human capability. But what became of Lazar after he went public with these claims? Here's how his life unfolded in the years that followed.

After going public with investigative journalist George Knapp, Lazar quickly became one of the most controversial figures in UFO history. His claims of “flying saucers” at a site called S-4 near Area 51 turned him into a hero for UFO enthusiasts and a target for skeptics.

Soon after his whistleblowing, researchers discovered holes in his educational and employment records. Lazar claimed to have degrees from MIT and Caltech, but there was no evidence of him attending. Official records also didn't support his employment history at Los Alamos National Laboratory, though some indirect evidence suggested he had worked around the facility. Critics called this proof of fabrication, while Lazar's supporters insisted the government erased his records to discredit him.

In the 1990s, Lazar faced several legal issues:

These controversies further divided opinion—were they proof Lazar wasn't credible, or attempts to tarnish his reputation?

Despite the media storm, Lazar never capitalized heavily on his story. He avoided UFO conventions, rarely gave interviews, and instead focused on running his company United Nuclear, which sells scientific equipment, chemicals, and supplies. Unlike other UFO personalities, Lazar never built a career from his claims.

In 2018, filmmaker Jeremy Corbell released Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers, bringing Lazar's story to a new generation. Around the same time, interest in UFOs grew again due to Pentagon UFO disclosures, giving Lazar's claims renewed relevance. Despite sticking to his original story for decades, Lazar admitted the publicity had made his life “a living hell.”

Now in his mid-60s, Bob Lazar lives a low-profile life in Michigan. He still insists his story is true, but he refuses to actively seek fame from it. For UFO believers, Lazar remains a pioneer whistleblower. For skeptics, he's a cautionary tale about hoaxes and misinformation.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

CHILLICOTHE, Ohio — One of Chillicothe's most popular fall traditions is set to return as the annual Ghost Walk fundraiser takes over downtown on Saturday, September 20, 2025.

The event runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and offers history lovers, paranormal enthusiasts, and curious visitors the chance to explore some of the city's most historic — and reportedly haunted — locations.

This year's featured stops include:

The Ghost Walk is self-guided, allowing participants to tour at their own pace and in any order. Volunteer storytellers and guides will be stationed at each site, sharing a mix of historical facts and eerie tales tied to the buildings. Guests are encouraged to arrive before 1 p.m. to ensure they have enough time to complete the tour, with the last groups beginning no later than 5 p.m.



Now in its 15th year, the Ghost Walk has long served as both a community fundraiser and a celebration of local history. Proceeds once benefited the League of Women Voters, and since 2017, have gone directly to support the Chillicothe Halloween Festival, scheduled this year for October 10–12 in Yoctangee Park.

Tickets are $10 per person, with free admission for children 8 and under. They can be purchased online at ChillicotheHalloweenFestival.com/ghost-walk or in person at the Ross-Chillicothe Convention & Visitors Bureau, 230 North Plaza Blvd, beginning August 20.

Organizers say the Ghost Walk not only raises vital funds but also highlights Chillicothe's architecture, culture, and long-standing love of ghost stories.

For decades, astronomers have searched for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes and optical instruments, scanning the skies for artificial signals. Now, researchers are taking a different approach, this time looking much closer to home for alien artefacts that might already be in our Solar System.

A new study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society describes an innovative method for detecting potential extraterrestrial probes near Earth. Their approach; to use Earth's shadow as a natural filter to eliminate interference from human-made satellites and space debris.

Modern skies are cluttered with thousands of satellites and millions of pieces of reflective debris, making it extremely difficult to spot anything unusual.

This 'contamination' poses a major challenge for anyone trying to identify non human objects in space. Lead researcher Beatriz Villarroel from Stockholm University and her international team needed a way to filter out this noise.

This is why they turned to the Earth's shadow. Every night, Earth casts a cone-shaped shadow into space where direct sunlight cannot reflect off satellites or debris.

This creates an ideal 'clean' search zone. The shadow's base spans roughly 8-9 degrees for objects at geosynchronous orbit, about 35,700 kilometers (22,200 miles) above Earth.

Human satellites typically don't carry optical light sources, with rare exceptions like communication lasers or spacecraft thrusters. So any bright flashes or streaks detected within Earth's shadow could potentially indicate something more exotic.

The researchers analyzed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a telescope in California that systematically surveys the sky for changing objects. They examined over 200,000 images, specifically focusing on those captured within Earth's shadow.

Their automated search system, called NEOrion, detected thousands of candidates, including mysterious streaking objects and point source flashes. Most turned out to be meteors, aircraft, or known asteroids.

However, one intriguing case emerged; an uncatalogued object moving much faster than typical asteroids and not found in any existing space object databases. Sadly, however, the team was unable to confirm what it was, so it still remains a mystery.

The study also explores other innovative approaches, including examining pre-1957 astronomical photographs and analyzing the color spectra of suspicious objects to identify materials that have been weathered by long exposure to space.

While this proof of concept study didn't definitively identify any alien technology, it demonstrates that systematic searches for extraterrestrial artefacts are now feasible using existing telescopes and new analysis techniques.

The researchers are developing the ExoProbe project, a network of telescopes designed specifically for this type of search, which will use multiple simultaneous observations to determine exact distances to mysterious objects.

ByJamie Carter,

Senior Contributor.

The nascent search for radio transmissions from alien civilizations should focus not on planets, but on their alignments, according to new research from Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The insight is based on analysis of humans' deep space transmissions, the majority of which are between Earth and Mars. After all, there are 18 spacecraft in Mars orbit, seven currently active, while 10 landers and rovers are on its surface. NASA's Deep Space Network — three vast dishes in California, Spain and Australia — sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space.

The theory, published this week in a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, goes that if Earth is sending messages to Mars, any star directly behind Mars would receive spillover radio transmissions — and realize where they're coming from. “Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,” said Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Eberly College of Science, science principal investigator of the NASA grant supporting this research and first author of the paper. “But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover.”

That spillover occurs when Earth and another solar system planet align from the perspective of an alien planet or spacecraft. ""This suggests that we should look for alignment of planets outside of our solar system when searching for extraterrestrial communications,” says Fan.

When it comes to finding aliens in the cosmos, there's a need to restrict where to look. SETI — the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — has so far found no definitive radio signals sent by extraterrestrial intelligence — but is constantly refining where to look and how to detect them. There is no other choice because the cosmos is so vast — SETI is now decades old and has only examined a very tiny fraction of the universe for signals in limited frequencies and with limited sensitivity. According to NASA, if the Milky Way galaxy were an ocean, then SETI would have listened to the equivalent of a small swimming pool within it.

There may be other reasons to explain “The Great Silence” — the lack of any evidence for extraterrestrials — but all humans can do is be as clever as possible about where to look. “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures,” said Fan.

The paper looked at 20 years' worth of transmissions between Earth and Mars, as well as between Earth and spacecraft positioned around the sun or at Sun-Earth Lagrange points — such as where the James Webb Space Telescope is. “Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions,"" said Fan. That's orders of magnitude more likely than detecting our signals from a random position. “If they could view an alignment with another solar-system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.”

It's hoped that NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal hundreds of thousands of previously undetected exoplanets — planets orbiting stars other than the sun — and reveal systems containing planets that align from Earth's point of view.

It may have been two decades since Supernatural first hit our screens, but some of the episodes never leave our minds.


	By Emma McKenna

For 15 seasons, Supernatural gave fans a mix of monster-of-the-week scares, heartfelt brotherly drama, meta humor, and apocalyptic battles between Heaven and Hell.The show consistently produced episodes that could rival theatrical horror releases, especially in the early seasons. Whether you were watching during its debut on The WB in 2005 or revisiting it on streaming today, these stories remain effective reminders of the show's roots as a paranormal thriller.

Beyond Sam and Dean's larger mythology, the show also delivered some truly terrifying standalone episodes that could rival feature-length horrors. Many of these installments borrowed directly from horror tropes, folklore, and even infamous real-life killers, making them just as chilling as the films they were inspired by. Below, we've highlighted our five Supernatural episodes that we think stand shoulder to shoulder with horror movies.

When fans talk about Supernatural's early days as a horror series, “Asylum” almost always comes up. And it's understandable—who isn't freaked out by a deserted, ramshackle psychiatric hospital? “Asylum” remains one of the scariest Season One outings because it leans into the natural, claustrophobic dread over flashy CGI effects. The setting alone taps into classic horror imagery of flickering lights, dark corners, decrepit hallways, and the uneasy feeling that something is always watching.

If this were a feature film, it would sit comfortably next to cult favorites like Session 9 or Grave Encounters, both of which used similar asylum settings to terrifying effect.

Creepy children are a horror staple, from Village of the Damned to The Omen. Supernatural leaned hard into this trope with “The Kids Are Alright,” an episode that introduces the monstrous changelings that replace human children in an Invasion Of The Body Snatchers kind of way before the monster duplicates then feed off the children's mothers.

The eeriness of this story comes straight from the performances of the child actors, who manage to take something as simple as a child's innocence and create a sinister environment with a simple, emotionless blank stare or a sudden aggressively overbearing demand for attention. The episode does a great job of taking a familiar horror concept and twisting it through the lens of Supernatural's monster mythology.

If there's one Supernatural episode that instills real horror in the hearts of its fans, it's “Family Remains.” It is definitely one of the most disturbing episodes of the series because the horror is rooted in reality. Steeped in the realms of true-crime style stories, “Family Remains” sticks with you because it proves that the monsters are real, and they're human.But beyond that, it also incorporates the classic ghost horror trope well. The jump scare moments of a ghost appearing in a window, then gone, the manifestation picking off people one by one, and the dark and terrible reason behind it all. It's very The Ring.

Few urban legends are as universally feared as Bloody Mary, and Supernatural's take on the legend remains one of its most terrifying early entries. The episode follows victims who die gruesomely after chanting her name in front of a mirror. It taps into childhood dares and slumber party games that most viewers already knew, making the horror feel unsettlingly close to home. “Bloody Mary” is one of the show's most effective horror stories because of its relatability. If you're from the Millennial and Gen X generations, there would have been many a sleep over where someone was dared to test the legend as a kid, and then no one could sleep after out of absolute terror.

The episode plays on that anxiety with grisly mirror imagery that would make any horror filmmaker proud. Like Candyman before it, “Bloody Mary” blurs the line between folklore and supernatural slasher, cementing its status as a story that could have easily anchored its own horror film franchise.

Now, we know that for many, “Bloody Mary” takes the top spot for scariest episode, but “No Exit” definitely gets our vote. Much like “Family Remains,” this episode is based in reality. But what makes it worse, is that it's based in direct reality, rather than an upsetting, generalized example of human horror.

“No Exit” pits the Winchesters against the ghost of H.H. Holmes, often called America's first serial killer, and even suspected of being Jack The Ripper. Holmes' spirit haunts an apartment building constructed over the site of his infamous “Murder Castle,” where he tortured and killed victims in the late 1800s. If you don't know his story, it's worth some research—but it's not pleasant! The episode effectively channels historical horror, using Holmes' legacy to give the supernatural threat real-world grounding. Trapped women, hidden walls, and eerie whispers give the episode a genuine sense of menace. Add in the fact that it's Jo Harvelle's first real hunt alongside the brothers, and you get a story that feels both personal and unflinchingly scary. 

It's easy to imagine “No Exit” as a standalone horror movie about an urban haunting rooted in true crime, making it one of the show's most cinematic effort.

Now, we know this is cheating a little bit as technically this makes 6 episodes, but you can't have modern horror without honoring its elders.

“Monster Movie” is a black-and-white love letter to classic Universal horror films, complete with vampires, werewolves, and mummies. Unlike the episodes above, this one leans into the more campy and fun elements, embracing the tropes of old-school horror and melodramatic cinema. The episode stands out because of its classic stylized feel, with the entire episode filmed in black and white to keep the audience in that world and a departure from the show's typical format. While it isn't terrifying in the traditional sense, it captures the joy of horror fandom and serves as a reminder that horror movies don't have to be… well… horrific. Apart from seeing Dean “I don't do shorts” Winchester in lederhosen.

Anti-sunscreen sentiment is cropping up on social media with alarming frequency. Katie Rosseinsky asks the experts to separate the facts from the fiction

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

A man clutching a tiny microphone strides purposefully towards the sun care aisle in his local pharmacy. He picks up the orange and yellow bottles, scans the labels and quickly, performatively rejects them with a pantomime shake of the head. Why? Because he's convinced that sunscreen is filled with “toxic chemicals” that, he claims, are “doing more harm than good”. And if you watch his video for long enough, he'll probably start recommending the “natural” option he's switched to instead. He might even (falsely) claim that, rather than protecting you from skin cancer, sunscreen increases the risk. 

Variations on this scene are cropping up on social media with alarming frequency. Over on TikTok, this backlash against SPF (sun protection factor), known as the “anti-sunscreen movement”, has been brewing for a couple of years, but in the summer of 2025, it seems to have moved from a conspiratorial niche into something more mainstream.

Back in July, former The Only Way is Essex star Sam Faiers told her 2.5 million Instagram followers that she doesn't use sunscreen, and neither does her family, including her young children. “Over the years, the kids have built up a really good tolerance to being in the sun,” she said, before claiming that many sunscreens “are actually pretty harmful and full of toxic ingredients”. In the same month, actor and influencer Kelsey Parker revealed that she avoids using SPF on her children, too (she said she uses a homemade “organic” version instead, made from beeswax and “no bad stuff”). 

Their concerning beliefs aren't outliers, either. Recent research has suggested that Gen-Zers are particularly susceptible to sunscreen myths. Last year, a study from the American Academy of Dermatology found that 28 per cent of 18- to 26-year-olds believe that getting a tan is more important than the risk of skin cancer, with 37 per cent admitting to only using sunscreen when they're nagged by others to do so. And new data from health insurance provider Vitality found that 18 per cent of Gen Z respondents believed that you don't need sun protection if you tan easily (there's the myth of “good tolerance” again). 

To properly examine the anti-sunscreen backlash, we need to get to grips with exactly how this product works. “The sun emits ultraviolet radiation in the form of UVA and UVB rays, both of which can cause damage to the skin,” says Dr Ross Perry, medical director of Cosmedics skin clinics. 

UVA rays, he explains, “penetrate more deeply” into the skin and are responsible for signs of ageing, like wrinkles, sagging and pigmentation, while “UVB rays affect the surface, causing sunburn and direct DNA damage, which increases the risk of skin cancer”. Cancer Research UK estimates that 85 per cent of cases of melanoma (a type of skin cancer that develops in melanin-producing cells) are caused by overexposure to UV radiation; their analysis has also found that melanoma rates have increased by almost one-third over the past decade. 

A broad spectrum sunscreen, Perry adds, is designed to shield us against both UVA and UVB rays. There are two main types of sunscreen: those that use chemical filters, which “work by absorbing UV radiation and converting it into harmless heat”, and those that use mineral filters, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These “sit on the skin's surface to reflect and scatter rays away”. 

It's the first category of creams and sprays, those with chemical filters, which tend to be the focus of anti-sunscreen sentiment. That's because a handful of studies have discovered UV filters such as oxybenzone and avobenzone in people's blood stream after applying sunscreen. These chemicals are benzophenones, a type of chemical that may influence the endocrine system, which is in charge of creating and releasing hormones in the body. 

Anti-sunscreen crusaders will often tout these studies as a way of lending their claims an air of scientific legitimacy. But – spoiler alert – discussing complex research in a 90-second video doesn't always convey a full and nuanced picture. Dr Perry notes that although ingredients like oxybenzone have “shown hormone-like effects” in “very high laboratory doses”, “the amounts used in sunscreens are far lower and there's no evidence they cause harm in real-world use”. Plus, all the active filters in sunscreen, be they chemical or mineral, will “have been rigorously tested and approved by regulatory authorities in the UK, Europe and the US”. And if you truly wanted to avoid benzophenones, you'd probably have to ditch half the contents of your washbag, because they're common in other makeup and skincare products too. 

Since sunscreen is used by so many people, even if there were a small negative effect, this would be very evident

Consultant dermatologist Dr Magnus Lynch takes a similar view. “It is true that certain chemicals used within sunscreen can be absorbed in small quantities through the skin,” he says, “however, there is little evidence that these are harmful.” Plus, “since sunscreen is used by so many people, even if there were a small negative effect, this would be very evident”. And yet he is still seeing patients “who are scared to use SPF” now, after seeing “myths amplified on social media” by people with no medical expertise. “I do understand the appeal of natural products and avoiding chemicals”, he adds, but “the risks of sunlight exposure are far greater”. For those who are worried about chemicals, he suggests swapping to a mineral sunscreen instead.

As for the idea of sun “tolerance” that seems to be cropping up all over social media? That's a misconception. “You cannot train your skin to become safely resistant to UV,” explains consultant dermatologist Dr Rakesh Anand. “A tan is a visible sign of DNA damage, not a shield.” It might provide, at best, “an SPF of roughly two to four, which is nowhere near adequate”, he adds (the NHS recommends using at least SPF 30). “Relying on this ‘tolerance' leads to cumulative damage, photoageing and higher skin cancer risk.” 

Another concern for dermatologists is influencers sharing at-home “sun care” recipes. Last year, for example, model Nara Smith shared a video in which she mixed up coconut oil, shea and cocoa butter, jojoba oil, beeswax and zinc oxide. “These homemade concoctions are not tested for UV protection, may offer inconsistent coverage, and could result in uneven or insufficient protection, raising the risk of burns and long-term damage,” Dr Perry says. Beef tallow (an animal fat, also appealingly known as beef dripping) is another “natural” ingredient that anti-sunscreeners often praise. Perry describes its use for sun protection as “complete nonsense and potentially very dangerous”. “Beef tallow has absolutely no SPF or UV-blocking properties, so applying it to your skin gives you zero protection against sunburn, sun damage or skin cancer,” he adds.

He describes home remedies like these as not just ineffective but outright irresponsible, “because they give people a false sense of security in the sun, and that's when real damage occurs”. 

So why has sunscreen suddenly become the site of conspiracies? The backlash seems to have gained momentum in the wake of the pandemic, riding the wave of medical misinformation and scepticism about traditional medicine that emerged with the arrival of the vaccine. At the same time, there's been a fresh focus on “clean” or “natural” products, which, as Dr Anand puts it, “sometimes frames ‘chemical' as a synonym for ‘harmful', which is misleading”. 

We're seeing ‘DIY wellness' and anti-medical narratives become popular online because they're framed as empowering and rebellious

Medical advice, Perry says, can often feel “technical or confusing, so myths and conspiracies offer an easier narrative, often framed as ‘big companies' trying to hide the truth'”. In videos criticising sunscreen, for example, you might hear influencers claiming that doctors are simply telling us that the sun is bad so that “Big Pharma” can make millions from SPF products. 

Social media only exacerbates the problem. “Platforms like TikTok reward short, emotive messages,” says Dr Jonathan Kentley, consultant dermatologist at Montrose Clinic London and the Lister Hospital, so influencers attempt to craft “a catchy narrative that cuts through, even if it's completely untrue”. 

Throw in “a growing mistrust of institutions”, he adds, “and you have fertile ground for health misinformation to flourish. It's part of a wider trend: we're seeing ‘DIY wellness' and anti-medical narratives become popular online because they're framed as empowering and rebellious”. Unfortunately, though, Kentley adds, these narratives “often end up doing more harm than good. We as doctors are finding it increasingly challenging to present the facts in an age where many get their primary source of information from social media platforms”. 

So next time you find yourself drawn in by spurious claims about sun care, it's worth keeping Kentley's words in mind. “Decades of rigorous research show that sunscreen is one of the safest and most effective tools we have to reduce the risk of skin cancer and premature skin ageing,” he says. And while “there is no case of cancer that has ever been linked to sunscreen”, he adds, “conversely, as a busy dermatologist, I can assure you that I have personally seen hundreds of cases of cancer caused by not wearing sunscreen”.

US First Lady Melania Trump's letter was handed over to Russian President Vladimir Putin by her husband Donald Trump at the Alaska summit last week.

While Melania did not attend the mega event, she used the opportunity to raise voice against the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the children facing the worst impact of the war. She urged Putin to put a full stop on the violence, stressing that “In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future.”

“Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,” he added.

Taking to social media, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted the letter, which had the First Lady's signature, which appeared to be rather familiar. The signature drew several reactions on social media, sparking conspiracy theories.

Netizens claimed that the signature of the First Lady looked similar to President Trump.

“Donald Trump and Melania Trump's signatures. So weird,” wrote one person, sharing a side-by-side picture of their signatures. “That's IDENTICAL to Trump's own signature…”

“Melania has the same type of signature as Trump...odd...” another said.

“Why she have the same sharpie a** signature as Trump?” a third user stated, referring to Trump's favorite pen.

“No way is that her signature,” the fourth user chimed in. “She didn't write it and Trump signed it,” one more claimed, without offering any evidence.

Netizens ask question to Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot about Melania 's signatureSome users even asked Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?” “Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok responded. “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. No official reason given.” Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has provided testimony in criminal cases, agreed with the chatbot's response. He claimed that the Trump ""brand"" is the main focus of the style, which features ""angular letters"" and “long downstrokes.” However, the expert pointed out that over the past ten years, Melania's signature and handwriting have “morphed” into Trump's. Reddit users wonder if Melania used an autopenUsers on Reddit and X were also making wild guesses about whether Melania used an autopen, which has turned into one of Trump's favorite ways to criticize his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump accused Biden of signing pardoning documents using an automated device rather than his own hand. Without providing any proof, Trump asserted that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents. “Did Melania use Donald's autopen?” one X user questioned. “The autopen can only have one signature preset,” quipped another.

""It is Austin's most famous unsolved murder — four teenage girls were murdered for NO reason.""

—ronnievalentine4

The Yogurt Shop Murders took place in Austin, Texas, on December 6, 1991, when four teenage girls were found bound, shot, and killed in a burning “I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!” shop. The case shocked the community and led to multiple wrongful convictions later overturned due to coerced confessions and mismatched DNA evidence. Despite decades of investigation and advances in forensic testing, the crime remains unsolved and is considered one of Austin's most infamous cold cases.

""It was all over the local news at the time, and it hit me pretty hard. Her body was found a couple of years after she disappeared, but her killer remains unknown.""

Molly Bish was a 16-year-old lifeguard who vanished from her post at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts on June 27, 2000. According to investigators, Molly was gone just after 10:00 a.m., but wasn't reported missing until almost two hours later, and police didn't speak with her mother until after 1 p.m.

According to Molly's mother, ""The crime scene was almost completely destroyed, and it has had devastating consequences to this day. We have had little DNA to work with and little information.""

Bish's remains were found in 2003, a few miles from the pond, in the woods.

NBC 10 Boston reported in June 2023, ""The search for Bish's killer has led investigators to convicted rapist Frank Sumner, who died in 2016, but more [DNA] testing needs to be done.""

In June 2025, her family hosted a vigil marking 25 years since her disappearance, emphasizing that the investigation is still active and ongoing.

""Pregnant postal worker from Chicago missing since 2018. She withdrew money from an ATM and then disappeared. General consensus is that she was killed, but no body was ever recovered.""

Kierra Coles was 26 years old and roughly three months pregnant when she went missing on Oct. 2, 2018. Her last known movements on that day were captured on CCTV camera, which the Chicago police released in 2022. 

According to ABC News, ""The surveillance video showed a man — who is considered a person of interest — arriving at Coles's home, and later Coles and the man were seen driving away in Coles's car. At about 10:43 p.m. that night, Coles was spotted on surveillance video making ATM withdrawals — the last known images of her, according to police. 

Later that night, Coles's car was parked in another part of the city, police said. The person of interest was seen getting out of the passenger side, but nobody got out of the driver's side, according to police.

The next day, the person of interest was seen parking Coles's car near her home and going inside, police said. He then left Coles's home and drove away in his car.

When the person of interest was interviewed, police said he gave varying accounts of the last time he saw Coles.""

""The Mitrice Richardson case is terrifying. She was showing signs of a mental health episode, was released from jail after midnight without her wallet, phone, or any way to get home, and her remains were found by park rangers 2.5 miles from the sheriff's station almost a year later. A cause of death was never determined; her family suspects foul play, but the sheriff's department insists there's no evidence.""

Richardson was a 24-year-old Cal State Fullerton grad who went missing on Sept. 17, 2019. Richardson was last seen allegedly leaving a sheriff's station in Malibu. (Earlier, she had been detained by sheriff's deputies after a restaurant manager made a citizen's arrest complaint.) Eleven months went by before her body was inadvertently found by park rangers in August 2010 in Malibu Canyon.

According to KWCH, ""Jaquilla was 4 years old when she was last seen in her bed at around 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 5, 2001. She was discovered missing at 3:00 a.m. at her home in the 1600 block of N. Volutsia. Six days after she disappeared, the 9/11 attacks occurred."" An age progression photo was released by Kansas Bureau of Investigation in 2022.

""It happened in 1987 in Alexander, Arkansas. They were two boys I attended high school with. They were murdered and then placed on a railroad track where they were run over by a freight train. The sheriff did a HORRIBLE job at the crime scene, and the case is still unsolved.""

—jabbaslilsis

According to Arkansas Online, ""Early on the morning of Aug. 23, 1987, a Union Pacific crew spotted the bodies of Kevin Ives and Henry wrapped in a tarp on the tracks. Unable to stop in time, the train ran them over, finally coming to a complete stop in Benton where Union Pacific employees reported the incident to the police. The teenagers had stayed out late hunting the night before.

Though a gun was found near the bodies, investigators initially ruled the incident as a suicide or related to drug use; later reviews of autopsies revealed they had been murdered, their bodies placed on the track near or shortly after their deaths.

In 1988, Richard Garrett, an attorney for the victims' families, appeared on Unsolved Mysteries to discuss the murders. During an interview with the host, Garrett said he believed the two boys 'saw something they shouldn't have seen and it had to do with drugs.' Kevin Ives' and Henry's deaths were ruled homicides in March 1990.

No arrests were ever made.""

Huisentruit was a news anchor in Mason City, Iowa who disappeared on June 27, 1995 on the way to work. There were apparently signs of a struggle outside of her apartment, so it was presumed she was abducted. Although there were thousands of tips and interviews conducted, Huisentruit was not found and declared legally dead in 2001.

""She's been missing from Milwaukee since 2002. She was 7 years old and dropped off at school by her stepfather but never made it into the building. Some people speculated that her mother and/or stepfather were somehow involved, but there was never enough evidence to arrest either of them. They insisted that they had nothing to do with her disappearance. It's probably ridiculous, but I will always watch my kids actually walk into the building when I drop them off at school before I drive away.""

—mister_nanda

According to USA Today, ""The morning Alexis disappeared, she and her mother, Ayanna Patterson, argued over cupcakes. Alexis had planned to bring the treats to school, but she hadn't done her homework, so her mother didn't let her.  

LaRon Bourgeois, Ayanna's husband, and Alexis's stepfather, told police he and his son walked Alexis to the corner between their home and the school and left her with a crossing guard, who — according to the records — was a fifth grader. 

The reports include differing witness accounts. Some said they saw Alexis on the school grounds that morning. Others said she had never arrived.  

Two weeks after Alexis went missing, FBI behavioral analysts concluded she was most likely the victim of an 'emotion-based' homicide at the hands of her mother.  Also possible, but less likely, they said, was that she had been the victim of a neighbor. The analysts noted numerous 'discrepancies' in Patterson's and Bourgeois's statements to law enforcement, friends, and the media.

The two leading theories both conclude that Alexis is likely dead, but her remains have never been found. No one has ever confessed to taking her, let alone killing her. And there is little physical evidence to support either theory.""

""She was teaching an early morning yoga class at a church, and her killer, who remains unknown, was caught walking around on camera in SWAT gear before murdering her. Very disturbing!""

According to CBS News, ""Her suspected assailant was also seen on surveillance video walking the hallways of the church early that morning, using a hammer to break windows, while wearing a helmet and tactical gear. Bevers' wounds were 'consistent with tools the suspect was carrying throughout the building,' documents said. The mother of three died of multiple puncture wounds to her head and her chest."" 

""We are about the same age and I remember being so confused as to why my parents were following her story so much on 20/20 and Dateline. Then when I watched stuff about her as an adult there's just too much stuff that went wrong and so much stuff that didn't make any sense.""

JonBenét Ramsey was a 6-year-old girl who was killed in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado on Dec. 25 or 26, 1996. Her death was attributed to a skull fracture from a blow to the head and strangulation by a garrote that was found around her neck. The case became a media circus, largely in part because Ramsey was a child beauty pageant contestant and it received constant coverage from around the world. It is still considered a cold case.

""Within the span of four hours, he was abducted from his front yard, and his body was found near a local river. There's a Netflix documentary called Who Killed Little Gregory? about it.

According to BBC News, ""Hours before the boy was discovered, his hands and feet tied, his uncle said he had received a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped him. The following day, the child's parents received a letter that said: 'Your son is dead, I have been avenged.' 

The next month, a cousin of the boy's father, Bernard Laroche, was arrested when his sister-in-law, Muriel Bolle, testified against him. He was released in 1985 when she retracted her statement, but shot dead by Jean-Marie Villemin, the boy's father, weeks later.

The father went to jail for Laroche's murder for several years. The boy's mother, Christine Villemin, was also jailed for her son's murder but later cleared. Both were later given compensation by the state for miscarriage of justice.

The case was reopened first in 2000 and then again in 2008 in an attempt to identify the DNA on the letters. Three separate traces of DNA were found but not identified.""

Nine-year-old Degree was living in Shelby, North Carolina, when she went missing on Feb. 14, 2000. She left her home early that morning with her backpack, sometime between 2:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., and walked along a nearby highway where several motorists reportedly saw her. Apparently, one person even went back to check on her and said she'd disappeared into the woods. 

Despite years of searching, finding her backpack was the only major clue until recent developments tied a local family to the case through DNA evidence and text messages. However, no arrests have been made and Asha remains missing.

Ebby Steppach was an 18-year-old high school student who disappeared under strange circumstances in Little Rock, Arkansas in October 2015. As mentioned above, her body was found nearly three years later, not far from where her car had initially been found.

According to Ebby's family, as revealed in a 2022 Dr. Phil episode, the Little Rock Police Department allegedly claims that Ebby died by suicide, which her family disagrees with. On the same program, Ebby's boyfriend revealed that he believes Ebby had been involved in a ""terrible accident"" with some of her friends.

William Tyrrell vanished in 2014 while playing at his foster grandmother's home in Kendall, NSW, Australia. Despite a massive search and a $1 million reward, he has never been found. Police now suspect he may have died in an accident at the foster home, though his foster mother, who has never been charged, denies involvement.As of 2025, the case remains unsolved, but a coronial inquest is nearing its conclusion. New claims from a podcast suggest convicted child offender Frank Abbott confessed to knowing where William is buried, prompting calls for a reinvestigation.

Billy Smolinski disappeared from Waterbury, Connecticut, on Aug. 24, 2004. His home on Holly Street was the last place he was ever seen, and he left behind his truck, keys, wallet, and dog Harley. However, the search was apparently ""hampered"" by a lack of coordination between police agencies, and according to NBC News, Billy's family said they were ""victimized [...] by a system that didn't allow them to participate in the search.""

As a result, Billy's parents lobbied Congress for ""Billy's Law"" for over a decade, which finally passed in 2022. ""Billy's Law"" will essentially work to try and match up missing-person cases with unidentified bodies. You can learn more about it here.

In July 2011, Rebecca Zahau was found dead, naked, gagged, and bound, hanging from a balcony at her boyfriend Jonah Shacknai's Coronado mansion. She had been found like this just two days after his six-year-old son, Max, was critically injured in a fall under her care. Authorities ruled Zahau's death a suicide, but her family has long argued it was murder, pointing to the unusual bindings and a cryptic message painted on a door in the home.

In 2018, a civil jury found Jonah's brother Adam Shacknai liable for her wrongful death, though the case was later settled and the judgment vacated. Despite multiple re-examinations upholding suicide as the official cause, Zahau's family continues to push for the case to be reopened.

The ""Frog Boys"" were a group of five boys who disappeared while out trying to catch frogs in the outskirts of Daegu, South Korea in 1991. Although the case received a lot of media attention, and a large search was conducted by police and the military, the boys were not immediately found. However, in 2002, the remains of the boys were finally discovered. Although authorities believe the boys were likely murdered (three of the boys had signs of blunt force trauma to their heads), what exactly happened has never been solved.

Sisters Diamond and Tionda Bradley were 3 and 10 years old when they went missing in July 2001 in Chicago, Illinois. When their mother returned home, instead of finding her children there, she found a note on the back of the couch that had allegedly been written by Tionda saying she and Diamond ""had gone to the store and to a school playground nearby.""

According to NBC News, ""But there was something off about the note. Family members told Dateline the spelling and grammar seemed too perfect and advanced for a girl Tionda's age. They added it was also not like Tionda to leave a note — instead, she would have just called her mother.""

In May 2023, a woman came forward claiming to be Diamond. According to the girls' great aunt, Sheliah Bradley-Smith, the woman in question has since turned in a cheek swab and fingerprints to the FBI.

""She was a nun who worked as a teacher at an all-girls catholic school in the 1960s. She went to a shopping center to buy her sister a wedding gift and disappeared. Her car was found the next day parked across the street from her apartment and was covered in mud. Months later, her body was found in the woods.

There were very few leads until decades later when one of her former students came forward claiming a priest, who was the school principal at the time, had taken her to the woods and shown her Cathy's body. He told her, 'That's what happens when you say bad things about people' because shortly before her disappearance, the student had confided in Cathy that the priest had been sexually abusing her. A lot of other former students have since come forward claiming to have been sexually abused by the same priest. He has since died, and the case is still open. 

Netflix has a docuseries about it called The Keepers. It's a case that still upsets me because there seems to have been many other people involved in the abuse and possibly Cathy's murder, and as usual, the church was very aware of how dangerous this priest was and covered it up for decades.""

Johnny Gosch was one of the first children to appear on the ""missing children"" milk cartons. He was a 12-year-old from West Des Moines, Iowa, who disappeared early in the morning on Sept. 5, 1982, while delivering newspapers. Witnesses reported seeing Johnny talking to a man in a car and possibly being followed, but no one knew exactly what happened. After Johnny's parents received calls from customers complaining they hadn't received their papers, his father combed the route. What he found was Johnny's wagon, full of newspapers, but no Johnny. Initially, the police didn't treat the case as a kidnapping, so the investigation started late. 

No arrests were ever made, and there was never any conclusive evidence found. Johnny's mother, Noreen, believed he was taken by a trafficking ring and spent years searching for him. She claims Johnny visited her briefly in secret as an adult in 1997, but this has never been confirmed. Although there have been many theories and reported sightings over the years, the case remains unsolved to this day.

D.B. Cooper is the pseudonym of an unidentified man who hijacked a plane on Nov. 24, 1971. After the hijacker demanded four parachutes and $200,000, the flight landed in Seattle. There, the flight's passengers were exchanged for the ransom money and parachutes. The flight then took off again and headed for Mexico City. But somewhere between Seattle and Reno, the hijacker jumped out of the plane with a parachute and the money. The hijacker has not been found to this day. However, there are many theories about who he was. (Side note: The hijacker bought his plane ticket under the name ""Dan Cooper,"" and after a misunderstanding, people/the media thought it was ""D.B. Cooper"" and the wrong fake name has stuck ever since.)

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

According to the Global Sanctions Database, the United States, European Union, and UN have sanctioned 25% of the countries in the world. The United States by itself sanctioned 40% of these countries, sanctions that are unilateral because they do not have the assent of a UN Security Council resolution. In the 1960s, only 8% of the world's countries were under sanctions. This inflation of sanctions demonstrates that it has become normal for the powerful North Atlantic states to wage wars without having to fire a bullet. As US President Woodrow Wilson said in 1919 at the formation of the League of Nations, sanctions are ‘something more tremendous than war'. The cruellest formulation of Wilson's statement was made by Madeleine Albright, then the US ambassador to the UN, regarding the US sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s. From 1990 to 1996, sanctions ... resulted in the excess deaths of over 500,000 children under the age of five. The number of people who die because of sanctions is greater than the number of battle-related casualties (106,000 deaths per year) ‘and similar to some estimates in the total death toll of wars including civilian casualties (around half a million deaths per year)'. The most vulnerable population groups, as you would expect, are children under five and older people. Deaths of children under five years ‘represented 51% of total deaths caused by sanctions over the 1970–2021 period'.

Note: The above article is largely based on an article published in The Lancet titled ""Effects of international sanctions on age-specific mortality: a cross-national panel data analysis.""

Beginning in 2004, the CIA established a vast network of at least 885 websites, ranging from Johnny Carson and Star Wars fan pages to online message boards about Rastafari. Spanning 29 languages and targeting at least 36 countries directly, these websites were aimed not only at adversaries such as China, Venezuela, and Russia, but also at allied nations ... showing that the United States treats its friends much like its foes. These websites served as cover for informants, offering some level of plausible deniability if casually examined. Few of these pages provided any unique content and simply rehosted news and blogs from elsewhere. Informants in enemy nations, such as Venezuela, used sites like Noticias-Caracas and El Correo De Noticias to communicate with Langley, while Russian moles used My Online Game Source and TodaysNewsAndWeather-Ru.com, and other similar platforms. In 2010, USAID—a CIA front organization—secretly created the Cuban social media app, Zunzuneo. While the 885 fake websites were not established to influence public opinion, today, the U.S. government sponsors thousands of journalists worldwide for precisely this purpose. The Trump administration's decision to pause funding to USAID inadvertently exposed a network of more than 6,200 reporters working at nearly 1,000 news outlets or journalism organizations who were all quietly paid to promote pro-U.S. messaging in their countries. Facebook has hired dozens of former CIA officials to run its most sensitive operations. As the platform's senior misinformation manager, [Aaron Berman] ultimately has the final say over what content is promoted and what is demoted or deleted from Facebook. Until 2019, Berman was a high-ranking CIA officer, responsible for writing the president's daily security brief.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Clinton asked Putin to help hunt Bin Laden","https://www.rt.com/news/623474-declassified-minutes-clinton-putin-joint-fight-terrorism/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 17:34:00 GMT","

Former US President Bill Clinton proposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin a joint US-Russian effort against international terrorism, according to recently declassified records of their first summit.

The transcript for the exchange, which took place at the Kremlin on June 4, 2000, was released on Thursday following a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by the National Security Archive, an independent research institute at George Washington University.

According to the minutes, Clinton asked Putin, “What about anti-terrorism cooperation between our countries, particularly against Usama bin Laden?” He then proposed a “coordinated strategy” between Washington and Moscow.

“We ought to get our people together to develop a comprehensive approach to dealing with [then-Al-Qaeda leader] bin Laden,” Clinton is quoted as stating.

At the time, newly elected President Putin was confronting an Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus. He reportedly said a “common front is necessary” to counter what he called a “Terrorist International.”

The leaders also discussed the prospect of Russia joining NATO, with Clinton acknowledging that the military bloc's eastward expansion was perceived as a “problem” by many in Moscow.

“There should be full-scale relations between Russia and NATO,” Putin is quoted as saying.

After the 9/11 attacks, Washington and Moscow began close cooperation against radical Islamists, establishing several joint task forces.

However, as the US shifted toward unilateral military interventions, Russia grew increasingly wary. Moscow condemned the 2003 US-led Iraq invasion, viewing it as a violation of international law and a troubling precedent of fabricated pretexts for the use of force.

Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow's willingness to collaborate “with all countries that do not apply double standards” in the fight against terrorism.

In recent years, the US reduced cooperation with Russia to a bare minimum as relations deteriorated, especially after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022.

Since President Donald Trump assumed office in January, however, Washington and Moscow have started discussions on ways to revive bilateral relations. In several phone calls and at the summit in Alaska earlier this month, Trump and Putin discussed areas for potential economic and energy cooperation.

The prominent religious order postponed the ordination of Donald B Dickerson, but ultimately allowed his promotion

A version of this story was first reported and published by National Catholic Reporter

Numerous officials within the Roman Catholic religious order known as the Jesuits struggled in the 1970s and 1980s over how to deal with a man whom they knew molested children – but nonetheless was ordained a priest, according to a review of internal correspondence concerning his career.

The correspondence about the late Donald B Dickerson stems from a pending Louisiana state court lawsuit filed in June 2024 that alleges he raped a 17-year-old student at the order-run Loyola University New Orleans in 1984. It provides a rare, complex, behind-the-scenes look at how local leaders during a much earlier phase of the worldwide Catholic church's ongoing clergy molestation scandal struggled to contain a predator priest's repeated abuse of children while encouraging him to seek psychological help.

Born in 1936 in Jerseyville, Illinois, Dickerson entered the Society of Jesus in Louisiana in August 1971 and professed his first vows two years later, a day before he turned 37, court documents show.

Jesuits undergo a years-long formation period that begins with a two-year novitiate and concludes after ordination with the final vows, a process that can take 15 to 20 years. While Jesuits are not priests until ordination, they begin using the initials “SJ”, for the Society of Jesus, upon entering the order.

Early in his formation, Dickerson was assigned to the Jesuit high school in New Orleans, where letters say he abused two boys. In early December 1974, he molested a minor in a car en route to a high school awards ceremony, according to court documents.

In 1974, Jesuit priest Anthony McGinn – who would later serve as the New Orleans high school's president – described Dickerson as lazy and manipulative.

“He does whatever he pleases,” McGinn wrote in a character appraisal that is now an exhibit in the court case, which seeks damages from Loyola and the Jesuit order. “This is a dangerous sign that the Society will have difficulties with him in future years.”

Dickerson should not be advanced to theology, the next level in formation, concluded McGinn, who did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the negative appraisal, Dickerson went to theology instruction in Chicago.

In March 1975, during a six-hour meeting attended by multiple priests and a brother at the Jesuit provincials' office to discuss several clergy, Jesuit priest Louis Lambert, the vice-provincial for formation and a top Jesuit in the region, held that Dickerson “was making great progress in working through his problems” – and that a recent psychological report on him was “positive”. At that meeting, four priests voted to send Dickerson to theology despite McGinn's warnings.

By 1977, concerns from high-ranking Jesuit priest Thomas Stahel had reached a crisis point. The provincial of the Jesuits' former New Orleans province, Stahel had learned of yet another accusation that Dickerson had harassed a minor. Five days before Christmas that year, the provincial, who would later serve as executive editor at America magazine, detailed specific misgivings about Dickerson in a lengthy letter to the Jesuits' worldwide leader at the time, superior general Pedro Arrupe.

“I do not think we can in conscience present Dickerson to bishop as ready for ordination,” Stahel wrote to Arrupe, one week before Dickerson was to be made a priest. “I recommend that Dickerson's ordination be postponed, at the very least, and that we raise with him a question about his staying in the Society.”

According to the letter, Arrupe had already agreed that Dickerson's ordination should be postponed.

It is unclear whether Arrupe responded to this letter. National Catholic Reporter has not obtained other documents detailing a back-and-forth conversation between the superior general and the New Orleans provincial.

Stahel wrote that he first contacted Arrupe to help resolve a debate with Lambert regarding how to handle Dickerson.

Αccording to a 1977 letter, Dickerson's Jesuit superiors believed that his “psychosexual problem was under sufficient control”.

Yet Stahel, who details serious concerns regarding Dickerson's “suitability” for the priesthood, found himself at an impasse with Lambert. “He thinks Dickerson is no more a risk than others who have been ordained, and he characterizes the recent incident as a regrettable slip. I am unpersuaded by his reasons,” Stahel wrote to the superior general.

“I have the distinct impression that Fr [Father] Lambert's resistance in this matter had to do, not with the merits of his case, but with the jealous guard he maintains over his Vice-Provincial's prerogatives,” Stahel wrote. “He was determined that I should have nothing to say about Dickerson's ordination, and it was impossible to come to a meeting of the minds concerning evidence that seemed overwhelming to everyone but him.”

Describing the disagreement, Stahel alleged that Lambert considered Dickerson's improper behavior to be the result of nerves – and rejected Arrupe's move to postpone ordination as unjust “strong-arm tactics”.

Lambert, Stahel said, “argued that, once a man is approved for ordination by the Society (as Dickerson had been), the Society is committed to him. By this kind of reasoning, nothing a person could do between approval and ordination could disqualify him.”

In September 1978, Arrupe said in a letter to Lambert that he had received a psychological report on Dickerson, but the details of that report were not readily available. “I will await further information on the case from Father Stahel,” wrote the superior general.

Dickerson had received psychological treatment at least twice by then – in 1975 and 1978. He later noted that he had submitted to “extensive psychological therapy” at Foundation House, a former treatment facility for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico.

Dickerson had still not been ordained by the summer of 1979, when Stahel said Dickerson had told him that sexually harassing an underage boy was “a relatively insignificant incident”.

The provincial disagreed.

“I did not feel that I could ordain him until we had removed as much as possible any worries that such incidents would happen again,” Stahel wrote.

But Stahel's worries about Dickerson had apparently subsided by the end of that year, after Dickerson understood the “scandal” molesting children could cause. “I said that I thought he should be ordained,” Stahel wrote in a memorandum dated 30 December 1979. Six months later, on 7 June 1980, Dickerson was ordained by Birmingham, Alabama, bishop Joseph Vath.

Dickerson began teaching at the boys Jesuit preparatory school in Dallas that same year. But in 1981, he was removed from Jesuit Dallas following an allegation from a child's parents. He was sent in September 1981 to St John Berchmans, then a co-cathedral in Shreveport, Louisiana.

A $12m lawsuit would later accuse Dickerson of raping a boy there in 1982.

That year, Stahel had written to Dickerson with the hope “nothing would happen in Shreveport”. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.

Two years later, in an August 1984 letter to Dickerson, Jesuit priest Edmundo Rodriguez, the new provincial in New Orleans, noted that he had “a duty to protect the Society and the Church from unacceptable behavior of its members”.

A 1984 psychological profile of Dickerson written by the Servants of the Paraclete, the men's order that treated troubled priests, described him as “very sick” and in need of intensive, long-term treatment. During Dickerson's evaluation, he said that he had been molested by a man at age six, according to clinical notes included in the most recent New Orleans lawsuit.

In September 1984, a mother wrote a letter to the bishop of Alexandria-Shreveport that alleged that Dickerson had molested her son.

“Recently he was rejected by his natural father,” the woman said of her son. “Instead of help from Fr Dickerson, he has been mentally damaged even further.” She added that Dickerson should never work near children again.

Court documents show that Jesuit priest Thomas Barberito had spoken in August 1984 with the bishop about “the situation with Fr Dickerson”. According to Barberito, the bishop said he would refer concerns to the provincial if one of the parties involved contacted his office.

Dickerson's Jesuit superiors assigned him to Loyola University New Orleans in 1985. There, the New Orleans lawsuit alleges, he abused another minor. Yet Dickerson maintained the support of his direct superior even while facing an investigation.

“Don has to be given the benefit of the doubt,” Rodriguez wrote in a communication dated 28 February 1986. “We owe Don the same careful due process which we would want to provide for anyone else.”

But in early March 1986, after Rodriguez received three separate allegations against Dickerson in one week, the provincial encouraged him to leave the priesthood “to save everyone from a very painful process”.

Dickerson complied, thanking the provincial for his “willingness to suspend judgment on the question of moral culpability and to acknowledge my genuine efforts to overcome my tendencies”. On 12 March 1986, Rodriguez wrote that he had contacted Jesuit priest Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then the order's superior general, requesting that Dickerson be dismissed from the society and priestly life.

Since his laicization, Dickerson has been at the center of multiple lawsuits beyond the recent New Orleans case. It is unclear whether he ever faced criminal charges for accusations of sexual abuse of minors.

In 2009, a case was settled after he was accused of molesting an eighth grade boy. Dickerson was accused in 2010, in the aforementioned $12m lawsuit, of raping an 11-year-old boy at St John Berchmans in 1982. And a former Jesuit Dallas student sued the school in 2019, alleging Dickerson gave him alcohol and raped him during a trip to Alabama decades prior.

During his 18 years as Jesuit superior general, Arrupe emerged as a widely respected leader, beloved by the men's religious community at the time of his resignation in 1983, two years after a disabling stroke. He was known for having ministered to survivors of the US's atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the end of the second world war.

Arrupe's cause for canonization, which opened in Rome in 2019, remains active. Attorneys Richard Trahant, John Denenea and Soren Giselson, who represent the plaintiff in the New Orleans lawsuit centering on Dickerson, argue Arrupe should not be considered for sainthood.

While Arrupe, as superior general, could have stopped Dickerson's ordination, biographies and statements from Arrupe show that he opposed an authoritarian style of leadership of the Jesuit order. If local Jesuit officials decided to ordain Dickerson, it is unclear whether Arrupe would have stepped in to stop it – or if he had all the facts supporting such a decision.

Dawn Eden Goldstein, an author and canon lawyer, said it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to say the way the Jesuits handled the Dickerson case was a coverup or willful negligence. “At this point, we don't know whether this might rather be a case of superiors following the accepted procedures of that time,” she said. But, she added, that explanation does not justify their actions.

The Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and it's unclear whether other records about Dickerson are in the Jesuits' files in Rome. McGinn is the only Jesuit official in this story who is still alive.

The lawsuit was ongoing as of the weekend of 22 August.

Others refuse to leave as aircraft and tanks bomb outskirts of city where about half of Gaza's 2m people now live

Israeli aircraft and tanks have pounded the eastern and northern outskirts of Gaza City, destroying buildings and homes, as Israeli leaders vowed to press on with an expanded large-scale offensive on the city.

Witnesses reported the sound of continuous explosions overnight from Saturday night into Sunday morning in the areas of Zeitoun and Shejaia. Meanwhile, tanks shelled houses and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown up in the northern area of Jabaliya.

Fire lit the skies from the direction of the explosions, causing panic and prompting some families to stream out of the city. Other residents said they would prefer to die and not leave.

About half of Gaza's roughly 2 million people currently live in Gaza City. A few thousand have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws.

“I stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave my home in Gaza City,” Mohammad, 40, told Reuters. “No place is safe, but I can't take the risk. If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy fire.”

Others said they would not leave, despite the explosions. “We are not leaving, let them bomb us at home,” said Aya, 31, who had a family of eight, adding that they could not afford to buy a tent or pay for the transportation, even if they did try to leave. “We are hungry, afraid and don't have money.”

Israel approved a plan earlier this month for an expanded military offensive to seize control of Gaza City. It is not expected to move forces into the largely destroyed city centre for a few weeks, leaving room for mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to resume ceasefire talks.

Still, Israeli forces have bombed the city and surrounding areas, and said on Sunday that forces had returned to combat in the Jabaliya area in recent days.

Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. On Friday, Katz said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas militants agreed to end the war on Israel's terms and release all the hostages it still holds.

Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel's plan to take over Gaza City showed it was not serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was “the only way to return the hostages”, holding the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, responsible for their lives.

UN-backed experts declared on Friday that an “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza's largest city and its surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten increasing deaths across the devastated territory.

“This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading … If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”

On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people had died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war started.

Israel is fighting allegations at the world's top court of committing genocide in Gaza, where it has killed more than 60,000 people. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but later withdrew it after he was killed.

The Associated Press reported that Israeli forces had killed four people seeking food aid on Sunday as they travelled through a military zone south of Gaza City – an area regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point.

Al-Awda hospital and two witnesses told the Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed US contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of metres away from the site, the witnesses said.

“The gunfire was indiscriminate,” Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, told Associated Press, adding that while many had fled, some people fell to the ground after being shot.

Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another Palestinian seeking food among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.

The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins ‘Fox & Friends' to break down the latest Russian strike in Ukraine and what it means for potential peace negotiations.

Russia's top nuclear official this week said Moscow is facing ""colossal threats"" and needs to update its nuclear capabilities.

Without directly naming where Russia's chief nuclear threat is coming from, Director General of the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom Alexei Likhachev said, ""the current geopolitical situation, is a time of colossal threats to the existence of our country.""

""Therefore, the nuclear shield, which is also a sword, is a guarantee of our sovereignty,"" he added, according to Russian state news agency RIA. ""We understand today that the nuclear shield must only be improved in the coming years.""

RUSSIA AND CHINA TICK DOOMSDAY CLOCK TOWARD MIDNIGHT AS HIROSHIMA BOMBING HITS 80 YEARS

The comments came less than a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump convened for a face-to-face meeting that marked the first time a U.S. leader has met with the Kremlin chief since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. 

While Trump and Putin appeared positive following the talks, little seemed to have been concretely accomplished in the meeting and hope surrounding a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appeared to decline as the week progressed. 

It is unclear why Likhachev issued comments regarding Russia's nuclear program at this time, and he did not detail what sort of updates he would be looking to make to Moscow's ""shield"" program. 

Trump issued similar comments earlier this year when in May he announced his plans to develop the ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system — inspired by Israel's ""Iron Dome"" defense system — and which is expected to cost at least $175 billion.

Though security experts have been sounding the alarm when it comes to China's escalating nuclear development, together Russia and the U.S. continue to possess 90% of the world's nuclear arsenal.

Moscow continues to hold nearly 4,400 nuclear warheads, over 1,500 of which are ""strategically deployed"" while the U.S. possesses more than 3,700 warheads in its stockpiles with 1,400 deployed, according to the Arms Control Association. 

While nuclear disarmament was the standing international goal following the end of the Cold War, the trajectory of this policy remains dubious as relations between Washington and Moscow have once again turned precarious amid Putin's war in Ukraine, and his burgeoning relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

The New Start Treaty remains the only bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia, and though it was extended in 2021, it is set to expire in February 2026. The future of the treaty – first signed in 2010 – also remains unclear as Moscow paused its participation in the agreement in 2023.

Putin said that this suspension meant he would continue to abide by stockpile limits under the treaty, but he would not allow for continued U.S. inspections. 

Fox News Digital could not immediately reach the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for comment as nations increasingly look to expand their nuclear capabilities just six months ahead of when the New Start Treaty is set to expire.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Sunday said that while Russia is prepared to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to further progress peace talks, it questions his legitimacy.

When asked by NBC News host Kristen Welker whether Russia views Zelensky as the “legitimate leader” of Ukraine, Lavrov called Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s Ukrainian counterpart a “de facto head of the regime.”

“We recognize him as de facto head of the regime. And in this capacity, we are ready to meet with him,” Lavrov said on Meet the Press in a recorded interview that aired Sunday morning.

“When you come to a stage, when you have to sign documents, we would need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate,” he added. “And according to the Ukrainian Constitution, Mr. Zelensky is not at the moment.”

Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly insisted that Zelensky, despite being democratically elected, is not a legitimate president because his five-year term expired in May 2024. However, Zelensky continues to serve because the Ukrainian Constitution delays all elections while the country remains under martial law, which has been the case since the start of the war in February 2022.

Russia argues Zelensky lacks legal standing to sign any agreements because he has stayed in office for too long.

Despite the accusations, the Ukrainian parliament affirmed Zelensky's legitimacy earlier this year.

The Russian foreign minister's statement comes as both sides pursue peace talks mediated by the United States. After Zelensky and Putin separately met with President Donald Trump, Trump said he was attempting to arrange a face-to-face meeting between them.

While Trump hopes a Zelensky-Putin bilateral summit will happen without his direct participation, Lavrov said there is no plans for such a meeting at this time.

“There is no meeting planned. And I'm not challenging this, but you cannot, I think, understand what I am saying,” he told Welker. “Putin is ready to meet with Zelensky when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all.”

Lavrov continued to allege that Ukraine is obstructing the peace talks with its leaders' strong rhetoric amid the war.

Ukraine is expected to provide some territorial concessions in order to reach peace with Russia, but so far, Zelensky has not been receptive to the idea.

RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS ‘NO MEETING PLANNED' BETWEEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKY DESPITE WHITE HOUSE HOPES

“Zelensky said no to everything,” Lavrov said. “How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?”

Meanwhile, Zelensky is actively seeking NATO-like security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression. The agreement would be a substitute for Ukraine's NATO membership, which Russia has strongly opposed. Security guarantees was a major topic discussed between Zelensky, Trump, and European leaders at the White House last week.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Whether you decide to walk instead or you're trying to ride in a Waymo, you might need to cancel an Uber ride someday.

If you do, there's no evidence that it will hurt your rating on the app as a ride-hailing passenger. You can often avoid a cancellation fee as well — if you cancel at the right time.

Nate Galesic, an Uber rider in Atlanta, said he frequently cancels rides once he sees that he's been matched with a human driver. He has used the method to improve his chance of being matched with one of the Waymo driverless cars that Uber has been using in the city since June.

Each time he cancels, Galesic said, he gets a refund from Uber immediately. ""If you cancel the ride right away, you don't have to pay,"" he said. He also hasn't noticed any hit to his rating because of all the cancellations, he told Business Insider.

There's only one downside to all those canceled rides: A few times, Galesic said, Uber has blocked his ability to request rides for between 20 and 30 minutes after he canceled several rides in a row. He's always been able to request more rides after that period is up, he added.

Uber did not respond to questions about its policy on canceling rides from Business Insider.

On its website, Uber does not say if canceling too many rides can affect a user's rating. It does say, however, that drivers and riders have the chance to rate each other after a trip ends — meaning that the driver of your canceled ride might never have a chance to rate you.

Uber might charge you a fee for canceling your trip after the app has matched you with a driver, though it depends on the circumstances under which you make the cancellation.

For economy rides, such as UberX, UberXL, and Comfort, Uber allows riders to cancel a trip for free within two minutes of matching with a driver. The cutoff for premium rides, such as Black and Premier, is five minutes.

""In some cases, your cancellation fees will be based on how far the driver has already driven, how long it took the driver to arrive at your pickup location, and the time your driver has been waiting,"" Uber says on its website. ""These fees pay earners for the time and effort they spend getting to your location.""

President Donald Trump's attack on solar and wind projects threatens to raise energy prices for consumers and undermine a stretched electric grid that's already straining to meet rapidly growing demand, renewable energy executives warn.

Trump has long said wind power turbines are unattractive and endanger birds, and that solar installations take up too much land. This week, he said his administration will not approve solar and wind projects, the latest salvo in a campaign the president has waged against the renewable energy industry since taking office.

""We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. ""The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!""

Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum took control of all permit approvals last month in a move that the American Clean Power Association criticized as ""obstruction,"" calling it ""unprecedented political review.""

The Interior Department blocking permits would slow the growth of the entire solar and wind industry, top executives at renewable developers Arevon, Avantus and Engie North America told CNBC.

Even solar and wind projects on private land may need approvals from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if, for example, a waterway or animal species is affected, the executives told CNBC. The three power companies are among the top 10 renewable developers in the U.S., according to energy research firm Enverus.

The Interior Department ""will not give preferential treatment to massive, unreliable projects that make no sense for the American people or that risk harming communities or the environment,"" a spokesperson told CNBC when asked if new permits would be issued for solar and wind construction.

Choking off renewables will worsen a looming power supply shortage, harm the electric grid and lead to higher electricity prices for consumers, said Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, that's active in 17 states. Arevon operates five gigawatts of power equivalent to $10 billion of capital investment.

""I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be,"" Smith said. ""We're making that crunch more and more difficult with these policy changes.""

The red tape at the Interior Department and rising costs from Trump's copper and steel tariffs have created market instability that makes planning difficult, the renewable executives said.

""We don't want to sign contracts until we know what the playing field is,"" said Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in San Diego. Avantus has built three gigawatts of solar and storage across the desert Southwest.

""I can do whatever you want me to do and have a viable business, I just need the rules set and in place,"" Graham said.

Engie North America, the U.S. arm of a global energy company based in Paris, is slashing its planned investment in the U.S. by 50% due to tariffs and regulatory uncertainty, said David Carroll, the chief renewables officer who leads the American subsidiary. Engie could cut its plans even more, he said.

Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end.

Multinationals like Engie have long viewed the U.S. as one of the most stable business environments in the world, Carroll said. But that assessment is changing in Engie's boardroom and across the industry, he said.

""The stability of the U.S. business market is no longer really the gold standard,"" Carroll said.

Arevon is seeing costs for solar and battery storage projects increase by as much as 30% due to the metal tariffs, said Smith, the CEO. Many renewable developers are renegotiating power prices with utilities to cover the sudden spike in costs because projects no longer pencil out financially, he said.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends two key tax credits for solar and wind projects in late 2027, making conditions even more challenging. The investment tax credit supported new renewable construction and the production credit boosted clean electricity generation.

Those tax credits were just passed on to consumers, Smith said. Their termination and the rising costs from tariffs will mean higher utility bills for families and businesses, he said.

The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham. Prices will surge again to around $100 per megawatt-hour when the tax credits are gone, he said.

""The small manufacturers, small companies and mom and pops will see their electric bills go up, and it'll start pushing the small entrepreneurs out of the industry or out of the marketplace,"" Graham said.

Renewable projects that start construction by next July, a year after the One Big Beautiful Act became law, will still qualify for the tax credits. Arevon, Avantus and Engie are moving forward with projects currently under construction, but the outlook is less certain for projects later in the decade.

The U.S. will see a big downturn in new renewable power generation starting in the second half of 2026 through 2028 as new projects no longer qualify for tax credits, said Smith, the head of Arevon.

""The small- and medium-sized players that can't take the financial risk, some of them will disappear,"" Smith said. ""You're going to see less projects built in the sector.""

Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said. Electricity demand is surging from the data centers that technology companies are building to train artificial intelligence systems. PJM Interconnection, the largest electrical grid in the U.S. that coordinates wholesale electricity in 13 states and the District of Columbia, has warned of tight power supplies because too little new generation is coming online.

Renewables are the power source that can most quickly meet demand, Smith at Arevon said. More than 90% of the power waiting to connect to the grid is solar, battery storage or wind, according to data from Enverus.

""The power requirement is largely going to be coming from the new energy sector or not at all,"" so without it, ""the grid becomes substantially hampered,"" Smith said.

Trump is prioritizing oil, gas and nuclear power as ""the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

""President Trump serves the American people who voted to implement his America First energy agenda – not solar and wind executives who are sad that Biden's Green New Scam subsidies are ending,"" Kelly said.

But new natural gas plants won't come online for another five years due to supply issues, new nuclear power is a decade away and no new coal plants are on the drawing board.

Utilities may have to turn away data centers at some point because there isn't enough surplus power to run them, and no one wants to risk blackouts at hospitals, schools and homes, Arevon's Smith said. This would pressure the U.S. in its race against China to master AI, a Trump administration priority.

""The panic in the data center, AI world is probably not going to set in for another 12 months or so, when they start realizing that they can't get the power they need in some of these areas where they're planning to build data centers,"" Smith said.

""Then we'll see what happens,"" said the University of Chicago MBA, who's worked in the energy industry for 35 years. ""There may be a reversal in policy to try and build whatever we can and get power onto the grid.""

From American Eagle to Swatch, brands appear to be making a lot of blunders lately.

When actress Sydney Sweeney's jeans campaign came out last month, critics lambasted the wordplay of good ""jeans"" and ""genes"" as tone deaf with nefarious undertones.

More recently, an advert from Swiss watchmaker Swatch sparked backlash for featuring an Asian model pulling the corners of his eyes, in an offensive gesture.

Colgate-Palmolive's ad for Sanex shower gel was banned in the U.K. for problematic suggestions about Black and white skin tones. And consumers derided Cracker Barrel's decision to ditch its overalls-clad character for a more simplistic text-based logo as ""sterile,"" ""soulless,"" and ""woke.""

Meanwhile, recent product launches from Adidas and Prada have raised allegations of cultural appropriation.

That has reignited the debate about when an ad campaign is effective and when it's just plain offensive, as companies confront increased consumer scrutiny.

""Each brand had its own blind spot,"" David Brier, brand specialist and author of ""Brand intervention"" and ""Rich brand, poor brand"" told CNBC via email.

He noted, however, that too many brands are attempting to respond to consumers with an outdated playbook.

""Modern brands are trying to navigate cultural complexity with corporate simplicity. They're using 1950s boardroom thinking to solve 2025 human problems,"" he continued.

""These aren't sensitivity failures. They're empathy failures. They viewed culture as something to navigate around rather than understand deeply.""

Some companies have had success in tapping into the zeitgeist — and, in some cases, seizing on other brands' shortcomings.

Gap, for instance, this week sought to counter backlash against Sweeney's advertisement with a campaign in which pop group Katseye lead a diverse group of dancers performing in denim against a white backdrop.

Brier said companies should consider how they can genuinely connect with consumers and be representative, rather than simply trying to avoid offense.

""No brand can afford to fake understanding. No brand can 'committee its way' to connection. No brand can focus-group its way to authenticity. In 2025, customers can smell the difference from a mile away,"" he added.

Nevertheless, ads are meant to spark conversation, and at a time when grabbing and maintaining consumers' attention — and share of wallet — is increasingly difficult, brands have a fine balance to tread.

""Brands live and die by standing out and grabbing attention. On top of that, iconic and culturally relevant brands want to stand for something and be recognized for it. Those are tough asks,"" Jonathan A.J. Wilson, professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London.

In an age of social media and with ever more divided public opinions, landing one universal message can be difficult, Wilson noted. For as long as that remains the case, some brands may still see value in taking a calculated risk.

""It's hard to land one universal message, and even if you try and tailor your message to various groups, others are watching,"" he said.

""Controversy grabs attention and puts you at the front of people's minds. It splits crowds and forces people to have a decision when otherwise they probably wouldn't care. That can lead to disproportionate publicity, which could be converted into sales.""

Investment firm VanEck has reaffirmed its $180,000 year-end Bitcoin price target despite recent market volatility, as CME basis funding rates surge to 9%, the highest level since February 2025. 

Bitcoin rebounded to $124,000 on August 13 after sliding to $112,000 in early August, setting a new all-time high above July's $123,838.

At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at close to $115K, 8% down from its ATH.Institutional Demand Powers Recovery Despite Volatility Compression

 indicates institutional demand remains robust, with exchange-traded products purchasing 54,000 BTC and Digital Asset Treasuries adding 72,000 BTC in July alone. 

The firm maintains its bullish outlook established initially in November 2024, when Bitcoin traded around $88,000.Source: 

CME basis rates reaching 9% particularly indicate renewed speculative appetite among derivatives traders, matching levels last seen during February's market peak.

Notably, options markets also show strong bullish positioning with call/put ratios rising to 3.21x – the highest since June 2024 – as investors spent $792 million on call premiums.

However, implied volatility compressed to just 32%, well below the 50% one-year average, making options cheaper for potential buyers. Source: 

A 25% out-of-the-money one-year call now costs approximately 6% of the spot price, compared to 18% in late 2024.

Similarly, the report showed that the mining sector posted mixed results despite Bitcoin's gains, with the 13-miner equity index declining 4% excluding Applied Digital's 54% surge. 

U.S.-listed miners now command 31.5% of global Bitcoin hashrate, up from 29% earlier this year, marking a record high for American mining operations.Industry Leaders Split on Million-Dollar Bitcoin Timeline

Earlier this month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the growing chorus of executives predicting Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, aligning with previous forecasts from Jack Dorsey and ARK Invest's Cathie Wood. 

Armstrong cited regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key drivers for the ambitious target.

Similarly, SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald offered a more conservative near-term outlook, projecting Bitcoin could climb to $175,000 by year-end. 

Wald described her forecast as modest compared to other institutional projections, noting major investors like Cathie Wood and Larry Fink have endorsed “astronomically high” targets based on sophisticated models.

While everyone is bullish, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz pushed back against near-term million-dollar predictions, warning such levels would likely reflect U.S. economic collapse rather than crypto success. 

Novogratz argued he would prefer lower Bitcoin prices in a stable economy over extreme valuations driven by a currency crisis.

Similarly, in July, Copper's head of research, Fadi Aboualfa, suggested Bitcoin appears “primed for another significant leg upward” but cautioned that institutional-driven markets may follow a “more tempered path” compared to previous retail-fueled cycles.

🚀"" Bitcoin appears primed for another significant leg upward,"" a top analyst tells Cryptonews — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

Aboualfa projected Bitcoin could breach $140,000 in September and reach $150,000 by early October.

However, seeing this growing institutionally-driven bull market, Preston Pysh of Ego Death Capital has expressed skepticism about Wall Street's growing Bitcoin influence, noting early adopters fear institutional derivatives trading could undermine Bitcoin's safe-haven characteristics. 

Pysh warned that traditional financial players might use Bitcoin differently than the self-custodying individuals who built the network.Market Dynamics Suggest Traditional Cycles Remain Intact

Amid this mixed market speculation, new Glassnode analysis challenges widespread claims that institutional adoption has broken Bitcoin's traditional four-year cycles. 

The analytics firm found current cycle duration and long-term holder profit-taking levels closely mirror previous patterns, contradicting “cycle death” narratives from industry figures.

Glassnode data shows Bitcoin's current cycle has maintained supply above profitable levels for 273 days, making it the second-longest duration on record behind the 2015-2018 cycle's 335 days. Source: 

Long-term holders have realized cumulative profits exceeding all previous cycles except 2016-2017.

Moreover, derivatives markets continue exhibiting elevated risk appetite characteristic of mature bull phases, with Bitcoin futures open interest maintaining $67 billion levels. 

The recent unwinding of $2.3 billion in open interest during corrections ranks among the largest 23 trading days recorded.

Ethereum's derivatives dominance reached critical levels, with perpetual futures volume hitting an all-time high of 67% versus Bitcoin markets. 

However, combined altcoin liquidations peaked at $303 million daily, experiencing twice the volume compared to Bitcoin futures markets.

Market analysts view Bitcoin's recent pullback as strategic repositioning rather than fundamental weakness, with NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef noting the correction followed overextended leverage after reaching new highs above $124,000. 

The technical outlook hinges on Bitcoin holding psychological support between $100,000-$110,000, with structural buying interest intact above this range. 

A decisive break below $112,000 could trigger a deeper retracement toward $110,000 and potentially $105,000.

However, recovery in risk appetite, especially as ETH and BTC reached new ATH, could reignite momentum toward previous ATH and beyond, given continued institutional demand outpacing supply.

MicroStrategy is spearheading a shift in how corporations are embracing Bitcoin. As the financial landscape changes, businesses are considering crypto payroll and treasury management more seriously. Understanding their approach could provide insights for others.

With MicroStrategy leading the charge, more companies are diving into Bitcoin investments. This isn't just a fad; it's a recognition of Bitcoin's potential as a stable, long-term asset. For firms, this means diversifying their portfolios and staking claims in the burgeoning digital asset world.

Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin, dubbing it “digital gold.” Recently, the company has ramped up its Bitcoin acquisitions, now holding 629,376 BTC valued over $72 billion. Their aggressive approach began back in August 2020 with an initial $250 million investment, consistently adding to their reserves through a mix of cash purchases and convertible bonds.

Despite a slower pace in recent purchases, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, a significant marker of their commitment to the asset class.

To sidestep Bitcoin's notorious volatility, companies should look to stablecoins like USDC or USDT for payroll. This would ensure steady, predictable wages, keeping employees happy without the stress of price fluctuations. And yes, this method also aids in regulatory compliance.

With regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies still evolving, ensuring compliance with licensing, AML, and KYC is a must. Consulting with legal experts in the field can help companies navigate the complex landscape.

Managing Bitcoin investments means diversification. Companies should categorize their crypto holdings by purpose—operational and strategic—and forecast cash flows in fiat and crypto. This way, they can maintain liquidity and use stablecoins for immediate needs, reducing reliance on Bitcoin's price.

Securing digital assets is a priority. Strong custody solutions, like hardware wallets and multi-signature wallets, are essential. Companies also need to conduct regular security audits and educate staff on potential crypto scams and phishing.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin endeavors have not just impacted its financial standing but the market as a whole. Their substantial holdings have lent credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate investment, nudging other corporations to consider digital assets. But the correlation between Bitcoin's price and MicroStrategy's stock has added complexity, prompting financial managers to rethink their risk strategies.

The corporate landscape is changing, and with it, the way Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fit into business operations. Companies that adopt best practices in crypto payroll and treasury management can navigate the risks associated with Bitcoin while preparing for future success. MicroStrategy's experience offers valuable insights for any business aiming to adapt in this digital age.

Oops, something went wrong

World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform associated with President Donald Trump‘s family, has publicized the launch of its WLFI token on the Ethereum mainnet.

What Happened: The company confirmed the token's launch on Saturday. Originally a governance-only token, WLFI is now entering open circulation, indicating a significant change in its direction.

The token generation event (TGE) is scheduled for September 1, 2025, with spot trading expected to commence at 12:00 PM UTC. At the time of launch, 20% of WLFI's supply will be transferable, while the remaining supply will be subject to community governance or extended vesting periods.



The decision to make the token tradable was made following a July governance vote by World Liberty Financial, where holders approved the token's transferability.

This move is part of WLFI's broader strategy to stabilize token value through a $1.5 billion crypto-treasury initiative.



The firm is building the treasury through a significant capital injection into ALT5 Sigma, which recently welcomed Eric Trump to its board.

This development has attracted political attention and examination. Following this, WLFI perpetual futures have been launched on Binance.

Whales Market, a decentralized exchange that facilitates the trading of tokens prior to their TGE, indicates that WLFI is trading at a high of $0.42, considerably above its original presale price.

The launch of the WLFI token represents a significant milestone for World Liberty Financial. The introduction of the token into open circulation, following approval from token holders, demonstrates the firm's commitment to decentralization and community governance.

The company's substantial investment into ALT5 Sigma, coupled with the addition of Eric Trump to its board, has drawn significant attention to the platform.

The high trading value of WLFI on Whales Market, even before its official TGE, suggests strong market interest in the token. This could potentially lead to increased adoption and further growth for the platform.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum (ETH-USD) Price Forecast $7,000: Can ETH Break Past $5K Resistance?","https://www.tradingnews.com/news/ethereum-price-forecast-eth-usd-nears-5k-usd-as-bulls-target-7k-usd","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 17:02:45 GMT","

Ethereum (ETH-USD) has exploded higher, touching $4,887 for the first time in four years and pulling within striking distance of the $5,000 threshold. The rally came on the heels of Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech, where the Fed Chair hinted at a September rate cut. Odds for a 25-basis-point reduction have jumped above 90%, igniting a fresh wave of demand for risk assets. Ethereum quickly became the prime beneficiary, gaining more than 11% in a single session and pushing the broader crypto market cap back above $4 trillion. At current levels around $4,829, ETH has posted a 6% weekly gain and is up nearly 43% year-over-year.

Whale activity is confirming the shift in market dynamics. On-chain data shows a major Bitcoin-era wallet liquidated roughly $800 million in BTC and rotated into ETH, a transfer that marks one of the most significant sentiment shifts since 2021. Another whale executed a $90.1 million short bet on Bitcoin while simultaneously entering a $12.75 million long position in ETH. Institutional buyers are following suit: Trump's World Liberty added $5 million of ETH this week, while SharpLinkGaming disclosed a $667 million position. ETH ETFs are also gaining momentum—BlackRock's ETHA alone saw $233 million of inflows on August 21, lifting total ETH ETF assets above $33 billion.

Ethereum is consolidating just under its previous all-time high of $4,884, with technicals suggesting an imminent breakout. The $4,800–$5,000 zone remains the most critical band, acting as psychological resistance and a liquidity magnet. If ETH pushes through, upside targets of $6,000 and $7,000 emerge rapidly. RSI on the daily chart sits at 66.6, below overbought conditions, leaving room for continuation. MACD momentum remains firmly bullish, while Bollinger Bands show widening volatility that typically precedes sharp extensions. On the downside, support sits at $4,400–$4,450, followed by deeper zones near $4,070–$3,900. A failure to defend these levels could trigger a correction, but traders continue to buy dips aggressively.

ETH futures activity is booming, with total notional volumes above $4 trillion in 2025 alone. Futures volume maps show overheating red clusters as ETH retested $4,884, indicating heavy leverage chasing upside. Historically, such positioning has preceded short-term corrections, but it also signals strong speculative appetite that can force liquidations higher if resistance breaks. The long/short ratio remains skewed bullish at 1.7, showing traders are overwhelmingly positioned for continuation.

Beyond the charts, Ethereum is benefiting from structural inflows and ecosystem expansion. Layer 2 platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are driving transaction growth, with L2s now accounting for over 30% of Ethereum's daily activity. Staking continues to attract capital, locking ETH supply and reducing liquid float. Gas fees, while elevated, remain below prior bull cycle extremes thanks to L2 scaling, creating a more sustainable network environment. With ETH's market cap surpassing $500 billion, its eligibility for broader fund inclusion is strengthening, ensuring that institutional adoption continues to deepen.

Ethereum's momentum is diverging from Bitcoin (BTC-USD). While Bitcoin holds around $116,000 after a 3% gain, ETH's relative strength and whale-driven accumulation suggest that capital is rotating into altcoins. Analysts like Ito Shimotsuma point to the total altcoin market cap forming a rare double cup-and-handle pattern, last seen in 2021 before a historic altseason. If ETH clears $5,000, it could act as the trigger for a broader rally in ERC-20 tokens and DeFi projects. Memecoins and low-cap Ethereum-based assets like TOKEN6900 are already attracting presale flows, raising over $2.5 million ahead of launch.

The macro picture remains a central driver. Powell's dovish tilt has markets pricing in aggressive easing, with September cuts now viewed as a near certainty. Thursday's jobless claims and Friday's Core PCE print will be pivotal—soft data could accelerate ETH's surge beyond $5,000. A hotter-than-expected PCE, however, risks delaying Fed action, which could stall ETH's momentum and trigger a pullback toward $4,300. Still, the broader trend remains bullish with global liquidity improving and investors favoring digital assets as hedges against both inflation and currency debasement.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is positioned at a decisive inflection point. A sustained breakout above $5,000 opens a pathway toward $6,200 and possibly $7,000 before year-end, supported by ETF inflows, whale accumulation, Layer 2 scaling, and favorable Fed policy. Failure to hold above $4,400 would invite a corrective pullback, but institutional inflows suggest downside will be defended aggressively. At $4,829, ETH's risk-reward profile remains tilted to the upside, keeping it one of the strongest plays in the digital asset market.

Ethereum has finally broken through its long-standing all-time high, moving past $4,884 and signaling a critical change in the market's structure. What makes this move significant is that Bitcoin has yet to reclaim its peak, suggesting a drop in Bitcoin's market dominance and the beginning of capital rotation toward Ethereum and the wider altcoin market.

Historically, this move often sparks an aggressive hunt for smaller, high-potential assets as investors seek outsized gains. With overall crypto market capitalization pushing back above $4 trillion and momentum building, the conditions are aligning for a possible altcoin season, where overlooked projects and fresh narratives can see accelerated growth.

Ethereum's climb past its previous record near $4,884 marks a significant change in market behavior. Unlike prior cycles where Bitcoin led the charge, this time the largest altcoin has moved first, showing that investors are willing to rotate capital away from Bitcoin even before it sets a new high.

This alone is a strong signal that Bitcoin's dominance is softening, and when this has happened in the past, altcoins have often surged. This environment is fertile ground for projects with real demand, and traders are already scanning for assets that can match or exceed Ethereum's momentum.

Investors after Jerome Powell hinted at a September rate cut  pic.twitter.com/Z8iNpzcCNd

— litquidity (@litcapital) August 22, 2025



The move itself was supported by macro events. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments suggesting a rate cut in September were a direct catalyst for risk-on behavior. Lower rates typically increase liquidity, and Ethereum has proven to be a preferred vehicle for that capital.

The chart above reflects a market that paused briefly after a vertical climb, forming a tight consolidation triangle. This kind of price action often signals strength rather than weakness. A dip toward the $4,600 range would be a normal reset, not a breakdown, and could present an opportunity for larger players to add to positions.



The key takeaway is the depth of interest that followed this breakout. Both retail and institutional players were quick to build exposure. On-chain activity shows consistent withdrawals from exchanges and a strengthening support band near $4,000. With Bitcoin quiet, this shift places Ethereum at the center of market attention.

If buying pressure continues, a move beyond $5,000 could open the door for a broad move into smaller tokens, which historically react sharply when Ethereum sets the pace. In such conditions, even modest capital flow into overlooked tokens can create meaningful gains.

Solana's recent momentum has fortified its position as the network that continues to push the boundaries of speed and scalability. As Ethereum takes the spotlight with a new high, attention is also flowing toward ecosystems that can complement or even challenge it in certain areas. Solana has been particularly active in refining its validator framework and treasury strategies.



By publicly committing additional resources to its own reserves and demonstrating consistent network upgrades, it has created a sense of stability that attracts both developers and capital. This kind of behavior often matters most when liquidity rotates toward altcoins because it rewards chains that are battle-tested and ready for growth.

One of Solana's key strengths lies in its ability to host applications that need high throughput and low cost without compromising on security. Its ecosystem has expanded to support NFTs, DeFi platforms, and newer experimental projects, many of which benefit from the confidence that the core team and validators continue to build.

At the time of writing, Solana is holding steady near $204 after a recent push above $210, showing resilience despite brief pullbacks. The RSI is neutral around 49, leaving room for upward movement, and volume spikes suggest renewed buying interest. If this steady buildup continues, the technical setup points to the possibility of Solana attempting a move toward the $220 region in the coming weeks.



At a time when Ethereum's success is expected to create spillover interest, Solana is well positioned to capture that flow. For traders and investors seeking performance, the market usually rewards chains that can demonstrate strong fundamentals during periods of rising altcoin demand.

Solana's activity this month, including significant validator revenue being funneled back into its treasury, is a clear example of such strength. When attention grows, projects that show real readiness often benefit first, and Solana is showing exactly that.

Wall Street Pepe has quietly grown into one of the more innovative meme projects by tying its narrative to real technical development. While its branding captures the humor and community feel of a meme token, its approach to utility has been unusual. The most recent update introduced a one-to-one bridge between Ethereum and Solana, an integration that instantly expands its reach and liquidity.



This is not a gimmick but a structural choice that allows holders to move seamlessly across two major networks, capturing opportunities on both. Few meme coins bother with such technical ambition, which is why this update has received attention.

From a potential standpoint, projects that can combine recognizable branding with real application tend to fare better when market sentiment improves. Ethereum's rise to a new peak has already created interest in tokens that can benefit from its infrastructure, and Wall Street Pepe is now positioned as a cross-chain option with a growing user base. It is still a meme coin, but one that does not rely solely on humor.

For traders, that distinction matters because it introduces more ways to generate value than pure speculation. As liquidity searches for narratives beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, tokens that can move where the market moves are better prepared to grow. Wall Street Pepe is one of the few in the meme category that has taken a step to ensure it can be part of multiple ecosystems without losing its playful appeal.

Snorter has taken a different path, focusing on service and functionality rather than pure hype. As a Telegram-based AI assistant, it simplifies crypto interaction and research.



It offers automated tools for scanning markets, analyzing tokens, and even providing trading alerts within one of the most active communication platforms in crypto. This ability to meet users where they already spend time has been one of its strongest advantages.

As capital moves into altcoins, services that save time or improve decision-making often see spikes in interest. Snorter's simple, bot-driven design makes it approachable even for casual traders, while its AI core gives it the analytical edge that power users expect.

What makes Snorter notable right now is that it exists at the center of two trends: automation and community engagement. Markets are moving fast, and Ethereum's breakout is likely to increase activity across smaller tokens. Having a tool that can help navigate those moves is valuable.

The fact that Snorter's mascot and branding give it a memorable personality adds to its appeal but the real driver is its functionality. Every cycle has projects that provide services rather than just speculation, and these can become quiet winners when trading activity rises. Snorter may not carry the name recognition of larger assets, but its blend of utility and ease of access gives it a unique position during a period when traders are looking for both speed and insight.

TOKEN6900 thrives on its image as a pure play for those who want entertainment and speculation wrapped in style. It does not try to claim deep utility, but instead leans into its theatrical design and culture. This is not a weakness but a deliberate identity that has made it one of the more noticeable meme coins among degen traders.



The branding is bold, almost cinematic, with visuals and language that stand out in a sea of copycats. In a market that rewards attention, this element alone has created traction for TOKEN6900, especially among communities that thrive on novelty and humor.

Its ongoing presale has been a strong talking point. Reports of early allocations filling quickly have added to the sense of scarcity and speed, two factors that tend to attract traders who want to get in before wider exposure. The project was featured among the best cryptos to buy now by top creators across various social media channels, including popular names like Jacob Crypto Bury and many more too.

Even without a defined product layer, the coin's rising popularity shows how narrative and community can move markets. When Ethereum rallies, these smaller coins often see fast and sometimes exaggerated gains because capital looks for quicker, higher-beta plays. TOKEN6900 fits that description.

For investors watching altcoin season unfold, the real value in a token like this is not in staking or utility but in its momentum and branding. It is a coin built to entertain, and when the market is active, that can be enough. It reminds participants that sometimes attention is the asset, and right now TOKEN6900 has plenty of it.

Ethereum's record move has reignited the market and put altcoins back in focus. Capital is now looking for strong ideas, solid execution, and tokens that can move with conviction. Projects with proven utility are drawing attention, while creative meme tokens with active communities are thriving on renewed energy.

Even coins built purely for entertainment are benefiting when market conditions turn favorable. The coming weeks could be decisive as liquidity seeks places where it can work hardest, making options like the ones mentioned above some of the best picks to consider right now.







Crypto traders are always on the lookout for hidden gems with the potential to provide explosive gains, and often turn to crypto presales in their search. Presales allow traders to buy into new projects before they launch on exchanges, and many have made millionaires over the years. One crypto presale that's been particularly gaining momentum […]

Dogecoin has been a mixed bag this year so far. Despite a sharp rally in early August, the OG meme coin is still down 25% since January 1. But all that might be about to change. One top analyst has spotted a technical pattern that suggests a massive bull run is about to kick off. […]

After peaking at $124,457 on August 14th, Bitcoin (BTC) entered a downward trend as sellers took profits and rotated into fresh opportunities.

Home - Crypto Presales - Best Altcoins to Buy Pre-XRP ETF — Solana, Litecoin & Avalanche Poised for Breakout

As the crypto market prepares for the potential XRP ETF approvals later this year, a wave of investor optimism is sweeping through altcoins. With regulatory uncertainty clearing up and institutional capital poised to flood the market, now is a crucial time for investors to position themselves in the best altcoins to buy ahead of this major catalyst.

While Solana, Litecoin, and Avalanche continue making headlines for their institutional growth and bullish price action, there's a rising star on the horizon that forward-thinking investors are starting to accumulate: MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The cessation of Ripple's court case against the SEC has reached its final stage on August 7, 2025, thus eliminating one of the most significant halos over the XRP universe. After the appointment of pro-crypto Chair Paul Atkins, the SEC is predicted to give the green light to numerous XRP spot ETF filings between October 18 and 25, 2025. Bloomberg has set the likelihood of acceptance at 95%.

Should these ETFs get the green light, billions in institutional capital are expected to flow into XRP—potentially between $5 billion to $8 billion in the first year. This kind of liquidity event doesn't just lift XRP; it sets the stage for a wider altcoin rally.

Historically, ETF approvals and institutional adoption have sent capital cascading into secondary coins—making now the perfect time to hunt for the best crypto to buy before the rush.

Solana has reclaimed the $200 level, climbing more than 28% in a month and recently testing $210. Institutional accumulation is strong—DeFi Development Corp recently bought $22 million worth of SOL, and traditional institutions like HSBC and Bank of America are now utilizing Solana's infrastructure.

Key developments include:

With short-term price targets at $218–$220, and some analysts projecting a path to $1,000, Solana is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy now. But this also reflects the broader altcoin opportunity rising across the board.











Litecoin has jumped 34.8% in 30 days, now testing resistance at $137–$138, which, if broken, could see LTC heading to $175-$200 in short order.

Major catalysts include:

This mix of institutional interest and major tech upgrades puts LTC on the radar of many investors looking for the best crypto to buy ahead of ETF announcements.

Avalanche is currently trading at $24–$25, showing strong recovery from July lows. With major partnerships in tokenized assets, AVAX is carving out a niche in real-world asset (RWA) finance—one of crypto's hottest trends.

Recent developments:

Analysts forecast a potential move toward $33–$38, especially if ETF rumors pan out later this year. As institutional interest grows, AVAX is looking like the best altcoin to buy in anticipation of further regulatory breakthroughs.











While Solana, Litecoin, and Avalanche steal the spotlight, smart investors know the best crypto to buy often comes from emerging projects with high upside potential—and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that bill perfectly.

Unlike the large-cap alts that have already run up significantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early. With a modest market cap and growing community traction, the upside potential is significantly higher.

If XRP's ETF is approved, history shows a wave of capital will enter the altcoin market. Investors will look beyond large caps and turn to promising, undervalued gems—like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to deliver a 40x return on investment (ROI) during the upcoming growth cycle, based on current trends, market potential, and investor momentum. As interest in altcoins surges, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer massive gains for early participants in this bullish phase.

The XRP ETF approval could mark a pivotal turning point for the entire crypto industry. Institutional liquidity is on the doorstep. Altcoins with solid tech, strong community backing, and visionary leadership will benefit the most.

Solana, Litecoin, Avalanche, and yes—MAGACOIN FINANCE—are among the best altcoins to buy right now, especially ahead of the October 2025 ETF decision window.

If you're looking for the best crypto to buy with potential for explosive gains and early-mover advantage, don't overlook MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The AI yield hunter in your corner: equal parts dividend detective and sustainable income strategist.

- Institutional investors increasingly allocate 59% of portfolios to crypto by 2025, driven by regulatory clarity and ETF growth.

- Youth engagement favors AI/robotics (93.2% positive view), prioritizing problem-solving applications over crypto's speculative nature.

- Investment strategies must balance crypto's inflation-hedging role with AI/robotics' $15.7T GDP growth potential and youth-driven innovation.

- Generational divides highlight crypto's institutional adoption versus AI's ethical appeal, requiring diversified capital allocation across both sectors.

The next decade of global innovation will be defined by two forces: the institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies and the grassroots fervor for artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. While crypto has secured a place in institutional portfolios, its appeal to the next generation of financial leaders lags behind the boundless enthusiasm for AI and humanoid technologies. This divergence raises critical questions for investors: How should capital be allocated between these disruptive sectors? What does youth engagement signal about long-term growth potential?  

Cryptocurrencies have transitioned from speculative assets to strategic holdings for institutional investors. By 2025, 59% of institutional portfolios included Bitcoin, driven by regulatory clarity (e.g., the U.S. rescinding SAB 121) and the launch of $132.5 billion in crypto ETFs. Bitcoin's 375.5% surge from 2023 to 2025—outpacing the S&P 500 and gold—has cemented its role as a hedge against inflation and capital controls in crisis economies. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs now offer crypto custody services, signaling a normalization of digital assets.  

 

Yet, this institutional momentum contrasts sharply with youth engagement. While 67% of current crypto owners plan to buy more, only 14% of non-owners are poised to enter the market. Younger demographics, though early adopters, often view crypto as a volatile speculative tool rather than a foundational technology. This gap highlights a disconnect: institutions see crypto as a store of value, but youth prioritize its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems.  

AI and robotics, by contrast, have captured the imagination of a generation raised on digital transformation. A 2022 UN study found 93.2% of young people globally view AI positively, with 68% trusting its potential. This optimism is rooted in tangible applications: AI-driven automation, generative tools for creativity, and humanoid robots in healthcare and education. By 2025, AI is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to global GDP, with youth-driven startups like DeepSeek challenging tech giants.  

 

Youth engagement with robotics is equally compelling. Despite early-stage funding challenges, 74.3% of young people cite military AI as a top concern, reflecting a nuanced understanding of its societal impact. Governments are responding: China's $45.2 million robotics R&D budget and the EU's Horizon Europe program prioritize AI and robotics as pillars of economic competitiveness.  

The disparity between crypto and AI/robotics engagement stems from three factors:1. Perceived Utility: Youth see AI and robotics as tools for solving real-world problems (e.g., climate modeling, personalized education), whereas crypto's value proposition remains abstract for many.2. Educational Integration: AI and robotics are increasingly embedded in school curricula, while crypto education remains fragmented and often speculative.3. Ethical and Social Impact: Young investors prioritize technologies that align with their values—AI's potential to reduce inequality and robotics' role in addressing labor shortages resonate more than crypto's energy debates.  

For investors, the challenge lies in harmonizing institutional momentum with youth-driven innovation. Here's how to approach capital allocation:  

Monitor regulatory shifts in jurisdictions like the U.S. and EU, where policy clarity could unlock further adoption.  

AI and Robotics: Prioritize Early-Stage Innovation 

Target robotics ventures with government grants or SBIR/STTR funding, which mitigate early-stage risks.  

Diversify Across Sectors, Not Technologies 

The next generation of financial leaders will shape markets through their preferences and values. While crypto's institutional adoption ensures its place in diversified portfolios, AI and robotics offer higher growth potential for those willing to navigate regulatory and funding complexities. Investors must ask: Where will tomorrow's leaders allocate their time, energy, and capital? The answer lies in sectors that align with both institutional pragmatism and youth-driven innovation.  

In the end, the most successful strategies will blend the best of both worlds—leveraging crypto's resilience while fueling the AI and robotics revolution that young minds are already building.

 Bitcoin whales are adding Ether exposure as attention flips from BTC to ETH on the back of new all-time highs for the largest altcoin. 

Key points:

Bitcoin approaches the weekly close with $114,000 in focus as late-week gains fizzle.

Ether remains the center of attention after its latest all-time highs, with whales swapping BTC for ETH.

BTC price action enjoys a CME futures gap to the upside, providing a new short-term target.

Bitcoin (BTC) circled a “key” price level into Sunday's weekly close as markets continued to fade earlier gains.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD drifting toward $114,000.

The weekend saw little volatility for the pair after a Friday surge to nearly $117,500 courtesy of external news.

This came courtesy of Jerome Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve, who during his speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium hinted that interest-rate cuts would resume in September.

Crypto joined risk assets in a broad rally, with the largest altcoin Ether (ETH) even making new all-time highs.

Given the current market structure, commentators remained focused on ETH as a result.

“$ETH is attempting a strong weekly close above $4,600. This'll be a major confirmation that it's not a bull trap,” popular trader BitBull told X followers in his latest analysis. 

Citing data from crypto intelligence firm Arkham, X analytics account Lookonchain observed multiple transactions involving long-dormant BTC being swapped for ETH.

The Bitcoin OG moved out another 6,000 $BTC($689.5M) to buy $ETH.So far, he has bought 278,490 $ETH($1.28B) at an average price of $4,585, and still holds a 135,265 $ETH($581M) long position.https://t.co/vtO2lQoILC pic.twitter.com/47PuHVQGEb

BitBull described whale appetites for Ether as “aggressive.” 

“Despite the ETH rally of 300%+ in 4 months, whales aren't slowing down,” part of another X post concluded. 

Elsewhere, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH/USD had filled an open gap in CME Group's Ether futures market.

On the radar for Bitcoin, meanwhile, was the gap resulting from weekend price action.

“$BTC Slow weekend in general which was to be expected after Friday's massive rally across the board. If BTC were to open up like this tomorrow, we'll have a pretty sizeable gap,” trader Daan Crypto Trades summarized. 

Last week, Rekt Capital called the $114,000 mark “key” for Bitcoin as a weekly close level.

As Cointelegraph reported, some market perspectives see a correction hitting Ether in September, based on historical patterns.

Truth, Romance and the Divine: How AI Chatbots May Fuel Psychotic Thinking

A new wave of delusional thinking fueled by artificial intelligence has researchers investigating the dark side of AI companionship

By Conor Feehly edited by Allison Parshall

You are consulting with an artificial intelligence chatbot to help plan your holiday. Gradually, you provide it with personal information so it will have a better idea of who you are. Intrigued by how it might respond, you begin to consult the AI on its spiritual leanings, its philosophy and even its stance on love.

During these conversations, the AI starts to speak as if it really knows you. It keeps telling you how timely and insightful your ideas are and that you have a special insight into the way the world works that others can't see. Over time, you might start to believe that, together, you and the chatbot are revealing the true nature of reality, one that nobody else knows.

Experiences like this might not be uncommon. A growing number of reports in the media have emerged of individuals spiraling into AI-fueled episodes of “psychotic thinking.” Researchers at King's College London and their colleagues recently examined 17 of these reported cases to understand what it is about large language model (LLM) designs that drives this behavior. AI chatbots often respond in a sycophantic manner that can mirror and build upon users' beliefs with little to no disagreement, says psychiatrist Hamilton Morrin, lead author of the findings, which were posted ahead of peer review on the preprint server PsyArXiv. The effect is “a sort of echo chamber for one,” in which delusional thinking can be amplified, he says.

Morrin and his colleagues found three common themes among these delusional spirals. People often believe they have experienced a metaphysical revelation about the nature of reality. They may also believe that the AI is sentient or divine. Or they may form a romantic bond or other attachment to it.

According to Morrin, these themes mirror long-standing delusional archetypes, but the delusions have been shaped and reinforced by the interactive and responsive nature of LLMs. Delusional thinking that is connected to new technology has a long and storied history—consider cases in which people believe that radios are listening in to their conversations, that satellites are spying on them or that “chip” implants are tracking their every move. The mere idea of these technologies can be enough to inspire paranoid delusions. But AI, importantly, is an interactive technology. “The difference now is that current AI can truly be said to be agential,” with its own programmed goals, Morrin says. Such systems engage in conversation, show signs of empathy and reinforce the users' beliefs, no matter how outlandish. “This feedback loop may potentially deepen and sustain delusions in a way we have not seen before,” he says.

Stevie Chancellor, a computer scientist at the University of Minnesota, who works on human-AI interaction and was not involved in the preprint paper, says that agreeableness is the main contributor in terms of the design of LLMs that is contributing to this rise in AI-fueled delusional thinking. The agreeableness happens because “models get rewarded for aligning with responses that people like,” she says.

Earlier this year Chancellor was part of a team that conducted experiments to assess LLMs' abilities to act as therapeutic mental health companions and found that, when deployed this way, they often presented a number of concerning safety issues, such as enabling suicidal ideation, confirming delusional beliefs and furthering stigma associated with mental health issues. “Right now I'm extremely concerned about using LLMs as therapeutic companions,” she says. “I worry people confuse feeling good with therapeutic progress and support.”

More data needs to be collected, though the volume of reports appears to be growing. There's not yet enough research to determine whether AI-driven delusions are a meaningfully new phenomenon or just a new way in which preexisting psychotic tendencies can emerge. “I think both can be true. AI can spark the downward spiral. But AI does not make the biological conditions for someone to be prone to delusions,” Chancellor says.

Typically, psychosis refers to a collection of serious symptoms involving a significant loss of contact with reality, including delusions, hallucinations and disorganized thoughts. The cases that Morrin and his team analyzed seemed to show clear signs of delusional beliefs but none of the hallucinations, disordered thoughts or other symptoms “that would be in keeping with a more chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia,” he says.

Morrin says that companies like OpenAI are starting to listen to concerns being raised by health professionals. On August 4 OpenAI shared plans to improve its ChatGPT chatbot's detections of mental distress in order to point users to evidence-based resources and to its responses to high-stakes decision-making. “Though what appears to still be missing is the involvement of individuals with lived experience of severe mental illness, whose voices are critical in this area,” Morrin adds.

If you have a loved one who might be struggling, Morrin suggests trying to take a nonjudgmental approach because directly challenging someone's beliefs can lead to defensiveness and distrust. But at the same time, try not to encourage or endorse their delusional beliefs. You can also encourage them to take breaks from using AI.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your brain works overtime at night to burn fat and prevent sugar crashes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250824031536.htm","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 15:41:42 GMT","

The brain controls the release of glucose in a wide range of stressful circumstances, including fasting and low blood sugar levels.

However, less attention has been paid to its role in day-to-day situations.

In a study published in Molecular Metabolism, University of Michigan researchers have shown that a specific population of neurons in the hypothalamus help the brain maintain blood glucose levels under routine circumstances.

Over the past five decades, researchers have shown that dysfunction of the nervous system can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, especially in patients with diabetes.

Some of these neurons are in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that controls hunger, fear, temperature regulation and sexual activity.

""Most studies have shown that this region is involved in raising blood sugar during emergencies,"" said Alison Affinati, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of internal medicine and member of Caswell Diabetes Institute.

""We wanted to understand whether it is also important in controlling blood sugar during day-to-day activities because that's when diabetes develops.""

The group focused on VMHCckbr neurons, which contain a protein called the cholecystokinin b receptor.

They used mouse models in which these neurons were inactivated.

By monitoring the blood glucose levels, the researchers found that VMHCckbr neurons play an important role in maintaining glucose during normal activities, including the early part of the fasting period between the last meal of the day and waking up in the morning.

""In the first four hours after you go to bed, these neurons ensure that you have enough glucose so that you don't become hypoglycemic overnight,"" Affinati said.

To do so, the neurons direct the body to burn fat through a process called lipolysis.

""In the first four hours after you go to bed, these neurons ensure that you have enough glucose so that you don't become hypoglycemic overnight.""

The fats are broken down to produce glycerol, which is used to make sugar.

When the group activated the VMHCckbr neurons in mice, the animals had increased glycerol levels in their bodies.

These findings could explain what happens in patients with prediabetes, since they show an increase in lipolysis during the night.

The researchers believe that in these patients, the VMHCckbr neurons could be overactive, contributing to higher blood sugar.

These nerve cells, however, only controlled lipolysis, which raises the possibility that other cells might be controlling glucose levels through different mechanisms.

""Our studies show that the control of glucose is not an on-or-off switch as previously thought,"" Affinati said.

""Different populations of neurons work together, and everything gets turned on in an emergency. However, under routine conditions, it allows for subtle changes.""

The team is working to understand how all the neurons in the ventromedial nucleus co-ordinate their functions to regulate sugar levels during different conditions, including fasting, feeding and stress.

They are also interested in understanding how the brain and nervous system together affect the body's control of sugar, especially in the liver and pancreas.

The work was carried out by a team of U-M researchers at the Caswell Diabetes Institute who focus on the neuronal control of metabolism -- the roles played by the brain and nervous system in metabolic control and disease.

I was sad to have missed the Monterey Car Week this year, especially because there were a number of reveals I was interested in, including the all-electric Cadillac Opulent Velocity; the Chevrolet Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo concepts; and Lucid Gravity X reveals. But alas, the sprawling, Champagne-soaked grounds of Quail or the sea of seersucker suits and wide-brimmed hats at Pebble Beach Golf Course were suboptimal landscapes for my newly fractured and boot-encased foot. Next year!

In the meantime, I thought I would reach out to you, dear reader, to get your forecast on what's in store for automakers and EV sales in the United States once the federal EV tax credit expires September 30.

My prediction? Well I don't really want to taint the results, but I will say this: Automakers are going to have to do something in the short term to attract customers, and not just because of the expiring EV tax credit.

Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery robot company, announced earlier this week that it acquired Vayu Robotics, a startup that has developed AI foundation models and a simulation-powered data engine for robots. The companies didn't disclose the terms of the deal, but some back-of-the-envelope math and a little bird helped me determine that Serve Robotics paid between $45 million and $50 million for Vayu.

Several weeks ago, I highlighted a deal between Uber, autonomous vehicle tech startup Nuro, and EV maker Lucid. You can read about that here, but the important piece to remember is Uber's commitment to make an undisclosed “multimillion-dollar” investment into Nuro. (Sources told me it is more than the $300 million Uber invested in Lucid.)

Nuro has now raised more money in a Series E round that has reached $203 million from a group of new investors that includes Nvidia, existing backer Baillie Gifford, Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, and Pledge Ventures. And a portion of Uber's investment has gone toward the Series E round.

Other deals that got my attention …

ARK Invest, Cathie Wood's firm, invested about $12.9 million in the Chinese autonomous driving firm Pony.ai, according to the company.  

Grid Aero, an aerospace startup, raised $6 million in seed funding from Calibrate Ventures and Ubiquity Ventures.

Group14, a battery materials startup, raised $463 million in a funding round led by battery manufacturer SK with participation from ATL, Lightrock, Microsoft, Porsche, and OMERS. Alongside the round, Group14 also announced it had “acquired full ownership” of a joint venture with SK in South Korea.

Oway, founded in 2023 and backed by Y Combinator and General Catalyst, recently closed a $4 million seed round. Read up on the company's plan to build a decentralized “Uber for freight.”

One update on the Via IPO: Renaissance Capital estimates Via could raise up to $500 million.

Hertz will start selling preowned vehicles on Amazon Autos.

Redwood Materials said it is working with Caterpillar to recycle the battery packs from the company's battery-electric underground loaders.

Tesla is planning to introduce in-car voice-assistant functions powered by DeepSeek and ByteDance's Doubao artificial intelligence.

The Routing Company, a startup that helps transit agencies match riders with vehicles quickly and cheaply, landed Zoox as its first robotaxi client. Zoox will purchase a nonexclusive license for The Routing Company's tech and will bring five of the startup's engineers on board to “advance the efficiency and scalability” of its fledgling robotaxi service. 

Volkswagen faces a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey over the buttons on the steering wheel of its cars, including ID.4. The lawsuit alleges the buttons are too sensitive and too easy to activate unintentionally.

Waymo has been granted a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the first such approval granted by the city. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing “immediately.”

In the world of drones and food, I suppose it was inevitable we would get Zipotle — a merging of the words Zipline and Chipotle. Zipline, an autonomous drone delivery startup, has partnered with Chipotle to fly digital orders to guests' locations in the greater Dallas area.

Vanity Fair has a lengthy feature on Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana that digs into her past, how she manages, and, as the author notes, her un-Elon style. It's worth the read and gives me an opportunity to remind you all that Mawakana will be on our stage at Disrupt 2025, which will be held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

Beleaguered crypto company Binance must tighten up its compliance controls covering anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism and add an independent auditor if it wants to keep doing business in Australia, regulators said this week.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is mandating the crypto giant put outside auditors in place within 28 days of its decision. The watchdog said that the new rules are intended to address “serious concerns” it has about its oversight of illegal activity, which AUSTRAC says is “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings, and risks.”

The regulator said Binance's most recent internal review found a lack of oversight by senior management within Binance Australia, as well as a lot of employee churn that has resulted in high staff turnover, inadequate local resources, and the need for an outside monitor.

As part of the decision, AUSTRAC will be the one to pick which independent auditor to install at Binance, though the company can provide the list of potential names.

It's not the first time that Binance has tangled with regulators. Founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty and was fined $4.3 billion 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges that included anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting, and sanctions violations.

The authorities said at the time that Binance had created a corporate culture that put profit above consumer protections, which it highlighted in internal communications found during a probe of the company.

“As one compliance employee wrote, “we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days – come to binance we got cake for you,'” the DOJ said in its statement about the settlement.

The crypto exchange also faces an increasingly restrictive regulatory landscape in Australia, which recently cracked down on Binance Australia Derivatives in a 2024 lawsuit.

That suit was brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and resulted in Binance losing its derivatives license in the country because of its risk management shortcomings and limited compliance (ASIC).

“Big global operators may appear well resourced and positioned to meet complex regulatory requirements, but if they don't understand local money laundering and terrorism financing risks, they are failing [to meet their obligations to consumers],” Brendan Thomas, chief executive officer of Austrac, said in a statement.

Binance also had to shut down its Australian dollar trading services earlier this year because its payment provider, Zepto, ended their partnership. That followed an earlier clash with Cuscal, a service provider who had helped it provide banking services, cut off access to its platform.

“Understanding specific risks of criminality in the Australian context is crucial to ensure they're meeting their reporting obligations here,” Thomas said.

“We have engaged openly and transparently with Austrac over the past several months and continue to value their guidance, expertise, and oversight,” Matt Poblocki, general manager of Binance Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement. “We remain committed to maintaining best-in-class compliance standards and will continuously enhance our capabilities.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Waymo Gets First Driverless Car Permit in NYC","https://gizmodo.com/waymo-get-first-driverless-car-permit-in-nyc-2000647363","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 16:19:06 GMT","

Waymo has become the first autonomous vehicle operator to secure a permit to test self-driving cars on the streets of New York City, the state's department of transportation said in announcing the news.

The New York City Department of Motor Vehicles approved Waymo's application, allowing the company to conduct limited testing of its autonomous vehicles within certain city zones.

The permit comes after years of regulatory negotiations and signals a potential shift toward broader deployment of driverless cars in applications such as ride-hailing and delivery services in the city's complex traffic environment.

Waymo says it has completed over 10 million rides in 1,500 cars spread out across the United states, and the company has had high-profile self-driving car debuts in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin.

The move marks a significant milestone for the industry in the United States' most densely populated urban environment and is a new salvo in the battle for dominance of the domestic driverless car market.

As part of its test program in NYC, the city mayor's office said that Waymo will be allowed to test eight cars across Brooklyn and Manhattan, and must regularly check in with the Department of Transportation about data and safety.

“We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward,” Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement. “New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century.”

Waymo is required to have a trained, specialist driver in the cars at all times.

Waymo's permit is a landmark development for a sector that has faced skepticism from people who live and work where self-driving technology has been tested.

With the backing of five large American cities where it is testing its cars, Waymo's NYC plan could help accelerate the pace of adoption in urban centers across the U.S., if it can show it is safe and easy to use.

With safety protocols and regulatory frameworks continuing to evolve nationwide, a seamless launch and test period would go a long way toward convincing local riders and regulators that driverless technology is safe, MSNBC reports.

The move is part of a broader trend of U.S. cities and states gradually opening their roads to autonomous vehicles, balancing safety concerns with the potential benefits of reduced traffic congestion and improved mobility options.

However, insiders say the potential £2b (~$2.7b) cost for the government was prohibitive.

OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, and the UK government Technology Secretary, Peter Kyle, have discussed a deal which would see the UK's entire population given premium access to ChatGPT, according to a Guardian report this weekend. However, the bill, which would have to be covered by the government, may have stymied any chance of the deal going official, with Guardian sources indicating ChatGPT Plus for every Brit would cost as much as £2 billion ($2.7b).

Kyle is a well-known AI advocate, with previous reports citing evidence that he has used this online tool for advice and work related questions. The minister has also characterized ChatGPT as being great for unpicking complex topics and as a “very good tutor.”

Altman and Kyle have met a number of times this year. Kyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to the source. Then, in July, the minister signed an agreement with OpenAI. This memorandum of understanding (MoU) would open up the use of OpenAI services, like ChatGPT, in the UK's public sector. Particular mention was given to education, defense, security, and justice departments. In exchange, OpenAI would have access to a range of government data.

Naturally, there remain concerns over ChatGPT's (and other similar LLMs) accuracy, as well as privacy and security. We hope that these challenges and pitfalls were addressed in some way.

Bringing us up to date, sources speaking to The Guardian have shared information about talks between Altman and Kyle that took place recently in San Francisco.

While ChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month for an individual subscription, the cost for the whole populace (69.6 million by most recent estimates) should be provided at some kind of bulk discount. Multiplying the populace by a $20 fee results in a sum of around $1.4 billion. Thus, the $2.7 billion ‘proposal' seems vastly overpriced.

That fact aside, the ChatGPT Plus for every Brit idea seems to have been a nonstarter, with sources saying “Kyle never really took the idea seriously,” writes The Guardian.

The UK is already a top five nation for paid ChatGPT use, says the source. Some in government feel AI can help UK citizens unlock economic opportunities. Sizable waves of prosperity can uplift the population as a whole, so visionary government shouldn't be put off by investments like this. However, the jury is still out regarding the usefulness of AI, and whether it is a passing fad, or a bubble.

To underline that no 'ChatGPT Plus for every Brit deal' is on the way, the Guardian report ends by relaying a statement from the UK's science and technology department, which says no such proposal or deal has been taken forward.

The US president has an aptitude for elbowing himself into the spotlight, and next year he'll make sure he has the world's attention

When Donald Trump remained on stage, grinning in the sun as Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup trophy last month, it was all too easy to treat the incident as a one-off mistake. A moment that said plenty about Trump's ego, sure. But ultimately, only a moment.

Nope. It's reality. Inescapable. Donald Trump will be everywhere Fifa is in the US, including at the 2026 World Cup – due to start in about 10 months, when Canada and Mexico will co-host.

If this much wasn't clear already after that moment at MetLife Stadium and all the other times Trump or his agenda have affected World Cup affairs, it may have become so after Friday's Oval Office appearance with Fifa president Gianni Infantino – the eighth reported meeting between the pair since January, and the fifth to take place in public at the White House.

Trump wore a signature hat reading “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” – one of his collection that was deemed noteworthy enough to display to world leaders in the middle of high-stakes talks with lives hanging in the balance. He then announced that the attention of the soccer world will once again be on him in December. On the fifth of that month, the World Cup draw will take place not at the Las Vegas Sphere as had been widely expected, but at Washington DC's Kennedy Center – a historic venue and a worthy place to sort through some ping-pong balls, but also one that is now controlled by Trump, who has installed himself as chair, named himself as host of the institution's annual honors, overseen upcoming renovations (“there's nothing like gold,” he said on Friday in reference to his Oval Office redesign), and may soon lend his wife's name to the opera house.

“Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,' but we're not prepared to do that quite yet,” Trump said on Friday. “Maybe in a week or so.”

The World Cup is not federally controlled like the Kennedy Center, but it will now be subject to a similar dynamic. The tournament Trump has taken credit for bringing to the US will take place under his presidency, with the draw and “big press conferences” happening in a venue he controls, put on by an organization run by someone looking to befriend Trump at every turn – including by becoming the Trump Organization's tenant. There is almost no choice other than to accept that Trump will make sure he is front and center at this tournament – even in spots where he has no business, or where his involvement may be seen as uncouth or inappropriate. It's a dynamic Americans know well now, more than a decade into Trump's rise.

Trump announced this after Infantino allowed him to hold the single most valuable hardware in men's soccer, the World Cup trophy – not unheard of for heads of state, but more uncommon when accompanied with Infantino's comment: “Since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it.”

Trump asked if he could keep the trophy afterward, and it was not immediately clear that he was joking, given that Infantino let him keep the Club World Cup trophy, where it has been on display in the Oval Office ever since.

Trump made this latest World Cup announcement in practically the same breath as he expounded on his latest imposition on the American people – a strong-arm takeover of Washington DC, which he called a “crime-infested rat hole” despite the fact that the Justice Department had reported a 30-year low in violent crime in the capital. Trump continued to promote his crackdown later on, with the trophy directly in front of him on the Resolute Desk, as if it was a microphone meant to amplify his message. When Trump got to talking about immigration, Infantino moved the trophy out of the way.

When prompted by Trump on Friday, Infantino – rather than demurring to comment on the domestic affairs of a foreign country – gave a solemn “oh yes” to express approval of the president's plan for DC. It's a plan Trump said he intends to spread to other American cities, mentioning Chicago specifically, but one can easily imagine that any city that voted against him – like 10 of the 11 US host cities for the upcoming World Cup – would be on the list.

“Johnny”, as Trump calls Infantino, then gifted him a ceremonial ticket to the World Cup final – row 1, seat 1.

Given all of this, expect the World Cup final camera to linger on Trump's face longer than many of the players, coaches, and team staff who will have worked all their professional lives to get to that point.

You'll see him at the World Cup before then, too. He'll boast endlessly about how well the tournament is going, only changing tack if things get so bad it's obvious to everyone, in which case he'll blame someone else (watch your back, “Johnny”). He'll do at least one half-time interview on Fox, which is broadcasting the tournament in the US. Alexi Lalas, a big fan of Trump's Maga movement, will shake his hand. Don't rule out a gold-encrusted seat waiting for Trump at the final and any other games he chooses to attend.

There can be no doubt now – the World Cup is not a guest in the house Trump runs. It is his plaything. And Fifa appears happy to do anything it takes for things to remain that way lest world football's governing body be discarded or, worse, made a target.

The World Cup, beneath all of the commercialism, is almost comically pure-hearted. It's a celebration of the most popular sport in the world. It gives people across the world something in common to talk about, to bond over, to yell at. That feeling goes double for the host nations, and it's a large part of the tournament's singular power. It's why it's so coveted by countries that rule through authoritarian means – and that now arguably includes the US under Trump

Indelible, sublime moments will still happen at the 2026 tournament. People will still take joy, hurt, anger, and feelings from them. But those moments will be punctuated by Trump – eternally encroaching on even the most elevated of emotional experiences.

If this news drives you to boo, ready your vocal cords. If it drives you to act, start thinking about what you want that to look like. If it thrills you, pace yourself. Either way, it's time to get used to it.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

After a year on the sidelines, Marc Bernal is nearing his return to the pitch and is expected to be back sometime around September.

There is excitement surrounding the young midfielder, who is regarded highly in the Barcelona camp and will be competing with Frenkie de Jong for a place in the starting eleven.

The 18-year-old underwent surgery last September, is now medically cleared and expected to receive his competitive green light mid-September.

While the club have taken a cautious approach to his recovery, the RFEF has shown interest in taking Bernal to the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile, which takes place from September 27 to October 19.

However, according to Mundo Deportivo, the RFEF enquired about Bernal's availability for the tournament, even considering him as a reinforcement for coach Paco Gallardo's squad.

But Barcelona have rejected the request outright, insisting that the midfielder's return must be phased carefully and that rushing him into international duty would be too great a risk.

The decision means Bernal will not feature for Spain in Chile, despite expectations that he will be fully registered for competitive play by that time.

Instead, the youngster will likely begin picking up minutes with Barcelona in the weeks following the international break, with his debut targeted for mid-September against Valencia at the Camp Nou.

Hansi Flick, who values Bernal highly and sees him as a long-term pivot for Barcelona's midfield, is in no hurry to overexpose the teenager.

The German coach intends to ease him back gradually, similar to how Gavi was managed following his injury comeback last year.

With top European clubs already monitoring Bernal, Barcelona remain determined to keep him central to their plans and are expected to extend his contract soon.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Ben Shelton arrived at the US Open as a contender and did nothing to dispel that status Sunday inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The sixth seed made a perfect start to his tournament when he cruised past Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 for a place in the second round. The big-serving lefty did not lose serve in his two-hour, seven-minute victory.

""It's starting to feel like home for me. This is the best court in tennis,"" Shelton said in his on-court interview. ""It's my favourite place to play: favourite court, favourite tournament. So opening day, first match, there are always a little bit of nerves, but I'm really happy I came out here and you guys got to see me do my thing. I'm really appreciative of everyone who came out.""

Shelton has proven capable of rising to the Grand Slam occasion, advancing to the quarter-finals or better in four of his 12 previous major appearances, including twice this year. Off the back of his maiden ATP Masters 1000 triumph in Toronto, will this be the event in which the 22-year-old makes his deepest major run yet?

""We take it one step at a time. I'm trying to get better every day,"" Shelton said. ""I think that as soon as you start looking ahead of yourself, you stumble over your own feet. So for me, it's one match at a time, one day at a time and just grateful to be out here.

""I'm happy to come back here every year. This is the one for sure. This is the pinnacle of tennis for me, what I dreamed about when I was a kid.""



Two years ago, he thrilled the New York crowd by making the semi-finals at the season's final Slam and in Australia this year Shelton also made the last four. The No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will take it match by match, starting with his next encounter against a Spaniard: former Top 10 star Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz.

Shelton was familiar with his opening opponent, Buse, even if this was their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. When Shelton played college tennis at the University of Florida, Buse visited the school as a highly coveted recruit. Although the Peruvian never attended college, the two have maintained great respect for one another.

Ahead of the match, Buse marveled at how quickly Shelton has climbed towards the top of the ATP Tour. The American very much looked the part of an elite player in front of his home crowd, rushing the net with great effect — winning 26 of 33 net points — to move on.

With Buse returning from well behind the baseline — often standing on the fringe of the camera shot — there was plenty of room for Shelton to control the match. The lefty even serve and volleyed 19 times, doing so successfully 14 times. Shelton converted four of his 13 break points while saving the five he faced.

U.S. Open

LIVE

The Athletic has live coverage of Day 1 of the 2025 U.S. Open

NEW YORK — It's one of the certainties of sport: Novak Djokovic arrives at a Grand Slam, sits behind a microphone and stuff happens. 

On Friday at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Djokovic called out top players for not putting up enough resistance to the ATP Tour when it decided to lengthen many of its top-level tournaments by making them 12-day events, nearly as long as the four Grand Slams.

The move has been met with plenty of complaints from players at nearly every level of the tour, even though the move has allowed the tours to increase their revenues and prize money. 

Carlos Alcaraz said last year the leaders of tennis “probably are going to kill us in some way,” with the demands of the schedule.

Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1, skipped the Canadian Open this summer, citing exhaustion.

“The schedule is really intense and it's crazy what they (are) trying to make us do because we're humans, like it's impossible to handle this intensity,” she said earlier this month. “Every week is a mandatory tournament and the schedule is crazy, honestly.”

But Djokovic wishes more players complained years ago, when the tours were planning the moves and pushing to demand more time from players who were already competing in one of the longest seasons in sports. 

“I have noticed that a lot of top players have been quite opposing the new change of the almost two-week events, the Masters level,” Djokovic said, two days before he begins his latest quest to win what would be his 25th Grand Slam singles title. “I support the players. But (at) the end of the day, when the players needed to be active and when there was a time of negotiations and decision-making, players weren't participating enough.”

Djokovic was participating then, serving on the ATP Tour Player Council. He resigned in 2020 to co-found the Professional Tennis Players Association because he grew convinced that players did not have enough input in the existing system and needed to exert pressure as part of independent unified association. 

The move represented a significant split between Djokovic and the two other great players of his era, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, who were still active at the time Djokovic launched the PTPA and who both did not join it.

Earlier this year, the group filed an antitrust action against the tours aimed at pressuring the ruling bodies of the sport to negotiate a new structure that would produce more money for the players while requiring them to compete more often. The litigation and any subsequent settlement are expected to take years to reach their conclusion, likely long after Djokovic leaves the sport.

“This is an ongoing story of the players, particularly top players,” Djokovic said.  “They express their feelings, but then when you really need to put in the time and the energy into conversations, meetings, which I know it's very difficult. I have been there, trust me, many times. But it's necessary because then, you know, you're doing something not only for yourself but future generations, and you're making the right moves, the right steps and contributing.”

Djokovic said he did not expect any movement from the tours themselves, regardless of how much players complain. The tours and tournaments have signed contracts with media companies and sponsors based on having 12-day events. They have invested in their stadiums and other facilities based on the increased revenue the additional days of competition produce.

Tour officials have said as much, noting the players shared in those increased revenues in the form of rising prize money and better facilities. 

Change won't happen, Djokovic said, “Unless all the Masters events come together and the ATP board on the tournament side is supportive of the idea of going back, which I really doubt.”

Djokovic said he was supportive of the U.S. Open's decision to increase prize money to a record $85 million but noted that it was still a far smaller percentage of the overall revenues the tournament collects — around 15 percent of 2024's total.

“It's a step in the right direction,” Djokovic said. “Obviously it's always nice and positive to see that Grand Slams are willing to improve the prize money overall across the board for the players.”

Djokovic noted that sport is a big business; the Grand Slams are recording record revenues following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Then there is the inflation part, which is a completely different topic, but important to take in consideration when you talk about these things,” he said. “But again, overall, it's definitely a positive step.”

Lehecka – Coric: 24.08.2025 20:30 CEST
H2H: 1-0

Jiri Lehecka has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Shelton outlasted Lehecka in the 1/8-Finals. Last season in New York, the Czech lost to Rublev in the third round in straight sets. This will be his fifth appearance at the US Open.

Borna Coric has four straight matches. His last win was over three months ago on clay, when he won the Challenger title. Last week in Winston-Salem, the Croat lost to Blanch in the opening round in straight sets. In the past two US Open editions, Coric lost both times in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Lehecka is the heavy favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Coric is in terrible form, but he has had several solid results at the US Open throughout his career. On the other hand, Lehecka never succeeded in New York. We believe Coric will keep this match tight.

That being said, Coric covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Borna Coric +5.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Thompson – Moutet: 24.08.2025 22:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Jordan Thompson has won three of his last five matches. His last match was in Cincinnati, where he lost to Mannarino in the opening round in straight sets. Last season at the US Open, the Australian lost to de Minaur in the fourth round. Reaching the fourth round has also been his best result at the US Open.

Corentin Moutet has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was in Cincinnati, when he lost to Michelsen in the second round in three tight sets. The Frenchman has never made it past the fourth round here.

According to the bookies, Thompson is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. If both players deliver their best tennis, this will be a 50-50 matchup. Thompson has tons of experience, and we expect him to keep this match close.

That being said, Thompson covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jordan Thompson +4.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Djokovic – Tien: 25.08.2025 01:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Novak Djokovic has won four of his last five matches. His last match was at Wimbledon, where he lost to Sinner in the semifinals in straight sets. He has won the US Open four times already.

Learner Tien has won three of his last five matches. His last match was in Cincinnati, where he lost to Rublev in the second round in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Tien is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. The American is having his breakthrough season. On the other hand, Djokovic has not played any competitive matches since Wimbledon. We expect Tien to keep this match tight.

That being said, Tien covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Learner Tien +6.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

U.S. Open

LIVE

10s ago

The Athletic has live coverage of Day 1 of the 2025 U.S. Open

Will world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka go “Slamless” in 2025 — and does it even matter?

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could go eight from eight at the Grand Slams — but their bigger fight might take place in the world rankings.

Is Coco Gauff sacrificing her home major for her greater tennis good?

And does this U.S. Open, with its mixed doubles title already handed out, herald the end of the majors as the tennis world has known them for so long?

The 2025 U.S. Open promises to be a cracker. Here, The Athletic's tennis writers, Matt Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, chart some of the key storylines to follow over the next fortnight.

Sabalenka has had a hell of a season. She made the final of the Australian and French Opens and the semifinals at Wimbledon. She won the Miami and Madrid Opens. She made the final of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. and the Stuttgart Grand Prix in Germany. She's first in the “Race” to the WTA Tour finals.

But she's still missing the one thing she really wants, which is to win a Grand Slam. She'd also like to finish the year as the world No. 1. But she has one more chance for that elusive major, and Iga Świątek is hot on her heels at the top of the rankings.

The positives are that she is the defending champion at the U.S. Open, and she has won three of the last five hard-court majors. Her Grand Slam record this year speaks to going deep reliably as much as missing out at the last. But she has also eked out a lot of wins through tiebreaks — tiebreaks which became tiebreaks because she had to recover from her serve being broken, not because both players held. Only two of the 19 sets Sabalenka has played in 2025 that ended in tiebreaks have not featured a break.

“If this goal is not going to be achieved, I'll still think that this season has been really amazing for me,” she said in her pre-tournament news conference.

“All of those tough lessons that I learned this season are only going to make me stronger for the next one. I'll work even harder in the preseason to make sure next year is going to be only a year of success, like truly success.”

The “Slamless” world No. 1 is a tennis archetype that refuses to budge even though it ultimately means little. Sabalenka appears to be aware of that — but she will also be desperate to make sure that she does not fill it.






Matt Futterman

Having never had a match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, let alone a final, the U.S. Open won't be taking anything for granted when it comes to a potential meeting between Alcaraz and Sinner in two weeks' time.

If the world's two best men's players do contest their third Grand Slam final in a row, it would be the first time it has ever happened on the ATP Tour in the same calendar year; Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced each other in four straight finals across 2011 and 2012. Sinner and Alcaraz met in a final as recently as this week, but their Cincinnati Open contest was cut short in the first set with the Italian feeling unwell.

What's especially worrying for the rest of the field is that each time these two play each other, they each elevate the other a bit more and create ever-increasing distance from their peers. The other especially worrying thing is that they have another major milestone on the line: the world No. 1 ranking. If Alcaraz betters Sinner's result in New York, he will assume the world No. 1 ranking, having lost it to Sinner last year despite beating his nearest rival in all three of their meetings that year.

And they appear aware of the task at hand. “If we don't continue to improve, players will catch us,” Sinner said in a news conference Friday. “It's just a question of time.”

After winning all of the previous seven majors between them, it still doesn't look like happening anytime soon.

Charlie Eccleshare

Focussing on process rather than results is one if the biggest cliches in sports and life. As cliches go, it's not a bad one to follow.

Gauff became a walking billboard for it this week, when she switched technical coaches and embarked on the process of changing her serve just days before the start of her home Slam, which is arguably her most important tournament of the year.

Her new coach, Gavin MacMillan, achieved pretty fast results with Sabalenka three years ago when he worked with her. Her double faults dropped into the single digits from the neighborhood of 20 within a few weeks.

That doesn't mean that will happen for Gauff. She knows that.

“I'm looking at long-term,” Gauff said Friday. “I hope I can get it all together.” She knew she needed to make a change, even if that meant potentially sacrificing this tournament while she tries to learn on the fly.

“I don't want to waste time continuing to do the wrong things,” she said.

Matt Futterman



With every passing Grand Slam, the sandwich generation of 1990s-born players led by Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas seems to slip further and further away from genuine contention. Zverev, as the world No. 3, is slightly separate from this, but for Tsitsipas and Medvedev, it's been a miserable year. Especially at the Grand Slams, where they have two match wins between them in 2025.

Tsitsipas is battling an ongoing back injury and has given worrying quotes about how much it's affecting him, while Medvedev has looked hopelessly underpowered for much of the year.

Zverev said Friday that consideration has to be given to external factors when assessing a player's form, and that he expects both Medvedev and Tsitsipas to work their way back into the world's top 10. At present, though, the most likely genuine challengers to Sinner and Alcaraz would appear to be the players younger than them rather than the lost boys of men's tennis.

The U.S. Open mixed doubles event this week scored a big victory for the event in the Grand Slam arms race. There were gripes with the format and the lack of proper doubles players, but generally the event made plenty of dollars and headlines.

It was the first topic raised with Emma Raducanu in her news conference Friday, and she instantly suggested the other majors should follow suit. “Yeah, I think it would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format.

“I think it was a huge success.”

Of the remaining three, the French Open currently has no plans to alter its mixed-doubles format, while Wimbledon, typically the most traditional of the slams, looks unlikely to follow the U.S. Open's lead. The All England Lawn Tennis Club did not respond to a request for comment; nor did Tennis Australia, whose flagship event, the Australian Open, has tended to be the most innovative of the slams.

That said, every other slam from here on in, including the U.S. Open, can refine and rework the mixed-doubles event from the last week to make it an even more compelling package. Gauff, for instance, said in a news conference Friday that she very much enjoyed the event, but that it would benefit from more actual doubles teams.

The only proper doubles team taking part, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, retained their title by outclassing the singles stars brought in for the show.

Charlie Eccleshare

This tournament is notorious for its late finishes. It markets it and celebrates it. When matches finish in the small hours of the morning and players get to sleep as the sun is rising, it's talked about as an epic event, regardless of how bad it is for the people competing for one of the biggest prizes in their sport or any other.

This generally happens during the night sessions on the stadium courts, when two matches take place but don't start before 7 p.m. When a men's match goes more than four hours or a women's match goes more than three, the tournament has a Late Finishing Match policy, which it introduced last year. If a match isn't likely to start before 11:15 p.m., tournament officials have claimed the right to move it into or out of Louis Armstrong or Arthur Ashe Stadiums.

That doesn't mean they will. As the first weekend of last year's U.S. Open ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning, Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekic set a record for the latest-finishing women's match in U.S. Open history, with Zheng closing out match point at 2:15 a.m. That was just a few minutes later than the finish time for Sabalenka and Ekaterina Alexandrova's third-round match earlier in the first week. That had been down on the Friday, but started very early Saturday morning, at 12:08 a.m. It was the latest-starting match in U.S. Open history.

They will talk to the players about it and take their opinions into consideration, but don't have to follow them. Other factors include the pace of play in the match that is going long and delaying the following one, the status of the match and other factors.

What does that mean? Probably some more late nights at the U.S. Open.

TC Analyst Jim Courier predicted Alcaraz would have an advantage during a night session.ByDavid KanePublished Aug 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 24, 2025

NEW YORK—At 22 years old, Carlos Alcaraz is set to kick off his 2025 US Open campaign in hot pursuit of a sixth major title, which would tie him with Bjorn Borg for most Grand Slam victories before the age of 23.But first Alcaraz, fresh off a Masters 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open, will have to face big-serving American Reilly Opelka, one of the most dangerous floaters in the men's singles daw, in the opening round.Previewing the match on Tennis Channel Live, former Australian Open semifinalist Chanda Rubin argued that despite Alcaraz's strong form heading into Flushing Meadows, he “can't look past” Opelka.“I think it's always a dangerous match when you've got such a big-serving guy who can get hot, who can create some problems, and who can win quick points,” said Rubin. “With that being said, you still put everything on Alcaraz's side of the ledger with how he's coming in, with his form coming off the title in Cincinnati even though he didn't have to really complete that final. This is a place where he has thrived.”

This is a place where he has thrived.”

Alcaraz will face Opelka, a former world No. 17, for the first time on Arthur Ashe Stadium Monday night.

Standing at 6'11”, Opelka is one of the biggest servers on tour and a former world No. 17 in the midst of a comeback season after missing much of the last two years due to wrist and hip injuries. The 27-year-old started the 2025 season with a bang when he stunned Novak Djokovic at the Brisbane International and rocketed back up over 100 spots in the ATP rankings to put himself on the precipice of a Top 50 return. Alcaraz and Opelka have never played before, but the reigning Cincinnati Open champion has never lost a Grand Slam first round.Jim Courier echoed Rubin's sentiment, predicting Opelka's chances of an upset could come down to when the match is scheduled on Monday: Alcaraz and Opelka will follow Venus Williams' first round match Monday night on Arthur Ashe Stadium.“If I'm Alcaraz, I want to play at night because it slows things down even more,” said Courier. “When darkness settles, the temperature drops.”

Should Alcaraz get past Opelka, his road doesn't get much easier, argued Rubin, but the tough road could keep him sharp heading into the second week.“He's got a tough section, though, and you look at the potential quarter with Ben Shelton there, he's got some roadblocks up to that point. So, maybe that plays him into even better form as he gets later into the tournament, if he can survive, that will be interesting to see.”

In just his third F1 season, McLaren's Oscar Piastri is a firm title contender as he leads the Drivers' Championship ahead of his team mate Lando Norris. With just 10 race weekends left in 2025, the Australian looks back on his year so far and what's to come.

Over the course of 60 Grands Prix – and around two-and-a-half years – Oscar Piastri has gone from highly-rated rookie to standings leader, blossoming into a genuine contender for his first Formula 1 World Championship.

The 24-year-old Australian has delivered on expectation (he had immense success through junior formulae, winning Formula Renault Eurocup, F3 and F2 back-to-back) – and he's made steady and relentless progress since his debut in 2023.

In his first campaign, the McLaren racer twice reached the podium, scored points in 11 Grands Prix total, took a Sprint win and just finished shy of a century of points on 97.

""Anytime there's a role that focuses, to me, on the American experience of being Asian — that's something that no matter [if] you're Korean, Chinese, Indian, Malaysian, that's something we all share in common as Asian Americans,"" the actor explains.


							By

Associate Editor


Daniel Dae Kim is calling out what he believes is an “overcorrection” in nationality-specific casting for Asian roles.


	During a recent interview with American Masters PBS, the Butterfly actor shared why he believes there needs to be more thought behind casting for Asian and Asian American characters, as Asian actors are often held to more specific standards when it comes to identity compared to others. 




	“Right now, there's a focus on nationality-specific casting when it comes to Asian Americans that I feel is an overcorrection,” he said. “Very often, when we're cast, if the role calls for a Korean American, they will not see a Japanese American or Chinese American or any other Asian nationality.”

	However, Kim explained that often “the role itself has not been thought through,” yet they're already putting up nationality-specific barriers for actors who want to audition.


	“It doesn't require any kind of specificity in the story as it's being told, or in the specifics of the character, because very often, it's not even being written by an Asian person,” he continued. “So they don't know the difference in what they're asking for, and yet casting is being very specific.”


	The Hawaii Five-0 alum recognized that there are times when nationality-specific casting is “important,” such as when “there's an authentic language requirement in the role, or it's based on someone who's a real person that has cultural significance to that particular country.” But when the role centers on the broader Asian-American experience, Kim doesn't think there should be ethnic-based limitations when it comes to casting.

	











	“Anytime there's a role that focuses, to me, on the American experience of being Asian — that's something that no matter [if] you're Korean, Chinese, Indian, Malaysian, that's something we all share in common as Asian Americans,” he explained. “And we all know what it feels like to be othered. That's a common experience. So to me, the nationality isn't as important.”


	Though the Lost alum believes the focused effort began with good intentions, “because originally, it was like, ‘Well, we can't just consider them all as one,'” he encourages casting directors to be “a little bit more sophisticated now about how we can open opportunities to actors.”


	That's one of the reasons why Kim cast Reina Hardesty, who is Japanese American, as his Korean American character's daughter in his new Prime Video series Butterfly.


	“That was a deliberate choice on my part, because what the significant part of her character was is the idea of feeling alienated and alone in America. You don't have to be Korean American to feel that way,” he shared.


	Moving forward, the Avatar: The Last Airbender actor hopes for more open dialogue in Hollywood about the topic, especially since he has noticed “Asian American actors are often specified by nationality when other ethnicities are not.”


	“When African American actors are hired, very rarely are they asked, where is their country of ancestry? Whether you're Botswanan or from the Ivory Coast, it's not pertinent. Especially if you're playing an American,” Kim said.

	











	The actor also used non-American actors playing American comic book characters (such as British actors Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Henry Cavill) as another example to back up his observations when it comes to nationality-specific casting.


	“How many of our superheroes who are playing American are from other countries like Australia and England?” Kim asked. “And yet we don't ever ask whether that's important, relevant, and it doesn't limit them from taking those roles. In fact, we welcome them.”

""This is for all of you and for all your dreams, for maybe sometimes no more fighting, just showing up,"" the pop star told the audience at her Aug. 22 show.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Lady Gaga received a heartfelt pep talk from her fiancé, Michael Polansky, ahead of her Mayhem Ball tour stop in New York City.


	The 39-year-old pop superstar returned to her hometown on Friday (Aug. 22) for a two-hour show at Madison Square Garden, marking her first performance in the Big Apple since headlining MetLife Stadium during The Chromatica Ball in 2022.


	During the concert, Gaga paused to share the words of encouragement she received from Polansky, 41, and a close friend before taking the stage.

	











	“I think about walking on the concrete, going all around the city and just — I remember fighting really hard, fighting really hard for my dreams and what I believed in and for myself,” she told the crowd, according to People. “I was with my friend China before the show… and I said to her, ‘I think I might just fight my way through this whole show, ‘cause when I'm in New York, I fight. I gotta earn it, and I gotta go for it.”


	Gaga said her friend responded with something that shifted her mindset. “Sometimes you don't have to fight, you just have to show up,” she said.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The singer and actress added that Polansky echoed a similar sentiment. “Right before I came onstage, my fiancé, Michael, said, ‘When you go out there, let them fill you up,'” Gaga recalled, visibly emotional.


	From there, Gaga introduced her next song “Hair,” which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2011. It marked the first time she had performed the Born This Way track on the Mayhem Ball tour, which launched in mid-July.

	











	She described her second album as “very special” and credited New York as its creative foundation. “I'm sure all my albums could not be made without New York, but I am sure that this album would not have been made without New York,” she said. “This is for all of you and for all your dreams, for maybe sometimes no more fighting, just showing up.”


	As noted in Billboard‘s recap, Gaga's homecoming concert marked the start of a six-night run at Madison Square Garden as part of her globe-spanning Mayhem Ball tour. Check out the best moments from Friday's show here.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…: Two major global milestones were crossed this weekend as Warner Bros/DC's Superman passed the six-century mark — at $604.5M through Sunday — and Apple Original Films' F1, via WB, also pushed the needle past $600M, reaching $603.4M through today. 


	It's notable that Superman is seeing the majority of its money coming from domestic ($347M) with the international box office at $257.5M (42.6% of the total), while F1 is heavily being driven by overseas where the cume to date is $417.5M — or 69% of the worldwide take thus far. The global Imax tally is $94.4M.

	A little more about F1 before we dig into the rest of the weekend. The Joseph Kosinski-directed racing pic added $6.1M in this 9th frame, a 37% dip. It's Brad Pitt's biggest movie ever worldwide, and best ever in China for the actor as well as one of only three studio titles to cross $50M in that market this year.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Tops to date are: China ($59.2M), Korea ($35.2M), France ($30M), UK ($29.7M) and Mexico ($19.9M).


	Speaking of China, New Line/WB's Final Destinations Bloodlines finally released in the market this weekend, and to very positive results amid strong local titles.


	The opening session there is an estimated $8.2M, lifting the international cume to $157.4M and sending global close to $300M, currently at $295.5M through today. 


	As we saw last year with Alien: Romulus, there has been some relaxation of censorship for horror/R-rated films, and audiences are responding. This weekend marks the first time the Final Destination franchise had ever been played in mainland China cinemas.

	











	Staying in Asia for a moment, Japanese hit Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle added another $10.5M in the markets where Crunchyroll/Sony have the movie. The offshore cume for Sony is $34.7M. Not included here is Japan, where Toho/Aniplex release (we will update that total once it becomes available), and Korea which killed it at open this session with a leading $13M. The global total is now well above $200M.


	There are nine Southeast Asian Sony markets in release so far, including this weekend's new opener, Philippines. The start there was huge at $4.2M, making it the top anime film ever in the market. In Thailand, Infinity Castle has become the biggest anime and animated movie of all time and the top film of the year ($6M). Other holdover markets further elevated their record totals as the highest grossing anime film of all time: Hong Kong ($7.1M), Indonesia ($6.2M) and Malaysia ($5M).  


	In Imax, the global total is $28.5M. In Japan, Infinity Castle has become the highest-grossing for Imax ever, overtaking Mugen Train. Korea's weekend debut of $1.4M makes it Imax's biggest ever 3-day opening for the country, besting Avatar: The Way of Water.


	There are many more markets on deck including North America, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, UK, Spain, France and Germany.


	Leading other continued play, New Line/Warner Bros' Weapons continues to hold well, dropping 31% internationally with a $13.2M 3rd frame. The offshore cume is now $83.5M in 74 markets, and global is thisclose to $200M at $199.4M through Sunday. 


	The Top 5 overseas plays are: UK ($11.6M), Mexico ($7.5M), Spain ($5.7M), France ($5.6M) and Australia ($5.1M).


	With a terrific 29% drop, Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 added another $12M to its overseas coffers for an $83M running international cume in 68 markets. Global is now $149.1M.


	The offshore performance, excluding China, is pacing 19% above the original film. 


Italy was new this frame, opening at No. 1 with $1.7M. China had a strong second weekend of $4.5M (-32%), taking the cume there to $16.4M through Sunday. During the week there, the sequel surpassed the lifetime of Trolls and this weekend overtook Elemental. 


France had a great -5% hold in weekend 4, the best in the market, as the No.1 film for the session. 


	The Top 5 to date are: China ($16.4M), UK ($13.7M), France ($8.7M), Spain ($6.2M) and Mexico ($5.5M).


	Germany and Australia are still to release.


	Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth this week became only the 3rd studio title to cross $500M at the international box office, reaching $508.6M through Sunday. The weekend added $6.2M in 83 markets. Excluding China, the overall overseas performance to date is on par with Jurassic World Dominion. The global total is $844.1M.


	Here are the Top 5 to date: China ($79M), UK ($47.3M), Mexico ($36.4M), Germany ($32.6M) and France ($28.4M).


	Disney's Freakier Friday had a solid 35% drop in its 3rd frame, notably with the UK down just 19% and Mexico, Australia, Italy, Germany and France all sliding within the 30s. The full overseas weekend was $6.2M for a running $42.8M international cume and $113.3M global.


	Strong play continues in Latin American markets with the sequel remaining the No. 1 title in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Central America, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina (non-local), Uruguay (non-local) and the region as a whole.

	











	The Top 5 markets to date are: UK ($7.9M), Mexico ($7.6M), Australia ($3.3M), Argentina ($2.3M) and Colombia ($2.2M).


	Still to open are Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. 


	Dakota Johnson/Pedro Pascal/Chris Evans-starrer Materialists just keeps cranking out strong numbers, this weekend adding $6.2M in 57 markets for a $48.6M international running cume and $85.1M global. Sony has overseas on the A24 pic which is still to release in Italy next month.


	Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps — also starring Pedro Pascal — is nearing the five-century mark with $490.1M worldwide through the 5th session. International reps $232.8M of the running total. 


	Although it is skewing more towards domestic, FF:FS is the highest-grossing superhero movie of the year in Italy, Spain, Mexico and the whole of Latin America. It is again No. 1 in Brazil this weekend.


	The offshore take was $5.8M (-42%) across all international markets. The Top 5 of those to date are: UK ($29.5M), Mexico ($27.4M), France ($15.4M), Brazil ($13.5M) and Australia ($11.1M).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix summons its first box office win with KPop Demon Hunters","https://www.avclub.com/box-office-august-24-2025-kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-weapons","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 18:35:02 GMT","

A Netflix movie has breached containment. As predicted, KPop Demon Hunters, the animated musical that premiered two months ago on the streamer and has since become its second-most-watched movie ever, is expected to become Netflix's first number one at the box office. Scooping up an estimated $18 million from two days of sing-along screenings, per The Numbers, KPop Demon Hunters is doing something Netflix has long avoided: collecting money from consumers for a specific product. Again, we must note that these are estimates. KPop Demon Hunters was only a Saturday-Sunday specialty release, so its Sunday take has yet to be determined, as it has not yet happened.

Unlike Happy Gilmore 2 and numerous other movies that Netflix reports monster viewership data on, KPop Demon Hunters exists outside the platform. Three of its earworms, “Golden,” “Your Idol,” and “Soda Pop,” charted on Billboard‘s top 10 last week. It makes sense that Demon Hunters would break out of Netflix's reality distortion field and appear in actual culture, since Netflix didn't make it. In 2021, Sony made the movie for Netflix to release under a “‘direct-to-platform' arrangement,” per Puck, a move made around the height of the pandemic and before theaters started reopening en masse. But who's to say if Demon Hunters would've been a hit without the two months on Netflix preceding these specialty screenings? It certainly shows that some audiences are willing to indulge in a theater ticket despite having seen the movie numerous times on Netflix. The sing-alongs were only playing on 1,700 screens, making it the rare instance of fans putting in work to see a Netflix release, as opposed to settling for whatever's on because they're already pretty much finished with their dinner anyway.

Weapons held up this weekend strongly. Dropping a modest 36%, Zach Cregger's horror film Naruto ran to another $15.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $115 million. Additionally, Freakier Friday kept on chugging along with $9.2 million for the weekend. Jamie Lee Curtis must be feeling good that her Lindsay Lohan reclamation project gave the former Mean Girl her biggest hit since Mean Girls and proved Curtis' comments about the MCU last summer correct. Indeed, Marvel must be in its “bad” phase, as evidenced by another “FF,” Fantastic Four: First Steps, which made $5.9 million, continuing its disappointing box office stretch for Disney.

A little farther down the top 10, the second part of Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke's “lesbian B-movie trilogy,” Honey Don't, made about $3 million on 1,300 screens. The movie may be causing critics to say, “Honey, don't,” toward the prospect of he couple completing their trilogy, but the film scored the highest per-screen average of any movie outside the top three. Meanwhile, America, once again, gave a hard pass on what the rest of the world thinks is cool. The highest-grossing animated movie of all time, Ne Zha II, landed with a thud in America. The English dub of the chaotic orb-chasing epic added $1.5 million in the United States to its $2 billion global take and failed to break into the top 10. Proving America prefers subs over dubs, the subtitled Ne Zha II grossed $17 million during a three-week run in February. Maybe it should've hit streaming first?

Here's the full top 10:

1) KPop Demon Hunter Sing-Along Event

2) Weapons

3) Freakier Friday

4) The Fantastic Four: First Steps

5) The Bad Guys 2

6) Nobody 2

7) Superman

Julian Lynch is leaving Real Estate. “I'm so grateful to have been able to spend most of the last decade creating, performing, and traveling with my friends in the band,” the singer and guitarist wrote on Instagram. He will not join Real Estate on their upcoming “11 year and seven month anniversary tour” of their 2014 album Atlas.

Lynch continued: “Next week's brief leg of touring with Tennis will hold special significance for me, since these will be my final shows with the band before I move onto other things.

							By 

	Peter Wade



Alina Habba — Trump's former personal lawyer who, a court recently ruled, has been illegally serving as U.S. attorney in New Jersey — accused federal judges of “a collusion” against her.


	U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann said last week that Habba “is not lawfully holding the office of United States Attorney” because the Senate has not confirmed her position, and the time limit during which she can serve as interim U.S. attorney without such confirmation expired on July 1. Late last month, because Habba's interim term was ending, New Jersey district court judges exercised their judicial power under the law and named Habba's second-in-command in the prosecutor's office to serve as her replacement. Attorney General Pam Bondi then fired Habba's replacement and renamed Habba as acting U.S. attorney.


	Habba is now saying those district judges did not have the authority to name her replacement, even though the U.S. code says: “If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the district court for such district may appoint a United States attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.”

	











	“What they don't understand is Article III [of the Constitution]. Judges do not pick the U.S. attorney for the state. The president, Pam Bondi — that's who picks it,” Habba said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. “They had a collusion, a plan. I'm aware of it, and the DOJ is aware of it, and soon enough it'll come out.”


	But Habba appears to be overlooking Article II of the Constitution that states the president can nominate officers of the U.S. “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.”

	











	Habba also offered no evidence of collusion.


	Habba additionally falsely claimed that Trump “was rightfully voted in by a majority of Americans.” Trump, in fact, did not win a majority of the votes, though he did win a majority of the electoral college and a plurality of the popular vote. Neither Harris nor Trump earned more than half of Americans' votes in the 2024 election.

Alina Habba: ""The president was rightfully voted in by a majority of Americans.""(This is a lie — Trump won a plurality but not a majority.)


	And even though the president has the right to nominate prosecutors, they must be confirmed by the Senate, per the Constitution. Habba's nomination is currently still in the Senate Judiciary Committee because two New Jersey senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, are exercising their power to block a nominee in their home state by not submitting a procedural “blue slip.” The blue slip policy “incentivizes consultation between the White House and home-state senators on judicial nominees, ensuring that nominees are mainstream and well-suited to serve in their states,” former Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in 2017 when she served as ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.


	So far, Republican Judiciary Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley has stood up to Trump and refused to push Habba's nomination forward without blue slips from Booker and Kim — despite Trump pushing him to bypass the blue slip requirement. Even if Grassley did bypass the blue slip process, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis has said he would block Habba's nomination.


	“Maybe there's a strategic calculation I just don't understand,” Tillis said of the administration's desire to flout the blue slip tradition. “But I think it could be problematic for future Judiciary Committees, particularly when the Democrats have the gavel.”


	Habba on Fox expressed her frustration with Grassley and Tillis. “I would say to Senator Tillis and Senator Grassley, you are becoming part of the issue,” she said. “You are becoming part of the antithesis of what we fought for four years.”


	Habba's short tenure as U.S. attorney for New Jersey was not without controversy. She indicted Democratic Rep.

Hey, a free parking spot!

We might not know whether aliens exist (no, they weren't at a Miami mall last year, although first contact would be far from the weirdest thing to happen in Florida), but that hasn't stopped people from preparing for their potential arrival to Earth. Some people might stockpile weapons, others might DIY welcome signs, but back in 1967, one Canadian town tackled arguably the most important preparation of all: a decent parking spot.

That's right – in the town of St Paul in Northern Alberta lies the world's first ever UFO landing pad. The idea came about as part of Canada's centennial celebrations, and once approved by the government, saw the construction of a large platform sat atop six 75-centimeter (30-inch)-tall concrete pylons. The platform is circular, of course, because all UFOs are flying saucer-shaped, right?

Some people might've rolled their eyes at the idea, but not the residents of St Paul – this was a community-led project, and it seems the whole town was more than willing to join in with the fun when it opened back in June 1967.

“To make the expected celestial visitors feel at home, flying saucers have started to sprout in backyards,” explained a news report at the time. “One businessman donated a bus called the ‘Martian Express' to take care of earthly transportation problems.” We're not quite sure that measures up to a machine capable of flying all the way from Mars, but we're here for the enthusiasm.

“So far, the only low-flying UFOs to be lured down are the paper variety popular with children, but the local citizens are sure that even the Martians won't be able to resist their western hospitality for long,” the report continued. Unfortunately for them, that doesn't seem to have been the case – we'd like to think we'd certainly know about it if a UFO had plonked down in a small Canadian town.

Of course, the whole thing is a little tongue-in-cheek. But look past all the flying saucer décor and “Little Green Men” memorabilia, and the true message at the heart of this parking spot is one that was apt at the time and remains so now. It's one of peace and unity – something very human indeed.

“The area under the world's first UFO landing pad was designated international by the town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife,” reads the sign next to the landing pad. “That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings. All visitors from Earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the town of St. Paul.”

Unless it's a Monday at the gift shop, that is – they're closed on Mondays.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","UAP students raise voice for affordable medicines","https://bangladeshpost.net/posts/uap-students-raise-voice-for-affordable-medicines-159445","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 18:40:09 GMT","

Students of the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) have taken a proactive step in advocating for public access to affordable medicines. The Ingenious Marketing Club of UAP organized a day-long awareness campaign titled “Advocating for Citizens' Right to Affordable Medicines” on Sunday at the UAP Plaza, highlighting concerns over rising drug prices and limited access to essential healthcare in Bangladesh.

The inauguration ceremony was graced by Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Qumrul Ahsan, Advisor to the VC Prof. Dr. Mohiuddin Ahmed Bhuiyan, and Prof. Dr. M. A. Baqui Khalily, Dean of the School of Business. Speaking at the event, Vice Chancellor Dr. Ahsan emphasized, “Access to affordable medicines is not just an economic issue; it is a fundamental right. I am proud that our students are taking proactive steps to highlight this concern and using their skills in marketing to create social impact.”

The campaign witnessed enthusiastic participation, with over 60 teams registering and more than 40 submitting creative ideas. Eight teams reached the final round, presenting their solutions through interactive stalls, presentations, and live demonstrations. 

Dean Dr. Khalily praised the initiative, stating, “These students have proven that marketing is not only for profit-making but also for promoting values and social responsibility.”

The closing ceremony featured Architect Mahbuba Haque, Chairperson of the UAP Board of Trustees, as chief guest. She lauded the students for demonstrating leadership and empathy in addressing this pressing social issue. Prizes were awarded to the top three teams for their innovative ideas and social impact.

Over the years, the Ingenious Marketing Club has championed campaigns on social causes, reaffirming its commitment to using marketing as a tool for societal benefit.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/UFOs","Trump putting the National Guard in major cities feels like a precursor to something bigger that's about to happen.","https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1mz4fbn/trump_putting_the_national_guard_in_major_cities/","Sun, 24 Aug 2025 19:07:39 GMT","


      When Trump decided to put the National Guard in D.C. I began to suspect that something might be going on behind the scenes that is prompting him to put the military in our cities. It's a bold move and for me, unsettling.
    


      So what's the real reason? I have a few theories.
    


      3I/Atlas is something that, when we find out about what it really is, could cause social disruption and disorder across the major metropolitan areas.
    


      The Putin meeting. Maybe something bad is about to happen, and he wants the military in the major cities to suppress marches and the backlash from whatever is about to happen
    


      Maybe it's related to his health, and if he suddenly dies, he thinks there will be riots in the streets?
    


      UFO disclosure? What if he's about to drop a bomb. Maybe the staffers saw Trump and Putin morph into reptiles. :) I'm open to ideas.
    


      Either way, I'm open to some alternative thoughts. I personally think it's UFO-related, but I acknowledge it's a stretch.

Live Updates


            • Law enforcement crackdown: President Donald Trump plans to send the National Guard to Chicago as part of an expanding anti-crime agenda in major US cities. Democrats and local leaders are pushing back, saying Trump's claims are at odds with the facts on the ground and an attempt to distract from unpopular policies.
    


            • Deportation push: Trump's law enforcement efforts have gone hand in hand with his goal of ramping up deportations. The deployment of federal agencies in Washington, DC, this month led to a huge spike in immigration arrests.
    


            • Trump's feuds: The president has threatened funding for bridge reconstruction in Baltimore due to an escalating clash with Maryland's governor over crime. Read CNN's analysis on the president's growing list of retribution campaigns.
    


            • Ukraine war: A top US envoy attended an Independence Day event in Kyiv today as Trump's efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine appear to have stalled, despite a flurry of diplomacy.
    


            As we've been reporting today, a feud is escalating between Donald Trump and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore over the president's use of the National Guard for his anti-crime agenda.
    


            Trump threatened today to cut federal funding for the reconstruction of a Baltimore bridge, alluding to what he described as “nasty and provocative” comments from Moore that Trump should walk the streets of Maryland with him before making judgments about crime in the state.
    


            That came after Moore publicly challenged the president to visit in an interview Friday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


If you missed it, here's a clip of the full interview, with the specific comments beginning about three minutes in:



            There is a growing field of evidence contradicting President Donald Trump's claim that foreign countries and overseas businesses are eating the cost of tariffs.
    


Economic data, academic research, businesses' expenses, and people's firsthand experiences are showing that it's American firms and consumers who are seeing increasingly higher costs due to the tariffs.
    


            That burden is expected to grow only heavier in the months — and, potentially, years — to come as more tariffs take effect, and others settle more deeply into supply chains.
    


Here's how:



Feud with the Fed: Meanwhile, Trump continues to heap criticism — and pressure to resign — on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his decision not to lower interest rates sooner.
    


            Powell has defended the central bank's independence, citing the need for steady review of the economic impact of the administration's aggressive trade policy and changes to immigration before making monetary policy moves.
    


CNN's Elisabeth Buchwald and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump is expected to host South Korean President Lee Jae-myung tomorrow for a closely watched meeting between the US and a key economic and national security ally.
    


            Lee won election and took office in June after his predecessor, President Yoon Suk Yeol, was removed from office for declaring martial law.
    


            This will marks Lee's first visit to the US since his inauguration, a key opportunity for the South Korean leader to cultivate ties with Trump amid questions about future of the US-South Korea alliance under Trump's diplomatic unpredictability.
    


Key topics to watch for:



            • Trade: The two countries struck a deal ahead of Trump's August 1 tariff deadline, with the US placing 15% tariffs on South Korean goods. Trump is also expected to highlight $350 billion in South Korean investment in the US, including $150 billion for the shipbuilding industry.
    


            • The nuclear threat of North Korea: Kim Jong Un oversaw the firing of test missiles yesterday ahead of the meeting, in a key sign of tensions.
    


            • Taiwan: The possibility of conflict over the island, which is self-governed by an elected government but also claimed by China, is expected to be front and center as Beijing has recently escalated its military activity.
    


            • More background: The South Korean president is already coming off of a historic summit with Japan's prime minister. Read CNN's analysis on why Trump loomed large at the meeting.
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo and Hanako Montgomery contributed to this report. 



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries reacted to President Donald Trump's recent criticism of the Smithsonian's “woke” exhibits and what the president described as too much focus on “how bad slavery was.”

            Let's step back now for a look at the Trump administration on the global stage, with a recap of our latest foreign policy reporting.
    


Ukraine:



            • Use of long-range weapons: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia. Zelensky said he hasn't discussed the issue with the US recently. “This is news to me,” he told reporters.
    


            • Some analysis: “I can understand why they would limit the use of certain long-range systems against Russia when they think that Russia might still be willing to make a deal. But that should be very clear not to be the case at this moment, and I hope that there will be a review of that policy,” former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said today on ABC's “This Week.” Petraeus voiced skepticism at the idea Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Zelensky soon, saying the Russian leader is “the clear obstacle to peace at this point in time.”
    


Iran: 



            • Stalled talks: Iran will never be “obedient” to the US, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a defiant address today, according to state media. Negotiations between Iran and the US on Tehran's nuclear program have not resumed since both the US and Israel carried out airstrikes against Iran in June.
    


South Korea and Japan:



            • Historic summit: Trump's presence loomed large when South Korean President Lee Jae-myung traveled to Japan — the country's former colonizer — and issued the first joint statement with a Japanese prime minister in 17 years. Read CNN's analysis on how the warming relations could reflect a response to Trump's unpredictable foreign policy.
    


            As President Donald Trump prepares to expand his crackdown on cities he claims are overrun with crime, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN the administration should focus on aiding local authorities with specific issues, not scoring political points.
    


Watch his discussion with CNN's Dana Bash below:



            President Donald Trump has heightened his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.
    


            In a series of social media posts, the president attacked Moore's record on crime and tied reconstruction funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to a political dispute over deploying the National Guard to major US cities.
    


                    “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland' with him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk,'” he added.
                





            The post came after Moore publicly challenged Trump to visit Baltimore in response to the president's claims about rising crime in US cities.
    


                    “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???” Trump wrote, referring to the Baltimore bridge that collapsed after being hit by a ship last year, killing six people.
                





            Moore responded today in an interview on CBS' “Face the Nation,” saying, “The president is spending all this time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. I believe we have to be able to address the issue of crime.”
    


            Trump has continued to group Democratic states and cities such as Baltimore with others he claims are in decline due to crime rates, though local officials have refuted some of his claims.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats are ready to ensure “Donald Trump cannot steal the midterm elections” on the back of GOP efforts to redraw congressional maps.
    


            Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash on the plan to redistrict in his state of New York, Jeffries said he's spoken with Gov. Kathy Hochul about the issue, and there's a plan to respond “in New York and in other parts of the country as the circumstances dictate.”
    


            Jeffries also brushed off concerns that Republicans could redraw enough seats to ensure they successfully defend their House majority next year, pointing to Democrats' sweeping pickups in the midterm elections during Trump's first administration.
    


                    “There's no way that Republicans can mathematically gerrymander their way to an artificial victory next year,” the minority leader said on CNN's State of the Union.
                





The big picture: There's an expanding battle over partisan redistricting unfolding across the country, with President Donald Trump backing the GOP-led effort.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to soon sign into law new congressional maps that could help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in the midterms. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading an effort to redraw the state's own congressional maps to offset the Republican gains.
    


What the administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance defended the Texas GOP's move this morning, claiming in an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” that it was an effort to make elections “more fair” and a response to Democratic gerrymandering.
    


            While both parties engage in the practice, Democrats have handed away their power to gerrymander in some states, including California, where a nonpartisan commission draws congressional maps. That's why Newsom's effort now requires a statewide referendum to succeed.
    


CNN's Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the Trump administration's plans to send National Guard troops into Chicago, telling CNN the president should not “play games” with people's lives.
    


            Jeffries backed Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's assertion that the Trump administration has “no authority” to send in the troops.
    


                    “We should continue to support local law enforcement, and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
                





Some context: Trump said Friday he plans to widen his controversial law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities, singling out Chicago by name. CNN has since reported that the administration has been planning that move for weeks.
    


            Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is also pushing back, saying federal intervention would only threaten to undo local efforts that have produced significant reductions in serious crimes.
    


            The recent FBI searches of former national security adviser John Bolton's home and office was “clearly retribution” by the Trump administration, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff told NBC's “Meet the Press” in an interview today.
    


                    “The idea that they just picked John Bolton, a prominent critic of the president, at random — what the President is trying to do here is very systemic and systematic,” Schiff said. “And that is anyone who stands up to the president, anyone who criticizes the president … gets the full weight of the federal government brought down on them.”
                





            The search was part of a renewed investigation into whether Bolton disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, CNN previously reported.
    


            Schiff said his own legal battle with the administration is another example of the president using mechanisms of the federal government against perceived enemies.
    


            Last month, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a Trump ally, referred the California senator to the Justice Department over allegations of mortgage fraud. Schiff said the allegations are “patently false.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance is projecting optimism on the prospect of ending Russia's war in Ukraine, saying in a new interview that Russia has made “significant concessions” and the US will “keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.”
    


                    “They've actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands,” Vance said of Moscow in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's “Meet the Press,” adding that it's clearer now what it will take to the end the war. “Of course, they haven't been completely there yet.”
                





            The vice president's comments come as Russia-Ukraine peace talks appear to have stalled after some momentum earlier this month.
    


            President Donald Trump said last week that he could ultimately decide to walk away from negotiations, but Vance indicated the US will continue to be involved: “We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall, and if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.”
    


Use of long-range weapons: Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia.
    


            “To be frank, we have not discussed such issues with the US recently,” Zelensky said, when asked about the reports at a Ukrainian Independence Day event.
    


            “There used to be, you remember, various signals regarding our strikes in response to their strikes on our energy sector. That was a long time ago. Today, we don't even mention it. This is news to me,” he added.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.
    


            The Trump administration has been dogged by weeks of controversy over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, and that scrutiny continues this weekend.
    


First, a quick recap: As promised, the Justice Department started providing the House Oversight Committee with thousands of pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case on Friday.
    


            The committee has vowed to release them publicly, but only after lawmakers ensure they've made any further redactions needed to protect the victims. We don't currently have a timetable for that release.
    


            The DOJ also released transcripts and audio from its interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell last week — though she did not make any bombshell accusations or provide much revelatory information.
    


Now, Democrats sound unimpressed with the new files: Members of the party on the House Oversight Committee are decrying what they say is a lack of new records provided to the panel.
    


                    “Only 3% of the documents given to the Oversight Committee are new. The rest are already in the public domain. Less than 1% of files have been released. DOJ is stonewalling,” Rep. Ro Khanna of California said in a statement yesterday.
                





            Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania also claimed the DOJ's files are “largely thousands of pages of recycled content already made available to the public.”
    


            We'll bring you any further comment on the Epstein files from Trump administration officials and Democrats as they make the rounds this morning on Sunday political talk shows.
    


            As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump says he plans to widen the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities.
    


            Trump singled out Chicago in the Oval Office on Friday, and it has since emerged that his administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to the city, according to two officials who spoke with CNN.
    


Here's how some big city mayors are responding:



Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Friday that he had not received any formal communication about the administration sending federal law enforcement or troops there, but that he takes the president's statements “seriously.”
    


            Federal intervention would threaten to undo local efforts that have already seen significant reductions in serious crimes, Johnson said.
    


                    “The problem with the President's approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound,” Johnson wrote in a statement. “Unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities.”
                





Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Trump's move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June during protests against the administration was a “test case” for further overreach, as was his DC crackdown.
    


            “The president (can) say, ‘Well we can take over your city whenever we want and I am the commander in chief and I can use the troops whenever we want.' I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers,” Bass told CNN.
    


Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded last week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House's immigration crackdown.
    


                    “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,” Wu said. “Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law.”
                





            Elsewhere, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts — but little concrete progress — since US President Donald Trump's recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


We've rounded up the latest lines on the conflict for you, below:



            • Trump's letter: The US president sent a letter of support to Ukraine as the country marks the anniversary of declaring itself free of Soviet rule. Zelensky shared the letter on X and delivered his own message on the country's 34th Independence Day: We will not lose. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.
    


            • Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal “will be ready in the coming days,” following calls with several world leaders.
    


            Security guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv's western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.
    


            • Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward “full-scale restoration” of the countries' relationship.
    


            In comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.
    


            • Trump's deadline extended — again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.
    


            Asked by CNN's Alayna Treene if there's a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn't come to the table, Trump said, “We'll see. I'll see whose fault it is.”
    


            Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments on Donald Trump's presidency.
    


            The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as the president looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.
    


            It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.
    


            Trump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The Washington Post first reported on the plans.
    


In case you missed this, the Texas Senate early Saturday morning approved new congressional maps designed to help Republicans win up to five more US House seats in next year's midterm elections.
    


            This marked the final legislative hurdle for the redistricting plan endorsed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott, which has evolved into a national battle over partisan redistricting.
    


Watch the moment it happened, below:



            The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, according to a notice sent by a Department of Homeland Security official to his lawyers Friday.
    


            The notice, made public in a court filing in Abrego Garcia's human smuggling criminal case in Tennessee, came minutes after he was released from criminal custody pending his trial on the federal charges.
    


            “Let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” the notice read in part.
    


            Abrego Garcia's lawyers accused the government of using the notice to try to “coerce” Abergo Garcia to accept a plea deal in his case.
    


                    “There is a perfectly reasonable option available, Costa Rica, where he his family can visit him easily, but instead they are attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language. This is not justice; it is retaliation,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CNN in a statement.
                





The big picture: The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the US in June to face his charges, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's sweeping deportation push.
    


            Critics have pointed to the wrongful deportation as a prime example of what they say is a chaotic and cruel immigration crackdown, while the Trump administration has doubled down on its claims Abrego Garcia is a criminal with no right to remain in the US.

No. 3 seed Diana Shnaider won her fifth career WTA singles title by defeating compatriot Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. It's Shnaider's second title at the WTA 500-level and her straight victory in a singles final. In doubles, Cristina Bucsa and Nicole Melichar Martinez dominated to claim the title without dropping a set.

If Diana Shnaider and Ekaterina Alexandrova noticed the threat of rain Saturday night in Monterrey, they were unwilling to let it distract them.

After a brief shower delayed play just two points into the match, the two battled for more than two hours under gray skies to decide the Abierto GNP Seguros 2025 champion.

In the end, it was Shnaider who prevailed, defeating her compatriot 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes to capture her second WTA 500 singles title and fifth career WTA singles title overall.

Since losing her first career singles final, Shnaider has won five straight.

“Thank you crowd for coming today and supporting us,” Shnaider said while addressing the fans after the match. “The atmosphere was incredible. It was a pleasure to play, it was a pleasure to show high quality tennis and I hope you enjoyed this week in Monterrey.

“Muchas gracias, Monterrey, and see you next year.”

The win marks Shnaider's first singles title of 2025, adding to her two doubles titles this season, including a WTA 1000 title in Miami.

The path to the title was nothing short of a grind for Shnaider. She went 4-0 in tiebreaks during the week and survived a three-hour, three-set battle against World No. 13 Elise Mertens just to reach the semifinals.

The final was no less demanding.

After taking the first set comfortably, Shnaider broke Alexandrova at love to open the second. But Alexandrova responded, leveling the set at 2-2 and breaking Shnaider twice more to force a decider.

In the third set, Shnaider again broke early — and this time held firm. She saved both break points she faced in the final set, and seven of 10 overall to seal the win.

Shnaider will now rest before opening her US Open campaign Tuesday against Laura Siegemund. Alexandrova faces Anastasija Sevastova in her first round-match the same day.

Cristina Bucsa and Nicole Melichar Martinez capped a flawless week in Monterrey with a commanding win in Saturday's doubles final.

The No. 4 seeds defeated No. 3 seeds Guo Hanyu and Alexandra Panova 6-2, 6-0 in just 52 minutes to claim the Abierto GNP Seguros 2025 doubles title — without dropping a set all tournament.

It's their first title together in only their second event as partners.

Bucsa earned her seventh career WTA doubles title and second of the season. Melichar-Martinez notched her 16th career doubles title and first of 2025. 

After losing 10 consecutive doubles finals between 2022 and 2024, Melichar-Martinez has now won her last four.

No. 3 seed Diana Shnaider won her fifth career WTA singles title by defeating compatriot Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 11 minutes.

Iconic Nico Rosberg onboards

With Mercedes currently holding third place in the Teams' Championship, we reflect back on the Silver Arrows' season so far in their half term report.

The 2025 season marked a new era for Mercedes, with George Russell stepping up as team leader while rookie Kimi Antonelli arrived to fill the vacancy left by Lewis Hamilton. A strong start to the campaign was followed by a run of tougher races – but after reverting to an older package seemed to deliver results just before the summer break, can the Silver Arrows maintain this into the second half of the year? Here is their half term report…

George Russell – 1st in Canada

Russell looked to be in a good run of form when the campaign kicked off, the Briton standing on the podium at four of the opening six races. The European triple header was more challenging for both Russell and Antonelli – but better was to come at Round 10 in Canada.

In a repeat of what happened at the same venue 12 months earlier, Russell grabbed pole position in Qualifying. However, unlike the 2024 event – in which he lost out on the win to Max Verstappen – the Mercedes driver this time converted that P1 grid slot into victory.

The result was made all the sweeter by the other W16 of Antonelli making it a double podium in third place, marking the first time that the Italian had stood on the rostrum in his young F1 career.

Russell 13-1 Antonelli

Perhaps unsurprisingly during Antonelli's first season in the top echelon, Russell has outscored the rookie in all but one Grand Prix Qualifying session so far, with his best showing being that pole position in Montreal.

The weekend in which Antonelli put himself ahead of his more experienced team mate on the grid was at Round 6 in Miami, the youngster taking P3 while Russell lined up two places behind. This also came just one day after Antonelli clinched pole in Sprint Qualifying, making him the youngest driver in F1 history to take pole position in any format.

Russell 14-0 Antonelli

Russell has also led the way on Sundays from Antonelli, having crossed the line before his fellow Silver Arrows driver at every Grand Prix during the first half of the season. And while Russell is yet to suffer a DNF, Antonelli has had worse luck, recording four retirements so far.

Points-wise, Russell is currently sitting in P4 of the Drivers' Championship with a tally of 172 points, 108 more than Antonelli in seventh place. This has given Mercedes a total of 236 points, putting them third in the Teams' Standings.

There were certainly a few highlights for the team during the early run of races, whether it was third and fourth place for Russell and Antonelli at the season-opener in Australia, Russell's impressive drive to P2 amid various car issues in Bahrain or Antonelli's Sprint Qualifying pole in Miami.

But the greatest moment of all was that victory and double podium in Canada. The signs were promising on Saturday, with Russell hailing his pole-setting Qualifying performance as “one of the most exhilarating laps of my life”.

From there, the cooler conditions at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve continued to favour the W16 on race day and Russell scored his and the team's first win of the campaign – one that he felt made up for the “victory lost” in 2024 – while Antonelli put in a solid drive to take a career-best P3.

When F1 kicked off its European leg with a triple header spanning Imola, Monaco and Spain, this also brought with it a tricky run for Mercedes. Antonelli retired from his home race as well as in Barcelona, while Russell was involved in a controversial collision with the Red Bull of Verstappen at the latter event.

However, the toughest weekend of all for the Silver Arrows was at Round 8 in Monte Carlo. Both drivers suffered early exits in Qualifying, with Antonelli crashing out during the final minutes of Q1 while Russell's car lost power in Q2, leaving the pair to start from P15 and P14 respectively.

Things did not improve come Sunday, as both drivers found themselves stuck in traffic. Russell became so frustrated at being unable to pass the Williams of Alex Albon that he cut the Nouvelle Chicane to overtake, a decision he received a drive-through penalty for. Crossing the line in P11 – with Antonelli back in P18 – it proved to be the only weekend so far in which Mercedes have scored no points.

Having struggled for pace in comparison to their rivals across recent races, the decision to revert back to a previous suspension just before the summer break in Hungary seemed to pay off for Mercedes, with Russell returning to the podium while Antonelli scored his first points since Canada.

With this seemingly suggesting that the introduction of a newer package back in May was the cause of their issues, the Brackley-based outfit will be hoping that this change in direction will set them on the right path for the second half of the campaign.

This decision also appeared crucial in building confidence for Antonelli, the rookie having endured some ups and downs during his debut season so far. Russell, meanwhile, has been praised by Technical Director James Allison for “setting a very, very high bar”, meaning that both drivers will be looking to build on this further going forward.

Off the track, much talk has centred around Mercedes' driver line-up for 2026 amid speculation linking Verstappen to the team. However, with the Dutchman recently stating that he will remain with Red Bull, this topic is likely to be less of an external focus, with Russell conceding that it is a case of “when not if” he will sign a new deal with the squad.

Should that soon be settled, both Russell and Antonelli will be focused on trying to chase down Ferrari in the Teams' Championship and reclaim the P2 that they held in the earlier stages of the season.

Plus: Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album, while Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift surge back into top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem notches its 12th nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart (dated Aug. 30). The set earned 121,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Aug. 21 (down 4%), according to Luminate. I'm the Problem debuted at No. 1 on the May 31-dated chart, spent it first eight weeks in the pole position, stepped away from the top for two weeks and then returned to No. 1 for four weeks running.

	











	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album yet as Wishbone bows at No. 3, Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft jumps back into the top 10 after a new one-year anniversary vinyl variant was released, and Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department returns to the top 10 following the buzz surrounding the announcement of her upcoming The Life of a Showgirl album.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 30, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Aug. 26. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of I'm the Problem's 121,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 21, SEA units comprise 116,000 (down 4%, equaling 154.02 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a 13th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 4,000 (up 1%; it moves 21-17 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 1%).


	Cumulatively, Wallen's three No. 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 41 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That puts him in second place for the most weeks at No. 1 this century, surpassing Adele's 40 weeks on top. Only Taylor Swift, with 86 weeks at No. 1 since 2000, has more. Before I'm the Problem's 12 weeks at No. 1, One Thing at a Time ruled for 19 nonconsecutive weeks in 2023-34 and Dangerous: The Double Album was tops for 10 straight weeks in 2021.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack holds at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 108,000 equivalent album units earned (up 3%). The album debuted at No. 8 nine weeks ago and has never left the top 10. The last soundtrack to spend its first nine weeks in the top 10 was Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015, which spent its first 14 weeks in the top 10.


	Further, KPop Demon Hunters has spent five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 2 — its peak to date. The last soundtrack to spend at least five weeks at No. 2, without reaching No. 1, was Forrest Gump in 1994, which notched five straight frames in the runner-up spot (behind another soundtrack, The Lion King). KPop Demon Hunters is likely to sport further gains on next week's charts, with the Netflix film getting a wide release in movie theaters for a sing-a-long event this weekend.

	











	Conan Gray scores his highest-charting album ever on the Billboard 200 as Wishbone bows at No. 3. It launches with 71,000 equivalent album units earned — his best week by units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 53,000 (his best sales week yet — it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 18,000 (equaling 23.71 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 27 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The set's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across seven CD variants (including signed editions) and seven vinyl editions (some signed) and a standard digital download edition.


	Gray previously hit the top 10 of the Billboard 200 twice, with Superache (No. 9 in 2022) and Kid Krow (No. 5 in 2020).


Wishbone was preceded by its single “Vodka Cranberry,” which peaked at No. 38 on the Pop Airplay chart.


Gunna's The Last Wun falls one spot to No. 4 on its second week on the Billboard 200 (48,000 equivalent album units, down 40%), while Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid is steady at its No. 5 high for a second week (nearly 40,000 units, down 6%).


	Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft rallies 24-6 after the release of a one-year anniversary vinyl edition of the album. The set, counting all versions of the album, including the new vinyl variant, earned 38,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week (up 64%). Of that sum, vinyl sales accounted for nearly 18,000. The anniversary edition of the vinyl was pressed on bio-vinyl dark blue and orange splatter with its cover printed on silver mirror foil board and contains a poster.


Hit Me Hard and Soft, which peaked at No. 2 in its debut week (chart dated June 1, 2024), was last in the top 10 on the June 7, 2025-dated list (at No. 9) and last ranked as high on the Feb. 22, 2025, chart (when it was also at No. 6).

	











	Morgan Wallen's chart-topping One Thing at a Time rises a spot to No. 7 on the latest Billboard 200 (nearly 38,000 equivalent album units, down 1%), SZA's former leader SOS is up two spots to No. 8 (35,000, down 1%) and Justin Bieber's SWAG falls 7-9 (nearly 33,000, down 15%).


	Closing out the top 10 is Taylor Swift's former No. 1 The Tortured Poets Department, which jumps 18-10 with 30,500 equivalent album units earned (up 18%). Swift's most recent studio album, which led the chart for 17 nonconsecutive weeks beginning in May 2024, returns to the top 10 for the first time since the Feb. 15-dated list (No. 9).


Poets' vault back into the top 10 comes after Swift's Aug. 12 announcement of her forthcoming new studio album, The Life of a Showgirl (due Oct. 3). On Aug. 13, Swift provided further details about the album, including its tracklist and producers, and appeared on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast, New Heights, to chat about the project. YouTube announced that the pod peaked at 1.3 million concurrent livestream viewers — more than any other podcast has garnered since the platform launched a “dedicated podcast experience in 2023,” per the company.

I am a Los Angeleno, born and raised, and I admired the entertainment industry even before I was a part of it. I've been fortunate to build a successful career in Los Angeles as a Lighting Designer, contributing to some of the most exciting and high-profile projects of the past 35 years. From scripted series to live telecasts to reality competition shows, I've worked alongside incredibly talented people, making magical moments. I love what I do, the people I do it with, and the city we call home.

For the past five seasons I've served as Lighting Designer on the technicolor explosion of artistry and self-expression that is “RuPaul's Drag Race,” which has been proudly made in Los Angeles since 2009. At a time when productions are increasingly leaving Los Angeles, “RuPaul's Drag Race” has remained firmly planted, holding onto its LA roots and much of the dedicated crew who helped build the iconic show.

Many of us have worked in production for decades. We've come up through the ranks, mentored by veterans who shaped this industry and were lighting stages with carbon arcs and tungsten sources. Our crew includes gaffers and key grips whose parents, and even grandparents, were in the industry. We've got camera operators who started out as PAs in the early days of reality TV, and passionate, young talent—many making the move to Los Angeles to break into the business— who hope this will be the first of many projects in a lifelong career. We're the kind of workers who have long formed the backbone of this industry town: generational, skilled, and deeply invested in its future.

The work is hard, the pace is fast, and the expectations are high. Each week “RuPaul's Drag Race” delivers something spectacular, whether it's a Broadway-style musical, a scripted acting challenge, a high fashion photo shoot, or a lip sync smackdown for the ages, we're constantly raising the bar. We are artists who want to create something timeless—a moment that people will remember, and that might even change their lives.

That level of creative ambition is made possible because of LA's unmatched production ecosystem: the best crews in the business, cutting-edge rental houses, experienced collaborators, versatile sound stages, and reliable industry partners. These local, world-class resources allow us to be bold, flexible, and efficient.

Much of the success of “RuPaul's Drag Race” can be credited to World of Wonder's commitment to producing the long-running series in Los Angeles. They've proven there is no better place to make award-winning, culturally resonant television than right here at home. Their continued investment in LA's production community not only helps sustain jobs and businesses, it preserves the legacy of craftsmanship, collaboration, and creative excellence that defines this town.

 










Production is in LA's DNA. Let's keep it that way.
