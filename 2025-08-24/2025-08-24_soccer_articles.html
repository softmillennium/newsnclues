                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A moment that said plenty about Trump's ego, sure. Donald Trump will be everywhere Fifa is in the US, including at the 2026 World Cup – due to start in about 10 months, when Canada and Mexico will co-host. If this much wasn't clear already after that moment at MetLife Stadium and all the other times Trump or his agenda have affected World Cup affairs, it may have become so after Friday's Oval Office appearance with Fifa president Gianni Infantino – the eighth reported meeting between the pair since January, and the fifth to take place in public at the White House. Trump wore a signature hat reading “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” – one of his collection that was deemed noteworthy enough to display to world leaders in the middle of high-stakes talks with lives hanging in the balance. On the fifth of that month, the World Cup draw will take place not at the Las Vegas Sphere as had been widely expected, but at Washington DC's Kennedy Center – a historic venue and a worthy place to sort through some ping-pong balls, but also one that is now controlled by Trump, who has installed himself as chair, named himself as host of the institution's annual honors, overseen upcoming renovations (“there's nothing like gold,” he said on Friday in reference to his Oval Office redesign), and may soon lend his wife's name to the opera house. “Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,' but we're not prepared to do that quite yet,” Trump said on Friday. The World Cup is not federally controlled like the Kennedy Center, but it will now be subject to a similar dynamic. The tournament Trump has taken credit for bringing to the US will take place under his presidency, with the draw and “big press conferences” happening in a venue he controls, put on by an organization run by someone looking to befriend Trump at every turn – including by becoming the Trump Organization's tenant. There is almost no choice other than to accept that Trump will make sure he is front and center at this tournament – even in spots where he has no business, or where his involvement may be seen as uncouth or inappropriate. Trump announced this after Infantino allowed him to hold the single most valuable hardware in men's soccer, the World Cup trophy – not unheard of for heads of state, but more uncommon when accompanied with Infantino's comment: “Since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it.” Trump asked if he could keep the trophy afterward, and it was not immediately clear that he was joking, given that Infantino let him keep the Club World Cup trophy, where it has been on display in the Oval Office ever since. Trump continued to promote his crackdown later on, with the trophy directly in front of him on the Resolute Desk, as if it was a microphone meant to amplify his message. When prompted by Trump on Friday, Infantino – rather than demurring to comment on the domestic affairs of a foreign country – gave a solemn “oh yes” to express approval of the president's plan for DC. It's a plan Trump said he intends to spread to other American cities, mentioning Chicago specifically, but one can easily imagine that any city that voted against him – like 10 of the 11 US host cities for the upcoming World Cup – would be on the list. “Johnny”, as Trump calls Infantino, then gifted him a ceremonial ticket to the World Cup final – row 1, seat 1. Given all of this, expect the World Cup final camera to linger on Trump's face longer than many of the players, coaches, and team staff who will have worked all their professional lives to get to that point. You'll see him at the World Cup before then, too. He'll boast endlessly about how well the tournament is going, only changing tack if things get so bad it's obvious to everyone, in which case he'll blame someone else (watch your back, “Johnny”). Alexi Lalas, a big fan of Trump's Maga movement, will shake his hand. Don't rule out a gold-encrusted seat waiting for Trump at the final and any other games he chooses to attend. And Fifa appears happy to do anything it takes for things to remain that way lest world football's governing body be discarded or, worse, made a target. It's why it's so coveted by countries that rule through authoritarian means – and that now arguably includes the US under Trump Indelible, sublime moments will still happen at the 2026 tournament. People will still take joy, hurt, anger, and feelings from them. But those moments will be punctuated by Trump – eternally encroaching on even the most elevated of emotional experiences. If this news drives you to boo, ready your vocal cords.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a year on the sidelines, Marc Bernal is nearing his return to the pitch and is expected to be back sometime around September. There is excitement surrounding the young midfielder, who is regarded highly in the Barcelona camp and will be competing with Frenkie de Jong for a place in the starting eleven. The 18-year-old underwent surgery last September, is now medically cleared and expected to receive his competitive green light mid-September. While the club have taken a cautious approach to his recovery, the RFEF has shown interest in taking Bernal to the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile, which takes place from September 27 to October 19. However, according to Mundo Deportivo, the RFEF enquired about Bernal's availability for the tournament, even considering him as a reinforcement for coach Paco Gallardo's squad. But Barcelona have rejected the request outright, insisting that the midfielder's return must be phased carefully and that rushing him into international duty would be too great a risk. The decision means Bernal will not feature for Spain in Chile, despite expectations that he will be fully registered for competitive play by that time. Hansi Flick, who values Bernal highly and sees him as a long-term pivot for Barcelona's midfield, is in no hurry to overexpose the teenager. The German coach intends to ease him back gradually, similar to how Gavi was managed following his injury comeback last year. With top European clubs already monitoring Bernal, Barcelona remain determined to keep him central to their plans and are expected to extend his contract soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's one thing for Gianni Infantino to debase himself, fawning over autocrats and human rights abusers. His sycophancy is also sullying the World Cup, however, as sure as if the FIFA president took that iconic gold trophy once held by Pelé, Maradona and Messi and dipped it in tar. The men's World Cup next year is shaping up to be a North Korea-style state propaganda event, and Infantino is going right along with it. He stood beside Donald Trump as the president turned what was supposed to be an announcement that the draw will take place at the Kennedy Center into a 45-minute stream of lies Friday, smiling, laughing and agreeing with Trump as if he was a Cabinet member. And because sacrificing your dignity and self-respect doesn't go as far as it used to, Infantino came bearing more gifts! Infantino even stood by while Trump suggested that Vladimir Putin "may" attend the tournament, despite Russia being banned from FIFA competitions since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. FIFA and its leaders have never been paragons of virtue. Infantino's predecessor, Sepp Blatter, is still ostracized by FIFA for his shady dealings, and half of the members of the Executive Committee that voted on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were fined, suspended or banned for life for corruption. But the World Cup was always viewed separately from its leaders' tawdry behavior. When the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, that country's leaders promised that it would not impose its local customs and rules on a global tournament. Human rights violations were rampant, the LGBTQ community was targeted and longtime sponsor Budweiser discovered its $75 million sponsorship was worth less than warm beer. Now comes next summer's men's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The United States is sliding into autocracy, with Trump encouraging voter suppression in Texas, manufacturing a crime wave to justify a takeover of Washington, D.C., and retaliating against his enemies. And that was just in the last few days! Trump likes anything that can be used to exalt his glorious leadership, so he is, naturally, all in on the World Cup. And Infantino is happy to oblige his grandiosity. He didn't step in when Trump crashed Chelsea's victory celebration after winning the Club World Cup, and he “let” Trump keep the original trophy. Now he's fawning over Trump's tales of Washington's “resurgence” and placating his overestimation of the U.S. men's national team's chances next summer. “The home team always have a good chance to win,” Infantino said. This is a team that lost four in a row earlier this year and got humiliated by Panama in the semifinals of the Nations League. Most of the rest of the world has an even dimmer view, which is already being reflected by a drop in foreign tourism. Allow the World Cup to become “Trump's tournament,” and Infantino should not be surprised if fans decide to sit it out. Or only go to games in Canada and Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vance, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell in the Oval Office for the announcement. “It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes — the best athletes in the world — to the cultural center of our nation's capital,” said Trump. While FIFA did not have an official statement to coincide with Friday's White House press event, Infantino stated himself that the draw will commence at noon ET, moments before handing the World Cup trophy to Trump. The news came as something of a surprise. The D.C. region was not selected to host matches at the World Cup, with issues at Northwest Stadium eventually resulting in a joint Washington/Baltimore bid that was ultimately rejected. However, speaking in 2022, U.S. Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone did hint at plans to follow long-standing World Cup tradition, which has largely seen national capitals play a major role for the tournament. The last men's World Cup to not feature matches in the host country's capital city was in 1974, when West Germany did not hold matches in Bonn. “Our nation's capital is very much going to be a huge part of this World Cup, even though they're not hosting games,” said Parlow Cone shortly after the host cities were confirmed. The Trump administration has in recent days instituted federal control over Washington's police force and called in national guard units from several states amid a sharp increase in visible law enforcement throughout the capital. The 2026 edition of the men's World Cup — set to run from June 11 to July 19, 2026 — will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and will be the first to feature an expanded 48-team field. The World Cup draw is a major event held before a given World Cup, which sets the schedule of games and bracket for the tournament. With each team only guaranteed three group stage games, the results of the draw are considered critical in gauging a given country's hopes of a deep tournament run. Based on the December 2025 FIFA rankings and a desire to prevent too many nations from one continent being paired together in the tournament's group stage, FIFA will sort the 48 qualifying teams into four pots. Host nations Canada (Group B), Mexico Group A), and the United States (Group D) have already been assigned to groups as seeded teams, with nine best-ranked teams in the world set to be the seeded sides in the other groups. Here is a full list of cities and corresponding venues:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There are few clubs in the world with higher expectations than Club America in Liga MX, but it's for good reason. In December of 2024, Club America became the first Mexican Club ever to three-peat in Liga MX, which no team had done since Mexican soccer split into the Apertura/Clausura era. But because of those expectations, it feels like America are struggling in the current Apertura season despite only sitting fourth in the table. They're only one point off first place, but after also missing out on the Club World Cup due to losing a playoff with Los Angeles FC and not making it out of the group stage of the Leagues Cup, it just hasn't been good enough. Club America and manager Andre Jardine will need to rally in order to win a trophy this season or a change could be called for at the club. Someone who can help bring that is American winger Alex Zendejas. Zendejas hasn't scored since matchday one, facing Juarez, and even left winger Brian Rodriguez hasn't scored in three consecutive league games. Midfielder Eric Sanchez has gotten the job done, but the attack around him has been one-dimensional. Facing Atlas is as good a time as any to put an end to their attacking woes, considering that Atlas have allowed three or more goals in four consecutive games. This is a team loaded with attacking talent, but they've scored just nine goals in 11 league games, averaging 0.8 per contest. There is no gambling offered on this site.

Trump and Putin meeting in AlaskaIn a high-stakes session on the situation in Ukraine, Putin and Trump last met on August 15 but left without reaching a definitive agreement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national team will call up a new defender, according to Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Thomas Müller. While Müller may still be playing and scored his first MLS goal on Saturday night in a 3–2 comeback win over St. Louis CITY SC, he also dipped his hand into the realm of breaking news post-match. “With the new [signings] coming in, they have a little bit more time. On the other hand, we're playing during international break in October, we were missing some guys at this moment, and now Tristan is nominated for the U.S.,” Müller said, before laughing and realizing the news of Blackmon's first callup had yet to be announced by the Whitecaps or U.S. Soccer. However, Müller did not go as far as to clarify which roster Blackmon will be called up for. Blackmon, 28, has spent parts of the last four seasons with Vancouver and has become a critical piece of the backline, helping to lead the team to three Canadian Championship titles and a run to the Concacaf Champions Cup Final this season. This season, he has helped the Whitecaps to a league-high 12 clean sheets in the regular season and an extended run in cup competitions. Thomas Müller: Der NewsbreakerJesse Marsch had been talking with Vancouver Whitecaps CB Tristan Blackmon about potentially playing for #CanMNT.The U.S. didn't like that. Despite his standout moments, he has never cracked a final USMNT squad, with his only previous call being the 60-man preliminary roster for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, which featured an MLS-heavy list, but not Blackmon. Earlier in the season, ESPN reported that Canadian men's national team head coach Jesse Marsch had a conversation with Blackmon about potentially representing Canada and gaining his citizenship. However, that possibility would fall short should the USMNT cap Blackmon. “Just a conversation,” Blackmon said of his chat with Marsch. Getting to know me as a player, and that there's a potential opportunity for this to possibly take place in the future. Müller might not be in the business of breaking stories just yet, but he has his first big scoop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading sports journalist Miguel Delaney dissects the Club World Cup to show how football has been taken over by capitalism and Gulf states, as well as the motivations that pushed him to write his essential guide to understanding the modern game, States Of Play. It's a phrase you'll hear fans say in response to modern football. There were half-time interviews, half-time shows, and players coming out of the tunnel with their names announced WWE-style. Sportswashing – the practice of using sport to improve the public image of an entity, such as a country or organisation – was rife. There are few better qualified to discuss this than Spanish-Irish journalist Miguel Delaney. What's important is that it worked for Gianni Infantino's (Fifa President) purposes. He needed the significant indirect backing of Saudi state money. This was around the same time that the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) took a 10% stake in them. “Clubs have been trying to unlock that PIF money for years. So Infantino suddenly got all the big clubs on his side. Each Gulf state has its own socio-political reality, but share troubling common ground when it comes to human rights. There were reports of poor conditions, withheld wages, and unexplained deaths among those building stadiums. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, meanwhile, rank poorly for press freedom. In May, a group of lawyers alleged that Fifa wasn't following its own human rights rules by having the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. It's easy to see why these states seek image improvement through football. “They obviously have some sort of relationship with Infantino. Saudi money indirectly made the tournament happen. That links to the [Saudis'] wider project, this long road up to the 2034 World Cup, which is classic sportswashing really, because it's tournament hosting.” One of the participating teams, Riyadh-based Al Hilal, have signed global stars such as Neymar (who left after playing just seven games) as part of a wider plan to raise Saudi football's profile. “One of the more cynical interpretations of the Club World Cup is that it's a Trojan horse,” Delaney explains. “I think it is crucial, in terms of sportswashing, that Saudi Pro League clubs have an equivalent competition to the Champions League. We know Abu Dhabi, or Manchester City's owners, were really interested in this competition. “It's about using a global tournament for international projection. That's what a lot of club ownership is about.” Money from states, billionaires, and private equity affects what happens on the pitch by distorting football's economics. Wage inflation has widened the gap between European giants and everyone else. The Club World Cup claimed to address this. There wasn't that much memorable football. “I think this is a landmark moment in football history, because of what Infantino has been able to put on, and how it's changed the attitude of the big clubs. I do genuinely think this is the start of a real transformation in football, and one that's been coming for a long time. “It's something that specifically comes from the United States' economic model. Funds and billionaires buy them for good old financial capital. They see the future as a kind where you can make money by being in a more international market.” “The Bisht itself is an otherwise innocent garment that bestows honour. There he is in the middle of it, clearly not wanting to leave. At the moment, a flawed liberal democracy. “A lot of human rights groups would say the American World Cup will be used to further his current political agenda, which is obviously authoritarian leaning. “With him, it's much more about basic ego. There is an element of WWE to this. “But these are the sort of figures involved. The Gulf rivalry has driven a lot of modern sportswashing. Ultimately it does come down to petty rivalries between very powerful men as well.” Of all those men, one looms large over football – Fifa President Infantino, who replaced Sepp Blatter after the 2015 FIFA corruption scandal. As Delaney puts it, he was a “reform candidate”. "Infantino sees himself in the sphere of world leaders. Trump isn't the only one he's got a relationship with. “There's that infamous photo of Infantino sitting beside Putin and [Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister] Mohammed bin Salman. The Trump administration very much encouraged Infantino's relationship with Mohammed bin Salman. It absolutely is a concern that these are the sort of world leaders that Infantino seems to have the closest proximity to. Was there a specific moment that pushed Delaney to write States Of Play? There's transfers, which is a separate industry in itself. “I was covering Manchester City's run to the treble in 2023,” Delaney says. “I found myself in airports, hotels or restaurants with City fans. Some are civil, but I got a lot of aggressive abuse. I'm not talking about the fanbase as a whole, just minority sections within it. Ultimately there is a cynical use of the psychological attachment that football brings by powerful entities behind the club. Some fans take it as their identities being criticised. “I think it's pro-City to not want them owned by an autocratic state. I would extend this to capitalist funds and billionaires. I don't think they should be owning clubs either. As a fan himself, has confronting the ugly realities of modern football made it harder to enjoy the game? “It's hard not to see clubs in terms of who owns them. It's them who are voting at Premier League meetings. They've become intrinsic to the identity of clubs.” “I would say there's nothing like going into a big game at international tournaments,” Delaney says. “The club game has never been more financially conditioned. From years of research, we know there's a 90% correlation between what clubs spend on wages and where they finish in the table. Manchester United at this point might make up a considerable part of the 10% aberration… “But in the international game players are doing it for glory. You've got fans from all the nations, and it's a scene of great humanity. In the final chapter of States Of Play, Delaney lays out some reforms he'd make to bring the game back to fans. “Before 1995, if your club was competing in Europe, you could only have three foreign players. “You can recreate it from a different direction, which is essentially having three of your starting line-up, or more of your squad, having to be homegrown players. One of the effects of this is the super clubs don't have as many available spaces in their squad for kind of talent they want to buy in. “It means that players stay at clubs longer. You could have Red Star Belgrade winning the Champions League. “It starts to bring more parity in football, and if there's more parity, it means a lot of these kind owners aren't necessarily interested in clubs in the same way.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexico was a controversial choice as World Cup host in 1970, primarily because it was widely expected that the heat and altitude would result in poor football. Brazil had won two of the previous three World Cups, but their experience in England in 1966 had been disastrous; eliminated at the group stage amid complaints about the physical approach of their opponents. Pele had briefly retired from international duty, although later agreed to return after two years away. “We had a fantastic side and everyone expected us to win, which gave me the shakes,” Pele later said. “I was very nervous and under a lot of pressure. Maybe people have forgotten, but the political situation in Brazil was not good and we felt that we simply had to win the title. Thank God we were able to do it.” We've encountered Mario Zagallo before — he played in Brazil's two World Cup-winning campaigns of 1958 and 1962, as a reliable left-winger who tucked inside to allow Garrincha freedom down the opposite flank. His predecessor, Joao Saldanha, had been a bizarre choice as manager. He had been out of work for a decade after a spell in charge of his old club Botafogo, and had spent the intervening period working as an outspoken journalist and radio host. He was dismissed after a few months, despite good results, partly because he refused to cooperate with the country's authoritarian president, Emilio Medici, who regularly offered advice about team selection. He was close to the players, having played alongside several — most notably Pele — and was happy to take their suggestions about tactics on board. In many ways, he feels comparable to Carlo Ancelotti, recently appointed Brazil manager for the 2026 World Cup. He had been assistant manager four years earlier for Brazil's fourth World Cup success, and had a brief caretaker spell in 2002, before becoming a technical coordinator for World Cup 2006. On one hand, this was the 4-2-4 approach that Brazil had used at previous tournaments. This side featured five players who were accustomed to playing No 10 for their club — Pele, Tostao, Rivellino, Jairzinho and Gerson, all world-class. Pele and Tostao were the front two, although neither was considered an out-and-out striker. Gerson was a brilliantly inventive midfield playmaker, capable of long-range passes, with the similarly left-footed Rivellino charging infield dangerously from the left flank with slightly odd, angular dribbles. That allowed Jairzinho to play from the right, where he was inevitably compared to Garrincha, but he was more of a drifting all-rounder. Wilson Piazza was a defensive midfielder converted into a centre-back because of the lack of top-class options, and even legendary captain Carlos Alberto was suspect when opponents dribbled at him, always seeming to desperately recover at the last minute. World Soccer's Brian Glanville wrote that “his ineptitude, at times, was extraordinary”. Even Bob Wilson, the normally amiable Arsenal goalkeeper turned television presenter, branded him “without question, the most incompetent goalkeeper to win a World Cup medal”. Pele is the greatest player in World Cup history, and became the only player to win three World Cup winners' medals here. And therefore, amid strong competition, Brazil's key player was Jairzinho, who managed to score in all six games. A direct dribbler who had an eye for a clever through- ball, he played on the left at World Cup 1966, with his idol Garrincha an automatic pick on the right. But Jairzinho always wanted to play on the right. He could shoot powerfully with both feet, too. His goal against Czechoslovakia, where he dribbled past four opponents before finishing, was the outstanding moment — in pure technical terms — of Brazil's campaign. “That's really difficult,” said Zagallo when asked by FIFA who the best player was at this tournament. But you have to mention Pele, Tostao, Rivellino, Clodoaldo, and Gerson — Gerson was the best No 10, the best midfielder I've seen in my life.” So that's the whole midfield and forward line mentioned, which is probably fair enough. Whereas Brazil found space for five No 10s, Italy manager Ferruccio Valcareggi had a policy of fielding Sandro Mazzola and Gianni Rivera ‘in relay', one replacing the other at half-time, a somewhat primitive approach to substitutions. With the original Jules Rimet trophy up for grabs — it would be permanently awarded to the first nation to win the tournament three times, and these sides were both on two — Brazil were dominant. While Sandro Mazzola showed some flashes of inspiration, Italy weren't really in the game. Then came Italy's goal, which curiously summarises Brazil's approach to football as succinctly as any of the goals at the other end. It came when centre-back Piazza swept a ball out to Brito, who nodded it infield to Clodoaldo — the defensive midfielder supposedly playing the solid, reliable role. But he responded with a hilariously nonchalant backheel intended for left-back Everaldo, completely unaware that he was being closed down by Roberto Boninsegna, who intercepted and charged through on goal. Then Pele seemed set to score his second header of the game, but instead nodded it down for Jairzinho, whose final goal of the tournament was his scruffiest. And then came Alberto's fourth — more on that shortly. At the time, opinions differed on whether it was a great final. Brazil's play was not as flowing as in some of their previous matches, and it was a somewhat one-sided game. Brazil scored some truly spectacular goals in this tournament, showing a particular penchant for rounding the goalkeeper, powerful free kicks and strikes from a tight angle. “When it arrived at Pele's feet, I just believed the ball would come to me,” said Carlos Alberto in Garry Jenkins' book The Beautiful Team. We played at Santos and had a good understanding. I knew that if the ball was at his feet, he would give it to me.” It was a move that Brazil played a lot, thanks to their multiple No 10s sucking the opposition centrally before leaving space on the outside for an overlapping right-back. The nature of Pele's assist was somewhat similar to his assist for Jairzinho's winner in the group stage victory over England. This was the first World Cup to feature substitutes, but Zagallo elected not to use either of his in the final. And therefore, since medals were only awarded to those who had actually played in the final, two medals went spare. They are now on display at the FIFA Museum in Zurich. The answer to that depends on what you want. Brazil were not the most complete World Cup winner. These were shortcomings that the 1958 side simply didn't have. But they had more than enough attacking flair to make up for that. No other side has had five genuinely world-class attackers in the same team. That they succeeded without width in its strictest sense, or without an obvious focal point up front, underlines the selflessness and cohesion between players, who believed in each other's talent. “I don't want to compare them,” said Zagallo of the 1958 side he played in, and the 1970 side he managed. However, the team of 1958 was really good because we had a sensational defence, a great midfielder and an attack with Garrincha, Pele and Vava. Oh, and we had Mario Zagallo on the left wing!” But Zagallo as manager wasn't too bad either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>History was made on Saturday in San Francisco, as the largest crowd to ever watch a National Women's Soccer League game filled Oracle Park. "We live in Oakland and we drive down to San Jose for every home game," said Leone Baron. "So, when they had something up here and it could potentially set records, we'll absolutely be there. Yeah, we love our team, you know? With more than 40,000 tickets sold, it set a new record for attendance at an NWSL game. "I did not know that they're saying a record or something," said Schuyler Vinefield, a young soccer player from Sacramento, "so, now I'm even more excited!" "This is history right here because it's the first women's game at Oracle Park," said Paige Terrazas, visiting with her Sonoma Valley United soccer team. "I feel like just being able to witness it is very inspirational." There was plenty of pre-game fun, including music from Oakland's native rapper, Mistah Fab and featuring iconic San Francisco Giants players from Oracle Park's baseball history: Barry Bonds, Sergio Romo and Hunter Pence. But this day was about women's soccer and no one means more to that sport than Brandi Chastain. Her penalty kick to win the 1999 World Cup for Team USA will go down as the iconic moment when American women's soccer came into its own. "When I started playing soccer some 40-something years ago, I had no idea that I could be a professional, let alone bring a team here to Oracle Park and play in such a phenomenal place," said Chastain. Now, she is a co-founder of Bay FC, a team that is said to represent the largest investment in global women's sports. And Chastain felt that the crowd at Oracle Park had a significance far beyond just a soccer match. "The meaning is when you bring a girl to an event like this, she starts to have her dreams lit on fire," she said. "It doesn't mean she has to be a professional soccer player. And I think sports gives us that opportunity. I mean, It gives me chills just to think about how awesome this opportunity is for our players and our fans to see this happening." The match brought 40,000 soccer fans together, but for Kristen Lee and her 10-year-old daughter Clementine, who traveled to the game from Fresno, the impact was on a more personal level. Meanwhile, sitting in the front row, Sunny Moun from Sacramento gazed in amazement at the huge crowd behind him. "Who would have thought a sold-out arena...?" "Major League Baseball games don't even sell out arenas. But right now, a women's soccer game is selling out.
