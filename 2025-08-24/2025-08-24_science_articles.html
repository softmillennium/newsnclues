                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The brain controls the release of glucose in a wide range of stressful circumstances, including fasting and low blood sugar levels. However, less attention has been paid to its role in day-to-day situations. Over the past five decades, researchers have shown that dysfunction of the nervous system can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, especially in patients with diabetes. "Most studies have shown that this region is involved in raising blood sugar during emergencies," said Alison Affinati, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of internal medicine and member of Caswell Diabetes Institute. "We wanted to understand whether it is also important in controlling blood sugar during day-to-day activities because that's when diabetes develops." They used mouse models in which these neurons were inactivated. These nerve cells, however, only controlled lipolysis, which raises the possibility that other cells might be controlling glucose levels through different mechanisms. "Our studies show that the control of glucose is not an on-or-off switch as previously thought," Affinati said. "Different populations of neurons work together, and everything gets turned on in an emergency. However, under routine conditions, it allows for subtle changes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That metallic sheen turned out to herald a bounty of more than 30,000 bronze and copper coins minted in Rome during the fourth century. Near the town of Arzachena, divers were trawling an area of sandy clearing near the beach that was also surrounded by seagrass. And, if we're lucky, it may even point to a completely undiscovered hidden shipwreck. While there is no news yet of a wreck being found, experts remain hopeful that one could turn up after further investigation. Alongside the coins, the divers also located walls of narrow-necked jugs with two handles, which also helped point experts towards the idea that a shipwreck may be nearby.
