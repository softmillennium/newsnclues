I was sad to have missed the Monterey Car Week this year, especially because there were a number of reveals I was interested in, including the all-electric Cadillac Opulent Velocity; the Chevrolet Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo concepts; and Lucid Gravity X reveals. But alas, the sprawling, Champagne-soaked grounds of Quail or the sea of seersucker suits and wide-brimmed hats at Pebble Beach Golf Course were suboptimal landscapes for my newly fractured and boot-encased foot. In the meantime, I thought I would reach out to you, dear reader, to get your forecast on what's in store for automakers and EV sales in the United States once the federal EV tax credit expires September 30. Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery robot company, announced earlier this week that it acquired Vayu Robotics, a startup that has developed AI foundation models and a simulation-powered data engine for robots. Several weeks ago, I highlighted a deal between Uber, autonomous vehicle tech startup Nuro, and EV maker Lucid. (Sources told me it is more than the $300 million Uber invested in Lucid.) And a portion of Uber's investment has gone toward the Series E round. Alongside the round, Group14 also announced it had “acquired full ownership” of a joint venture with SK in South Korea. Read up on the company's plan to build a decentralized “Uber for freight.” Tesla is planning to introduce in-car voice-assistant functions powered by DeepSeek and ByteDance's Doubao artificial intelligence. The Routing Company, a startup that helps transit agencies match riders with vehicles quickly and cheaply, landed Zoox as its first robotaxi client. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing “immediately.” In the world of drones and food, I suppose it was inevitable we would get Zipotle — a merging of the words Zipline and Chipotle. Vanity Fair has a lengthy feature on Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana that digs into her past, how she manages, and, as the author notes, her un-Elon style.

OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, and the UK government Technology Secretary, Peter Kyle, have discussed a deal which would see the UK's entire population given premium access to ChatGPT, according to a Guardian report this weekend. However, the bill, which would have to be covered by the government, may have stymied any chance of the deal going official, with Guardian sources indicating ChatGPT Plus for every Brit would cost as much as £2 billion ($2.7b). Kyle is a well-known AI advocate, with previous reports citing evidence that he has used this online tool for advice and work related questions. Altman and Kyle have met a number of times this year. Kyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to the source. Then, in July, the minister signed an agreement with OpenAI. Particular mention was given to education, defense, security, and justice departments. In exchange, OpenAI would have access to a range of government data. We hope that these challenges and pitfalls were addressed in some way. Bringing us up to date, sources speaking to The Guardian have shared information about talks between Altman and Kyle that took place recently in San Francisco. While ChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month for an individual subscription, the cost for the whole populace (69.6 million by most recent estimates) should be provided at some kind of bulk discount.

Sizable waves of prosperity can uplift the population as a whole, so visionary government shouldn't be put off by investments like this. However, the jury is still out regarding the usefulness of AI, and whether it is a passing fad, or a bubble. To underline that no 'ChatGPT Plus for every Brit deal' is on the way, the Guardian report ends by relaying a statement from the UK's science and technology department, which says no such proposal or deal has been taken forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beleaguered crypto company Binance must tighten up its compliance controls covering anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism and add an independent auditor if it wants to keep doing business in Australia, regulators said this week. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is mandating the crypto giant put outside auditors in place within 28 days of its decision. The watchdog said that the new rules are intended to address “serious concerns” it has about its oversight of illegal activity, which AUSTRAC says is “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings, and risks.” The regulator said Binance's most recent internal review found a lack of oversight by senior management within Binance Australia, as well as a lot of employee churn that has resulted in high staff turnover, inadequate local resources, and the need for an outside monitor. It's not the first time that Binance has tangled with regulators. Founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty and was fined $4.3 billion 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges that included anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting, and sanctions violations. “As one compliance employee wrote, “we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days – come to binance we got cake for you,'” the DOJ said in its statement about the settlement. The crypto exchange also faces an increasingly restrictive regulatory landscape in Australia, which recently cracked down on Binance Australia Derivatives in a 2024 lawsuit. That suit was brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and resulted in Binance losing its derivatives license in the country because of its risk management shortcomings and limited compliance (ASIC). “Big global operators may appear well resourced and positioned to meet complex regulatory requirements, but if they don't understand local money laundering and terrorism financing risks, they are failing [to meet their obligations to consumers],” Brendan Thomas, chief executive officer of Austrac, said in a statement. Binance also had to shut down its Australian dollar trading services earlier this year because its payment provider, Zepto, ended their partnership. That followed an earlier clash with Cuscal, a service provider who had helped it provide banking services, cut off access to its platform. “Understanding specific risks of criminality in the Australian context is crucial to ensure they're meeting their reporting obligations here,” Thomas said. “We remain committed to maintaining best-in-class compliance standards and will continuously enhance our capabilities.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

AMD launched the Ryzen 5 5500X3D a few months ago, but it hasn't received much attention due to its exclusivity to the Latin American market. Positioned as a budget-friendly chip, it builds upon the standard Ryzen 5 5500 with the addition of 3D V-Cache, giving it a notable boost in gaming performance. However, it's not just fast in that area, as new benchmarks suggest that the 5500X3D also holds its own in productivity workloads, proving to be more versatile than expected. Spotted by Gray, the Ryzen 5 5500X3D just appeared on Geekbench for the first time, where it delivered some decisive results. In single-core performance, it scored 1,932 points—roughly on par with the standard 5500 CPU. The real gains show up in multicore tests, where the 5500X3D came in nearly 12% faster than its non-X3D counterpart. The 5500X3D was tested on an Asus TUF Gaming B550M-Plus WiFi II motherboard with 32GB of RAM, suggesting the benchmark likely came from a regular user rather than a system integrator or OEM. On paper, the chip offers 6 cores and 12 threads, with a 3.0 GHz base clock and up to 4.0 GHz boost. Interestingly, this Geekbench run shows it hitting almost 4.3 GHz, which implies the base clock may have been adjusted—since Ryzen 5000X3D chips otherwise ship with locked multipliers. Just a couple of weeks ago, it appeared on PassMark, where it trailed the 5600X3D by around 6% in multi-core performance but still managed to edge out the standard 5500 by the same margin. All in all, the benchmark results for the 5500X3D have remained solid but its infered $185 price is poor by American or European standards which is why this chip only launced in Latin America, which is much more price-sensitive region.

That's essentially what researchers at imec and Ghent University accomplished when they grew 120 alternating layers of silicon (Si) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) on a 300 mm wafer—a key step toward three-dimensional DRAM. At first glance, it sounds like stacking sheets of paper, but in reality, it's more like balancing a house of cards with materials that naturally want to pull apart. Silicon and silicon-germanium crystals have slightly different atomic spacings, so when stacked, the layers naturally want to stretch or compress. Think of it like trying to stack a deck of cards where every second card is slightly larger than the first—without careful alignment, the stack warps and topples. In semiconductor terms, these “topples” appear as misfit dislocations, tiny defects that can ruin a memory chip's performance. They also maintained extremely uniform temperatures during the deposition process, because even minor hot or cold spots in the reactor can lead to uneven growth. The process itself, using advanced epitaxial deposition techniques, is like painting with gases. Controlling the thickness, composition, and uniformity of each layer is crucial; even a tiny deviation can propagate through the stack, magnifying defects. In conventional DRAM, memory cells are laid out flat, limiting density. Stacking layers vertically—in 3D—allows for far more memory cells in the same footprint, improving storage capacity without making chips larger. Successfully creating 120 bilayers demonstrates that vertical scaling is achievable, bringing us closer to next-generation, high-density memory devices. By controlling strain and keeping layers uniform, the researchers effectively built a nanoscale skyscraper of silicon and SiGe that could host thousands of memory cells per unit area. Techniques for growing precise multi-layer structures can advance 3D transistors, stacked logic devices, and even quantum computing architectures, where controlling layer properties at the atomic level is critical. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Furthermore, the research aligns with ongoing efforts to develop Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAAFET) and Complementary FET (CFET) technologies. These advanced transistor architectures benefit from the precise control over material properties afforded by epitaxial growth techniques, enabling the fabrication of smaller, more powerful transistors that are crucial for the continued miniaturization of electronic devices. In summary, this is not just stacking silicon as you might know; it's engineering order from atomic tension, creating structures that nature itself would struggle to produce. For memory technology, like we say with every new breakthrough, it's a milestone that could reshape how chips are designed, making them denser, faster, and more reliable than ever before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Someone could say the words “high fidelity” until you're both blue in the face, but it's hard to understand unless you hear it for yourself. Great audio is as high as your frame of reference is, and if you're like most people and you're used to sticking AirPods in your ears and calling it a day, then that's your baseline. But not everyone is so easily wooed by Apple's ecosystem, and for those baptized in the expensive waters of hi-fi audio, the ceiling is damn near cathedral-length. With that extra headroom, however, comes an even loftier hit to your wallet. But how good can Panasonic's $299 Technics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds that cost more than Apple's ubiquitous white buds really sound? I wouldn't usually bother to get into the nitty-gritty of how drivers work, but in this case I think it's worth explaining to make you appreciate these buds' uniqueness. Distortion happens in a number of ways, but usually distorted sound emanates from some kind of deficiency in the driver. That deficiency can be the result of materials, design, and other factors, but Panasonic's magnetic fluid drivers focus on one thing in particular, which is stability, so to speak. While most wireless earbud drivers will vibrate in random directions while pumping out sound, causing distortion along the way, the EAH-AZ100's drivers are immersed in an oil-like substance with magnetic particles that prevent unwanted movement and the dreaded distortion that happens. In fact, across all the genres I tested these wireless earbuds on—indie rock, folk, hip-hop, and electronic—they sounded great. Even though I was listening to compressed audio files on Spotify, it felt like I was one step closer to hearing songs like those artists intended when they entered the studio. Another major selling point for the EAH-AZ100 is very long battery life. Fortunately, I was able to put that lofty battery claim to the test since I had a long flight from New York to Arizona (with a layover) and can also say confidently that these buds have the longevity that's advertised. I used the EAH-AZ100s all day on and off and didn't have to charge the wireless earbuds once, which is a perk that can't be overstated when you're trying to block out noise from crying babies on a flight. With the case, you get 18 hours of total battery life according to Panasonic, and on that front I'll have to take their word since I still haven't had to charge these things since I started testing. Either way, 10 hours is a lot of juice for wireless earbuds with ANC on and helps justify the $299 price tag. With crying babies nearby, I relied on the EAH-AZ100 to help safeguard my sanity, and they performed… admirably. These aren't going to win any medals from me on the ANC front (Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds still take the cake here), but they held their own when it comes to noise cancellation, especially when tested against a boss as scary as the in-flight baby scream. If you're looking for ANC as elite as the sound and battery life, you may be a little let down, though. If you're going to be wearing wireless earbuds for a long time (like 10 hours), another thing you may want to know is how they feel in your ears, and fortunately, they feel pretty damn comfy. If you don't find them to be a good fit, Panasonic also includes four other eartip sizes in the box (XS, S, ML, L), but I just used the pre-installed eartips, and they fit my ears well. There are some things about these wireless earbuds that I won't be writing home about, but that doesn't mean they're bad in any way, just not as excellent as the sound or the battery life. One of those things is the touch controls, which work just okay. A quirk you should be aware of is that the case does not have a pairing button, so in order to pair the buds to a device, you have to take them out, put them in your ears, and then hold down on the outsides of each with your finger to initiate a Bluetooth connection. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but I prefer a button, which is simple and universal and not something you have to figure out by reading a manual on an airplane. Another thing I'm not particularly compelled by is the design. That being said, the shape (bulb-like) is likely a product of the use of a magnetic fluid driver, which is incredible at conveying clear hi-fi sound, so I can't complain too much there. Substance over style is a choice I'm okay with. Like other wireless earbuds, there's also a companion app for controlling ANC levels, switching modes, spatial audio, and custom EQ, which are all things I would expect from a premium-priced pair of earbuds since competitors that are half the cost also have those things. The EAH-AZ100 have an ambient mode, which works fine, though Bose's QuietComfort Ultra is still nicer in my opinion. These are some of the best-sounding wireless earbuds I've ever shoved into my ears, and it's not too often that I feel spoiled on that front, nor is it often that I can say a pair of earbuds sounds better than over-ear headphones of a similar price. If you're looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that focus hard on that important stuff (sound, battery life, and comfort) and still deliver dutifully on the rest (ANC, features, and controls), then I can say with confidence that the Technics EAH-AZ100 could be the pick for you.

Google has a fresh smart home speaker to go along with its upcoming Gemini for Home upgrade, according to new leaks. The world would be a better place if AirPods had this one Pixel Buds 2a design feature. The Sony Inzone H9 II sounds incredible and feels great. It's just short of perfect in one important way. Just because the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are cheaper doesn't mean they have to be worse. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's considerable evidence that dark matter exists, but it's “dark,” meaning it doesn't respond to light and very weakly interacts with other matter. In a preprint submitted to arXiv, Rocco suggests that Ganymede's craters may store evidence of dark matter particles, which spacecraft like NASA's Europa Clipper or ESA's JUICE could observe during their respective missions. The paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, proposes that massive dark matter particles could have struck and penetrated Ganymede's thick, icy surface, leaving deep, broad ruptures. Unlike the comparatively small-sized candidates for dark matter that ground-based detectors are searching for, these particles would be much larger. These extra-large dark matter particles would create “dark matter craters”—smaller dents on Ganymede's surface comprised of distinctive minerals pulled to the surface from deep inside the moon's oceans. “If you used something like ground-penetrating radar, you might be able to see this column of melted ice going all the way down through the ice,” DeRocco explained in an interview with New Scientist. Studying Ganymede's surface with this proposal in mind could uncover some unexpected insights about cosmic dark matter, according to the paper. At the same time—like all dark matter experiments—there is still no definitive evidence that such heavy, massive dark matter particles actually exist. If all of this sounds bonkers, I don't blame you. Still, it's important to remember that, as many physicists are keen to point out, solving a physics mystery often means testing bold, unconventional ideas. And while there's no decisive evidence that this particular proposal is correct, there isn't any evidence to discount it, either. We'll have to wait and see if NASA or ESA takes up DeRocco's idea, and if they do, whether Ganymede really does have a surface dotted with dark matter craters.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is back in Taiwan for weighty negotiations with contract chipmaker TSMC. Their warm relationship is made clearly apparent in a video showing the two billionaires joking about who will pay the bill for dinner. Wei: We have the honor for $4 trillion guy to be my guest. Wei: No problem, if you agree with my wafer pricing pic.twitter.com/Y3iBtoVhqyAugust 23, 2025 With these incredibly serious negotiations probably still some way to go, the two tech leaders enjoyed dinner in Taipei. In the video, you can see them standing closely with Huang's arm around Wei's shoulders. After Huang's introduction, and explanation that he has been in meetings with “TSMC's world-class leaders,” earlier in the day, Wei took his turn to speak. “Let me say that we have the honor to have this four trillion NT guy to be my guest.” The sum of four trillion NT Dollars is about USD $130 billion, and is obviously a reference to Huang's fortune. We get a sense, next, that negotiations are not yet finalized. Huang flew into Taipei on Friday on a private jet and is quoted by a Reuters report as stating, “My main purpose coming here is to visit TSMC.” That report shares some insight regarding the underlying purpose of this visit. It is hinted that it might be related to China's caution about buying more H20 chips, and Nvidia's plans to tailor a new AI chip for China – the purported B30.

Also, according to Reuters, Huang was in Taiwan to thank TSMC for the successful tape out of six brand-new chips, including a GPU and a photonics processor for Rubin-architecture supercomputers. Every one of those chips is “new and revolutionary,” claimed the Nvidia CEO. Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is home to dozens of active mines. Some extract copper, while others dig for iron. “We're only producing a few commodities,” said Elizabeth Holley, a professor of mining engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. In a study published today by the journal Science, Holley and her colleagues aimed to quantify what else is in those rocks. They found that, across 70 critical elements at 54 active mines, the potential for recovery is enormous. There is enough lithium in one year of U.S. mine waste, for example, to power 10 million electric vehicles. Critical minerals are essential to the production of lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and other low- or zero-carbon technologies powering the clean energy transition. Where the U.S. gets those minerals has long been a politically fraught topic. While securing a domestic supply of rare or critical materials has been a U.S. policy goal for decades, the push has intensified in recent years. Former president Joe Biden's landmark climate legislation, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, included incentives for domestic critical mineral production, and this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order invoking wartime powers that would allow more leasing and extraction on federal lands. “Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers' mineral production,” the order read. “It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.” Trump also made critical minerals a cornerstone of continued support to Ukraine. Holley's research indicates that increased domestic byproduct recovery could address this instability. Even a 1 percent recovery rate, it found, would “substantially reduce” import reliance for most elements. Recovering 4 percent of lithium would completely offset current imports. “We could focus on mines that are already corporate and simply add additional circuits to their process,” said Holley. This latest research is “very valuable,” said Hamidreza Samouei, a professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University who wasn't involved in the study. Other areas that will need attention, he said, include looking beyond discarded rock to the “huge” amounts of water that a mine uses. He also believes that the government should play a more aggressive policy and regulatory role in pushing for critical mineral recovery. “Mining is a very old-fashioned industry,” said Samouei. “It is a very hot topic in mining these days.” The attention is contributing to a burgeoning shift in thinking, from an intense focus on the target mineral to consideration of what else could be produced, including critical minerals. “Mining companies are there to make a profit.” Byproduct potential varies considerably by mine, and the analysis, she said, can help pinpoint where to potentially find which minerals. “Our paper allows the development of a strategy.” This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/science/us-mines-are-literally-throwing-away-critical-minerals/.
