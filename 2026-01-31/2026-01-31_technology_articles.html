HN users, have any of you actually run OpenClaw and let it do any things useful or interesting? If you think this sort of thing is gonna change the world in a good way: here's evidence of it getting to scale. If you think it's gonna be scams, garbage, and destruction: here's evidence of that. First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own.I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant.I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be. It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through. I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents.

But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances.This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch.This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale.

I'd expect that if there is a usable quality of output from these approaches it will get rolled into existing tools similarly, like how multi-agents using worktrees already was. Persistent file as memory with multiple backup options (VPS, git), heartbeat and support for telegram are the best features in my opinion.A lot of bugs right now, but mostly fixable if you thinker around a bit.Kind of makes me think a lot more on autonomy and freewill.Some thoughts by my agent on the topic (might not load, the site is not working recently):https://www.moltbook.com/post/abe269f3-ab8c-4910-b4c5-016f98...

Elon built and deployed an app overnight without being asked. Burry paper-traded to 77% win rate before going live.The setup took a weekend. I wake up to a full briefing every morning.It's not AGI.

The token cost is real (budget it) but for a solo founder, having 6 tireless employees changes everything The token cost is real (budget it) but for a solo founder, having 6 tireless employees changes everything I'd say it's right on the edge of being useful, but given the number of bugs, it's not really that practically useful. I don't have so many communications I need an assistant to handle them, nor do other online chores (e.g. shopping) take much time, and I wouldn't trust an LLM to follow my preferences (physical chores, like laundry and cleaning, are different). I'm fascinated by what others are doing, but right now don't see any way to contribute nor use it to benefit myself. No identity layer exists for autonomous agents that isn't tied to a human.Documenting the journey at @nozembot on Twitter. The ones I've tried do not work all that well. 3) It murdered my codex quota trying to chase down a bug that resulted from all the renames -- this project has renamed itself twice this week, and every time it does, I assume the refactoring work is LLM-driven. It still winds up looking for CLAWDBOT_* envvars when they're actually being set as OPENCLAW_*, or looking in ~/moltbot/ when actually the files are still in ~/clawdbot. When the main agent works on something, your chat is blocked, so you have no idea what's going on or if it died. 5) And sometimes it DOES die, because you hit a ratelimit or quota limit, or because the software is actually pretty janky. It feels like the design and implementation are riddled with vibetumors. 7) It actively lies to me about clearing its context window. This gets expensive fast when dealing with high-end models. I keep seeing these people saying they're spending $1000s a month on LLM tokens :O) 8) I am NOT impressed with Kimi-K2.5 on this thing. It keeps hanging on tool use -- it hallucinates commands and gets syntax wrong very frequently, and this causes the process to outright hang. 9) I'm also not impressed with doing research on it. I guess mostly, I'm looking at it like:1) the chat metaphor gave me a convenient interface to do big-picture interactions with an LLM from anywhere; 2) the terminal agents gave the LLMs rich local tool and data use, so I could turn them loose on projects; 3) this feels like it's giving me a chat metaphor, in a real chat app, with the ability for it to asynchronously check on stuff, and use local stuff.I think that's pretty neat and the way this should go. More likely, I think this is a good icebreaker for an important conversation about what the primetime version of this looks like. I'm having it do some stuff for me right now.

Other part of me is arguing that old annoying Dropbox/Box Hacker News scenario where all us tech people aren't impressed but this makes it easier for non-tech people.Tiny tinfoil security part of me is cowering in fear. Tiny tinfoil security part of me is cowering in fear. Note that nothing about that depends on it being a local or remote model, it was just less of a concern for local models in the past because most of them did not have tool calling. OpenClaw, for all the cool and flashy uses, is also basically an infinite generator for lethal trifecta problems because its whole pitch is combining your data with tools that can both read and write from the public internet. did my own cli to play with.. ended up getting shitcoin promotions (dont wanna name them) and realized a famous speculator funding this project also great stuff - platform is generating synthetic data to train its own llms. which is smart way since ppl are paying for tokens It also BURNS through tokens like mad, because it has essentially no restrictions or guardrails and will actually implement baroque little scripts to do whatever you ask without any real care as to the consequences.. I can do a lot more with just gpt-5-mini or mistral for much less money.The only "good" think about it is the Reddit-like skills library that is growing insanely. But then there's stuff like https://clawmatch.ai that is just... (sigh) But then there's stuff like https://clawmatch.ai that is just... (sigh) GPT-5.2 in a while loop with reasoning enabled is extremely hard to beat. A code REPL or shell is the ultimate tool. It'd be fun to automate some social media bots, maybe develop an elaborate ARG on top. Any specific admin tasks it's done really well at?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Gino Palileo moved to Seattle from the Philippines in 2015, his first job in his new city was at an ice cream shop at the waterfront ferry terminal. Now an architect splitting his time between Seattle and New York, he's stuck with 3D printing as a hobby — and this week he showed off a new passion project. “I'm very fond of these ferries; they're always fun to be on,” Palileo (@GP_3D) said in his Reddit post. “They all have beautiful names that honor tribes, peoples, and locations indigenous to the Puget Sound area.” A self-professed transit geek, Palileo said he has plans for other Seattle-related designs and prints. He might do the Monorail or maybe a Link light rail train. And he likes the Virginia V steamship moored at South Lake Union. And when it comes to revisiting ferries, he's been eyeing a classic. “I was thinking of maybe an older ferry — the Kalakala?” Palileo said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tobaccowala had just sold her last startup, Gixo, to OpenFit and was looking for a new challenge. “There had to be something more than like turning our lights off.” Without a background in climate science or hardware engineering, she wasn't sure where to start. “When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,'” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.” Tobaccowala co-founded HomeBoost to help people conduct their own home energy assessments. As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded. In many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said. “We talked to a bunch of consumers who'd gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,'” she said. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. For contractors, it's another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home. By bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too.

Yesterday, Google announced Project Genie, a new generative AI tool that can apparently create entire games from just prompts. The firms affected by this include Rockstar owner Take-Two Interactive, developer/distributors like CD Projekt Red and Nintendo, along with even Roblox — that one actually makes sense. Unity's share price fell the most at 20%, since it's a popular game engine. Generally speaking, that's how most games operate: they use a software framework, such as Unity or Unreal Engine, which provides basic functionality like physics, rendering, input, and sound. Studios then build their vision on top of these, and some developers even have their own custom in-house solutions, such as Rockstar's RAGE or Guerrilla's Decima. There are no objectives, and the AI often forgets what it has already generated when filling in gaps. Roads in these questionably-generated games would often have patches of grass in between, as if the model thought it was supposed to generate something else for a bit before swiftly recovering. This hallucinating behavior signifies the prototype nature of the tech, and Google has said Project Genie is an experimental tool for now, meant to help with things like previz for large games. That ties into the issue with game development these days: how bloated some productions can get with insane budgets and lead times, yet still somehow end up delivering an underwhelming product. Tools like Project Genie could genuinely help here, saving developers time they'd otherwise spend in the early stages of the game, before level design is locked in. But in that way, AI is the solution to an artificial problem that should've been solved without it; for all that matters, devs could still find a way to balloon productions out of control even with Project Genie and a hundred other generative AI models at the helm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to Meta, everyone wants a piece of the AI glasses pie. While Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses aren't quite at iPhone levels of popularity, they've sold a lot more pairs than most were expecting, and as a result, competitors are cropping up left and right. No, really, smart glasses competition is getting serious: In the pipeline are forthcoming entrants from Google, Samsung, and maybe (just maybe) Apple. Needless to say, when (or if) those competitors enter the chat, Meta is going to have its work cut out for it. In the meantime, there are other options, and some of them have come surprisingly close to challenging Meta already. I've tried quite a few last year, but for me, Rokid's latest pair, the $299 AI Glasses Style, might be the closest to giving Meta's Ray-Bans a run for their money so far. So here's the deal: the Rokid AI Glasses Style, despite their word-garbled name, are nicer than I expected, though I have some serious gripes about how they're being marketed. Rokid's AI Glasses Style are advertised as weighing just north of 38g, which is notably less than the Ray-Ban Meta AI Gen 2 glasses. Meta's smart glasses weigh between 48g and 50g, for context. There's just one problem: that weight difference actually has a gigantic caveat. I bothered to weigh them myself at home, and they actually clock in at 45g, which is just 3g lighter than the lightest pair of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Why Rokid chose to list its smart glasses' weight without the lenses is beyond me (I think I know why, though), but I was aggravated to learn that the figure was a stretch of the truth. It doesn't make sense since you're never, under any circumstance, going to be using your smart glasses without the lenses in them. That brings me to my next point of comparison: despite the small difference in weight, the AI Glasses Style don't feel nearly as comfortable as the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. For me, that's mostly because of the frame. While Rokid's AI Glasses Style may look like a Ray-Ban dupe, they don't always feel like one after longer periods of wear. The bridge really took a toll on my nose after a while, and having worn Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses for hours upon hours collectively, I can't say that I felt the same fatigue wearing them. While Rokid opts for a bridge with nose pads (presumably for a tighter fit), the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are smooth. Even just running your finger through the bridge of both, Rokid's smart glasses feel a lot more angular than the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Personally, I think the AI Glasses Style look pretty alright, but your take may vary. The frames, I've noticed, are a little wider than the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which isn't ideal for me since I don't have a particularly wide face, but they may look better on your head. One tap on the arm for things like play/pause, two taps for things like skipping songs, three taps to go back, and a tap and hold to launch the voice assistant. Nothing groundbreaking here, but they work as well as they should, though the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses might be a tad more sensitive. One thing I do love about Rokid's AI Glasses Style is that they have loads of lens options. You should be wary of deceptive marketing, too. These smart glasses are not significantly lighter than Meta's. Rokid's glasses don't just look like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses; they're also intended to be used in similar ways. One of the first things people will associate smart glasses with right now is audio, video, and pictures, so let's get into that first. One difference between Meta here is that Rokid, with its companion app, allows you to shoot photos and videos in quite a few ratios (9:16, 3:4, and 4:3) to fit a number of different scenarios, including posting straight to social media. Photos were fairly sharp for smart glasses, and comparable to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (they both use a 12-megapixel Sony sensor, so no surprise here). While I wouldn't want to do any professional photography with this camera, it's serviceable for snapping stuff on the fly. It's hard to put my finger on why, but I find Meta's version of slightly soft-looking photos more appealing. Here's a comparison: on the left is Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses and on the right is Rokid's AI Glasses Style. Video is also solid and comparable quality-wise to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, with both topping out with a 3K resolution at 30 frames per second. Rokid gets the point here because its smart glasses can record up to a maximum of 10 freaking minutes as opposed to Ray-Ban Meta's AI glasses that top out at 3 minutes. I found this out by accidentally recording a 5-minute video after I tried and failed to use the voice assistant to stop recording. Either way, if you're going to use the AI Glasses Style for action sports, or capturing video while riding your bike, or anything where you want to record for longer periods, that 10-minute recording limit is kind of great, especially with the option to shoot natively in different aspect ratios. Which pair of glasses you like for shooting pictures and videos may depend on your preference for image processing like me, but there's no denying that the AI Glasses Style blow Ray-Bans out of the water in terms of recording length. It's worth noting here that, like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, there's an LED light that turns on when you're recording or taking a picture to let people know you've captured something. Those videos wouldn't be complete without audio, and Rokid is also competitive in that arena. One of the best uses of smart glasses is as an open-ear audio product, so audio is more important than you might think on the surface, and Rokid's AI Glasses Style seem to understand that. I was pleased with the quality of sound coming from Rokid's new smart glasses as well as the volume. I put these smart glasses through the same gauntlet as every audio product that I test, including using them on the New York subway, and they performed well. Sound is fairly clear, though a little more tinny-sounding than Meta's glasses, and the volume was loud enough, though I couldn't hear it as well as Meta's glasses (maybe Meta's glasses are more directional). I still think Meta takes this category, but Rokid doesn't leave the fight without landing some punches. I personally love the podcast setting since it does make voices more audible. I still wouldn't want to use the AI Glasses Style on a loud subway, but you could say that for pretty much any open-ear audio product. I did 10 minutes of calling cumulatively with multiple people, and all of them could hear themselves on the call to a disruptive degree. For the record, I've had no such issue on the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, so I'm pretty sure this issue is solvable with software. If you're big on taking calls with smart glasses like I am, you may want to wait on using the AI Glasses Style for now. The AI Glasses Style don't break the mold entirely when it comes to display-less smart glasses, but they do come with a few things that I wish Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses had. If you pull open the companion app, you can also tap open a screen with a map to follow along. So many times while biking, I wished that Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses could launch navigation, so it's nice to see Rokid making that wish a reality. Like other smart glasses, you can use AI translation, and there's a twist here, too. While most smart glasses are reliant on an internet connection to translate speech, Rokid's AI Glasses style come with a downloadable local model that allows you to load six different languages onto the glasses for offline translation. Those languages are English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and simplified Chinese. The AI Glasses Style have similar problems to other AI models (translation can be a bit literal and doesn't always get sentence construction right), but it performed its duty better than I expected. I will say, however, that the local translation mode was a bit slow, so if you're using this feature in the real world, you may have to ask the person you're speaking with to slow down. Using online translation with Alibaba's Qwen AI model was much, much, faster for me (impressively so), but that will depend on your internet connection, obviously. Like other smart glasses, the AI Glasses Style will convert speech into a translated voice on the speakers, but also gives you an option to convert your speech, which is displayed in text on the companion app. I tested it by translating my speech into German, and it was equally as snappy as the other singular translation mode. I'm going to assume most people will want to hear one person at a time, but maybe the 360-degree mode could be good for groups? In addition to translation and navigation, there are your usual smart glasses features like calling, though I wasn't able to get Rokid's companion app to recognize my contacts despite enabling permissions in iOS. There are also reminders, which work fine—I set a reminder to go grocery shopping and a voice popped up on time to remind me after I set it. Lastly, there's a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and then use the companion app to generate a summary or word-for-word transcription. This feature also worked fairly well and was able to capture audio in a quiet room and transcribe it accurately. I'd say there's parity here between Meta and Rokid. While Rokid's AI was able to translate some stuff from a Japanese poster I pulled up online, it couldn't read some of the smaller text. I don't find this to be a particularly important battleground for smart glasses, though, if I'm being honest, since the use case feels a little niche. If there's a bright spot that I was hoping for software-wise, it's in the voice assistant department and Rokid did an admirable job here, too. The last time I used a pair of Rokid smart glasses, they failed to recognize my “Hey, Rokid” wake command over and over, but the company seems to have fixed that this time around. I do have one problem with Rokid's voice assistant, and that's its tendency to shut down the microphone too early. If you're asking Rokid's AI something, I would suggest getting the whole thing out in one fell swoop, since it seemingly gets bored with your yammering quickly. One thing that any person willing to wear smart glasses all the time seeks is battery life, and Rokid's AI Glasses Style push the envelope here. The AI Glasses Style claim a 12-hour battery life, which I was skeptical of at first, but after using the smart glasses for a week, I think Rokid may actually have achieved it. As of writing these words, I've had the AI Glasses Style on for several hours with intermittent use and have only seen a 15% dip in battery. Obviously, the battery will depend on what you're doing. Still, if you're listening sometimes, taking short calls, and using them incrementally throughout the day, you may manage to squeeze 12 hours out of the AI Glasses Style. For reference, the Meta Ray-Ban AI Glasses Gen 2 advertise a maximum of 8 hours of battery, so four more hours is nothing to scoff at. Speaking of battery, one thing that I wish Rokid included was a charging case. I don't love the idea of having to rely on a cheap, glasses-specific dongle for charging (what if you lose it or it frays? ), but that's what you'll get from Rokid in the standard purchase. One last thing to be aware of: I did have some Bluetooth issues with the AI Glasses Style, which caused them to disconnect abruptly, though after I downloaded an OTA update, there haven't been any problems. Still, it's worth mentioning since other smart glasses I've tested, like the Even Realities Even G2 glasses, have had persistent problems with that sort of thing. If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that Rokid is competition, and while it probably won't unseat Meta from its pedestal any time soon, it goes to show you just how heated things are about to get. If Rokid can give Meta a scare, just imagine what Google or Samsung could do. If new gadgets are your thing, then there's arguably not a more fruitful month than January. Just ignore silly AI 'freemium' features in legacy apps. It's not all about getting email notifications plastered on your eyeballs.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's always a new vacuum to try. Bosch's new vacuum featured at this year's CES. The Bosch Unlimited 10 ($699) stands out for incorporating two features from two popular vacuum brands: Dyson and Shark. The Bosch also offers six power levels, with three specialty levels (quiet, car, and delicate carpet) on top of the classic automatic, eco, and turbo levels we see on the Shark and Dyson. While the Dyson Gen5 Detect doesn't have the compression bin, I was curious how the Bosch would compare, given it has a price tag closer to a Dyson. Ultimately, Bosch trailed both Dyson and Shark in most challenges, and I was frustrated to see it dump debris three times during the tests. Here's how each of my tests went and which vacuum pulled ahead. For each vacuum, I poured a small amount of sand across it and tested how well the vacuum sucked it up. I was surprised that Shark was the only one that didn't respond to the sand by throwing it everywhere while trying to vacuum it up. Both Bosch and Dyson had this issue. Bosch picked up a lot of sand, but also blew sand pretty evenly all over the rug and dumped some of it back on the floor after I turned the vacuum off. Meanwhile, the Shark PowerDetect has nice suction and a really smooth glide over carpet (though the increased power and glide feel like they're pulling you forward), which made it easy to sweep the rug and get almost all the sand in one go without sending it everywhere. I really thought the Dyson would do better in this test, but its tight suction actually ground up the cereal flakes and made a little more of a mess than it cleaned. I used only the Dyson Motorbar head for this test, but I think switching to the Fluffy Optic head, which is designed for hard floors, would have been a better choice for debris like this. My only issue was that as soon as I was done, it dumped some of the cereal (and the sand from earlier) back out onto the rug when I switched it off. Shark's carpet mode adds a zing to the power that feels a little like a puppy running away from you, but it did well at gathering the cereal and other debris on my living room rug when I tried it there later that day. If you're a pet owner like I am, nothing really does it like a Dyson, especially the Gen5 Detect. I have two staircases in my house, and I used each vacuum on one half of it. Dyson pulled up much more gray cat hair and dusty debris from my stairs than the other two vacuums. The other two did fine, but I could feel the spray of sand on my feet when I used the Bosch on a lower stair, where my son's sandy feet had been. The Bosch also got confused whenever I lifted it between stairs, causing it to frequently switch to hard-floor mode. Bosch pulls ahead of its competitors in one area: It has more cleaning modes. While the Dyson and Shark have the classic trio of power levels (both have an Auto and Eco mode, and Dyson calls its more powerful mode Boost while Shark and Bosch call it Turbo), Bosch comes with three more options. And while it isn't a different mode, Bosch also reacts when you switch between flooring types. It raised the power level for carpet and rugs, and lowered it when switched to hard floors. The screen also showed me when it toggled between these. It didn't do a perfect job, though; it read carpet that was more matted down from walking as hard floors, and didn't switch between flooring types as quickly as the Shark does. The extra modes also don't feel hugely different. Silent is still noisy, and delicate carpet mode didn't seem to change anything. Bosch has the compression feature we'll see on Dyson's upcoming vacuums, but the current Gen5 Detect I'm testing doesn't have it. You can use the compression lever when it's both closed and open. It did help compress the hair and dust while I was vacuuming, helping me see if I had really filled the bin, though at a certain point it doesn't compress much more. It was helpful to push debris out if needed too, versus the times I've had to stick my hand in both the Dyson and Shark to get the stuck hair and dust out. Dyson has this same feature on the Piston Animal V16, which is due out this year, so I'll be curious to see which mechanism is better engineered. If you're looking for a vacuum that can bend to reach under furniture, I prefer the Shark to the Bosch. Both have a similar mechanism and feel, but the Bosch tended to push debris around when I was using it with an active bend, while the Shark managed to vacuum up debris I couldn't get with the Bosch without lifting it and placing it on top of that particular debris (in this case, rogue cat kibble). But Bosch does well in this area, too. It's one more attachment than you'll get with Shark, and Bosch also includes a wall mount that you can wire the charging cord into for storage and charging, and you can mount two attachments on it. But I will say, I like that Shark includes a simple tote bag to store the attachments in. The rest of my attachments are in plastic bags for each vacuum, and keeping track of attachments is the most annoying part of a cordless vacuum. All three of these vacuums have a good build quality, but each one feels like it focuses on something different. Bosch feels the lightest of the three and stands up the easiest on its own, but all three do need something to lean against to stay upright. The Bosch has a sleek black look and a colorful LED screen that will show you a picture of carpet or hardwood depending on what mode it's vacuuming in. Dyson and Shark both have minimalist screens that show the power level and remaining battery life, though they're not as colorful as Bosch's. I'd mount the wall stands that come with each to safely store them between uses. If you're looking for the best value for features and a single-head vacuum that can handle both carpet, rugs, and hard floors, the Shark PowerDetect cordless vacuum is the way to go. It's usually on sale for around $300, and the folding stick makes it really easy to vacuum underneath couches, side tables, barstools, and the like without having to crouch on the ground. It did the best in the general floor debris pickup if you're looking for something that will make your broom obsolete. If you have more carpet than rugs and hard floors, and if you have pets, I'd recommend the Dyson Gen5 Detect. I'd switch to the Fluffy Optic head for hard debris, but the Motorbar does a fantastic job of pulling dust and hair out of carpet. It has more cleaning modes than the others, though I think you'll mainly use the standard three (Eco, Auto, and Turbo) that you can easily toggle between. This vacuum dumped debris on my floor three different times during my testing, which isn't a great sign for the future. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The Biwin Black Opal NV7400 is a solid performer with reasonable power efficiency and no real downsides. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Looking for a do-anything SSD that won't break the bank? That's becoming an increasingly difficult ask, but Biwin has proven itself to be up to the task with drives like the Black Opal NV7400. It would be great for your laptop, desktop, or PS5, and since it's available up to 4TB, you don't have to compromise on capacity. With SSD pricing and availability becoming so volatile, having another arrow in the quiver – that is, another SSD that'll work in a pinch – is not something to lightly dismiss, and Biwin has positioned this one well. We do have concerns about pricing and availability – the 4TB SKU in particular will set you back quite a bit – but that's more about timing than anything else. The Biwin Black Opal NV7400, or NV7400 for short, supports a wide range of capacities from 512GB to 4TB. Prices right now are obscene, so it's becoming more difficult to gauge them, but these are within the ballpark of what you should expect to pay for comparable hardware. As it stands, there are better deals to be had at all three available capacities, but prices are in constant flux, so do your due diligence. It's a good place to be for a PCIe 4.0 drive, and you don't have to worry about it being underwhelming. This is excellent write endurance, and if you're someone who pays attention to that, make a note of this drive. reading, error scanning, performance testing, data backup, drive cloning, firmware updating, secure erasing, and the conveyance of drive and system information. This all-in-one SSD toolbox tackles everything you want for an SSD, and that could be a selling point if you don't feel like meddling around with other free or paid software applications. Single-sided drives have wider compatibility and are usually easier to cool. Some of Biwin's past partners, such as Acer and HP, also use graphene labels to help spread heat, which works well in this configuration. It's at least sufficient when the drive is not going to get ridiculously hot. This matches the highest power state, which is pegged at 6.50W, compared to some high-end PCIe 5.0 drives that can get up to 11.5W. This is pretty reasonable, and the drive should operate fine without a heatsink. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The four-channel, DRAM-less controller is powerful and power-efficient. The Lexar NM790 is probably the model for this controller, as it remains a very popular budget drive at capacities up to 4TB. Most commonly, this controller is paired with 232-Layer TLC flash from YMTC, but QLC also pairs well with it in drives like the HP FX700 and TeamGroup MP44Q. In this case, though, we're looking at Micron flash, which is more unusual. Whenever you see “29” in a flash string, you can be sure it's something from Intel or Micron from back in the IMFT joint venture days, as this code designates the manufacturer. Look for our TeamGroup NV5000 review to see a similar breakdown on the Intel side of things. It's likely that the most interesting thing about this string for you is the fact that it indicates TLC flash, which is always preferred over QLC. We've dug into both 232-Layer Micron and YMTC flash many times in the past, and this review will give us a chance to see how the two products line up when each is paired with the MAP1602 controller.

Sandisk, renowned for producing some of the market's best SSDs, has substantially increased prices across its SSD portfolio in early 2026. In fact, some of the company's SSDs cost almost three times more than their normal MSRP. The flagship WD Black SN8100 series shows staggering price increases of up to 2.5X above their original MSRP. The newly added 8TB variant now commands an eye-watering price tag exceeding $2,500. Pricing for these Optimus SSDs is not yet available; therefore, the price increases apply to the existing WD Black and WD Blue lineups. Rising prices are trickling down to Sandisk's entire SSD product stack. The WD Black SN7100 series has increased in price by 2.1X to 2.9X, depending on capacity. The company's edge business was the highest earner, generating $1.678 billion in revenue, while consumer and data center generated respectable figures of $907 million and $440 million, respectively. The ongoing data center expansion, fueled by the AI boom, has created exceptionally high demand for memory, and chipmakers are prioritizing enterprise products over consumer products. Sandisk is among the handful of companies benefiting from the shortage, with its data center business seeing a very healthy 64% growth. It's easy to see why consumer drives are affected in the current market. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. All indications are that the NAND shortage will persist through 2026. Many manufacturers are expanding production capacity, but that takes time to materialize. The AI revolution shows no signs of slowing, so SSD prices may rise further before they stabilize. Sandisk SSDs may now sell for almost 3X what they did a few months ago, and that price is likely to increase further as the year progresses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samsung's first-ever Galaxy Z TriFold went on sale this past Friday, but it sold out in minutes. This folding phone differs from the 7th-generation Galaxy Z Fold7 in that its screen can expand to a whopping 10 inches, turning it into a proper tablet. That also means it commands an incredibly high price of $2,899. The company says it has limited units at select Samsung Experience Stores across the US in states such as New York, Texas, California, and Minnesota. Google hasn't been quiet about hinting at its future plans of converging Android and Chromebooks into a single operating system, reportedly known as Aluminium OS internally. But now we may have our first peek at what it'll look like, as picked up by 9to5 Google. The brief look shows that Aluminium OS really does feel like Android and ChromeOS stitched together. The video shows two instances of Google Chrome running in split-screen, a common setup for Chromebooks, before briefly opening the Google Play Store in a separate window. That'll be important if Google hopes to keep the Chromebook business running in education markets. While Aluminium OS will reportedly replace ChromeOS in the long run, that may take years, and Chromebooks themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. But rumors indicate that we will see an official launch of its cross-platform operating system sometime later this year as Google gradually integrates its platforms. Vivaldi, an alternative web browser, recently released an update to its tab organization tools, but the update is more notable for what it doesn't include: AI. “While every major browser is racing to cram AI assistants into their products, Vivaldi is dropping a middle finger to that entire approach,” writes Vivaldi CEO Jon von Tetzchner. With Google's Chrome browser now integrating the company's Gemini 3 LLM model to handle tasks like booking flights and finding apartments, Vivaldi is positioning itself as the browser that remains AI-free. Instead, Vivaldi plans to double down on tools for humans because "human intelligence, equipped with genuinely powerful tools, beats artificial algorithmic assistants every single time," says Tetzchner. The new “powerful tools” in this release include some improvements to Tab Tiling, Vivaldi's feature for having two tabs (two web pages, or more) side-by-side in the same window. Vivaldi 7.8 adds a new feature that allows you to tile tabs using drag and drop. Where you drag it determines how the tab is tiled, to the left, right, top, or bottom, depending on where you want it. Samsung is always experimenting with new display technology, but sustainability fans will be especially interested in its most recent innovation: phytoplankton-based bio-resin in screens. “The display's housing has been independently verified by global safety and sustainability certification organization UL to consist of 45 percent recycled plastic and 10 percent phytoplankton-based bio-resin,” Samsung says. “This material innovation was developed as an alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics, which can reduce carbon emissions in the manufacturing process by more than 40 percent.” The use of advanced modern plastics is on brand for the purpose of these screens; the new display is designed largely for retailers who might use traditional paper signage, allowing folks to change displays and images without printing new paper for every change of season or sale. But as a portion of every sale supports mental health charities, thankfully, there's more to Split than just good-looking timepieces. Until now, my clear favorite piece was the searingly yellow Sub-7. This new In the Skies model, however, might have just replaced it. This piece, however, has a particular party trick—one for when things turn dark. And at just £1,800 (about $2,480), it is a safe bet that this watch is considerably cheaper than the IWC will be when it eventually hits stores. Inside is a bi-compax automatic chronograph movement (allowing two sub-dials at 3 and 9 o'clock) from Seiko, visible through an exhibition caseback. The all-important, all-over glow is achieved by infusing a “secret ratio” of Japanese luminous powder directly into the strap and case materials during manufacture. If you've ever strained to hear gate announcements for your flight (let's face it, we all have at some point), you'll be pleased that Frankfurt Airport is trialling Bluetooth Auracast to send gate announcements directly to a passenger's hearing aids, wireless earbuds, and smartphones. It also works with apps from Auracast-enabled GN hearing devices. It enables multiple people to connect to the same audio stream simultaneously and has many possible uses, from watching a movie together on a smartphone in the back of a car to audio from TVs in public spaces like the gym. It can also enhance accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing, allowing them to stream audio directly to their hearing aids at public venues. Initially being trialled at two busy gates in Frankfurt Airport, Auracast has been integrated into the German company, Sittig Technologies' PAXGuide announcement platform, which could enable it to roll out across the country without airports having to replace their existing systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. “Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence's co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don't immediately grasp them. What I'm watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations — warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop — and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The company also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There's a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it's for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it's there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that's with what Levine describes as “an enormous markup” from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. But that's the point — good intelligence compensates for bad hardware. As Levine excuses himself, I'm approached by Lachy Groom, moving through the space with the purposefulness of someone who has half a dozen things happening at once. At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of one of Silicon Valley's boy wonders, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite). When I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: “Absolutely not, I've got meetings.” Now he has 10 minutes, maybe. Groom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine's who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. Groom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he'd loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was “on vacation much more as an investor.” But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. The two-year-old company has now raised over $1 billion, and when I ask about its runway, he's quick to clarify it doesn't actually burn that much. “There's always more compute you can throw at the problem.” What makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn't give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. “I don't give investors answers on commercialization,” he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. “That's sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now. Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won't need to start data collection from scratch — they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. “The marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it's just a lot lower,” he says. The company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals — logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street — to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their “any platform, any task” approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today. Physical Intelligence isn't alone in chasing this vision. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its “omni-bodied” Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing. Skild has even taken public shots at competitors, arguing on its blog that most “robotics foundation models” are just vision-language models “in disguise” that lack “true physical common sense” because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data. In the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need — or new hardware or whatever it is — and then we do it. The company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully “as slowly as possible.” What's the most challenging, he says, is hardware. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.” Hardware breaks. There are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company's progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense. If Groom has any doubts, he doesn't show it. He's working with people who've been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know. Besides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there's a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they'll figure it out.
