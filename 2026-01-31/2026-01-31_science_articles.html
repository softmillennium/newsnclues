                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discoveries suggest these ancient populations were far more capable and adaptable than previously assumed. An international research team led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences carried out excavations at Xigou in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region of central China. Their work revealed evidence of advanced stone tool technologies dating from about 160,000 to 72,000 years ago. The project, co-led by Griffith University, shows that hominins living in this area demonstrated creativity and flexibility during a time when several large-brained hominins lived in China. "Researchers have argued for decades that while hominins in Africa and western Europe demonstrated significant technological advances, those in East Asia relied on simpler and more conservative stone-tool traditions," said expedition leader Dr. Shixia Yang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP). Study co-author Professor Michael Petraglia, Director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, added: "The Xigou findings challenge the narrative that early humans in China were conservative over time." One of the most remarkable discoveries at Xigou was evidence of hafted stone tools, representing the earliest known composite tools in East Asia. Such designs required careful planning, skilled workmanship, and an understanding of how tool performance could be improved by combining materials. The findings indicate a sophisticated approach to technology rather than simple or static traditions. Lead author Dr. Jian-Ping Yue of the IVPP said: "Their presence indicates the Xigou hominins possessed a high degree of behavioural flexibility and ingenuity." The archaeological layers at Xigou span approximately 90,000 years, offering a long-term view of technological development. Large-brained hominins identified at sites such as Xujiayao and Lingjing, sometimes referred to as Homo juluensis, may provide a biological context for the behavioral complexity seen in the Xigou stone tool collections. The findings indicate that early populations in the region had cognitive and technical abilities comparable to those of early humans in Africa and Europe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Largest galaxy survey yet confirms that the Universe is not clumpy enough The Dark Energy Survey observed around 150 million galaxies visible in Earth's southern sky. Astronomers have released the most ambitious cosmic map assembled so far, confirming that matter in the Universe is less clumpy than standard cosmological theory would predict. From 2013 to 2019, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) team repeatedly imaged a large section of Earth's southern sky to collect the positions, colours and shapes of around 150 million galaxies.

The combined results refine previous DES measurements to confirm that gravity has not clumped galaxies together as much as as much as observations of the early Universe would lead us to anticipate, were the standard theory of the Universe's evolution correct — an ongoing puzzle for cosmologists.
