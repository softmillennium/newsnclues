                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denver Summit have signed defender Eva Gaetino from Paris Saint-Germain on a deal through to the 2028 season. The 23-year-old center-back joins Summit ahead of their inaugural National Women's Soccer League season, becoming the second United States international to do so from France after USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps announced she will sign in June. Gaetino signed for PSG in 2024's winter transfer window from University of Notre Dame and has made 45 appearances since, winning the Coupe de France Féminine that year and becoming the youngest American, 21 at the time, to score in the knockout rounds of the Champions League. “Joining Denver Summit FC is an exciting next step for me,” said Gaetino on the club's website. “This club is building something special, and I'm honored to be part of it from the beginning. “I'm looking forward to bringing my experience, competing at the highest level in the NWSL, and helping set the standard for this team.” The defender has appeared for the United States on multiple levels and made her senior debut in 2024. Summit were accepted as an NWSL expansion team last year and the 2026 season will be their first. They have unveiled 22 players on their roster so far and will be led by former Manchester City Women head coach Nick Cushing. Jessica Hopkins  is a Staff News Editor at The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A little-known FIFA rule will block players from protesting against ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or displaying other political or religious messages during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will take place across the US, Mexico, and Canada, concerns have already been raised about the potential presence of ICE officers near or even inside stadiums. However, the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE falls under, has been subject to criticism in recent weeks after two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Nicole Renee Good – were shot dead by agents in Minneapolis in January. The Trump administration's foreign policy is also subject to debate, with some suggesting World Cup nations may boycott the tournament. Although a mass boycott remains unlikely at this stage. Germany's starting XI then covered their mouths during a team photograph ahead of their group stage match with Japan. But what are the rules on political messaging for the 2026 World Cup, and could players and federations face punishments? According to the 2026 FIFA World Cup regulations, displaying political, religious or personal messages is strictly prohibited by world football's governing body, whether the action is made before, during or after a match. The same rule applies to press conferences, training sessions and any official activity organised by FIFA. The official answer remains unclear, but given the fact that local officials have suggested that agents will be at the upcoming Super Bowl, a precedent could soon be set. Speaking to SPORTbible earlier this week, Professor Simon Chadwick, who has worked with FIFA and Barcelona among other global sporting organisations, suggested that ICE agents being present inside World Cup stadiums was a possibility. He explained: “One of the big issues is, if you go back to the Club World Cup last summer, for example, in Florida, there were local Hispanic people who were saying, ‘We're not going to Club World Cup games' because it was announced that ICE agents would be in attendance at Club World Cup games. “But what you've also got to keep in mind is that at the same time, not only might you get picked up by ICE, but you're also having to pay actually quite a lot of money for your tickets. So I think the stadiums will be full. When directly asked whether he believes ICE agents will be present inside World Cup stadiums, Chadwick replied: “From my perspective, yes. Because I think what we now know is that the Trump administration's view of the world, certainly on American territory, is that they ultimately have jurisdiction over what happens.” Journalist with expertise covering football, cricket, boxing and MMA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Liverpool vs Newcastle United predictions for their Premier League match on Saturday night, including value on a goalscorer bet. Our betting expert expects Liverpool to continue where they left off in the Champions League and beat Newcastle this weekend. Liverpool have faced some huge injuries to the front line and lost Mo Salah to the Africa Cup of Nations for a long while. As a result, they've scored only 16 goals in their 11 league matches at Anfield. Unusually, Liverpool scored more goals (19) away from home than at their stadium. The Reds have also conceded an average of one goal per home match this season, offering hope to the visitors. Despite Newcastle's wealth of talented attackers, they've scored only 10 goals in their 11 away matches. However, they're certainly capable of piercing a makeshift home defence that will likely comprise Ryan Gravenberch at the back to cover Ibrahim Konate. Moreover, both teams have scored in 55% of Liverpool's home matches. Additionally, four of the last five head-to-heads produced goals for both teams (80%). Howe's men will likely get some joy at Anfield, especially with Yoanne Wissa starting to gain momentum. Liverpool will hope that their two Champions League victories in the last two weeks can help turn their Premier League fortunes around. The Reds won the reverse fixture 3-2 at St James' Park, part of a run of eight wins across their previous nine Premier League meetings. It's worth noting that Newcastle last beat Liverpool at Anfield in 1994. Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the Premier League this season is their new signing, Hugo Ekitike. However, the Frenchman hasn't scored in this competition since before Christmas, so he will be eager to finally get onto the scoresheet. He currently has four goal involvements across his last five club appearances, although it must be noted that he didn't start last week at Bournemouth. The forward scored Liverpool's second goal in the reverse fixture, so he knows what it takes to breach Howe's defence. Arne Slot's men are sixth in the standings ahead of this round, but only two points behind rivals Manchester United. Liverpool beat Qarabag 6-0 on Wednesday night to secure an automatic place in the last 16 of that competition. However, after losing due to a late goal against Bournemouth last weekend, they will want to avoid a similar situation in this round. Newcastle are always a difficult side to face, so the home team must play at their very best. However, being only five points behind fifth place means their ambitions for a European spot next season are still achievable. Liverpool expected lineup: Alisson, Frimpong, Gravenberch, Van Dijk, Kerkez, Wirtz, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Salah, Gakpo, Ekitike Newcastle expected lineup: Pope, Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall, Miley, Guimaraes, Tonali, Barnes, Gordon, Wissa</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This came after the club missed out on qualification for the Champions League knockout stages on goal difference, with De Zerbi supposedly willing to leave southern France. Marseille were sent packing in the Champions League group stage after an incredible last-minute header from Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin against Real Madrid ensured the Portuguese side would progress at the Ligue 1 side's expense. The late goal ensured that Benfica would leapfrog Marseille and claim the final qualification spot for the play-off round, in which they will face Real Madrid. The confusion around De Zerbi's future only compounded when it was suggested that the former Brighton coach was willing to leave the club on his own terms. The side are currently third in the French top-flight, but have been cut adrift from the league leaders RC Lens and French champions Paris Saint-Germain. Yet, days on from those initial reports, De Zerbi remains at the helm and the club's president has told the media what has, or has not, happened. Since that very heavy defeat, there have been the post-match emotions. There's still that feeling of disappointment. Losing 3-0 against Bruges in the Champions League is a significant defeat. I never stated that the objective was to qualify for the Champions League this season. That's not a sign of ambition. In the last 30 years, OM has only qualified for the Champions League two seasons in a row once. At no point was there any discussion about the coach leaving. There was a calm, professional analysis between Medhi (Benatia), the coach (Roberto De Zerbi) and myself." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Longoria did admit that the early Champions League exit was a disappointment and a source of great frustration for supporters, adding: "With last week's disappointment, we created a lot of frustration among our fans, I share that, I understand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to United States President Donald Trump. Gottlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott. In what appears to be a public rebuke to Gottlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public”. The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament” from June 11-July 19. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament. When president, however, Blatter opposed calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia over concerns about Ukraine. “Football can not be boycotted in any country,” he said at the time. Ahead of this summer's tournament, fans have concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones – just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Germany's soccer federation has definitively ruled out a boycott of the upcoming World Cup, despite internal pressure to send a strong message regarding the actions of Donald Trump. This option was initially put forward last week by DFB vice president Oke Göttlich. Mr Göttlich, who also serves as president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, had cited recent actions and statements by Mr Trump, suggesting it was time to "seriously consider" a boycott. However, in what appears to be a direct rebuke to Mr Göttlich, the DFB declared that "debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public." The federation confirmed that a boycott "is not currently under consideration," adding that the DFB is actively "in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament" scheduled from 11 June to 19 July. Mr Trump's policies have previously caused significant discord in Europe, notably with his bid to acquire Greenland and threats of tariffs against European nations that opposed it. Furthermore, US actions in Venezuela and the handling of domestic protests in American cities have also sparked international concern. Last week, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter advised fans to avoid the tournament. Supporters have already voiced concerns over high ticket prices, while potential travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could prevent fans from certain competing nations from attending. Despite these issues, Germany's national team will participate. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones — just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country."</p>

As reported by Meu Timao, the showpiece is staged at Emirates Stadium. Set in Holloway, north London, Emirates has straightforward public transport links. Arsenal station on the Piccadilly line is a three to five minute walk. Before the move, Arsenal played at Highbury, vacated on 7 May 2006 after 93 years. Today it is among Britain's most modern venues, with Arsenalisation murals of 32 greats and bronze statues of Arsène Wenger, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Tony Adams, Herbert Chapman and Ken Friar. Brazil's men have made Emirates their European base, playing nine games for eight wins and one defeat. Matchdays favour public transport, with cars discouraged due to traffic and road closures. London buses are cashless, accepting Oyster or contactless with a flat £1.75 fare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany's football federation, the DFB, has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls to send a message to Donald Trump. Göttlich, who is also president of the Bundesliga club St Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott. In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public”. The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. There has been disquiet in Germany over Trump's behaviour on the global stage. The Germany international and Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka said on Wednesday that Trump's actions have left him feeling “not only German but also European”. “I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.” Fans already had concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones – just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.” Germany have won the trophy four times, in 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 23rd FIFA tournament is set to take place across Canada, Mexico and the US this summer– however, it's been arguably overshadowed in recent months, thanks to the opinions and actions of a certain president. World Cup games will traditionally see fans of competing nations flock in from around the world to watch their team play, but this won't be the case for 15 out of the 48 teams competing, thanks to travel bans issued by Donald Trump. Meanwhile at home, the US has been troubled by ongoing unrest in the state of Minnesota, after protests against ICE raids in the state's capital Minneapolis saw US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti shot dead by federal agents. Here is a rundown of all the countries which have either floated or commented on the idea of a World Cup 2026 boycott: "I really wonder when the time will be to think and talk about this [a boycott] concretely," he told the outlet. Going on to reference the backlash to the 2022 Qatar games, he added: "Qatar was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? Calls for a South African boycott have been led by politician Julius Malema, a member of the Economic Freedom Fighters party has called on the South African Football Federation to withdraw in protest. "SAFA must take a decision to withdraw from having anything to do with the World Cup that is taking place in America," he said on a recent EFF podcast. Like Belgium, the Netherlands is also facing calls to boycott the tournament from its people, with a petition calling for a boycott reaching over 163,000 signatures. "Taking part in a sporting event as if nothing is happening legitimises Trump's expansionist policy. French Sports Minister Marina Ferrari told local media that a boycott was not being discussed 'at this stage', but she did add that 'I'm not going to predict what might happen'. A small group of delegates eventually attended the ceremony in Washington D.C. There has also been calls for competing countries from the UK - England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales - to boycott the tournament. The call came from Conservative former minister Simon Hoare and Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam Luke Taylor, with the pair saying competing countries from the UK should pull out in order to 'fight fire with fire' and embarrass Trump during a dispute over Greenland (via STV). However, a boycott from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, should they qualify, is unlikely, given Keir Starmer's longrunning diplomacy attempts to keep President Trump onside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WSL side host Brazilian champions in Sunday showdown Slegers wary of complacency against a ‘very good team' Renée Slegers praised the impact of trailblazing hijab-wearing footballer Nouhaila Benzina after Arsenal's defeat of Moroccan side AS Far earned them a place in Sunday's Champions Cup final against Corinthians. Asked about the impact of Benzina competing in the new cross-continental club competition in London, with no hijab-wearing players currently playing in the Women's Super League, Slegers said: “The strength of football in society is that football is for everyone. It's really good that we have role models in all possible ways to show that football is for everyone. There are so many examples and different ways of how we can show that football is for everyone. This is one of them, so that's great.” AS Far was a step into the unknown for Arsenal with it being the first time a European and African club team have played against each other in an official competitive match. Arsenal were untroubled by the Moroccan champions, earning a 6-0 win at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium on Wednesday. Corinthians will prove to be another unknown entity for the current European champions. “We are very proud to be in this tournament, we are very proud to be the champions of Europe and we look forward to playing against the champions of South America,” said Slegers. “We are very respectful of the opposition, we are very humble also because of the unknown. We are happy to play at the Emirates, our home stadium, but we will also respect the opposition. It's a final, so they're going to give absolutely everything, together with the fans. Slegers has the same squad available to her as she did for the game against AS Far. “They're going to bring the intensity together with their fans,” said Slegers. Our fans are going to bring energy and the intensity as well. “Football is growing everywhere around the world. AS Far is a good example of that; another continent, another culture, but there's so many things to the way they play and it's at such a high level and I think tactically you see that there's a trend globally.” So we can't be complacent about anything, especially not going into this final because Corinthians are a very good team.”</p>
