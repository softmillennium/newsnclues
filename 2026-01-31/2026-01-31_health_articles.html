                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bacteriophages, the viruses that attack and kill bacteria,  can be a useful alternative to antibiotics. Antibiotics kill not just pathogens but also good bacteria, but bacteriophages can be deployed in a more targeted way to kill just one problematic strain of bacteria, leaving beneficial microbes untouched. Bacteriophages are also useful in agriculture because they provide a more targeted approach to killing bacteria. However, just as bacteria have evolved antibiotic resistance, they can also become immune to bacteriophages. That is where the Gerdt Lab's work comes in. Former lab member Zhiyu Zang, now a post-doctoral candidate at the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne, discovered a chemical molecule that when paired with the bacteriophage helps the virus overwhelm a bacteria's immune system. This finding was revealed in Zang and Gerdt's paper "Chemical inhibition of a bacterial immune system," recently published in Cell Host and Microbe. While antibiotics will likely remain the first line of defense for human bacterial infections, the Gerdt Lab's discovery could still apply to hard-to-treat infections in humans. Just as millions of bacteria strains exist, there are potentially as many chemical molecules that could be deployed to inhibit bacterial immune systems. Gerdt hopes that in 10 to 15 years, his lab will create a library of inhibitors for different bacteria. Gerdt and Zang's strategy with this paper was to begin research with a bacterium that was relatively easy and safe for undergraduates to study. Students like Olivia Duncan, who was an undergraduate when she worked in Gerdt's lab, helped Zang and Gerdt find molecules that chemically inhibited that bacterium's immune system. "Our study is important not just because we found the first example of a small molecule that can inhibit a bacteria's immune system," Zang said. This finding allows them to develop general rules and tools for a targeted approach to pathogenic bacteria with similar immune systems like  Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus, both often resistant to antibiotics and the cause of many deadly hospital-acquired infections. "Our goal is to have a collection of inhibitors that will work for different immune systems," Gerdt said. That's what makes this paper so exciting: We're starting something new and seeing where it takes off."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Organized by the Algae4IBD Consortium, of which Teagasc Ashtown are the Irish partners, this event will present findings from Algae4IBD Project that focused on the development and formulation of functional ingredients for health from algae and seaweeds, and their formulation into functional foods/nutraceuticals, pharma, and supplements. Some, like Kelp, form ocean forests and help to sequester carbon dioxide from the environment, while others are microscopic and provide a source of nutrition to fish and marine species and are also rich in nutrients like Polyunsaturated fatty acids like Omega-3 often found in food supplements. Commenting ahead of the gathering, which will also bring together stakeholders from government organizations and policy makers from Ireland and Europe, Dr. Maria Hayes, Natural Products Chemistry Research Officer in the Teagasc Food Research Center, Ashtown, said: "Seaweeds are a largely untapped Irish resource that could be used to create new products and markets for sectors impacted negatively by Brexit and recent EU quota negotiations for fish. "The key focus of the Algae4IBD Project was specifically generation, isolation and characterisation of these ingredients specifically to target pain and inflammation associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which affects greater than 3 million people in Europe including over 40,000 people in Ireland. The problem of inflammation is an ever growing one, and is also associated with aging, and the results from the project are also relevant to the development of products to prevent inflammation associated with other metabolic diseases and aging as well as inflammation in animal health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lower hinge of immunoglobulin G (IgG), an overlooked part of the antibody, acts as a structural and functional control hub, according to a study by researchers at Science Tokyo. The findings provide a blueprint for engineering next-generation antibody therapies with precisely tailored immune effects for treating diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that help the immune system recognize and eliminate foreign threats such as bacteria and viruses. The dominant antibody in the bloodstream is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which accounts for about 75 percent of circulating antibodies. Its structure is divided into two main functional units connected by a flexible hinge that must work together seamlessly. A study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry on January 29th, 2026, reveals that deleting a single amino acid in an antibody's lower hinge can dramatically alter its assembly and immune signaling. The research was led by Associate Professor Saeko Yanaka and graduate student Yuuki Koseki from the Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), Japan, in collaboration with researchers from Kyushu University, Japan, Nagoya University, Japan, and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan. Our study demonstrates that a single deletion mutation in the hinge region of IgG1 can produce half-IgG1 molecules." Saeko Yanaka, Associate Professor, Institute of Science Tokyo An IgG antibody has three main structural components. Two matching arms, known as Fab regions, bind to specific antigens, while a stem-like Fc region connects them and relays signals to the immune system. It provides just enough flexibility for the antibody arms to adapt, enabling efficient target capture while maintaining immune signaling. The IgG hinge has a "mosaic" design, with a rigid central core that holds the two heavy chains together through disulfide bonds, surrounded by more flexible upper and lower hinge segments. Previous studies have mainly focused on how changes in the upper hinge and central core affect antibody function, overlooking the lower hinge. By deleting a single proline residue (Pro230), they observed the formation of a 75 kDa half-size antibody species, known as half-IgG1. In this configuration, the disulfide bonding pattern was disrupted, and the two heavy chains were no longer stably linked. In a normal IgG antibody, the Fc region is arranged in a way that allows its two halves to pair and interact with immune receptors. This unusual arrangement likely causes the Fab arms to interfere physically, preventing the Fc region from forming its normal dimer. Despite this disruption, the half-antibody was not completely inactive. Because FcγRI can engage antibodies with high affinity, even a half-IgG molecule could still trigger immune signaling, although less efficiently than a full-length antibody. Together, these findings show that the lower hinge plays a decisive role in maintaining antibody shape, stability, and function, leading the researchers to describe it as a "structural and functional control hub" in IgG1 with the potential to design therapeutic antibodies with customized immune effects. "These insights redefine the role of hinge region and provide a blueprint for engineering antibody variants with tailored effector profiles for autoimmune disease, cancer, and beyond," says Yanaka.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis of twin cohort data suggests that human life span is far more heritable than previously believed. The findings of the analysis show that once deaths from external factors, such as accidents or infectious disease, are accounted for, genetics may explain ~50% of how long we live. "[T]he study … has important consequences for aging research," write Daniela Bakula and Morten Scheibye-Knudsen in a related Perspective. "A substantial genetic contribution strengthens the rationale for large-scale efforts to identify longevity-associated variants, refine polygenic risk scores, and link genetic differences to specific biological pathways that regulate aging." Understanding the heritability of human life span is a central question in aging research, yet measuring the genetic influence on longevity remains challenging. Although some genes linked to life span have been identified, external environmental forces, such as disease or living conditions, exert a powerful influence on how long someone lives and often obscure or confound potential genetic effects. These conclusions are striking, given that life span is far more heritable in laboratory mice and that most human physiological traits show much more genetic determination. According to Ben Shenhar and colleagues, this discrepancy may arise from overlooked confounders in previous research, particularly the heavy burden of "extrinsic" mortality – deaths due to external causes – in the historical populations that underpin these studies. These external causes of death likely dilute the measurable impact of genetics, which primarily shapes "intrinsic" mortality driven by aging and internal biological decline. Shenhar et al. used mathematical models, simulations of human mortality, and multiple large-scale twin cohort datasets to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic sources of death. According to the findings, extrinsic mortality systematically depresses estimates of life-span heritability. Once deaths from external causes are properly accounted for, the authors show that the genetic contribution to human life span rises dramatically to roughly 55% – more than double previous estimates – suggesting that genetics is a central force in human aging. These revised estimates align human life span with the heritability of most other complex physiological traits and with the life-span heritability observed in other species. Heritability of intrinsic human life span is about 50% when confounding factors are addressed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is estimated that Americans will consume 1.48 billion chicken wings during the Super Bowl, but a new Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine/Morning Consult poll finds that most Americans, 56%, would consider trying a plant-based alternative such as Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Bites while watching the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 8. You can score a touchdown for your health this Super Bowl by passing on chicken wings, cheesy dips, and meaty chili and instead opting for plant-based favorites like buffalo cauliflower or black bean chili." Stephanie McBurnett, RDN, nutrition educator, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine McBurnett suggests swapping classic Super Bowl party fare for plant-based options like Loaded Sheet Pan Nachos, Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Bites, Ultimate Baked Potato Skins, Barbecue Jackfruit Tacos, and Protein Power Three-Bean Chili, all recipes from the Physicians Committee's Universal Meals program. Plant-based meals like these are lower in fat, loaded with fiber, and high in antioxidants, helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other conditions. Research also shows that a plant-based diet can help athletes like football players with performance and recovery. The poll, conducted among 2,202 U.S. adults from Jan. 16 to 19, 2026, also found that 86% of Americans plan on eating chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday or would if they were available. But most surveyed, 88%, don't know the health risks associated with consuming chicken. Urinary tract infections, the most common form of bacterial infection, are commonly caused by meat-borne bacteria, primarily from poultry. "Whether you are an armchair quarterback or in the end zone, choosing a plant-based diet is a win for good health," adds McBurnett.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ric Treble is a retired forensic chemist, who has studied the development of novel drugs for over thirty years. He provides support to the UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and was awarded an MBE in 2017 for services to forensic drug analysis. Dr Caroline Copeland is a senior lecturer in pharmacology and toxicology at King's College London, and the director of the UK's National Programme on Substance Use Mortality. She heads a research group at King's aiming to improve healthcare strategies for people who use drugs. They showed that the most effective legislations for reducing NPS deaths in the UK were those introduced in producer countries, but that this alone does not suffice to reduce drug deaths. The illicit drug trade is international, and different countries have developed different strategies intended to minimize its negative effects, most commonly through controls on, or prohibition of, specified substances. But which approaches to banning substances are actually most effective in reducing harm? The advent of NPS, and the range of subsequent legislative controls introduced by different countries, has created a natural experiment. Using data from the UK's National Programme on Substance Abuse Mortality (NPSUM), our study examines how different national and international control strategies have translated into real-world outcomes within England, Wales, and Northern Ireland by examining NPS deaths. Internationally, there has been a high degree of consistency in drug control. All signatory nations of the conventions are then required to incorporate these controls into their national laws. However, this process of problem identification, data compilation, formulation of recommendations, and achieving international consensus followed by national legislation, is inevitably slow. In contrast, the appearance and spread of NPS within drug markets can be incredibly rapid, so there can be significant delays between local identification of issues arising from novel substances and the international introduction of new controls. Whilst challenging for policymakers, this variation provides a valuable opportunity to assess the impact of the application of different nations' controls on particular substances. In the UK, there have been very few examples of the illicit synthesis of NPS and the vast majority of such substances are imported instead, often facilitated by internet trading and 'fast parcel' delivery services. These measures effectively prevented open sale of NPS via 'head shops' and UK-based websites. In response to both local and international concerns, China introduced a series of national controls over and above those required by UN scheduling, initially on specifically named substances and, more recently, on whole families of NPS by means of 'generic' controls. National legislation within consumer countries is, of course, still essential. However, national legislation and enforcement alone cannot eliminate drug use or its associated harms. For this reason, they must be complemented by wide-ranging harm-reduction strategies. This dynamic is currently being seen in the case of highly potent synthetic opioids, a particularly concerning cause of drug-related deaths. Broad controls on fentanyl and their pre-cursors have been followed by the appearance of nitazenes and, as controls on nitazenes are being introduced, a new group of potent opioids, the orphines, has begun to appear. These cycles of control and innovation are therefore likely to continue. Early legislative action by consumer countries remains necessary to limit the distribution and harms of newly emerging NPS. The findings of our study also demonstrate the particular effectiveness of prompt action to restrict production within source countries to prevent international distribution. If, as a result of Chinese legislative actions, production of NPS for the illicit drug trade becomes more geographically diverse, action to identify new sources of production and to encourage and support supplier nations to restrict production as soon as practicable will be required. This will present particular challenges if the substances being produced and exported are not perceived to present a threat within the producing country. However, supply-side interventions alone cannot provide a lasting solution: as long as there is sustained demand for psychoactive substances, there will be strong incentives for suppliers to adapt, innovate, and profit. Reducing drug harms will therefore require not only responsive legislation and international co-operation, but also investment in education, prevention, and treatment to address the drivers of demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together with industry, researchers at örebro University are working to increase knowledge and safety in 3D printing. "We often underestimate what we cannot see," says Andi Alijagic, researcher at örebro University, about the safer use of 3D printers. We can't say that 3D printing is inherently bad, but we can't say it's inherently safe either. Our goal is not to halt the use of 3D printers. Rather, we want to contribute to making their use safer by understanding the health effects of the particles and chemicals they emit." There are many advantages to using 3D printers: less waste, more efficient production, and better-adapted products. "3D printing is an essential technology for sustainable, modern manufacturing. With the right knowledge, monitoring, and regulations, society can benefit greatly from this technology without risking human or environmental health," says Andi Alijagic.In the NanoSafety2 project at örebro University, researchers are collaborating with industry to develop a framework for measuring particle and chemical emissions and assessing their effects on the human body, as well as for making production safer through health and safety instructions, safer materials, and better-designed 3D printing processes. Families who purchase a 3D printer that manufactures plastic parts - whether in the kitchen or living room - rarely have adequate ventilation for its use. "We currently have no way of knowing what long-term effects arise from the use of 3D printers in industry or in the home," explains Andi Alijagic. "Only after long-term measurements and tests will we know more. At the same time, new plastic and metal materials and methods are being developed all the time, which may entail new risks," explains Andi Alijagic.Although there are no specific threshold values for 3D printers, there are guideline values for particles in the working environment. In Finland, such guidelines are already used to assess the risks of particle emissions from various processes, including 3D printing. 3D printing: balancing innovation for sustainability with emerging environmental and health risks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A groundbreaking study from Brown University Health researchers has identified a crucial factor that may help improve treatment for glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and common forms of adult brain cancer. The findings, published November 10 in Cell Reports, reveal how differences among cells within a single tumor influence the cancer's response to chemotherapy, and introduce a promising new therapy designed to tip the odds in the patients' favor. Even inside one tumor, some cells may respond to treatment while others resist it, allowing the cancer to persist and grow. For decades, scientists have known that tumors are composed of diverse cells, but the biological forces driving these differences, and their impact on treatment, have remained elusive. Rather than focusing on the average response, we focused on the differences between individual cells within the same tumor, and what we found could change how we treat glioblastoma." Clark Chen, MD, PhD, senior author, professor and director of the brain tumor program, department of neurosurgery, Brown University Health Chen's team discovered that a small molecule called miR-181d acts like a master switch that helps control how much of a DNA-repair protein called MGMT (short for Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase) each glioblastoma cell produces. MGMT is crucial because it allows cancer cells to fix the damage caused by chemotherapy, making them harder to kill. The problem is that not all tumor cells make the same amount of MGMT, some produce a lot, while others make very little. This uneven production means that while some cells die during treatment, others survive to fuel tumor growth. When glioblastoma tumors are treated with chemotherapy, levels of miR-181d drop. This drop amplifies the differences among individual cells within the tumor, thereby allowing more cells to make more MGMT and survive treatment. The research team found that administering miR-181d into the tumor can reduce this effect, making the cancer cells behave more uniformly, and importantly, more likely to respond to chemotherapy. "Scientifically, it helps explain why tumors maintain so much internal variability. Clinically, it opens the door to gene-therapy strategies that could be truly game-changing for many glioblastoma patients." Feedforward miR-181d degradation modulates population variance of methyl-guanine methyl transferase and temozolomide resistance. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at WashU Medicine have developed a nasal vaccine against the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, or bird flu, which has jumped from wild birds to livestock to humans. Since it was first detected in the U.S. in 2014, H5N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has jumped from wild birds to farm animals and then to people, causing more than 70 human cases in the U.S. since 2022, including two fatalities. To mitigate the risk of such an event, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis developed an intranasal vaccine that elicited strong immune responses when tested in hamsters and mice and prevented infections in exposed animals. Because pre-existing immunity from prior seasonal influenza infection or vaccination could diminish the efficacy of H5N1 vaccines, the team also confirmed their vaccine remained effective regardless of prior flu exposure. The results are published Jan. 30 in Cell Reports Medicine. This particular version of bird flu has been around for some time, but the unique and totally unexpected event where it jumped across species into dairy cows in the United States was a clear sign that we should prepare for the event that a pandemic may occur. Our vaccine to the nose and upper airway  -  not the shot-in-the-arm vaccine people are used to  -  can protect against upper respiratory infection as well as severe disease. Although a bird flu vaccine already exists, it was developed based on older strains of the virus, may not be effective against current variants and is not widely available. To create a new vaccine to better protect against bird flu, Boon and his collaborators leveraged the nasal vaccine technology developed at WashU Medicine by study co-authors Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine, and David T. Curiel, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology. A COVID-19 vaccine based on their approach has been available in India since 2022 and was approved for clinical testing in the U.S. last year. Strong immune responses depend on how well the body can recognize a pathogen. For the H5N1 vaccine's antigen, Boon and co-author Eva-Maria Strauch, PhD, an associate professor of medicine who specializes in antivirals and protein design, selected specific proteins from H5N1 representative of circulating bird flu viruses that had infected humans. In comparison, and as expected, current seasonal influenza vaccines provided little protection against H5N1 infection. Both animal models showed better protection against H5N1 infection from the nasal spray vaccine than from the same formula administered through traditional intramuscular immunization. Further, strong protection emerged even when the nasal vaccine was given as a low dose against a high exposure to bird flu. A particular advantage of this compared to intramuscular immunization, Boon noted, is that it provides much better protection against infection in the nose and lungs and therefore likely protects against transmission as well as against severe disease. “We've shown that this nasal vaccine delivery platform we conceived, designed and conducted initial testing on at WashU Medicine can prevent H5N1 infection from taking hold in the nose and lungs,” said Diamond, the co-senior author of the study. “Delivering vaccine directly to the upper airway where you most need protection from respiratory infection could disrupt the cycle of infection and transmission. They found that even with pre-existing immunity, the nasal vaccine still provided strong protection, a critical feature if the vaccine is to be of practical use since most individuals, except young children, have many prior immune experiences with influenza virus or vaccines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sporadic Nipah virus infections have occurred almost annually in parts of South Asia, particularly in India and Bangladesh, and do not indicate a new or escalating global threat. Nipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen carried by fruit bats, with human infections typically linked to localized exposure, such as contact with infected animals or contaminated food. Human-to-human transmission can occur but remains rare and usually requires very close contact during acute illness. Countries with strong public-health systems and surveillance capacity are well positioned to mitigate the risk posed by Nipah virus through early detection, clinical awareness, and rapid diagnostics. Researchers at IAV are engaged in Nipah virus research, surveillance, and development of new diagnostic testing. While there are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for Nipah virus, promising candidates have shown effectiveness in animal studies. Professor Wang said, "Progress depends on sustained public-good investment and international cooperation." The Global Virus Network underscores that the current outbreak does not represent a global emergency, but it does highlight the ongoing importance of surveillance, diagnostics, and globally connected scientific networks to detect and defend against emerging infectious threats.

Results showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 44.3 months in the palbociclib arm, compared with 29.1 months in the control arm.

Angela M. DeMichele, MD, MSCE, PrECOG co-principal Investigator for PATINA and the Mariann T. and Robert J. MacDonald Professor in Breast Cancer Care Excellence, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine The NEJM publication establishes PATINA as the first large, randomized phase 3 study to demonstrate a clinical benefit for CDK4/6 inhibition in HR+, HER2+ metastatic disease. The finding suggests a potential new maintenance-therapy approach for this patient population. Despite substantial advances in treatment, resistance to both endocrine and anti-HER2 targeted therapies remains a persistent clinical challenge. Preclinical and early clinical data suggested that CDK4/6 inhibition may help overcome resistance to these therapies. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either palbociclib with anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy (n=261) or anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy alone (n=257).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bone marrow metastasis (BMM) from non-hematolymphoid malignancies with resultant cytopenia(s) can mimic primary hematolymphoid disorders. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics of BMM from non-hematopoietic tumors. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with BMM by non-hematolymphoid malignancies at our institution over the past 10 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics, histopathological findings of bone marrow, types of metastatic tumors, and prognosis were analyzed. The four most common malignancies with BMM, regardless of gender, were prostatic adenocarcinoma (29.6%), breast carcinoma (25.9%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (5.5%), and lung carcinoma (5.5%). The main clinical and laboratory manifestations were anemia (90.7%), reticulocytosis (80.5%), thrombocytopenia (73.9%), bone pain (55.5%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (39.6%), leukoerythroblastosis (35.3%), and leukopenia (24%). The vast majority (96.3%) of metastatic tumors were identified by morphology alone; however, in approximately 2.7% of cases, immunohistochemistry was required due to subtle morphologic features. In 29.6% (16/54) of patients, BMM was identified prior to or concurrently with other metastatic sites. Although patients who received anti-tumor treatment after BMM diagnosis showed significantly improved prognosis (P < 0.01), no significant differences were observed between those treated with immunotherapy versus chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (P = 0.145). Prostate and breast carcinomas are the most common malignancies associated with BMM, with anemia, reticulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia being the most frequent clinical manifestations. While our data demonstrate that anti-neoplastic treatments, regardless of regimen, significantly improve overall survival after BMM, no significant survival differences were observed when prostate and breast carcinomas were compared with other types of BMM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapid evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses, driven by high mutation rates and the consequent formation of complex quasispecies populations, present a formidable obstacle to conventional molecular diagnostic approaches. Widely used methods such as reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction are highly susceptible to performance degradation when primer or probe binding sites accumulate nucleotide mismatches. This vulnerability can lead to critical surveillance failures during outbreak responses, allowing emerging variants to evade detection and undermining containment efforts. To fundamentally address this challenge, the researchers indicate that next-generation diagnostic technologies should evolve along two complementary pathways. This strategy emphasizes resilience to genetic variation through several key methodologies: (1) Isothermal amplification techniques utilizing multi-target redundancy. (2) CRISPR/Cas-based detection systems engineered to tolerate distal mismatches or designed with multiple guide RNAs. The underlying principle involves leveraging multi-target redundancy, conserved genomic elements, and bioengineered component flexibility to preserve high analytical sensitivity across a diverse range of viral lineages amidst ongoing genomic drift. This capability is paramount for high-resolution applications, including tracking transmission chains, discriminating vaccine-escape mutants, and confirming variants of concern. Technological precision is realized through the following methodologies: (1) Designing allele-specific probes for quantitative PCR. (2) Engineering CRISPR/Cas systems by introducing "synthetic mismatches" or utilizing high-fidelity Cas variants. (3) Employing Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute paired with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to achieve single-nucleotide resolution. In summary, this dual-strategy framework-combining broad, tolerant surveillance for frontline screening with ultra-specific, discriminatory assays for confirmatory typing-forms an essential paradigm for managing the persistent threat of rapidly evolving pathogens. The forward-looking integration of these capabilities into multiplexed, portable point-of-care devices, dynamically informed by real-time genomic epidemiology data, will be critical for deploying targeted and effective public health countermeasures in a timely manner. Emerging techniques for the detection of RNA viruses: enabling mutation-tolerant screening and precise mutation discrimination. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.
