                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price has dropped below $80,000 for the first time since April 2025. While BTC dropped alongside broader risk assets, the losses were notably smaller than those seen in precious metals. This relative strength drew attention from new market participants. Many investors viewed the pullback as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at discounted levels. Between Thursday and Friday, the precious metal plunged nearly 10%. This contrast highlights shifting investor preferences during market stress. Although gold is traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin has shown greater resilience in the short term. The smaller drawdown suggests stronger demand support for BTC. Investor behavior reflects this shift, as capital appears to favor Bitcoin over gold during recent volatility. Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. Bitcoin's network recorded a surge in new addresses over the past 24 hours. Approximately 335,772 new addresses were created, marking a two-month high. New participants likely viewed the decline as a favorable entry point. Fresh address growth often signals expanding adoption and renewed interest. These inflows can strengthen demand and support price stability during corrections. Recently, BTC broke down from a broadening ascending wedge. This bearish pattern projected a 12.6% decline, targeting the $75,850 region. Improving on-chain metrics and rising address growth increase the chances of stabilization. A stronger recovery would require Bitcoin to reclaim $87,210 as support. Achieving this would signal renewed buyer confidence and help BTC recover recent losses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. president Donald Trump's surprise nomination of former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair boosted the dollar, unwound the precious metals rally, and is bringing bitcoin below a key support level. Onchain data shared by Glassnode shows bitcoin was consolidating just above key structural support around $83.4K, the lower bound of its short-term holder cost basis model. A breakdown below that zone could open the door to a deeper slide toward $80.7K, the so-called True Market Mean. Over the past 7-day period bitcoin BTC$83,460.68 lost more than 9.2% of its value and now trades at $81,200. Glassnode's report notes that short-term holder supply held at a loss with BTC above that level remained at 19.5%, well below the 55% capitulation threshold, suggesting some resilience despite downside pressure. However, buyer conviction is being tested as price drifts lower. On the derivatives side, funding rates remain muted, pointing to cautious speculative appetite. Options markets are pricing in greater demand for downside protection, with dealer gamma flipping negative below $90K. That increases the risk of volatility spikes if support breaks. According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, sentiment across various cryptocurrency communities has plunged to extreme lows, levels that have historically preceded price recoveries. “While network fundamentals are stagnant, crowd sentiment has hit extreme negativity levels,” the firm wrote. While prices have been dropping throughout the last few months, long-term bitcoin holders are selling at the fastest pace since August. Some industry observers say the current mood may be short-lived, however. Bitwise's CIO Matt Hougan had recently joined CoinDesk's Markets Outlook, where he said crypto is in the late stages of a bear-market bottom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's inability to hold the $3,000 level isn't a concern for long-term traders and investors. The world's second-largest crypto by market cap has a clear path to more than triple in value due to a combination of strong fundamentals and bullish technical patterns. But even if this bullish outlook plays out, it only represents a 2x return from its all-time high of $4,946.05. However, this type of return may pale in comparison to what early-stage crypto presale projects could offer. Digitap ($TAP), a fintech startup with a live crypto banking platform, is emerging as the better altcoin to buy for outsized gains. Digitap is the world's first “omni-bank” platform that blends everyday fiat finance with digital assets. Users can take advantage of a Visa card linked to their account balances. A partnership with one of the most recognized brands in payments signals that Digitap wants to be a serious contender in the banking industry. This immediate real-life utility of making crypto spendable also signals that Digitap has a tangible product from day one. An optional no-KYC signup process also opens the door to a large market. Digitap can provide basic banking services, including a Visa card, to this overlooked community of hardworking people seeking financial inclusion. Digitap's crypto presale of its native $TAP was launched last summer. During the peak of the crypto market selloff, when Ethereum tumbled from more than $4,000 to around $2,500, Digitap saw investor interest accelerate. After each round is sold out or expires, $TAP increases in value. In fact, a well-diversified altcoin portfolio that lost 30% would have broken even with a mere 10% allocation to $TAP in the first round. Aside from its status as a top altcoin to buy and hedge against a weak market, Digitap's tokenomics are built for long-term value creation. This model ties $TAP's value directly to the platform's success. Ethereum's price has lost around 15% from its early 2026 highs above $3,200. The $10,000 outlook is based on multiple signals lining up at once. These include Wyckoff-style accumulation patterns, cycle-based upswings, and liquidity correlations. When all factors align, traders are bullish on a coin's outlook. On the fundamental side, on-chain activity adds another layer justifying Ethereum as a solid crypto to buy. Daily active addresses are up about 50% over the same period. At the same time, smart contract deployments are hitting record highs. Ethereum reaching $10,000 would represent a milestone for the entire crypto industry, similar to Bitcoin hitting $100,000. Older Ethereum investors who bought years ago would reap impressive returns if the token reaches five figures. However, for investors seeking the best altcoin to buy for explosive gains, Ethereum's high-end scenario is limited to roughly a 3x return from current levels. Digitap's status as a crypto presale project offers an alternative. It is an early-stage project offering ground-floor valuations backed by a working product with real utility. If Digitap executes well and captures its target market, investors could see gains substantially higher than a 3x return. In fact, Digitap could offer the type of gains Ethereum once delivered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT ecosystem has transformed digital ownership, enabling creators, collectors, and investors to interact through blockchain-powered assets. Developing such a marketplace requires careful planning around business models, platform features, technology, and growth strategies, ensuring long-term value for stakeholders while maintaining adaptability to evolving trends and user expectations. Building an NFT marketplace involves creating a digital platform that allows users to mint, buy, sell, and trade non-fungible tokens securely on the blockchain. It is more than a transactional platform—it acts as a hub for creators and collectors, facilitating digital ownership, royalties, and secondary sales. NFT marketplaces are evolving at a rapid pace, with 2026 seeing significant adoption across industries. Increased use of blockchain for art, gaming, and digital collectibles, along with broader acceptance by brands and institutions, drives marketplace growth. Marketplaces that offer innovative use cases, secure infrastructure, and engaging user experiences are likely to lead growth, shaping the way digital assets are created, owned, and traded across the global ecosystem. Selecting a sustainable business model is crucial when developing an NFT marketplace. Understanding different models helps in aligning the marketplace with target audiences and market goals. A clear business model also builds trust among users, attracting both creators and collectors. By evaluating commission structures, subscription options, and hybrid revenue streams, developers can choose a model that ensures profitability while supporting the growth of the NFT ecosystem. A feature-rich NFT marketplace improves user experience, enhances security, and ensures efficient transactions. Scalability is achieved when these features operate seamlessly as user numbers increase. Choosing the right technology stack ensures that an NFT marketplace can operate efficiently, scale effectively, and maintain security standards. The stack includes blockchain selection, smart contract development, backend infrastructure, and frontend frameworks. Each component plays a vital role in the platform's performance and reliability. Proper technology integration allows seamless transactions, real-time data handling, and a smooth user experience, which are essential for building trust and fostering long-term engagement in a competitive NFT market. Effective marketing is key to attracting and retaining users in an NFT marketplace. A well-planned growth strategy involves community engagement, strategic partnerships, educational content, and incentive programs. Each element contributes to user acquisition, increased transactions, and loyalty. Legal compliance is critical to establishing trust and ensuring operational continuity in an NFT marketplace. Developers must adhere to intellectual property laws, AML regulations, taxation guidelines, and data privacy standards. Failure to comply can result in financial penalties or reputational damage. Scalability ensures that an NFT marketplace can grow sustainably while maintaining performance and user satisfaction. A scalable marketplace is capable of handling higher transaction volumes, attracting more users, and supporting long-term business growth without compromising the quality of service or security. Building a scalable NFT marketplace requires a comprehensive strategy that combines robust business models, advanced technology, user-focused features, and growth-oriented marketing. By addressing regulatory requirements, optimizing platform performance, and continuously evolving through data-driven insights, developers and entrepreneurs can create marketplaces that support creators and collectors while contributing to the long-term development of the NFT ecosystem. New blockchain protocols also allow for multiple tokens to be used to support transactions or coordinate governance such as by rewarding certain behavior. Whether people view him with support, criticism, or uncertainty, his story continues to spark conversations that go far beyond the courtroom. Social media, news outlets, and public figures weighed in almost instantly, often forming strong opinions before all facts were fully examined. This reaction highlighted a broader issue: how quickly narratives are created in the digital age and how difficult it can be for truth to move at the same speed as outrage. At its core, the Rittenhouse case forced many people to confront uncomfortable questions. What responsibility do individuals have during moments of public unrest? And perhaps most importantly, how does media framing influence public perception before a trial even begins? What makes his situation particularly notable is how polarized reactions became. For some, he represented a failure of social systems and accountability. For others, he became an example of how legal processes can be overshadowed by emotional narratives. Regardless of where one stands, it is hard to deny that his case exposed deep divisions in how people understand justice and personal responsibility. Interestingly, this pattern of public reaction is not limited to legal cases. A surprising comparison can be drawn with Sean Strickland, a professional mixed martial artist known for his blunt personality and controversial statements. While Strickland operates in a completely different arena, the way audiences respond to him reveals something important about modern culture. Much like Kyle Rittenhouse, discussions about Strickland frequently move beyond facts and into identity-based reactions. People tend to project their own beliefs onto public figures, turning them into symbols rather than individuals. This process simplifies complex human stories into easily digestible narratives, often at the cost of nuance. The comparison between Kyle Rittenhouse and Sean Strickland is not about equating their actions or professions. Instead, it highlights how society reacts to figures who do not fit neatly into acceptable molds. In both cases, public opinion tends to form quickly and solidify strongly, leaving little room for balanced discussion. This reflects a broader trend where debate becomes more about taking sides than seeking understanding. Legal outcomes may bring closure in court, but public judgment often continues indefinitely. This raises ethical questions about how society treats individuals after high-profile events and whether redemption or privacy is truly possible in the digital era. The way stories are presented can shape beliefs more powerfully than facts themselves. Sound bites, headlines, and viral clips often replace full context. Learning to slow down, verify sources, and separate emotion from evidence is increasingly important, especially when discussing sensitive topics like those surrounding Kyle Rittenhouse.

It has slipped by 47% from its all-time high despite improving network metrics. This article explains why the token has crashed despite its network growth and what to expect. A closer look at key third-party data shows that the Ethereum network is firing on all cylinders, a trend that will accelerate after the upcoming Glamsterdam and Hegota upgrades. At the same time, the number of active users jumped by 45% to 14.7 million, while network fees rose by 11% to over $12.39 million. Data shows that Ethereum fees have dropped sharply in the past few months and are almost cheaper than some layer-2 networks. According to Artemis, it has handled over $1 trillion in volume in the last 30 days, with the number of stablecoin addresses soaring to over 7.2 trillion. Stablecoin transactions and volume will continue accelerating in the coming years. Analysts believe that the supply of stablecoins will jump from over $300 billion today to over $1 trillion in the next few years. While the number of competitors such as Solana and Aptos has increased, data indicate that their dominance has accelerated in recent months. It also happened as ETH ETF outflows accelerated in the past few weeks. As such, it may drop towards that level in the coming weeks and then stage a strong rebound. However, a drop below $2,125 will invalidate the bullish outlook. READ MORE: Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Risks Drop Toward $70K Add us to your feed and stay ahead of the market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FOI sought further details on a potential housing development in Lambeth - the site pictured would have been demolished and redeveloped for a new housing development, but the plans were scrapped after a resident ballot saw a majority of residents vote against the plans(Image: Facundo Arrizabalaga ) Lambeth Council has been rapped by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for failing to disclose information to a resident around a potential housing development in the borough. In a ruling published on December 17, the ICO said it could have taken the council to the High Court for contempt of court but chose not to because of how "lengthy" it would have been, which would have caused further delays to the investigation. A Lambeth Council spokesperson said it will respond to the ICO report "in due course", adding that it was committed to openness and transparency in all of its work and ensuring it is held to the highest possible standards. The resident had submitted a Freedom of Information (FoI) request to the council on November 28, 2024 which asked for pre-application information relating to the potential redevelopment of Bellevue Garden Mansions in Stockwell. The plans would have seen the loss of a communal garden, a local nursery and a green space which contains basketball courts which are heavily used by the Stockwell community. Hyde's plans had been met with strong opposition from residents living at Bellevue Garden Mansions and the wider Stockwell community (Image: Peter Arkell ) The FoI sought all pre-application advice given by Lambeth Council to Hyde Housing regarding the development, as well as any emails, letters or meeting minutes between council officers and third-party representatives. The resident requested for several other details, including records of any site visits by council officers and evidence of any initial plans, proposals or concept designs. The council responded on January 3, 2025, confirming that it held relevant information but ultimately rejected the resident's request, citing environmental and commercial exceptions. Bellevue Garden Mansions is located on Clapham Road, Lambeth (Image: Google Street View ) The ICO contacted the council in July of last year and asked for a copy of the information it was withholding as well as legal arguments which supported its reasons for withholding information on commercial and environmental grounds. The council was legally required to respond to the Information Notice within 30 days, but did not respond until 48 days later. A spokesperson for residents who are involved with the FOI request told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): "Lambeth Council seems to be avoiding this issue. They wouldn't even let us speak for three minutes at a recent council meeting. "The original stock transfer document between Lambeth and Hyde Housing guaranteed that Hyde would maintain and repair Bellevue Garden Mansions until 2029, not demolish them. We eagerly await Lambeth Council's response to the ICO's ruling on this matter." The ICO has ordered Lambeth Council to disclose the information it withheld and must take action within 30 days of the ICO issuing its decision otherwise it could face High Court action. A spokesperson for Lambeth Council told the LDRS: "We receive over 3,000 FoI requests every year, and we work hard to respond to all of these fully – in compliance with regulations and within statutory timescales. Where problems do arise, we are committed to resolving these swiftly and fairly." Don't miss out on the biggest local stories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto markets are doing what they always do before major upside. According to the report, Strive purchased an additional 334 Bitcoin, pushing total holdings to roughly 13,132 BTC, now worth over $1.1 billion at current prices. When smart money stacks during uncertainty, it usually precedes explosive rotations into high conviction crypto picks. DeepSnitch AI sits directly in that window, offering traders a presale backed by live AI security tools and aggressive bonuses that are drawing serious capital ahead of launch. Corporate Bitcoin accumulation signals the next expansion phase Recent news around Strive ramping up its Bitcoin exposure while cleaning up debt is a classic pre-rally signal. This is what smart money does before the markets rip. They are loading Bitcoin when the price is boring, and the sentiment is quiet, which usually means they are positioning ahead of a bullish expansion phase. Bitcoin remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now for stability and trend confirmation, but let's be real. Stacking BTC alone is not how traders print 300x. Once confidence returns, capital rotates fast into presales and high conviction crypto picks where the real moonshots live. Best cryptocurrencies to buy right now: DeepSnitch AI, WLD and CC 1. SnitchFeed delivers breaking crypto news faster than social platforms. These tools are already active, which puts DeepSnitch AI in a completely different category from typical presales. Bonuses scale up to 300%, meaning allocations can literally quadruple before listing. That kind of multiplier is only available before launch. This is exactly why traders are aggressively positioning early. It also sits at the intersection of AI utility and meme energy, which historically creates viral adoption when market sentiment flips bullish. Among all presales, DeepSnitch AI is clearly the strongest high conviction crypto pick right now. The rally was driven by speculation that OpenAI could integrate Worldcoin's Orb technology into a humans-only social network, triggering a 40% intraday spike and an 831% surge in trading volume to $690M. This kind of narrative plus volume expansion is classic early bull behavior. If OpenAI confirms any linkage, WLD could push back toward $0.75 to $1.00 short term. For traders asking what crypto to buy now, WLD stands out among the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now as one of the strongest high-conviction crypto picks and emerging market favorites this cycle. Canton Network (CC) When traders start asking what crypto to buy now, it is usually because capital is rotating beneath the surface, and Canton (CC) fits that setup cleanly. CC is trading around $0.16 on January 29 after gaining 3.15% in the last 24 hours and extending a weekly move of more than 9%, even as the broader market stayed soft. The move followed Bitcoin briefly reclaiming $90,000, which flipped sentiment and pushed money into selected altcoins with strong institutional narratives. Rising volume and bullish momentum are opening a path toward the $1 zone. In this environment, Canton is increasingly viewed among the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now, shaping into one of those high-conviction crypto picks that quietly turn into market favorites once momentum fully kicks in. Conclusion: DeepSnitch crushes competitors with AI utility and bonus multipliers Institutions stacking Bitcoin is a loud signal, even if it looks quiet on the chart. For traders asking what crypto to buy now, this is not about chasing green candles or buying tops. Don't sleep on DSNT bonus codes before presale ends. Frequently asked questions What crypto to buy now for maximum upside? What crypto to buy now comes down to early positioning, and DeepSnitch AI offers live tools, audits, bonuses, and real 100x potential in presale with launch coming soon. What are the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now? The best cryptocurrencies to buy right now include DeepSnitch AI since it offers working products, heavy demand, and presale leverage that others lack. DeepSnitch AI separates itself by shipping live products, passing audits, and offering bonuses that amplify early positions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum Foundation will adopt a five-year austerity plan to maintain its roadmap while fostering decentralization and user control over data and privacy. Reports say the funds, worth about $45 million, will back a broad list of projects: open silicon, secure hardware, private messaging, local-first operating systems, and tools that mix zero-knowledge proofs with other privacy tools like FHE and differential privacy. Simple apps for daily life are included, not just fancy research. In these five years, the Ethereum Foundation is entering a period of mild austerity, in order to be able to simultaneously meet two goals: Buterin is taking on what might once have been “special projects” of the foundation. He withdrew the ETH personally, and reports note he is looking at secure, decentralized staking to route future staking rewards into these efforts. That shifts some financial risk from institutions to an individual who wants those projects to survive even when they are slow or controversial. Some of the initiatives are unlikely to attract fast capital. The Foundation is said to be entering a phase of mild austerity so it can meet two clear goals at once: finish an aggressive technical roadmap and remain alive and independent into the far future. The technical aim is to keep Ethereum fast and scalable without losing decentralization or security. Reports note that “Ethereum for people who need it” is the guiding line, rather than chasing large corporate deals that transform how people use the chain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Payment networks used earnings season to detail the numbers and strategies behind stablecoins. Both companies tied stablecoins to broader roadmaps that include agentic commerce, B2B payments and faster cross-border settlement. That shift was evident in this week's results from Visa and Mastercard, where management teams paired financial performance with disclosures on stablecoin settlement and emerging use cases. The company reported an annualized global stablecoin settlement run rate of $4.6 billion and said it now enables stablecoin card issuance in more than 50 countries. “Stablecoins have tremendous growth and disruption potential but are still in the very early stages of adoption for payments use cases,” McInerney said during the conference call with analysts. Visa management emphasized that these efforts are not substitutive to other parts of the business. “The stablecoin opportunity remains additive to what Visa is doing today,” McInerney said, pointing to on-ramps and off-ramps, settlement, money movement, consulting and value-added services as parallel growth paths. Executives also noted they do not expect stablecoins to immediately reshape mature digital payment markets, saying demand today is strongest in regions with constrained access to U.S. dollars and in cross-border scenarios where settlement speed matters most. Michael Miebach, Mastercard's CEO, said: “For us, stablecoins and agentic commerce are emerging opportunities, ones where Mastercard has a natural role to play.” He added: “Most use cases for crypto and stablecoin today offer trading and the like. For us, it is another currency we can support within our network.” He underscored why payment networks matter to broader adoption: “Trust, interoperability and global acceptance are key in all payments. During the quarter, Mastercard supported co-brand partners such as MetaMask as they expanded across geographies, worked with Gemini on what Miebach described as the first business-focused stablecoin co-brand and continued to broaden settlement capabilities, including partnerships with Ripple. Stablecoins are also being woven into the networks' push toward agentic commerce, where artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents initiate transactions on behalf of consumers and businesses. Visa is working with more than 100 partners on agentic commerce and is integrating stablecoins into the same infrastructure stack that supports credentials, tokens and real-time payouts. That operational momentum is unfolding against a shifting regulatory backdrop. PYMNTS reported this week that the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced a crypto market structure bill that would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission primary authority over spot digital commodity trading, while securities provisions remain under the Senate Banking Committee's jurisdiction and must be merged into a final package. PYMNTS also reported that the SEC and CFTC have begun aligning on shared data standards and coordinated supervision, signaling a move away from fragmented oversight. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
