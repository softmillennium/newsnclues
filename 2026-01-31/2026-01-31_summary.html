            Photographs appear to show former Prince Andrew on all fours leaning over a woman or girl lying on the floor, in the latest release of Epstein files from the US Department of Justice on Friday.
    


            In one undated image, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor looks directly at the camera as he crouches over the fully clothed figure, whose face has been obscured.
    


            Another photograph shows Mountbatten-Windsor's hand placed on the same person's abdomen. In the background, another unidentified person props their feet up on a table, which has a stack of towels on it.
    


            The latest Epstein documents also contain an email exchange between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor in August 2010 in which the disgraced financier invites the royal to meet a “friend” for dinner in London.
    


            Mountbatten-Windsor replies he would be “delighted to see her” and tells Epstein to give her his contact details.
    


            Epstein then describes her as a 26-year-old Russian that is “clevere (sic) beautiful, trustworthy,” and confirms that she has Mountbatten-Windsor's email.
    


            The messages are sent two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting sex with a minor.
    


            More than a month later, in another set of emails, Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor make plans to meet in London. Mountbatten-Windsor suggests dinner at Buckingham Palace where they would have “lots of privacy.” Epstein writes that the pair will “need/have private time.”
    


            It is unclear when or where the images were taken; no captions or context for the photographs was provided with the document release. Neither the photographs nor the email messages suggest any wrongdoing. CNN has attempted to contact Mountbatten-Windsor for comment.
    


            Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied all accusations against him and insisted that he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior of which Epstein was accused. In a now-infamous BBC interview in 2019, he said that he severed all ties with Epstein in 2010.
    


            The Justice Department on Friday released its latest tranche of files related to the investigation into Epstein, six weeks after its Congressional deadline to do so.
    


5 early takeaways from DOJ's big Epstein files drop



            The new photographs and email exchanges are likely to cast additional scrutiny on Mountbatten-Windsor over Epstein links, which eventually led King Charles to strip his brother of his “prince” title and evict him from his Windsor mansion in an extraordinary move last year.
    


            Buckingham Palace did not offer a fresh statement when approached by CNN on Saturday. Instead, it pointed to its October 2025 statement outlining King Charles' decision to remove Mountbatten-Windsor's style, titles and honors.
    


            Last month, the DOJ released another cache of Epstein files, which underlined Mountbatten-Windsor's relationship with not only Epstein but Epstein's then-girlfriend, disgraced former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            In one email, a person identified as only “A” wrote from the British royal family's Scottish residence in 2001, asking whether Maxwell had “found me some new inappropriate friends.” A separate set of emails appears to show Maxwell helping plan a trip to Peru for “A” that involves “girls.”

US president reportedly eyes plot near Memorial Bridge for a large-scale structure named the Independence Arch

Donald Trump reportedly wants the arch he is planning to build in Washington DC to dwarf the Lincoln Memorial.

The US president envision the planned arch to be a height of 250ft, or significantly taller than the 100ft-tall Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. It would also be significantly taller than Paris's 164ft-tall Arc de Triomphe – but less than half the height than the Gateway Arch in St Louis, Missouri, the world's tallest arch.

The Post reported that Trump has his eye on a plot of land near Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River, citing two people who are familiar with the plans and spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity.

The latest proposed addition to the Washington skyline comes as Trump is already constructing a new East Wing to the White House containing a ballroom. At 89,000 sq ft, the new ballroom is supposed to be larger than the White House's 55,000-sq-ft footprint, at the same 70ft height.

The scale of Trump's envisioned arch, named the Independence Arch, has already alarmed some architectural experts, including one who initially supported a smaller arch.

“I don't think an arch that large belongs there,” Catesby Leigh, an art critic who conceived of a more modest arch in a 2024 essay, told the Post. Leigh's idea was reportedly brought to Trump by allies of the president's administration.

Leigh had initially proposed a temporary, 60ft arch to mark the 250th of the US's declaration of independence. But Trump went for a permanent design four times larger and funded with leftover donations to the $400m White House ballroom project.

“If you're going to build an arch that big, you should build it in another part of town – and one possible site that comes to mind is Barney Circle,” Leigh was quoted by the outlet as saying. Barney Circle in south-east Washington DC overlooks the Anacostia River.

“There's nothing around it competing with it,” Leigh added.

But Leigh also recommended an architect, Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, who in September posted enthusiastically on Twitter/X: “America needs a triumphal arch!” together with a rendering. Charbonneau reportedly has since been retained by the White House to work on the project.

But the site of the proposed arch on a small plot of land that is under the jurisdiction of the US national park service. It lies between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery and could reshape the existing relationship between the two memorials as well as obstruct pedestrians' views.

It could also be thematically jarring to plant a celebratory arch on Memorial Circle – amid the sightline of Arlington national cemetery, the Memorial Bridge (envisioned as symbolic representation of peace between the Union and Confederacy after the Civil War) and the Lincoln Memorial.

The chairperson of Benedictine College's architecture program, John Haigh, told the Post: “It's a very somber corridor”.

Trump has reportedly considered more modest arch designs, including 165-ft-high and 123-ft-high versions, that he shared at a dinner in 2025. But the president has decided to go big in part because 250ft mirrors the 250th anniversary of the US's declaration of independence in July.

People at the dinner quoted Trump as saying: “250 for 250 makes the most sense.”

Trump is said to have told guests at a White House Christmas reception, “The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And we're gonna top it by, I think, a lot.”

The idea for an enormous arch in Washington DC is not entirely new. Trump told Politico in December that he hoped to begin construction of the arch within two months. Earlier in January, he posted images to his Truth Social platform of three potential designs, including one with gold gilding.

The Post noted that Washington is unusual among major cities for lacking a triumphal arch to commemorate national achievements.

Atlanta philanthropist and developer Rodney Mims Cook Jr, president of the National Monuments Foundation, has been appointed by Trump to the Commission of Fine Arts that would in theory oversee the arch.

The filings undermine DHS claims the facility was solely a state project, potentially reviving a court-ordered shutdown.

New court filings allege that federal and state officials withheld evidence of the Trump administration's involvement in the Everglades detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” a revelation that could revive a court-ordered shutdown. The Jan. 7 filings come as the Miccosukee Tribe presses ahead with its legal challenge amid President Donald Trump's recent veto of legislation expanding the tribe's control over Everglades lands.

The filings, submitted by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, argue that newly disclosed records show that the federal government helped fund and operate the facility from its earliest stages. The defendants, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have repeatedly argued that the facility — located in the Big Cypress National Preserve region of the Florida Everglades — was a strictly state-run operation managed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM). 

If the project is deemed a federal action, it would trigger mandatory environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires an environmental review for major federal projects.

The records cited in the filing include a June 20 email documenting an agreement between Florida officials and the federal government to allow FDEM to detain noncitizens using federal immigration authority under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, with federal funding support. Additional emails show that Florida formally applied for federal funding for the detention facility by Aug. 7, followed by a federal grant award letter dated Aug. 15, that provided guidance on how those funds could be spent. Plaintiffs say the documents were never provided to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida despite discovery and public records requests, and that the agencies failed to update earlier sworn declarations after they were rendered inaccurate by new information.

“We now know that the federal and state government had records confirming that they closely partnered on this facility from the beginning but failed to disclose them to the district court,” said Tania Galloni, an attorney with Earthjustice, which represents Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, in an emailed statement. “They cannot continue to evade responsibility for what they've done to the Everglades. The government is not above the law.”

DHS did not respond to Prism's request for comment. 

Since it was first announced in June of last year, “Alligator Alcatraz” has been at the center of a high-stakes legal battle over environmental law, federal authority, and Indigenous sovereignty. The Miccosukee Tribe announced that it was entering the legal fight on July 14, shortly after the environmental groups first filed suit. In its brief, the tribe echoes the environmental groups' findings and frames the dispute as an existential threat to tribal land, culture, and community safety.

“The Tribe's constitutional commitment to this land runs deep,” the brief states. “It's written into their Constitution to protect the Everglades because the Everglades protected them when they were being hunted by the Government.” 

The brief adds that the tribe “had no notice of the facility,” even though federal environmental and historic preservation laws state agencies must consult with federally recognized tribes when undertaking major federal actions that may affect Tribal lands or cultural sites. The physical barriers erected around the site, the brief notes, now block tribal members' primary access to Big Cypress for traditional activities.

In a December press release, the tribe described the facility's proximity to Miccosukee communities. A tribal village sits approximately 1,000 feet from the entrance to the detention camp; 11 villages are located within three miles; a school bus stop lies directly in front of the facility; and a K–12 school is less than 10 minutes away. 

In the press release, the tribe said its “use and occupancy rights in the Big Cypress National Preserve, and the safety and security of the community in the villages near to the detention camp, have been substantially impacted.”

Tribal leaders also warned that the facility threatens subsistence fishing and hunting, ceremonial practices, and the health of the Everglades ecosystem that sustains Miccosukee cultural life and recharges the Biscayne Aquifer, a primary source of drinking water for millions of Floridians.

“The Miccosukee Tribe is at home in the Everglades and the Big Cypress,” Chair Talbert Cypress said in the release. “We have a Tribal constitutional duty to defend our homelands from environmental degradation and defend our people from big government overreach.”

Those concerns are echoed in a resolution adopted by the National Congress of American Indians at its 2025 annual convention in November. The resolution, titled “To Call for the Prohibition of Using Indian Country as Venue for Internment or Detention Camps,” situates “Alligator Alcatraz” within a broader national pattern and draws a parallel to the historical placement of Japanese internment camps on or near tribal lands during World War II. 

The resolution states that the facility was constructed on land where the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes hold federally recognized use and occupancy rights, under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Ron DeSantis, without compliance with federal, state, county, or tribal permitting regimes or consultation with affected tribes. The resolution warns that bypassing environmental review and tribal consultation threatens treaty-protected rights, noting that “the fulsome exercise of Tribal rights depends on the health of the ecosystem.”

New construction at the detention center was briefly halted on Aug. 21, when U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a temporary restraining order. The order paused further building, stopped the arrival of new detainees, and directed that the facility be dismantled within 60 days, citing the lack of required environmental review and the risk of irreparable harm to the Everglades and nearby Miccosukee communities. 

But on Sept. 4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction. The appellate court did not rule on the legality of the facility, but placed the lower court's order on hold while the appeal proceeds, allowing detention operations to continue. 

Tribal leaders say the case is not only about a single detention facility, but about whether emergency powers can be used to bypass environmental safeguards and tribal consultation altogether. The outcome, tribal advocates argue, would determine whether environmental law and tribal sovereignty remain meaningful protections, or if they can be sidelined when government authorities say so.

The tribe's legal intervention was followed by a political setback. On Dec. 30, Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have expanded and clarified the Miccosukee Tribe's control over certain lands in the Florida Everglades. 

In his veto message, Trump explicitly referenced the tribe's opposition to “Alligator Alcatraz,”; supporters argued that the veto was retaliation against the tribe for exercising their legal rights.

In a Dec. 31 statement responding to the veto, Cypress said the tribe was “disappointed” by the White House's decision to reject the bipartisan Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, which he described as a measure aimed at protecting a historic tribal village facing serious flood and environmental risks. Cypress emphasized that the tribe “has never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,” but instead acted to ensure “sufficient environmental due diligence” to protect federal restoration investments in the Everglades. The legislation, he said, was not about “special treatment,” but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and clarifying land status for tribal members who have lived in the area for generations.

In response to the veto, Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Prism in an email, “The Miccosukee Tribe has such close, enduring ties to the Everglades. It is revolting that the president would retaliate against their effort to defend a place that is not only deeply important to the Tribe but to so many Americans in Florida and beyond.” 

This isn't the first time the tribe has confronted the federal government over development in Big Cypress. In the late 1960s, the tribe joined scientists and conservationists in opposing the Everglades Jetport, a massive airport that threatened to permanently alter the ecosystem and disrupt Miccosukee homelands. That resistance ultimately led to the project's abandonment, the creation of Big Cypress National Preserve, and the signing of NEPA. In 1969, the tribe and its allies prevailed. Today, they are invoking that same law.

“This detention facility was planned in secret, built in secret, and operated in secret — concealing devastating impacts to Big Cypress National Preserve and the Everglades,” said Eve Samples, executive director at Friends of the Everglades, in an emailed statement. “Friends of the Everglades was founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in 1969 to protect this very site from harmful development, and we won't stop fighting until it's safe and the government complies with all environmental laws.”

According to Bennett, the new findings regarding federal involvement “confirms the reasonableness of the district court's factual findings that there was a state-federal partnership for Florida to detain noncitizens with a commitment of federal funding, which affects a central issue in this appeal: whether there was a final, major federal action requiring compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.” 

If the appeals court ultimately upholds Williams' findings, the stay would be lifted, and the injunction halting construction and detention operations would again be in force.

Experts said the memo's legal claims violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

An internal legal memo obtained by the New York Times reveals that federal immigration enforcement agents are claiming broad new powers to carry out warrantless arrests.

The Times reported on Friday that the memo, which was signed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Todd Lyons, “expands the ability of lower-level ICE agents to carry out sweeps rounding up people they encounter and suspect are undocumented immigrants, rather than targeted enforcement operations in which they set out, warrant in hand, to arrest a specific person.”

In the past, agents have been granted the power to carry out warrantless arrests only in situations where they believe a suspected undocumented immigrant is a “flight risk” who is unlikely to comply with obligations such as appearing at court hearings.

However, the memo declares this standard to be “unreasoned” and “incorrect,” saying that agents should feel free to carry out arrests so long as the suspect is “unlikely to be located at the scene of the encounter or another clearly identifiable location once an administrative warrant is obtained.”

Scott Shuchart, former head of policy at ICE under President Joe Biden, told the Times that the memo appears to open the door to give the agency incredibly broad arrest powers.

“This memo bends over backwards,” Shuchart said, “to say that ICE agents have nothing but green lights to make an arrest without even a supervisor's approval.”

Claire Trickler-McNulty, former senior adviser at ICE during the Biden administration, said the memo's language was so broad that “it would cover essentially anyone they want to arrest without a warrant, making the general premise of ever getting a warrant pointless.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted in a social media post that the memo appears to be a way for ICE to “get around an increasing number of court orders requiring [US Department of Homeland Security] to follow the plain words of the law which says administrative warrantless arrests are only for people ‘likely to escape.'”

The memo broadens the terms, Reichlin-Melnick added, so that “anyone who refuses to wait for a warrant to be issued” is deemed “likely to escape.”

Stanford University political scientist Tom Clark questioned the validity of the memo, which appears to directly conflict with the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, which requires search warrants as a protection against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

“So, here's how the law works,” he wrote. “People on whom it imposes constraints don't get to just write themselves a memo saying they don't have to follow the law. Maybe I'll write myself a memo saying that I don't have to pay my taxes this year.”

A nation that can feed its billionaires but not its children has an economic system built to protect cruelty.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

When school counselors must decide which children get to eat, it's time to acknowledge we're in a national affordability crisis. The problem is the economy itself — not just its current condition, but the underlying unfairness of how it is organized.

A friend recently told me a story that made this reality impossible to ignore. Her elderly parents live near an elementary school not far from the nation's capital. For several years, they had been quietly raising money to provide groceries and basic supplies for families whose children were going hungry. When Republicans suspended SNAP benefits, the need surged overnight. What had been a steady act of care suddenly became an emergency response.

They gathered donations from grocery stores and community members and were able to support 102 children across four local schools. But more than twice that many needed help.

This meant that in the wealthiest nation on earth, school counselors — people trained to nurture children, not triage hunger — were conscripted into the role of deciding which children would eat and which children would be left to endure hunger. A nation that can feed its billionaires but not its children is not suffering from confusion; it is suffering from both a crisis of conscience and a system built to protect cruelty.

And yet, even in the face of realities like this, we are still being told that there is not a widespread affordability crisis in America.

Recently, economist Allison Schrager, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote an op-ed arguing that “there is not a widespread ‘affordability crisis' in the U.S.,” suggesting that while some households are struggling, the economy is “positive for most Americans.” She acknowledges rising food, housing, health care, and childcare costs — but insists that because “real income growth is still positive for most Americans” the situation should not be described as a broad crisis. In her telling, what millions are experiencing is less a structural failure than a matter of sticker shock, a need to readjust expectations that are too high, or simply lingering anxiety. To reach those conclusions Schrager had to pointedly ignore a recent JPMorganChase Institute report showing that real income growth has slowed to near-decade lows, with median real income for prime-age workers rising only about 2 percent after inflation — and younger workers are seeing even weaker gains.

You can hear that same distance from reality echoed at the highest levels of government. During Donald Trump's recent national address on the economy he falsely claimed that grocery prices were falling. In fact, grocery prices are up 2.7 percent over the past year, a meaningful increase for families already stretched thin. Electricity prices — conveniently absent from Trump's speech — are up some 13 percent, driven in part by the explosive growth of energy-intensive data centers tied to his own push for rapid AI expansion. These costs do not disappear because they are omitted from a speech; they show up in monthly bills.

What makes MAGA politicians and economists like Schrager economic alchemists rather than social scientists is that they assess the economy from the vantage point of the comfort of their own prosperity, ignoring the evidence that working people create the nation's wealth while the rewards are quietly captured by those already at the top. Schrager herself once lamented in a column, “I'm not nearly as rich as my Fidelity balance suggests.” When the greatest hardship you are facing is a tremor in your financial investment account, it becomes easy to declare that most people in the U.S. are doing fine.

But most people in this country do not live by Fidelity accounts. They live by their monthly bills. From New York City to Seattle, from sea to shining sea, the U.S. economy is starving the poor and stuffing the rich. In New York City during 2025, the median asking rent was about $3,599 a month, and rents now take roughly 55 percent of the typical household's income, well above standard affordability thresholds. A February 2024 report showed 50 percent of households headed by Black people were housing insecure. 

My hometown of Seattle, too, is one of the least affordable housing markets in the U.S., with rising home prices and rent. In the Seattle metro area, a household now needs to earn almost $92,000 a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment, and rents for one- and two-bedroom apartments have risen more than 30 percent in just a few years. Additionally, fewer than 1 percent of homes for sale in the Seattle area are affordable to middle-income households. At the same time, Seattle is home to more than 54,000 millionaires, including 130 centimillionaires, and at least 11 billionaires. This contradiction is not accidental. It is engineered. Zoom out further, and the scale becomes impossible to ignore. Globally, the richest 1 percent hold more wealth than the bottom 95 percent of humanity combined.

Economic inequality is structural — and people are beginning to make that unmistakably clear at the ballot box.

In recent elections, openly socialist leaders like Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani won not by minimizing the problem, but by naming the affordability crisis directly and advancing a vision of bringing democracy into the economy. They spoke unapologetically about taxing extreme wealth, expanding public goods, and shifting power away from corporations and toward working people. Affordability is not a feeling. It is a monthly calculation. And for millions of families — including those children whose names were weighed and sorted by a school counselor — the numbers simply do not add.

Yet rather than confront the injustice at the heart of that reality, some insist the real mistake is believing fairness should matter at all. Schrager even recently wrote that “a lack of fairness actually powers the economy forward,” urging us to worry less about justice and more about growth.

We have reached the bleak moment when capitalism has grown so distorted, so grotesquely unequal, that even some of its most ardent defenders no longer bother pretending it is fair. They simply ask us to accept injustice as wisdom.

Maybe the first step toward fixing our affordability crisis is to send economists back to preschool. Preschoolers are taught that fairness matters. They are taught to share. They are taught that other people's needs matter. These are the moral foundations of a humane society. Allison Schrager might benefit from sitting crisscross on a classroom rug and relearning them, instead of explaining to hungry families why their hardship is “efficient.”

Beyond re-enrolling some of our nation's economists in preschool, the other imperative for addressing the affordability crisis is collective organizing — and, when necessary, strikes. When elites tell us that a “fixation on fairness” breaks government, they are really telling us whose lives they value least. Our task, then, is clear: organize society around solidarity and human need.

We've seen what a struggle for that kind of world has looked like before.

It was workers organizing that won the 8-hour workday, the weekend, child labor protections, Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the right to unionize. It was Black sanitation workers striking in Memphis, immigrant laborers walking out of fields and factories, teachers in West Virginia and Chicago refusing to quietly watch public goods collapse. More recently, strikes by auto workers, baristas, nurses, hotel workers, and Hollywood writers have secured better wages, safer conditions, and fairer contracts.

On January 23, 2026, unions and immigrant rights activists organized a general strike in Minneapolis to demand that ICE leave Minnesota and that the agent who killed legal observer Renee Good be prosecuted. As The Intercept reported, “Tens of thousands of Minnesotans braved extreme cold to march en masse and shuttered a reported 700-plus businesses in a daylong general strike with the support of all major unions.”

Workers walked off the job, schools closed, flights were disrupted, and downtown commerce ground to a halt. Unions representing teachers, nurses, telecom workers, hospitality workers, graduate employees, municipal workers, and stagehands coordinated walkouts and work stoppages — often maneuvering creatively around no-strike clauses by using sick time, safety provisions, and collective pressure on employers.

The result was a rare thing in American political life: a multi-sector shutdown that echoed the Minneapolis General Strike of 1934 and the “Day Without Immigrants” strike of 2006, demonstrating that when workers collectively withhold their labor, they can confront not only economic exploitation, but also state violence and rising authoritarianism.

The struggle for fairness is not naïve; it is the work of people who believe we deserve something better. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. understood this long before today's affordability crisis. “Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism,” he insisted, “but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country.”

Today, as millions struggle to afford rent, groceries, health care, and the basic conditions of a dignified life, they are rediscovering what King knew: Democratic socialism — an economy where workers democratically control the wealth they create — is fairness made real, both morally and materially.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 30 rejected the Kremlin's proposal for holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow but signaled readiness for a meeting in a more appropriate format.

 "I can just as well invite him to Kyiv, let him come. I'm openly inviting him, if he dares," Zelensky said during a briefing with journalists, hinting that Putin is trying to avoid face-to-face talks.

The comments follow Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov's statement that Moscow is prepared to ensure Zelensky's security and working conditions if he comes to Russia to continue discussions on ending the war.

Ukraine previously said it was open to a meeting between Putin and Zelensky to discuss two crucial issues in an ongoing U.S.-led peace process: territorial questions and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

However, the Ukrainian president rejected holding talks in either Russia or Belarus, arguing that Moscow is the aggressor in the war, and Minsk its partner.

The two leaders have not held face-to-face talks since the start of the full-scale war, meeting previously during the Normandy format negotiations in 2019. Last year, Putin rejected Zelensky's proposal for talks in Turkey, instead inviting the Ukrainian president to Moscow — an offer Zelensky promptly declined.

"We are serious about the need to end the war. Any real format for a meeting of leaders is suitable," Zelensky said.

The latest round of peace talks among Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. officials took place in Abu Dhabi on Jan. 23-24, with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff describing the discussions as "very constructive."

The negotiations were scheduled to continue at the same venue on Feb. 1, but Zelensky did not rule out that the next round may be postponed.

"I don't know when the next meeting will be," the president said, saying that the date and location may change due to the "situation with the U.S. and Iran."

Recent days saw renewed tensions in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly again weighing strikes against Iran following weeks of violent crackdown against anti-regime protests.

Ahead of the next round of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will hold separate talks with U.S. officials in Florida. Dmitriev will meet with members of the Trump administration on Jan. 31, a White House official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. 

The Florida meeting comes one day before the talks in Abu Dhabi scheduled for Feb. 1 — the same day Russia claims is the deadline for its pause in attacks against Kyiv. 

Zelensky also commented on the supposed week-long pause in aerial strikes that Trump announced on Jan. 29. 

According to the Ukrainian leader, there was no direct agreement between Kyiv and Moscow on halting strikes against energy facilities, but he pledged that Ukraine is ready to refrain from attacking if Russia does the same.

"I think this is the response that the mediator in these negotiations, namely the United States of America, was expecting," Zelensky added.

Throughout this winter, Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine's power grid, causing one of the most serious energy crises during the war and triggering a state of emergency.

A pause in Russian strikes — provided that Ukraine also refrains from attacking Russian oil refineries and tankers — was said to be discussed during the trilateral meeting in Abu Dhabi.

Alfredo Mancillas was reportedly slumped in vehicle and ‘covered in vomit' when state troopers found him in St Paul

A US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employee was recently arrested amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota after state troopers reportedly found him “covered in vomit” and unconscious in a car.

Alfredo Mancillas Jr, 31, faces charges of drunken driving after his arrest early Tuesday morning, jail records show.

The Sahan Journal, a non-profit Minnesota news site, first reported Thursday that Mancillas drew attention from state police after having parked a car in a no-parking zone on a St Paul road and slumping over in the vehicle. Troopers who approached Mancillas alleged that he smelled of alcohol and that his eyes were watery and bloodshot, so they administered to Mancillas a field sobriety test, the Sahan Journal wrote.

Mancillas failed, subsequently refused to submit to a breath test and was booked into a local jail on counts of third- and fourth-degree driving while intoxicated (DWI).

Custody records show Mancillas was released on his own recognizance shortly before noon Tuesday, and the native of Corpus Christi, Texas, was tentatively given a 24 March court date.

A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – which oversees CBP – said in a statement that the agency's professional responsibility office was reviewing Mancillas's DWI arrest.

“CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission,” the DHS statement also said. “And the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe.”

Attempts to contact Mancillas were not immediately available.

His arrest occurred weeks after more than 3,000 federal immigration agents descended on St Paul and Minneapolisas part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign.

The so-called Operation Metro Surge invited widespread public backlash against the White House after agents fatally shot two 37-year-old US citizens in Minneapolis earlier in January: Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot Good to death on 7 January as she drove away from a confrontation. Then the border patrol killed Pretti having already disarmed and restrained him on 24 January.

On Tuesday, Trump administration officials demoted the border patrol's Gregory Bovino from his role as the agency's commander at large and sent him out of Minneapolis. Administration border chief Tom Homan was put in charge of the Minnesota operation and on Thursday said he “recognized that certain improvements could and should be made”, though he didn't elaborate.

The movement is taking its message on the road, campaigning across the province for an independence referendum

Mitch Sylvestre arrives at the heart of his message midway through an hour-long presentation. 

With a series of infographics, screengrabs of tweets and headlines pulled from supportive news outlets projected on a screen behind him, he makes his case: thousands of kilograms of fentanyl are being sent to the U.S. from Canada; immigration is an effort to replace “old stock” white Canadians; money earned in Alberta is sent East and never returns.

Listing grievances directed at Ottawa and standing at a lectern draped in an Alberta flag, Mr. Sylvestre is speaking on this cold January night at a community hall in Eckville, about two hours northwest of Calgary. At least 400 people have come to listen. Even more are just there to sign the petition trying to force Alberta's first-ever separation referendum.

“They're lying to you,” says Mr. Sylvestre, about the “elites” in the East. “They don't respect you and they're stealing from you.”

“So, do they like you? They absolutely hate you.”

Mr. Sylvestre, 70, a United Conservative Party constituency president and sports-store owner from Bonnyville, has given this presentation nearly 100 times over the past year, continually tweaking to keep it relevant. Most recently, he added Prime Minister Mark Carney's remarks in China about adapting to the “new world order.”

This is his pitch for Alberta independence.

The Globe and Mail attended three separatism campaign events in January, in Donalda, Eckville and Calgary, conducting interviews with movement leaders and speaking with nearly two-dozen supporters. 

The referendum push, coming as Quebec voters consider a renewed dalliance with the separatist Parti Québécois, is happening during a period of sharpened focus on Canadian national unity that hasn't occurred in generations.

Mr. Sylvestre's campaign hinges on contempt for Ottawa, and the sense that the feeling is mutual. It's a jacked-up version of the anger and frustration that has pervaded the province for decades: that despite Alberta's abundant natural resources, and the revenue it produces for the country, the federal government continues to act against the province's best interests.

This moment, however, is new. The landscape shifted with U.S. President Donald Trump's “51st state” provocations and tariff threats. 

Premier Danielle Smith, in response, embraced gentle diplomacy, punctuated by her trip early last year to meet Mr. Trump at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort and her suggestion that the U.S. delay its trade war with Canada until after last year's federal election to help the more “aligned” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

Mr. Trump's threats undoubtedly propelled Mark Carney's rise to Prime Minister – an outcome that many staunch independence supporters, Mr. Sylvestre included, cite as their breaking point with Canada.

The day after Mr. Carney's election last April, Ms. Smith – who was partly elected UCP Leader on a pledge to wrestle more control from Ottawa – announced that she would be making it easier for Albertans to engage in “direct democracy.” This concept allows the electorate to force votes on government policy through petitions, changes that have ushered new life into the possibility of an independence vote, coming as soon as this year.

Alberta's separatists, with their referendum question approved by Elections Alberta, have until May 2 to collect nearly 178,000 signatures, or 10 per cent of votes cast in the past election. If successful, Albertans will have to answer yes or no: “Do you agree that the province of Alberta should cease to be a part of Canada to become an independent state?” The referendum would be non-binding, but a Yes vote could trigger fraught negotiations between Alberta and Ottawa. 

Support for independence, floating between 20 and 30 per cent according to most polling, has remained stagnant, despite several flashpoints in the past year. 

Ahead of last year's election, in March, Ms. Smith threatened a national-unity crisis if Mr. Carney didn't respond to her demands to change federal energy and environmental policies and pave the way for a new bitumen pipeline. Ms. Smith then hit the road, holding a series of raucous provincewide town halls through the summer where separatism featured prominently.

In November, most of Ms. Smith's demands were met in a milestone agreement signed with Mr. Carney, which she hoped would signal to Albertans that Canada can work – a sentiment for which she was booed days later at her party's annual convention.

Throughout it all, Ms. Smith has continued to advocate for a “sovereign Alberta within a united Canada,” a position described by University of Calgary political-science professor Barry Cooper as “calculated ambiguity.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Sylvestre, his right-hand man, lawyer Jeffrey Rath, and a cadre of separatists have built their campaign organization, Stay Free Alberta. Events, popping up in cities and towns across the province, vary in shape and size. On a Tuesday night in Donalda, population 216, there is coffee, tea and bite-size snacks, and about 40 chairs set up in rows, about half of which are filled.

Stay Free Alberta has a list of speakers who show up to their events. In Donalda, it's Chris Scott, a cafe owner from the town of Mirror, who was acquitted in 2023 of charges related to breaking COVID-19 public-health restrictions. He went on to build an online presence, currently dedicated to advocating for independence.

Mr. Scott boasts that they will reach a million signatures, which they hope will force the province to negotiate with Ottawa on the movement's terms. “We are going to hold their feet to the fire. And when there's a million plus signatures on this petition, that becomes much easier,” he says.

Independence leaders are unconcerned with the risks of separation and steadfastly believe Alberta would be better off without Canada, arguing that its natural resources offer leverage over Ottawa. And if they believe the provincial government is failing in negotiations, Mr. Rath says they'll just “replace the government.”

“We're building a political movement that will control the government of Alberta,” he said.

For months, Mr. Rath and his colleagues have trumpeted two meetings with U.S. State Department officials in Washington and say their message has been received by the Oval Office.

The White House and the State Department on Thursday confirmed those meetings, inviting accusations of treason from B.C. Premier David Eby; the day before, Ontario Premier Doug Ford asked Ms. Smith to pick a side.

The Premier didn't denounce the meetings, but said she expects the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty. 

“I'm not going to demonize or marginalize a million of my fellow citizens when they've got legitimate grievances,” she said. “What we need to do is we need to give Albertans hope.”

Separatists' rejection of U.S. statehood has not stopped Mr. Trump's explicitly expansionist administration from weighing in on a potential referendum, raising concern that the campaign is laying out the welcome mat for unchecked foreign interference.

So far, despite images on social media showing crowds at rallies and lines to sign the petition, there is little evidence that the movement is growing.

Polling aside, the only metric of support came in a by-election last June when the separatist Republican Party of Alberta was trounced by the UCP in a riding where a strong strain of independence was believed to exist. The Alberta New Democrats secured more votes than the Republican candidate.

Prof. Cooper, with the University of Calgary, describes the current movement as a “warning” to Ottawa. Though Ms. Smith and Mr. Carney have signalled that their relationship is evolving, even warming, he said there are significant risks if their energy deal fails to yield results.

“I'm convinced that there will be a crisis between Alberta and Ottawa some time,” said Prof. Cooper.

At their stop in Eckville, Mr. Rath works up a sweat as he riffs on a number of subjects while arguing that Ottawa is engaging in “the planned destruction of our province.”

He doesn't fear being landlocked. Alberta, he says, would hold up trucks in transit to Ontario from B.C. and impose a punishing tariff on those goods: “Or would you rather let us have a pipeline? We'll see how quickly Alberta remains landlocked under those circumstances.”

Sandra Shippelt, a canvasser in Eckville, says Canada's cost of living is untenable, and she believes that an independent Alberta would be more affordable. She “loved Canada” but changed her mind about a year ago.

“If we were asked to come into Confederation with the deal that we have now, would you?” says Ms. Shippelt. 

On Monday, Spencer Burton and Alicia Ward were among several hundred people adding their names to the petition at the Big Four Roadhouse on Calgary Stampede grounds. The young couple, 33 and 35, view independence as a bargaining chip.

“Change needs to happen, whether it ends up being Alberta separating or we end up working with Ottawa,” said Mr. Burton, who lives in Calgary.

Thomas and Jean Limqueco were among the people who signed the petition at the campaign event in Calgary.Amir Salehi/The Globe and Mail

Thomas Limqueco and his partner, Jean, who moved to Calgary from the Philippines 15 years ago, said they're disillusioned with Canada's immigration policy. Mr. Limqueco, calling Mr. Trump “the main guy” and “big dog,” said he felt Canada has no business standing up to the U.S. and didn't object to joining Alberta's southern neighbour.

“Here in the West, we're more aligned with the U.S. I don't see us being aligned with the people in the East,” he said.

Later that evening, over four thousand people packed the Stampede venue for a rally, many wearing blue ballcaps reading “Republic of Alberta,” some with Alberta flags draped over their shoulders, nary a Canadian flag in sight. 

At the end of the night, as people left to make their way home, a catchy anthem, composed by an artificial-intelligence algorithm, boomed through the speakers: “Goodbye, elites, in Ottawa.”

            Marla Ailor attended President Donald Trump's inauguration last year with her family, and remembered thinking it was a long day.
    


            So she breathed a sigh of relief on Friday as she watched Melania Trump's documentary and saw that — after a day that included three balls and returning to the White House at 2 a.m. — the first lady kicked off her heels.
    


            “It's a gauntlet,” she said. “You really appreciate what they have to go through in order to get through an event like that, and what their day must really be like.”
    


            Ailor, the elected clerk-treasurer of nearby Westfield, was one of about 100 people — mostly older women — who packed all but two of the 10 rows of seats at a Regal movie theater northeast of Indianapolis on Friday for one of the first showings of Amazon MGM Studios' “Melania,” which documents a 20-day stretch leading up to Trump's return to office. In Carmel, a group of about 20 women who are active in local politics bought tickets for the 12:45 p.m. showing.

            The film wasn't a hit in every city on its opening day. Theaters in some cities were nearly empty. In Washington, DC, the first showing of the day — 11:30 a.m. ET at Regal Gallery Place downtown — was about one-third filled, and almost everyone in the theater was a reporter. Representatives of NPR, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Atlantic were among those in the room.
    


            Before the previews began, a male reporter called out, “Is everyone a journalist here?”
    


            A chorus of replies came from across the room: “Here.” “Here.” “Here.”
    


            “Any civilians?” the man asked.
    


            “I'm a civilian,” said one woman, who added that she was there with a journalist friend.
    

CNN went to theaters around the country to interview audience members of 'Melania,' the controversial Amazon produced documentary about the First Lady.


            Critics have alleged the multi-million dollar film might have been made with an ulterior motive. The president on Thursday batted away suggestions that the $40 million that Amazon MGM Studios paid to acquire the rights could constitute corruption. “I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal actually,” he told reporters on the red carpet at a Kennedy Center premiere.
    


            In the film, it's the president, not the first lady, who draws most of the laughs. One scene depicts Donald Trump asking his wife if she'd watched his election night victory speech, as she responds — seemingly in a hurry to get off the phone — that she'll catch it later on the news. Attendees chuckled when he's told he'll ride to the inauguration with outgoing President Joe Biden and responds, “That'll be an interesting drive.”
    


            In London, some who attended the documentary's opening day panned it afterward. One person said that “it's like if Victoria Beckham became first lady.”
    


I've covered Melania Trump for more than a decade. Here's what I learned from her new documentary



            Siblings Daniel and Elise Fairweather both disliked the film, even though Daniel — who called it “tone-deaf” — said he likes Melania Trump herself. “She's surrounded by ‘yes' men,” Elise Fairweather said.
    


            Still, across the United States on Friday, many Trump supporters said they'd bought tickets to see “Melania” on its opening day because they wanted to demonstrate their support for the first family.
    


            Outside an AMC theater in Los Angeles, Mary Eike, a 74-year-old retired CPA and Trump supporter, said she showed up early to catch the first screening. When asked what motivated her to come see the film, Eike told CNN she feels it's “about time they did something with that gorgeous first lady.”
    


            “This woman is beautiful and she's charming and nice and just a strong person,” said Eike, a Los Angeles resident who voted for Trump. “If I had a daughter, I'd want her to be just like her.”
    


            After seeing the documentary, Eike told CNN that she'd been struck by the same thing Ailor in Indiana had mentioned.
    


            “What I couldn't get over was 22 hours in heels — looking drop dead gorgeous after 22 hours,” Eike said.
    


            A 73-seat theater at the Cinemark Majestic in Meridian, Idaho, was nearly full. Most of the theatergoers appeared to be in the 50s, 60s or 70s, and mostly female. Their reactions during the screening were largely subdued, with a few chuckles here and there, such as when Melania Trump calls her husband and says, “Hi, Mr. President,” and he responds, “Hi, honey.”
    


            “It was interesting to see the role of the first lady and garner perspective on what she does,” said Kenny Cormack of Meridian, who said he'd come to the earliest showing largely to accompany his mother and sister.
    


            He said the most surprising thing, to him, was “the influence she had on the decorations, and the thought that went into it. That part kind of impressed me.”
    


            In Jupiter, Florida, 69-year-old Maggie Little said she loved the music — including Melania Trump singing Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean” during a car ride and waving her hands to the Village People's “Y.M.C.A.”
    


            In California, Eva Hackett, 80, a retired real estate agent and a Los Angeles resident, said she appreciated seeing “how much work” goes into being the first lady.
    


            “I have a lot of admiration, more for her now than before. I knew she was intelligent. I always liked the fact that she was stubborn,” Hackett said. “I thought she gave us a good insight into everything that goes into the first lady – and the long day and the patience.”
    


            A moment many attendees across the county pointed to as a highlight: Melania Trump suggesting the word “unifier” as she watched the then president-elect practicing his inaugural address and looking for a word to replace what had previously been written. The president works in the first lady's suggestion, and pauses, turns and points to her after delivering the line during his speech.
    


            In Indiana, Erica Strahm, a 52-year-old youth coordinator for a tobacco prevention and cessation program from Westfield, said she teared up at times during the movie — including when Melania Trump talked about her relationship with her mother, who died in early 2024.
    


            Strahm said she wanted to see the film on its opening day to show her support. She said she didn't learn new things about the Trumps, but appreciated being able to “see the behind the scenes of what you don't normally get to see.”
    


            “I didn't know what to expect, and I thought it was fantastic. It was one of those movies where at the end I wanted to clap,” she said.

The brutal handling of immigration raids and the killing of Alex Pretti have tested the reticence of the corporate class

During Donald Trump's first term, the US's corporate titans were prepared to literally turn their backs on the president when they disagreed with them. Weeks of growing national anger over deadly immigration crackdowns in the US have highlighted how much has changed.

Publicly, the US's top CEOs have stayed – mostly – quiet during Trump's second term, even as his administration has undermined free trade policies, cracked down on the immigration that many businesses relied on, and attacked the Federal Reserve – a pillar of the US's financial hegemony.

But the administration's brutal handling of its immigration raids in Minnesota and the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis have tested the reticence of the corporate class to its limits, highlighting their lack of leadership amid growing public anger.

A day after federal agents pinned down and shot protester Pretti, 37, to death on 24 January, a group of 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy, 3M and General Mills released a group statement calling for the “immediate de-escalation of tension” and for law enforcement agencies “to work together to find real solutions”.

“The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life,” the statement read, which came after Renee Good, an unarmed woman, was also killed by federal agents in Minneapolis.

A separate statement from Michael Fiddelke, incoming CEO of Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, also did not mention Pretti, Good or the actions of federal law enforcement. “What's happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target,” Fiddelke said.

The statements ended up producing a backlash against what many saw as a response too soft given the circumstances. People pointed out that neither Pretti nor Good were mentioned by name. At least eight people have either been killed by federal agents or died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2026 so far.

The pressure to say something is mounting, but the US's CEOs have so far failed to rise to the moment. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who on Saturday attended a VIP screening of the Melania Trump documentary at the White House, said he was “heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis” and that it was “time for de-escalation” in an internal message to Apple's workforce. Apple's workers are reportedly “livid” about Cook's attendance at the screening.

“De-escalation” has become the go-to safe word for US CEOs, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. In the meantime, protesters are organizing strikes and business boycotts.

Historically, American corporations have been careful to stay out of politics as best as they can, framing themselves as friendly and neutral to all. But as American politics have become more divisive over the last decade, corporations have found themselves caught in a tightening bind. Whether they respond or not, there will be consequences.

“There's no good decision. That's the kind of era that we're in right now,” said Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University's Stern business school.

In the last few years, corporations have gone from fearing liberal consumer backlash to anxieties about conservative boycotts. Now, many companies' biggest concern is being targeted by the Trump administration.

“The risks are really not theoretical – they're real,” Taylor said. “The administration is using a mix of public shaming and litigation. Are you going to be exempt from tariffs, or is your industry going to be subject to tariffs? Are we going to favor your competitors? There's a lot of economic levers the administration is using.”

Trump has made clear he's unafraid to use his vast executive powers against his enemies or anyone he deems to be too “woke”.

Many corporate executives have done their best to maintain friendly ties. Trump made sure the most powerful tech CEOs, including Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman, were in attendance at his inauguration last year. Paramount and Disney, owners of CBS News and ABC News, respectively, paid out millions of dollars to settle defamation lawsuits, and Meta paid $25m to the president over its decision to deplatform Trump after the January 6 insurrection. Amazon recently paid $30m to Melania Trump to acquire the documentary about her life.

“The government's voice has become hugely amplified on a state and federal level to the point where, when Paramount and Netflix are talking about acquiring Warner Bros, the headlines are: ‘Does Netflix have a White House problem?',” said Elizabeth Doty, executive director of Third Side Strategies, a thinktank and advisory firm that helps companies with public affairs. Doty said there's been a high-level shift toward “allegiances and loyalties, rather than rules and entrepreneurial competition” in Trump's second term.

The responses from corporate America today are dramatically different from in the 2010s and early 2020s, an era when companies were trying to align themselves with liberal causes like Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ rights and climate activism.

When Donald Trump said there were “some very fine people on both sides” in the aftermath of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally in 2017, CEOs started to publicly distance themselves from the president. As climate activism became more prominent, companies promised to pivot to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments.

After George Floyd's murder, also in Minneapolis, social media was flooded with corporations making statements in support of Black Lives Matter. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was photographed taking the knee in front of a bank vault. Companies flowed right along the tide of the racial reckoning, promising billions of dollars of investment into ensuring diversity and inclusion.

The corporate backlash against the January 6 insurrection was also swift and pronounced, with some companies announcing they would temporarily halt political donations and spending after the riot.

But even before Trump was reelected, the tides were starting to turn. The conservative movement against “woke” politics, including state laws banning diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, started to take hold. Conservative boycotts on social media fueled backlashes against products and companies like Bud Light and Target. Companies quietly dropped the diversity teams they formed after George Floyd.

And when Trump started his second term, he reentered the White House with a vengeance that has shaken many corporations.

“Corporations or brands felt like they were trapped between the left wing and the right wing,” Taylor said. “The problem then was perceived to be polarization. Today, we've still got polarization, but it's more about retaliation from the regime … and how we manage backlash from the government, versus backlash from the general public.”

Last week, Trump, through his personal lawyer, filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan and Dimon for “debanking” him after the US Capitol insurrection. The lawsuit came quickly after Dimon spoke up in defense of US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump's justice department put under criminal investigation. Dimon said that chipping away at Fed independence “is not a good idea”, to which Trump quickly responded: “It's fine what I'm doing.”

But the calculus for speaking out against issues like what's happening in Minnesota isn't just mitigating “woke” consumers and employees and a threatening federal government, Doty said. Even more is at risk when key institutions and principles are kicked away without consequences or criticism.

“Due process, rule of law, civic spaces and adherence to the constitution – all of those are essential to the environment [corporations] need,” Doty said. “The bigger choice right now is, are we going to be an economy based on loyalties and allegiances, or [one] based on institutions?”

MOSCOW, January 31. /TASS/. Russia resolutely condemns US illegitimate prohibitive measures against Cuba and Washington's pressure on the Cuban leadership and people, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

The US White House published an executive order on January 29, declaring an emergency over Cuba, its policy and government.

"Russia's position on this score remains unchanged: unilateral measures of sanctions pressure on sovereign independent states taken in circumvention of the UN and the provisions of its Charter and other norms of international law are absolutely unacceptable," the Russian diplomat stressed.

"We resolutely denounce illegitimate prohibitive steps against Havana, the pressure on the Cuban leadership and citizens of that country. We are convinced that despite the obstacles created from outside on the way of its development, Cuba will continue maintaining effective foreign economic ties," Zakharova said.

As the Russian diplomat pointed out, "this is yet another and quite radical recurrence, the strategy of maximum pressure on the Island of Freedom repeatedly used by Washington, which is aimed at economically stifling it."

"What captures attention is that the new anti-Cuban document classifies Russia, along with some other equitable foreign partners of Havana, as a ‘hostile' and ‘malign' state," she said.

"Assigning labels does not contribute either to stabilizing the Russia-US dialogue or raising the efficiency of Washington's important mediatory efforts for settling crises in various regions of the world," Zakharova emphasized.

The Russian side "cannot accept the attempts of creating obstacles to international cooperation, all the more so with the country that is confronted with a complex social and economic situation largely caused by the US trade-economic and financial blockade that lasts nearly 70 years," she pointed out.

Russia and Cuba have "special historical ties." "The traditions of our cooperation that is comprehensive have deep roots and enjoy broad public and political support in both countries," the diplomat said.

"Also, as we have stressed repeatedly, this cooperation is not directed against third countries and cannot be considered as detrimental to any interests. We firmly intend to consistently develop it for the benefit of the peoples of our countries and for the benefit of strengthening international security and stability," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.

MOSCOW, January 31. /TASS/. Northern Europe and the Baltic states should begin working on coordinated offensive information actions in case of a conflict, the North Atlantic Alliance's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence said.

A report titled Countering Information Influence Operations in the North Baltic Region obtained by TASS said that Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden need to work out actions that "should be more than ‘coordinated tweets from the capitals' and should demonstrate the value of coordinated offensive responses to penetrate hostile information environments, in preparation for a sudden escalation from threat actors. This would need to be prepared for in close cooperation with NATO and its plans and procedures."

NATO also advised the Nordic and Baltic states to jointly develop their information warfare capabilities, assign responsibilities in this area, and regularly conduct joint exercises.

In recent years, NATO has been intensifying its confrontation with Russia. In previous documents, Moscow is called the most significant and direct threat. At the same time, both representatives of the NATO countries and the military command of the bloc declare the possibility of a conflict between the alliance and Russia. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said in December that politicians in Europe were "raising the degree of hysteria" and "driving fears into their heads" about the inevitability of a clash with Russia. According to him, the allegations about a possible Russian attack on Europe are "lies and nonsense.".

A federal judge on Jan. 30 struck down key parts of President Donald Trump's executive order that tightened citizen verification requirements for voter registration, ruling he exceeded his authority.

The case concerns Executive Order 14248, which Trump signed on March 25, 2025, with the goal of preventing illegal immigrants from voting. In the order, the president directed the Election Assistance Commission to require in its national mail voter registration form that voters produce documentary proof of U.S. citizenship such as a U.S. passport.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.—A jury on Jan. 30 found a psychologist and surgeon liable for malpractice after they supported and performed breast removal surgery on a 16-year-old girl who at the time identified as transgender.

Fox Varian, now 22 and no longer identifying as transgender, was awarded $2 million in damages, with $1.6 million for past and future pain and suffering, and another $400,000 for future medical expenses.

11:56 JST, January 31, 2026

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve could bring about sweeping changes at a central bank that dominates the global economy and markets like no other.

Warsh, if approved by the Senate, will be under close scrutiny from financial markets and Congress given his appointment by a president who has loudly demanded much lower rates than many economists think are justified by economic conditions. Whether he can maintain the Fed's long time independence from day-to-day politics while also placating Trump will be a tremendous challenge.

Still, former associates and friends of Warsh say that he has the intellectual heft and people skills to potentially pull it off. His family also has connections to Trump that could reduce the pressure from the White House.

Warsh has “a judicious temperament and both the intellectual understanding but also the hopefully diplomatic talents to navigate what is a challenging position at this point,” said Raghuram Rajan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and formerly head of India's central bank.

Warsh would replace current chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump chose Powell to lead the Fed in 2017 but this year has relentlessly assailed him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.

“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting,' and he will never let you down.”

Trump said later Friday in the Oval Office that he didn't ask Warsh to commit to cutting rates, calling such a question “inappropriate” and adding, “I want to keep it nice and pure.”

But Trump added, “But he certainly wants to cut rates.”

The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, amounts to a return trip for Warsh, 55, who was a member of the Fed's board from 2006 to 2011. He was the youngest governor in history when he was appointed at age 35. He is currently a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

In some ways, Warsh is an unlikely choice for the Republican president because he has long supported higher interest rates to control inflation. Trump, by contrast, has said the Fed's key rate should be as low as 1%, a level few economists endorse, and far below its current level of about 3.6%.

During his time as governor, Warsh objected to some of the low-interest rate policies that the Fed pursued during and after the Great Recession of 2008-09. He also often expressed concern at that time that inflation would soon accelerate, even though it remained at rock-bottom levels for many years after that recession ended.

More recently, however, in speeches and opinion columns, Warsh has voiced support for lower rates, seemingly coming in line with Trump's point of view.

Financial markets reacted in ways that suggest investors expect Warsh could keep rates a bit higher over time. The dollar and yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys ticked higher. U.S. stocks fell about 0.5%. The biggest moves were in the volatile metals markets, where gold dropped more than 5% and silver sank more than 13%.

In Congress, Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, reiterated in a social media post that he will oppose Warsh's nomination until a Justice Department investigation into Powell is resolved.

Tillis is on the Senate committee that will consider Warsh's nomination.

He added that Warsh is a “qualified nominee,” but stressed that “protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.”

Tillis's opposition could complicate the confirmation process. Asked late Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, “probably not.”

Separately, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, accused Warsh of reshaping his views to appease Trump ahead of his nomination.

“I don't know how to interpret that, except to say, that's exactly what a sock puppet does,” she said. “If Donald Trump says it, then Kevin Warsh echoes it, even though it contradicts everything he had done for years.”

Warsh has frequently criticized the Fed for its ownership of trillions of dollars in government and mortgage-backed securities, which it accumulated after the Great Recession and during the pandemic.

Warsh has charged that the massive bond-buying, which was intended to lower longer-term interest rates and boost the economy, enabled Congress to ramp up spending without concern for higher borrowing costs.

Reducing the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, however, will be a fraught exercise because banks have become accustomed to the large amounts of cash in the financial system that it provides.

Warsh has also said the Fed's economic models wrongly assume that rapid economic growth threatens to elevate inflation. Instead, “Inflation is caused when government spends too much and prints too much,” he wrote in a November column in The Wall Street Journal.

The announcement comes after an extended and unusually public search. The chair of the Federal Reserve is tasked with combating inflation in the United States while also supporting maximum employment. The Fed is also the nation's top banking regulator.

The Fed's rate decisions, over time, influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, including for mortgages, car loans and credit cards.

Trump has sought to exert more control over the Fed. In August he tried to fire Lisa Cook, one of seven governors on the Fed's board, in an effort to secure a majority of the board. Cook, however, sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court, in a hearing last week, appeared inclined to let her stay in her position while her suit is resolved.

Powell revealed this month that the Fed had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department about his congressional testimony on a $2.5 billion building renovation. Powell said the subpoenas were “pretexts” to force the Fed to cut rates.

Warsh has expressed support for the president's economic policies, despite a history as a more conventional, pro-free trade Republican.

In a January 2025 column in The Wall Street Journal, Warsh praised Trump's deregulatory policies and potential spending cuts, which he said would help bring down inflation. He has also suggested that artificial intelligence will boost productivity, making the economy more efficient while reducing inflation. Lower inflation would allow the Fed to lower rates.

In December, Trump wrote on social media of the need for lower borrowing costs and said, “Anyone who disagrees with me will never be the Fed chairman!”

If confirmed, Warsh would face challenges in pushing interest rates much lower. The chair is just one member of the Fed's 19-person rate-setting committee, with 12 of those officials voting on each rate decision. The committee is already split between those worried about persistent inflation, who'd like to keep rates unchanged, and those who think that recent upticks in unemployment point to a stumbling economy that needs lower interest rates to bolster hiring.

Financial markets could also push back. If the Fed cuts its short-term rate too aggressively and is seen as doing so for political reasons, then Wall Street investors could sell Treasury bonds out of fear that inflation would rise. Such sales would push up longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, and backfire on Warsh.

Trump considered appointing Warsh as Fed chair during his first term, though ultimately he went with Powell. Warsh's father-in-law is Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a longtime donor and confidant of Trump's.

In Ottawa, various cabinet ministers are praying that TACO – the “Trump always chickens out” theory – is still valid. Or largely so, or at least somewhat so, for they are on the verge of gambling big on the U.S. President's rage factor. 

TACO is high on their minds because Prime Minister Mark Carney and several of his cabinet ministers, including Industry Minister Mélanie Joly, are thought to be embracing the idea of Canada building the Saab Gripen fighter jet and Saab GlobalEye military surveillance plane. They are both Swedish creations whose construction in Canada would create 12,600 jobs, Saab has said. 

One senior politician close to the military action, whom The Globe is not identifying because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told me that odds of a deal with Saab have climbed to 85 per cent from 50 per cent or less before last fall.

The TACO thesis is high on their minds because building the Gripen supersonic fighter – less so the GlobalEye, which is based on a plane already built in Canada (the Bombardier 6500 series business jet) – is bound to trigger apoplexy in Mr. Trump. When that happens, he typically announces tariffs, or sanctions, or launches armadas of warships. 

Mr. Trump would fly into a rage because Canada has ordered 88 U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter jets. Were the Gripen to enter the RCAF fleet, Canada would not need the full F-35 package, though it has already paid for 16 of the aircraft and is obliged to take them. 

Opinion: The idea of a mixed fleet of Canadian fighter jets should not take flight

The question is whether his rage would be followed by punitive tariffs against Canada. Maybe, but maybe not, if TACO comes into play again. 

Take Greenland, the Danish-controlled semi-autonomous territory that Mr. Trump wanted to “buy” and did not rule out invading if Denmark refused to succumb. On Jan. 17, he said he would hit the eight NATO countries that had sent small numbers of troops to Greenland with 10-per-cent tariffs. The TACO reversal came four days later – no tariffs, no invasion threat, just the vague outline of some “future deal” thought to centre on building U.S. military bases on the island.

Ditto last April, when Mr. Trump's “Liberation Day” saw him unleash a barrage of tariffs. The markets went into the tank, sending U.S. Treasury yields soaring. The President quickly dulled the edges of his tariff sword. He also threatened several times to fire U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell (which he cannot legally do, but never mind that) because Mr. Powell was reluctant to crunch interest rates. Again, Mr. Trump backed off; Mr. Powell will keep his job until his term ends in May. 

On the other hand, Mr. Trump did not back down on his threat to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power. And he has sent a naval armada within striking distance of Iran and said he may launch an attack. 

Trump's pledge to levy 50% tax on Canadian planes sparks confusion in industry

Mr. Trump obviously dislikes Mr. Carney, who upstaged him at the Davos forum earlier this month. His threats against Canada have become a natural reflex. The latest, on Thursday, saw him vow to impose a 50-per-cent levy on Canadian-made aircraft all because Transport Canada allegedly failed to certify U.S.-made Gulfstream private jets. Never mind that the ministry has been working on their certification and that Gulfstreams are allowed to fly in Canada. Details are not Mr. Trump's concern. 

To be sure, there is a fair chance that Mr. Trump will hit Canada with punishing tariffs if the F-35 order is scaled back in favour of the Gripen. It's a risk worth taking – the upside outweighs the downside. In Davos, Mr. Carney said the world is undergoing a “rupture, not a transition “ from the Pax Americana era. He called for middle powers like Canada to band together. 

The upshot is that it would be exceedingly difficult for Ottawa to square Canada's foreign policy trajectory with buying the full F-35 order. The new reality is that Canada and other non-superpowers have to pursue their own national interests, which means derisking from the Trumpian United States. 

Opinion: A Canadian-made Swedish fighter jet may kick-start a domestic defence aerospace industry. But at what cost?

The F-35 is an extremely expensive and complicated American plane – an AI-powered computer with wings – that is dependent on endless U.S. software upgrades and a steady supply of spare parts. Handing the U.S., that is, Mr. Trump, an effective veto on the long-term sustainability on what would be Canada's most crucial weapon seems not just risky, but plain irresponsible. Better to hedge with dozens of Canadian-made Gripens while reaping the rewards from the creation of a domestic aerospace R&D and supply network for the aircraft that would put Canada on the global defence-procurement map. 

Which way will Mr. Carney go? His Davos speech suggests that building the Gripen and downgrading the F-35 order would fit well his new geopolitical and geo-economic philosophy. The question is whether he has the courage to put the Gripen play in motion, which in turn hinges on his evaluation of the TACO premise. The risks are big either way, but the risks of giving up the chance to pursue military sovereignty and create an enormous defence aerospace industry along the way are far greater than worrying about placating Mr. Trump.

Texas Democrat U.S. Senate candidate James Talarico is facing renewed outrage for his comments on God and faith after claiming on a podcast that atheists are "more Christ-like than" some of his Christian colleagues in the Texas House. 

"Instead of putting the 10 Commandments in every classroom, instead of forcing school children to read the Bible against their wills, why don't we, all of us, look inward and figure out how we can be more Christ-like, even when it's uncomfortable," Talarico, who currently serves as a Democrat in the Texas House, said on the "Politics War Room" podcast published Friday. The podcast is hosted by journalist Al Hunt and Democratic strategist James Carville. 

Al Hunt added: "And that applies to Muslims and Hindus. … They can learn a lot from Jesus."

"I have met so many Hindus, Buddhists, Sikh Jews, Muslims, atheists, agnostics, who are more like Christ-like than some of the Christians I serve with in the Texas legislature," Talarico responded. "It is about how you treat other people."

CARVILLE SAYS CROCKETT'S RHETORIC OFFENDS PEOPLE WITH 'ANY SENSE OF HUMANITY,' WILL NOT BE VIABLE CANDIDATE

The Texas Democrat is running to serve as a U.S. senator and joined the podcast to discuss the race and how it's expected to be an uphill battle for a progressive Democrat. A Texas Democrat has not been elected to the Senate since 1988, with Talarico looking to unseat Republican Sen. John Cornyn. 

"There is a backlash growing in Texas against the extremism and the corruption that we're seeing at all levels of our government, and I'm seeing it everywhere I go," Talarico explained of what he's seeing from the campaign trail to flip the seat blue. 

The conversation largely focused on religion, with the former school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian explaining that he leans on his Christianity as he works in the "halls of power" while taking aim at conservatives. 

DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE CALLS NATIONAL PARTY 'CONDESCENDING,' HOSTILE TOWARD FAITH IN RED STATES

"Christian nationalism, you see people's faith growing out of their politics, right?" he said. "They're baptizing their partisanship, and they're calling that Christianity, and it's why it doesn't resemble the life, death and teachings of Jesus Christ, right? These Christians in Congress, these Christian nationalists, they want a Christian nation, unless it means providing health care to the sick, unless it means funding food assistance for the hungry or raising the minimum wage for the poor."

His remarks sparked outrage among conservatives on social media, who argued Democrats "love putting Christians down," and mocked him for previous comments on religion with one user responding: "says the dude who claims the pro-abortion position is Biblical."

"James Talarico has once again broken out his anti-Christian Christian shtick," RNC spokesman Zach Kraft said of the comments. "There isn't a woke cause that he won't claim to find buried in the Bible. Twisting Christian principles to promote woke talking points might play well with coastal elites in New York and California, but he's going to learn real quick that won't fly in Texas." 

Talarico has a long history of sparking controversy for his comments on God and Christianity, including claiming during a 2021 speech in the Texas legislature that "God is nonbinary" in a rebuke of Republican legislation focused on youth sports and transgender kids. 

DEMS SEE OPENING IN KEY SENATE RACE AS BITTER GOP INFIGHTING CONTINUES: 'LAST REMAINING STRATEGY'

Talarico joined Joe Rogan's podcast in September 2025 where he also claimed the Bible permits abortion, citing that the angel Gabriel "asks Mary if this is something she wants to do, and she says, ‘if it is God's will, let it be done.'"

"To me, that is an affirmation in one of our most central stories that creation has to be done with consent. You cannot force someone to create," Talarico said in 2025, "the idea that there is a set Christian orthodoxy on the issue of abortion is just not rooted in Scripture."

In an interview with a New York Times podcast in January, Talarico also claimed that his Christian faith has grown "by learning more about Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism," adding that "these beautiful faith traditions as circling the same truth about the universe, about the cosmos. And that truth is inherently a mystery.

Senior cadet leaders told Fox News Digital that VMI's culture promotes unity, leadership, and service, disputing claims that racism and sexism remain entrenched at the school.

This week in Fox News Digital's Campus Radicals investigative series, a historic military institute was thrust into an unexpected battle, while Chicago teachers caused multiple uproars and a nurse at a teaching hospital was fired after she went viral for all the wrong reasons. 

Virginia Democrats in the state's House of Delegates introduced a resolution on Tuesday that would establish a task force to investigate the Virginia Military Institute and determine if the historic military college should continue to receive funding. 

The move is the latest of Virginia Democrats' efforts to reinvigorate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy in the state after much of the DEI mandates and policies were revoked after President Donald Trump was elected in 2024.

"This takes away from VMI, takes away from its mission," Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., told Fox News Digital. "I think that it's harmful to the Commonwealth of Virginia, harmful to VMI as an institution, harmful to all the incredible military leaders and community leaders that have come out of VMI."

"It's just reprehensible that they would even go down this road," Wittman added. "But, it seems to be what's happening in Richmond."

Cadets Michael Ferrara, regimental S3 captain, and Devin Auzenne, regimental commander, sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital to discuss the core values of VMI, and dispute some of the allegations that have pushed Virginia Democrats to threaten the institution. 

"I would say on the cadet side, there's a little bit of confusion," Ferrara said. "One of the bills questions the contribution that VMI contributes to the commonwealth of the state and this school produces nothing but prestigious men and women ready to serve the country."

"We've had approximately 300 generals and flag officers coming from the Virginia Military Institute," Ferrara added. "We've had seven Medal of Honor recipients, 11 Rhodes Scholars, one Nobel Prize winner."

Ferrara graduates from VMI this spring, and is commissioned to serve in the U.S. Air Force as a developmental engineer. He told Fox he attended VMI because he wanted to serve the country. 

A Chicago area teacher is on administrative leave and facing calls to lose his job over a Facebook post last week offering support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

"GO ICE," the teacher at West Chicago's Gary Elementary School, posted on Facebook last week. Shortly after the post was made, activists in the predominantly Hispanic community quickly began sharing the post and calling for action to be taken against the teacher, who Fox News Digital is not naming due to safety concerns.

"Imagine working as a teacher in an elementary school in West Chicago where the Latino community is highly populated and promoting ICE, sick AF," one social media post said. 

Another commenter called the teacher a "f****** piece of s***."

Members of the Chicago Teachers Union filmed themselves protesting federal immigration enforcement and anti-DEI measures at a local Target on Friday, sparking criticism both online and from experts who spoke to Fox News Digital. 

In a video posted on Tuesday by the union, members can be seen entering a Chicago area Target holding anti-ICE signs, harassing employees and demanding answers about whether Target will "protect" its employees from ICE.

"As a private business, Target has a choice," the post said. "They can use their Fourth Amendment rights and post signs that demand ICE show warrants to enter their building. Instead, they've allowed harm to their employees and customers, while continuing to roll back DEI commitments and bow to pressure from the Trump administration."

A nurse at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health has been fired after making a series of videos suggesting ways to harm ICE agents. 

"Following an investigation, the individual involved in the social media videos is no longer employed by VCU Health," the hospital told Fox News Digital in a Tuesday night statement. "In addition, VCU Health has fulfilled its reporting requirements under Virginia state law." 

On Tuesday morning, the hospital said that it and the VCU Police were investigating the nurse over the posts after they went viral on X. 

"We prioritize the health and safety of anyone who comes to us for care. We are aware of a series of videos that appear to have been posted by an individual confirmed to be an employee of our health system," VCU told Fox News Digital in a statement. "The content of the videos is highly inappropriate and does not reflect the integrity or values of our health system."

In one video, simply captioned with "#ice #resistance #sabotage," the nurse instructed others to use a "sabotage tactic" against opponents.

"I thought of something good," she said.

"Sabotage tactic, or at least scare tactic. All the medical providers, grab some syringes with needles on the end," she said. "Have them full of saline or succinylcholine, you know, whatever. Whatever. That will probably be a deterrent. Be safe."

Succinylcholine is an anesthetic that causes rapid, short-acting muscle paralysis. The paralytic effect typically lasts for four to six minutes.

"As we've documented at Do No Harm, VCU has a long history of pushing extreme identity politics into medical education and clinical treatment," Do No Harm's Executive Director Kristina Rasmussen told Fox News Digital. "Now, they act surprised when radicalism sprouts from a ground seeded with toxic ideology."

The group represents employees and students in the medical field, as well as patients and policymakers who are fighting to keep identity politics out of medical education, research and clinical practice. Do No Harm often pushes back against DEI initiatives and youth-focused gender ideology in medicine.

"When medical schools and hospitals allow radical politics to shape curriculum, they end up training harmful activists rather than skilled medical professionals," Rasmussen continued. "VCU Health firing this nurse is the bare minimum response. Unless they clean up their act, how will any patient feel safe walking through their doors?"

St. John's University's student leaders shot down an application from TPUSA to be officially recognized as a club, following a first a school spokesperson confirmed Wednesday morning. The first time was in 2021. 

"At St. John's University, the sole authority to approve or deny new student organizations rests solely with Student Government, Inc. (SGI)," Brian Browne told Fox News Digital. "The four-round Power to Organize process aims to introduce or revitalize clubs/organizations to the St. John's Campus."

He said that during the fall semester, only four of 19 proposed organizations were approved by the SGI.

"St. John's students interested in Turning Point USA are encouraged to reapply to SGI in the Spring or pursue other existing alternatives for department-sponsored organizational support," he said. 

Several University of Minnesota student groups are leading what they are calling a "National Shutdown" in protest of federal immigration enforcement, and they are joined by far-left radicals from across the country.

On its Instagram page, the university's Black Student Union made a post directing others to a webpage called nationalshutdown.us, where they can endorse the day of action. The protesters are refusing to go to work and school on Friday, and are also promising not to shop.

"The only way for us to get justice for Alex Pretti, Renee Good, and the countless people murdered by ICE is for the shut down to go national," the Instagram post says. "NO WORK. NO SCHOOL. NO SHOPPING. VOTE NO TO ICE FUNDING."

The Black Student Union is at the top of the list of endorsers of the day of action, alongside the school's Somali Student Association, Ethiopian Student Association and Liberian Student Association. The Graduate Labor Union at the University of Minnesota also endorsed the event.

The Justice Department says it's releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosure

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that if any member of Congress would like to see materials in their unredacted form, they can make arrangements with the department to do so.

▶ Follow the latest developments on Friday's release of the Epstein files

NEW YORK (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday released many more records from its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, resuming disclosures under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier's sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with rich and powerful people such as Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The files, posted to the department's website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release in December.

Included were documents concerning some of Epstein's famous associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Britain's Prince Andrew, and email correspondence between Epstein and Elon Musk and other prominent contacts from across the political spectrum.

The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Lawmakers complained when the Justice Department made only a limited release last month, but officials said more time was needed to review additional documents that were discovered and to ensure no sensitive information about victims was released.

Friday's disclosure represents the largest document dump to date about a saga the Trump administration has struggled to shake because of the president's previous association with Epstein. Criminal investigations into the financier have long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have suspected government cover-ups and clamored for a full accounting, demands that Blanche acknowledged might not be satisfied by the latest release.




“There's a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don't think will be satisfied by the review of these documents,” he said.

After missing a Dec. 19 deadline set by Congress to release all the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needed to be redacted, or blacked out. It denied any effort to shield Trump, who says he cut ties with Epstein years ago after an earlier friendship, from potential embarrassment.

The latest batch includes correspondence either with or about some of Epstein's friends.

The records have thousands of references to Trump, including emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles about him, commented on his policies or politics, or gossiped about him and his family. Also included was a spreadsheet created last August summarizing calls to the FBI's National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline established by prosecutors from people claiming without corroboration to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump. 

Mountbatten-Windsor's name appears at least several hundred times in the documents, sometimes in news clippings, sometimes in Epstein's private email correspondence and in guest lists for dinners organized by Epstein. Some records document an attempt by prosecutors in New York to get the former prince to agree to be interviewed as part of their Epstein sex trafficking probe.

The records also show Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, reached out to Epstein on at least two occasions to plan visits to the Caribbean island where many of the allegations of sexual abuse purportedly occurred.

In a 2012 exchange, Epstein asked how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter to the island he owned.

“Probably just Talulah and me,” Musk responded, referencing his then-partner, actress Talulah Riley. “What day/night will be the wildest party on our island?”

Musk messaged Epstein again ahead of a planned Caribbean trip in 2013. “Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,” he wrote. “Is there a good time to visit?” Epstein extended an invite for after the New Year holiday.

It's not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Spokespeople for Musk's companies, Tesla and X, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

Musk has said he repeatedly rebuffed Epstein's overtures.

“Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,” he posted on X in 2025 when House Democrats released an Epstein calendar with an entry mentioning a potential Musk visit.

Epstein also appears to have tried to connect New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch with women, according to emails. In one exchange, Tisch told Epstein he had had lunch with one of Epstein's assistant's friends. He described her as a “very sweet girl,” and asked if Epstein knew anything about her.

“no, but i will ask,” said Epstein, before inquiring if Tisch had contacted another woman, crudely describing her physical features.

Tisch said in a statement that he had a “brief association” with Epstein where they emailed about adult women and other topics. He said he “never went to his island” and that he “deeply regrets” the association.

The documents show that Steve Bannon, a conservative activist who served as Trump's White House strategist earlier in the president's first term, bantered over politics with the financier, discussed get-togethers with him over breakfast, lunch or dinner and, on March 29, 2019, asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.

Epstein told him his pilot and crew “are doing their best” to arrange that flight but if Bannon could find a charter flight instead, “I'm happy to pay.” Apparently in France at the time, Epstein sent a text message saying: “My guys can pick you up. Come for dinner.” The exchange did not show how that played out.

In December 2012, Epstein invited Howard Lutnick, now Trump's commerce secretary, to his private island for lunch, the records show. Lutnick's wife accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.

Lutnick has said he cut ties with Epstein long ago. A Commerce Department spokesman said Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”

Another Epstein contact surfacing in the records is former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler. In one of several exchanges, Epstein emailed Ruemmler to advise that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”

A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler is general counsel and chief legal officer, said in a statement that Ruemmler “had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice” and “regrets ever knowing him.”

The tens of thousands of pages released last month included previously released flight logs showing Trump flew on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s, before their falling-out, and several photographs of Clinton. None of Epstein's victims who have gone public with their stories have publicly accused Trump, a Republican, nor Clinton, a Democrat, of wrongdoing. Both have said they had no knowledge he was abusing underage girls.

Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his Palm Beach home. The U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges.

A draft indictment from that period released Friday shows prosecutors contemplated federal charges against not just Epstein but three others who were his personal assistants and were suspected of participating in a conspiracy to recruit underage girls to perform lewd acts with Epstein.

In 2021, a federal jury in New York convicted Maxwell, a British socialite, of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of his underage victims. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

U.S. prosecutors never charged anyone else in connection with Epstein's abuse of girls. One victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, accused him in lawsuits of having arranged for her to have sexual encounters at age 17 and 18 with numerous politicians, business titans, academics and others. They all denied her allegations.

Among those accused was Britain's Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles amid the scandal. Andrew denied having sex with Giuffre but settled her lawsuit for an undisclosed sum.

Giuffre died by suicide last year at age 41.

The remnants of a 19th-century shipwreck have emerged from beneath the sands of a New Jersey beach.

The ruins were recently found at Island Beach State Park, a narrow barrier island along the Jersey Shore in Ocean County.

In a Jan. 22 Facebook post, the state park identified the wreck as the Lawrence N. McKenzie — a cargo ship built in 1883.

The 98.2-foot-long schooner was wrecked off the coast of the Garden State on Mar. 21, 1890, en route to New York City from Puerto Rico. Its homeport was Provincetown, Massachusetts.

The ship — and its entire cargo of oranges — was swallowed by the sea, though all eight crew members aboard survived.

Officials said the wreck was exposed due to rough surf and heavy winds in recent weeks.

Last May, researchers announced they had identified mysterious bones that were found on Atlantic County beaches in the 1990s, with additional remains found in Ocean County in 2013. 

The bones belonged to Henry Goodsell, the captain of another 19th-century schooner.

Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.


Former Sports Illustrated model turned influencer, Haley "Baylee" Kalil, is in hot water after speaking about her ex-husband during a live stream.

The 33-year-old influencer recently filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed against her by her ex-husband, former NFL offensive lineman Matt Kalil, who accused her of "invasive commentary" during a live stream on Twitch in November 2025.

Matt and Haley met and got married in 2015, prior to her gaining national attention for her photographs in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.

Here is a look back at Haley's professional career leading up to her most recent legal battle with her ex-husband.

SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL HALEY KALIL GETS CANDID ON PERSONAL HEALTH BATTLE: ‘I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN'

Kalil began modeling for Sports Illustrated in 2017. (Gilbert Carrasquillo/FilmMagic)

Haley began her journey with modeling while attending St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where she was studying medical biology.

While in school, she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2014 and placed as runner-up. She then began working on local and commercial modeling while in school.

She continued to work as a model and in 2017 entered the Sports Illustrated Swim Search, ultimately winning a spot in the magazine and gaining national attention. The following year, she was named Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Rookie of the Year and continued modeling with the company through 2019.

"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit has truly, I mean truly, changed my life," Kalil told Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in December 2024. "I went from being somebody that had no modeling experience, I had never had a modeling agency, I was turned down by every modeling agency I ever contacted ... And so, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit has truly opened up so many doors for me. It's all about embracing beauty in every different shape, size, color, and it's that diversity that makes Sports Illustrated Swimsuit so beautiful."

Haley began posting on TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, explaining on a recent episode of the "Not Skinny But Not Fat" podcast that initially "my entire following I think was like 99% dudes," because she was posting sexy content because she thought that was what she "was supposed to post as a model."

Things changed for her after she appeared in another influencer, Caleb Simpson's apartment tour series. Her apartment tour went viral, with Haley saying on the podcast, "I hit a million like right after. I thought pretty fast."

"The thing that surprised me was I was used to a world where like it was men in my comment section," she explained. "It was men talking about my body, talking about my face, oversexualizing me pretty much, which, like I put myself in that position. I don't judge them for that. But this was women in the comment section of Caleb's video, and it was women being like, 'Yo, I vibe with her.'"

After her apartment tour went viral, she realized she could step away from what she learned in her modeling career about "how men are supposed to perceive me" and just be herself, since "women are vibing with me," which she said was "a really, really, really good feeling."

Her career as an influencer has been extremely successful, as she has amassed over 16 million followers, with her videos consistently reaching over two million views. She has also been invited to interview celebrities on the red carpet for her own social media and outlets such as E! News and Variety, at events like the Golden Globes, Grammys and Oscars.

Haley's career as an influencer has not come without its fair share of controversy.

The influencer faced backlash in May 2024 when she posted a video of herself at the Met Gala dressed in an 18th century style dress and headpiece, syncing her lips to audio of Kirsten Dunst saying "Let them eat cake" in a scene from the 2006 movie "Marie Antoinette."

Many found the now-deleted video to be tone-deaf, as she posted it as pro-Palestinian protesters were standing outside the Met Gala. One commenter wrote, "The sound choice that you're using is wild. We are truly living in a dystopian world," while another told her to "read the room."

Haley posted an eight-minute apology video on TikTok following the backlash, explaining she wasn't even invited to the Met Gala and was just there interviewing attendees for E!'s coverage. She also said she was "sorry that I chose a sound that you guys could ever possibly feel was malicious in nature," and that she wouldn't have chosen it if she knew people would be offended.

"I never would have chosen a sound on purpose to highlight wealth disparity or elitism. I never even thought it would be taken in that way, because I wasn't elite enough to even be invited to the Met Gala because I'm not elite. I'm a normal person," she said. "My dumb self just used an audio that I thought was viral and trending and that people recognized from the 'Marie Antoinette' 2006 movie. I didn't think that much into it, and for that I am so sorry. I did not do my due diligence."

During a recent appearance on the "Not Skinny But Not Fat" podcast, Haley discussed the early days of her career and how she never thought she would have a career in entertainment.

Growing up in Minnesota, Haley explained she always "idolized" fashion and YouTube and the entertainment industry, but "just didn't think I would ever have access to it," adding her parents never would have allowed her to have a YouTube account before she turned 18.

"But that was always my dream, like I loved performing, and so I went to school for biomedical engineering psych with a minor in chem, so I was planning on medical school," she told the podcast host. "No one in my family was in entertainment. No one even remotely like lives anywhere besides Minnesota… so like we're… it feels so unattainable."

She went on to say that the feeling of it being unattainable is probably "one of the reasons why" the last few years of her life have felt "like a blur," because she is "just amazing I'm even doing this."

Haley previously told Fox News Digital in an August 2020 interview that seeing her Sports Illustrated photos for the first time "was really a magical moment for me" because she felt like "Every inch of my body is celebrated."

"But when I was growing up, I was always kind of a nerd. I was always teased for what I looked like. Whenever I would tell anyone I wanted to be a model, I was laughed out of a room. So this has been a long time coming for me. And as women, it's really hard to see ourselves the way other people might see us."

Haley's ex-husband Matt filed a lawsuit against her on Jan. 6 accusing her of providing "invasive commentary" on their marriage during a Twitch live stream in November 2025.

During the live stream, Haley spoke about the couple's sex life, telling the viewers the size of his penis was "the biggest factor" in their divorce. In the complaint, Matt alleged that Haley's words "implied that the size of Plaintiff's genitalia was a primary factor in the parties' divorce and claimed that sexual intercourse with Plaintiff would leave her 'in tears.'"

In response to her ex's complaint, Haley filed a motion to dismiss his lawsuit on Jan. 23, with her attorney, Matthew Bialick, telling People they filed the motion "because Minnesota has a longstanding commitment to free speech, which is important now more than ever."

"Allowing a lawsuit to proceed against a woman for sharing a truthful, autobiographical account of sexual trauma would directly undermine those core values. We believe the motion will be granted," he said.

Matt's attorney, Ryan Saba of Rosen Saba LLP, responded to Haley's motion to dismiss, telling People: "Haley Kalil's motion to dismiss does not dispute the fact that she wantonly disclosed private and intimate details about Matt Kalil that resulted in widespread ridicule and unwanted attention."

"The motion completely misses the point that a spouse does not have a right to expose private and confidential marital and sexual details for the purpose of profiting," he continued. "We expect that the motion will be completely denied."

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians including several children on Saturday, one of the highest tolls since the October ceasefire, a day after Israel accused Hamas of new truce violations.

The strikes hit locations throughout Gaza, including an apartment building in Gaza City and a tent camp in Khan Younis, said officials at hospitals that received the bodies. The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. Another airstrike hit a police station in Gaza City, killing at least 14 and wounding others, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

The strikes came a day before the Rafah crossing along the border with Egypt is set to open in Gaza's southernmost city. All of the territory's border crossings — the rest are with Israel — have been closed throughout almost the entire war. Palestinians see Rafah as a lifeline for tens of thousands needing treatment outside the territory, where the majority of medical infrastructure has been destroyed.

The crossing's opening, limited at first, will mark the first major step in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10. Other challenging issues include demilitarizing the strip after nearly two decades of Hamas rule and installing a new government to oversee reconstruction.

Egypt, one of the ceasefire mediators, in a statement condemned the Israeli strikes in the “strongest terms” and warned that they represent “a direct threat to the political course” of the truce. Qatar, another mediator, in a statement called Israel's strikes a “dangerous escalation” and said continuing them poses a “direct threat” to the political process.

Nasser Hospital said the strike on the tent camp in Khan Younis caused a fire, killing seven, including a father, his three children and three grandchildren.

Atallah Abu Hadaiyed said he had just finished praying when the explosion struck. “We came running and found my cousins lying here and there, with fire raging. We don't know if we're at war or at peace, or what. Where is the truce? Where is the ceasefire they talked about?”he said, as people inspected ruins including a bloodied mattress.

Shifa Hospital said the Gaza City apartment building strike killed three children, their aunt and grandmother.

“The three girls are gone, may God have mercy on them. They were asleep, we found them in the street,” said a relative, Samir Al-Atbash, adding that the family were civilians with no connection to Hamas. Names were written on body bags lined up at the foot of a wall.

Shifa Hospital said the strike on the police station killed at least 14 including four policewomen, civilians and inmates. The hospital also said a man was killed in a strike on the eastern side of Jabaliya refugee camp.

Hamas called Saturday's strikes “a renewed flagrant violation” and urged the United States and other mediating countries to push Israel to stop them.

“All available indicators suggest that we are dealing with a ‘Board of War,' not a ‘Board of Peace,'” senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said on X, questioning the legitimacy of the Trump administration-proposed international body meant to govern Gaza.

Israel's military, which has struck targets on both sides of the ceasefire's dividing line, said its attacks since October have been responses to violations of the agreement. It said Saturday's strikes followed what it described as two separate ceasefire violations a day earlier, in which Israeli forces killed three militants who emerged from a tunnel in an Israeli-controlled area of Rafah and four who approached troops near the dividing line.

The number reported killed Saturday was several times higher than the daily average since the ceasefire began. As of Friday, Gaza's Health Ministry had recorded at least 520 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire. The ministry, part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.

The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. The remains of the final hostage in Gaza were recovered early this week.

Special envoy Steve Witkoff told President Trump Hamas will demilitarize because they "have no choice."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday that strikes across Gaza were carried out in response to what it described as a ceasefire violation in which eight terrorists were identified exiting underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah.

The IDF said it struck four commanders and additional terrorists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as a weapons storage facility. A weapons manufacturing site and two launch sites belonging to Hamas in central Gaza were also hit, the IDF said.

Gaza hospitals run by the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry said at least 30 Palestinians were reported killed in the strikes, according to The Associated Press.

Hospital officials reported that casualties included civilians. They said the casualties included two women and six children from two different families. An airstrike also hit a police station in Gaza City, killing at least 14 and wounding others, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

The strikes came a day after Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire. An Israeli military official told the AP that the strikes were carried out in response to ceasefire violations but declined to comment on specific targets.

The violence unfolded one day before the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was set to reopen, a move seen as a key step in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. That phase includes limited border reopenings, efforts to demilitarize Gaza and discussions over postwar governance.

Israel has said the Rafah crossing has been a focal point for concerns about weapons smuggling by Hamas, and that security arrangements would accompany any reopening.

TWO IDF SOLDIERS KILLED AMID 'SEVERE' CEASEFIRE VIOLATION, 'IT'S NOT THE LAST,' ANALYST SAYS

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel agreed to a "limited reopening" of the crossing under President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan.

Israel has said it continues to carry out strikes across the region in response to violations of ceasefire understandings. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces said it struck Hezbollah infrastructure and engineering vehicles in southern Lebanon, accusing the group of attempting to reestablish terror infrastructure in violation of agreements with Israel.

Meanwhile, a senior Israeli military official acknowledged that the IDF believes the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry's overall death toll from the war is largely accurate, according to The Times of Israel. The military estimates around 70,000 Gazans were killed during the two-plus-year conflict triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

The Gaza Health Ministry currently reports 71,667 deaths, including more than 450 since the October 2025 ceasefire, though Israeli officials said the estimate does not include bodies believed to be buried under rubble.

Gaza's Health Ministry has said 509 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire began Oct. 10.

Israel also returned the bodies of 15 Palestinians on Thursday, days after recovering the remains of the last Israeli hostage, a Gaza Health Ministry official said, according to the AP.

The transfer marked the final hostage-detainee exchange under the first phase of the ceasefire.

Father of three Craig Stowell joined Fox & Friends to discuss his viral video detailing the cost of a Disney day trip.

Some Disney fans are saying they're furious after specialty fries were quietly eliminated from Disneyland — vanishing from the popular park in January.

The changes have been dubbed a "French fry apocalypse."

Filmstrip Fries at Award Wieners, the beer-battered fries at Hungry Bear Jamboree, and Taverne Potato Bites at Red Rose Taverne are some of the offerings that have been allegedly yanked from the California theme park.

Fans claim that instead of those offerings, the park subbed in standard fries. 

The action is a cost-cutting measure, many fans are convinced. "Cost is almost certainly part of it," Andrew Boardwine, a senior writer at the Disney blog "Inside the Magic," told Fox News Digital. 

Disney fans are angry that many specialty fries at Disneyland have allegedly been taken off some of the menus. (iStock)

"Fewer unique items means fewer suppliers, simpler kitchens, less training and less waste," he said. "Standardization saves money and speeds up service. We've seen it not just at Disneyland, but at Walt Disney World as well."

A Disneyland spokesperson told Fox News Digital the theme park often makes changes to its menus. 

The spokesperson added that house fries, tater tots, beer-battered fries and sweet potato fries can still be found throughout the resort.

CRACKER BARREL CAVES TO CUSTOMER PRESSURE AND BRINGS BACK MENU FAVORITES

Boardwine added, "What made this blow up is that it didn't happen all at once. Regulars started noticing that certain locations had quietly changed or removed their fries. The seasoned fries at one stand were suddenly plain. Another spot stopped serving them altogether."

"It feels like Disney is chipping away at the park's personality."

Boardwine said that in his view, it was a park-wide change. 

"When something familiar disappears without explanation, it feels like Disney is chipping away at the park's personality."

This is far from the first so-called menu mutiny.

In 2024, Disney reportedly nixed its fried green tomato sandwich at Hungry Bear restaurant. 

"I don't care how they re-theme [the restaurant], just bring back the fried green tomato sandwich!" a fan wrote on Reddit at the time.

In 2025, there was a fan uproar when Disneyland temporarily stopped selling clam chowder bread bowls at the Royal Street Veranda. 

"So sad. Have fond memories of getting [the] bread bowl," a commenter wrote on Reddit.

"This struck a nerve."

The French fry upset follows a menu price hike in the summer of 2025.

"So tired of Disney raising prices with no added benefits to the customer — food, rides and entertainment," one reader wrote in July 2025. "Precisely why we are going to Dollywood this summer instead."

One-day tickets for Magic Kingdom average $160, according to NerdWallet.

Those can cost $200 on the most popular days. Some fans feel the cost-to-value ratio isn't adding up.

"For a lot of longtime guests, this feels like another sign that Disney is slowly moving away from some of those special offerings toward a more standardized, corporate menu," Boardwine said. "That's why this struck a nerve."

Jacquelyne Devine, a Pennsylvania content creator who posts under the handle @shopclubcostco on TikTok and Instagram, reviews Costco's new Peaches and Cream Bar Cake, calling it "a good summertime dessert."

The best deals at Costco aren't necessarily where many shoppers are looking.

Jacquelyne Devine, a content creator from Pennsylvania who posts under the handle @costcojacque, spends a lot of her time investigating Costco offers.

While many Costco customers rush for the rotisserie chickens or bulk staples, she and other shoppers and fans, she said, have found the bakery to be the site of the warehouse's biggest bargains. 

She shared some insights from her perspective.

Costco offers low-cost items in its bakery with prices that are tough to find elsewhere, Devine said.

This includes the Kirkland Signature 2-Pack Baguettes at $5.99 and the 12-count Kirkland Signature Butter Croissants, which typically sell between $5.99 and $7.99.

The past fall, the massive and seasonal pumpkin pie sold for $5.99.

Devine described the pie as "a staple" in her house.

"I buy it for every holiday party," she said. "My family and I are always impressed by how good it is."

Devine called the filling "smooth and delicious," saying "it feels like a steal for the size and quality."

Buying in bulk allows shoppers to get more mileage out of favorite food items.

"I freeze anything we will not eat right away."

Costco's croissants are a favorite for Devine.

"I regularly use them to make chicken salad sandwiches using Costco's rotisserie chicken" for "an easy and affordable meal," she said.

"As for stretching them, I freeze anything we will not eat right away."

Devine said that when she takes the croissants out of the freezer, she microwaves them for 45 to 60 seconds.

"I do the same with the muffins, and they hold up incredibly well," she said. 

The mother of three said Costco's sheet cake is a go-to for her. 

"Using the order form in the bakery, you can place your custom order in advance, or pick up one of the pre-made options," she said. 

Costco sheet cakes offer very good value, said a fan of the brand. (Jacquelyne Devine / @costcojacque)

The cakes, in her opinion, are "genuinely delicious," she said. 

Devine mentioned the "flavorful" raspberry lemon muffins. "They can be split in half to make them last longer."

She also suggested the six-count Blueberry Caramelized Cheesecake Croissant, though this costs more per unit than the regular croissants.

To her, the item is worth trying because "it's indulgent and tasty."

Devine said people should "not be intimidated" by items sold in bulk. 

"It's indulgent and tasty," said Costco fan Jacquelyne Devine of the Blueberry Caramelized Cheesecake Croissant.  (Jacquelyne Devine / @costcojacque)

"With freezing, planning ahead and knowing what stretches well," the bakery offers "value and quality," she said.

"The backbone of the Costco bakery is volume, whether through the sheer size of a single item or the number of baked goods per package," notes Food & Wine.

Also worth noting: "Not every item" in the bakery is "a winner," according to Tasting Table — "because even America's favorite wholesale superstore can't do everything right."

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on protests in Iran, as well as new building activity at the nation's nuclear sites on ‘Special Report.'

Fresh satellite images have captured roofs being built over damaged buildings at Iranian nuclear sites that were attacked by the U.S. and Israel last year. 

The photos from Planet Labs PBC show new coverings over two structures at the Isfahan and Natanz facilities following the June 2025 strikes. 

The roofs are likely part of Iran's efforts "to assess whether key assets — such as limited stocks of highly enriched uranium — survived the strikes," Andrea Stricker, who studies Iran for the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Associated Press. 

"They want to be able to get at any recovered assets they can get to without Israel or the United States seeing what survived," she added.

Those coverings block satellites from seeing what's happening on the ground — right now the only way for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the sites, as Iran has prevented access. 

The Natanz site, which is about 135 miles south of Iran's capital of Tehran, is a mix of above- and below-ground laboratories that did the majority of Iran's uranium enrichment. 

The facility outside the city of Isfahan was mainly known for producing the uranium gas that is fed into centrifuges to be spun and purified.

Last year, Israel targeted the sites first, followed by U.S. strikes using bunker-busting bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles.  

The Israel Defense Forces said in June 2025 that a strike on the Isfahan site had "dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure." 

The U.S. strikes "significantly degraded Iran's nuclear program," the White House's National Security Strategy published in November said.

Iran has not allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the sites since the attacks. 

The new satellite images come as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that a "massive Armada" is heading toward the Middle East, ratcheting up pressure on the Iranian regime to reach a nuclear deal. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said during a Cabinet meeting Thursday that the U.S. military is "prepared to deliver whatever the president expects" regarding Iran. Meanwhile, Iranian military officials have vowed that any U.S. attack would be met with an immediate and decisive response.

The Trump administration has also escalated sanctions on Iranian officials in response to the deadly crackdown on anti-regime protesters.

Democrats' brief victory on government funding could be short-lived as Republicans bring their own demands, including a crackdown on “sanctuary” cities and states, to a fight over Immigration and Customs Enforcement conduct.

A White House-brokered deal to reopen the government, poised to clear Congress early next week, gave Democrats what they wanted to negotiate over immigration enforcement, namely a two-week extension on funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

Republicans have demonstrated openness to codifying some of their reforms, which come after two U.S. citizens were fatally shot in Minneapolis this month. For any deal to be signed into law, however, will require a give-and-take that Democrats might find difficult to swallow.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) wants to penalize Democratic jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with the federal government on immigration, a demand being echoed in the House. And Republicans believe that some of the demands from Democrats go too far, signaling early resistance to a ban on the face masks agents wear to shield their identity.

The impasse raises the distinct possibility of a protracted fight over the DHS funding bill. Democrats see the threat of DHS shuttering in two weeks as leverage in negotiations, given that the department also oversees the Coast Guard and emergency response to natural disasters. Yet, DHS also represents a small share of the federal budget, and immigration enforcement will continue regardless of a deal.

“I could see DHS shut down for a long, long, long time,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a member of the Appropriations Committee.

For days, the Senate has been consumed by how to avert a prolonged government shutdown and on Friday sent six spending bills, including the DHS funding patch, to the House with President Donald Trump's support.

But the early posturing has already begun over an ICE compromise that Republicans say won't happen without concessions. Graham, in particular, has been on a war path over the negotiations, accusing Republicans of not fighting hard enough to reclaim the narrative on immigration after the death of Alex Pretti last weekend.

“I'm doing it now because we're off the rails, both parties, quite frankly,” Graham said.

He's asking for a vote on his bill to impose criminal penalties on state officials who “wilfully interfere” with immigration enforcement. Other Republicans are framing the reforms proposed by Democrats as a bad-faith effort to provide de facto amnesty to illegal immigrants.

In a Friday floor speech, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) claimed the demands would make the job of immigration officers “personally dangerous and professionally impossible.”

The rhetoric is a sign of how challenging it will be to get any deal done after similar efforts at bipartisanship have fallen apart. Most recently, negotiators walked away empty-handed after a long-shot push to extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were at the center of the last government shutdown.

Kennedy expressed openness to building on modest reforms that already passed the House, chiefly more money for body cameras and de-escalation training. But the Louisiana Republican expressed skepticism that anything meaningful can be done given how polarizing ICE has become since Trump returned to the White House.

“In my opinion, it's not the details that matter here,” Kennedy said. “This has nothing to do with whether we want to make ICE a more efficient organization, or whether we want to make it look like an eighth-grade car wash. This has to do with, the Democrats cannot afford to appear to like ICE, and so, that's why we are where we are.”

That skepticism runs both ways, particularly when it comes to the Trump administration. Democrats don't believe the president is serious about reining in some of the more aggressive tactics by ICE, even as he deployed border czar Tom Homan, viewed in Washington as a steadier hand, to take over immigration operations in Minneapolis.

As a sign of goodwill, the White House also ended its expanded operation in Maine, following outreach from Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME). Those steps and others like it are ringing hollow with the more progressive members of the Senate who want to see a larger pullback.

“I mean, Tom Homan is not an avatar for responsible immigration policy, and I have no idea what they're doing in Maine,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), the top Democratic appropriator for DHS spending.

“I was just in Texas, a state 20 times as big as Maine, and they are involved in gross illegality every single day in the state of Texas,” he said, “and that is representative of what's happening all around the country.”

For that reason, Democrats are demanding that any compromise be codified into law, and so far, Republicans are entertaining the conversation. Earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) judged that “there's a path to consider some of those things and negotiate that out.”

His remark came after Democrats united behind a list of “legislative objectives” that includes tightening warrant requirements and instituting use-of-force rules akin to those adopted by local police departments. 

In the meantime, Republicans are bringing their own ideas to the table, with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) proposing a monthly reporting requirement on immigration raids. Tillis billed it as a way to rebuild public trust.

But Republicans are simultaneously reluctant to embrace the full set of reforms proposed by Democrats and believe that any deal must also advance their priorities.

Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL), the top appropriator on DHS funding, told reporters to expect Republicans to voice their “really strong stance” on law enforcement and push to end sanctuary city policies that bar cooperation with federal authorities.

“I think Democrats are going to have to be really honest about that, and we're going to have a lot of debate,” she said.

Like Graham, Tillis has a piece of legislation that allows legal action for families “harmed when sanctuary jurisdictions put public safety in danger.”

When asked about the sanctuary legislation, Murphy told the Washington Examiner he would not be negotiating in public.

“I'm not interested in negotiating out loud,” Murphy said. “I think they know where we are, and let's sit down and get in the room and start talking about a path forward.”

Reaching a compromise will be even harder in the House, where rabble-rousing conservatives have already threatened to hold up floor business over illegal immigration.

DEMOCRATS PUSH TO BLACKLIST ICE OFFICERS FROM FUTURE GOVERNMENT JOBS

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), who is running for attorney general of Texas, warned Wednesday that he had his own “list” of demands on DHS if Democrats get theirs.

Also this week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) began to draw red lines, telling reporters on Friday that Democrats “will not walk away from” their demand that ICE obtain judicial warrants before entering homes. He also called for an “explicit prohibition” on the deportation of U.S. citizens.

On Thursday, a student in Nebraska was hit by an SUV flying a Trump flag at a student-led protest against the immigration crackdown. Officials said the student was taken to a hospital but they didn't release details on the extent of the student's injuries.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Los Angeles on Friday to oppose the Trump administration's immigration policies. Demonstrators first gathered in front of city hall in the afternoon and later marched to the federal detention center.

Protesters held “no work, no school, no shopping” strikes across the U.S. on Friday to oppose the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The demonstrations took place amid widespread outrage over the killing Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who was shot multiple times after he used his cellphone to record Border Patrol officers conducting an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. The death heightened scrutiny over the administration's tactics after the Jan. 7 death of Renee Good, who was fatally shot behind the wheel of her vehicle by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country — to stop ICE's reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN,” said one of the many websites and social media pages promoting actions in communities around the United States.

Some schools in Arizona, Colorado and other states preemptively canceled classes in anticipation of mass absences. Many other demonstrations were planned for students and others to gather at city centers, statehouses and churches across the country.

Just outside Minneapolis, hundreds gathered in the frigid cold early Friday at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, the site of regular protests in recent weeks.

After speeches from clergy members, demonstrators marched toward the facility's restricted area, jeering at a line of DHS agents to “quit your jobs” and “get out of Minnesota.” Much of the group later dispersed after they were threatened with arrest by local law enforcement for blocking the road.

Michelle Pasko, a retired communications worker, said she joined the demonstration after witnessing federal agents stopping immigrants at a bus stop near her home in Minnetonka, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.

“They're roaming our streets, they're staying in hotels near our schools,” she said. “Everyone in this country has rights, and the federal government seems to have forgotten that. We're here to remind them.”

In Michigan, dozens of students walked out of Friday morning classes at Groves High School in Birmingham, north of Detroit. The students braved the zero-degree (minus 18 degrees Celsius) temperatures and walked about a mile (1.6 kilometers) to the closest business district where a number of morning commuters honked horns in support.

“We're here to protest ICE and what they're doing all over the country, especially in Minnesota,” said Logan Albritton, a 17-year-old senior at Groves. “It's not right to treat our neighbors and our fellow Americans this way.”

Abigail Daugherty, 16, organized the walkout at Collins Hill High School in Suwanee, Georgia, on Friday. 

“For years, I have felt powerless, and seeing other schools in the county being able to do this, I wanted to do something,” the sophomore said.

Numerous businesses announced they would be closed during Friday's “blackout.” Others said they would be staying open, but donating a portion of their proceeds to organizations that support immigrants and provide legal aid to those facing deportation. 

Otway Restaurant and its sister Otway Bakery in New York posted on social media that its bakery would stay open and 50% of proceeds would go to the New York Immigration Coalition. The restaurant remained open as well.

“As a small business who already took a huge financial hit this week due to the winter storm closures, we will remain open on Friday,” they posted.

In Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced that ICE is ending its surge, people gathered outside a Portland church on Friday morning, holding signs that said “No ICE for ME,” a play on the state's postal code. 

Grace Valenzuela, an administrator with Portland Public Schools, decried an “enforcement system that treats our presence as suspect.” She said ICE's actions brought “daily trauma” to the school system.

“Schools are meant to be places of learning, safety and belonging. ICE undermines that mission every time it destabilizes a family,” Valenzuela said.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion, a Democrat, spoke about the importance of speaking out in the wake of ICE's actions in the city.

“Dissent is Democratic. Dissent is American. It's the cornerstone of our democracy,” Dion said.

In Los Angeles, where Trump's immigration surge first began last June, thousands of protesters gathered in front of city hall in the afternoon and later marched to the federal detention center. As the demonstration stretched into the evening, federal agents began using chemical sprays to push the crowd back.

Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters joined the protest, chanting “ICE out of LA” in front of a line of officers in riot gear.

“What I see here at the detention center are people exercising their constitutional rights,” Waters said. “And of course, they're now trying to tear gas everybody. It's in the air, but people are not moving.”

On Thursday, a student in Nebraska was hit by an SUV flying a Trump flag at a student-led protest against the immigration crackdown. 

A few students entered the street outside Fremont High School around 2 p.m. and one was hit by a vehicle that had stopped in front of the crowd, then began moving, Fremont Public Schools said in a statement.

Officials said the student was taken to a hospital but they didn't release details on the extent of the student's injuries.

Video from the scene shot by News Channel Nebraska shows a red SUV displaying a blue Trump 2024 flag accelerating as a student carrying a sign walks in the direction of the vehicle. The student is knocked onto the hood and falls onto the ground. The vehicle stops briefly and then takes off.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Journalist Don Lemon was released from custody Friday after he was arrested and hit with federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church.

Lemon was arrested overnight in Los Angeles, while another independent journalist and two protest participants were arrested in Minnesota. He struck a confident, defiant tone while speaking to reporters after a court appearance in California, declaring: “I will not be silenced.”

“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” Lemon said. “In fact there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.”

The arrests brought sharp criticism from news media advocates and civil rights activists including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who said the administration of President Donald Trump is taking a “sledgehammer” to “the knees of the First Amendment.”

A grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the arrest of Don Lemon after a Minneapolis church protest.

In court in Los Angeles, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Robbins argued for a $100,000 bond, telling a judge that Lemon “knowingly joined a mob that stormed into a church.” He was released, however, without having to post money and was granted permission to travel to France in June while the case is pending.




Defense attorney Marilyn Bednarski said Lemon plans to plead not guilty and fight the charges in Minnesota.

Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he has no affiliation to the organization that went into the church and he was there as a solo journalist chronicling protesters.

“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement earlier Friday. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi promoted the arrests on social media.

“Make no mistake. Under President Trump's leadership and this administration, you have the right to worship freely and safely,” Bondi said in a video posted online. “And if I haven't been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.” 

Since he left CNN, Lemon has joined the legion of journalists who have gone into business for themselves. He posts regularly on YouTube and has not hidden his disdain for Trump. 

Yet during his online show from the church, he stressed: “I'm not here as an activist. I'm here as a journalist.” He described the scene before him and interviewed churchgoers and demonstrators.

The indictment names nine defendants including Lemon. It says two of them posted their planned action on social media the day before and gave the others instructions in a shopping center parking lot the following morning.

Lemon started livestreaming and told the audience he was with a group gearing up for a “resistance” operation against federal immigration policies, according to the document. Lemon “took steps to maintain operational secrecy by reminding co-conspirators to not disclose the target of their operation,” the indictment says, and stepped away so his microphone would not accidentally divulge the planning.

During the briefing before the operation, prosecutors say, Lemon thanked an activist who is among the nine indicted for what she was doing and assured her he was not saying what was going on.

Inside the church the defendants shouted slogans and blew whistles after the pastor was about to begin the sermon and gestured in a hostile and aggressive manner, according to prosecutors, and the pastor and congregants perceived “threats of violence.” 

Lemon told the livestream he saw a young man who was frightened, sad and crying and it was understandable because the experience was traumatic and uncomfortable, the indictment says. The defendants then surrounded the pastor and Lemon “peppered him with questions to promote the operation's message.” 

Last week a magistrate judge rejected prosecutors' initial bid to charge Lemon. Shortly afterward he predicted on his show that the administration would try again. 

“And guess what,” Lemon said. “Here I am. Keep trying. That's not going to stop me from being a journalist. That's not going to diminish my voice. Go ahead, make me into the new Jimmy Kimmel if you want. Just do it. Because I'm not going anywhere.”

Independent journalist Georgia Fort livestreamed the moments before her arrest, telling viewers that agents were at her door and her First Amendment right as a journalist was being diminished.

A judge released Fort, Trahern Crews and Jamael Lundy on bond, rejecting the Justice Department's attempt to keep them in custody. Not guilty pleas were entered. Fort's supporters in the courtroom clapped and whooped.

“It's a sinister turn of events in this country,” Fort's attorney, Kevin Riach, said in court.

Jane Kirtley, a media law and ethics expert at the University of Minnesota, said the federal laws cited by the government were not intended to apply to reporters gathering news.

The charges against Lemon and Fort, she said, are “pure intimidation and government overreach.”

Some experts and activists said the charges are not only an attack on press freedoms but also a strike against Black Americans who count on Black journalists to bear witness to injustice and oppression.

The National Association of Black Journalists said it was “outraged and deeply alarmed” and warned of an effort to “criminalize and threaten press freedom under the guise of law enforcement.”

Crews is a leader of Black Lives Matter Minnesota who has led many protests and actions for racial justice, particularly following George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis in 2020.

“All the greats have been to jail, MLK, Malcom X — people who stood up for justice get attacked,” Crews told The Associated Press. “We were just practicing our First Amendment rights.”

A prominent civil rights attorney and two other people involved in the protest were arrested last week. Prosecutors have accused them of civil rights violations for disrupting the Cities Church service.

The Justice Department launched an investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. 

Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads ICE's St. Paul field office. 

“We are grateful that the Department of Justice acted swiftly to protect Cities Church so that we can continue to faithfully live out the church's mission to worship Jesus and make him known,” lead pastor Jonathan Parnell said.

            The Justice Department on Friday released more than 3 million pages of files related to the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after Congress passed a law last year forcing the Trump administration to do so.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said at a news conference the Justice Department has now completed its review of the files and that the White House had “no oversight” of the process. The documents released Friday contain references to President Donald Trump and other powerful figures, including Elon Musk, Bill Clinton and a former Obama White House counsel.
    


            CNN reporters have been going through the documents, and you can read highlights below:
    


Editor's Note: This story contains graphic and disturbing descriptions of sexual violence.



From CNN's Jeremy Herb



            Officials at the FBI compiled a list of sexual assault allegations related to President Donald Trump this past August — many of which appear to have come from unverified tips — and the list was included as part of the millions of documents in the new Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Justice Department on Friday.
    


            It's not clear why the FBI officials created the list of allegations related to Trump last year. The document was included in emails that were sent by officials in the FBI's New York field office on the Child Exploitation & Human Trafficking Task Force. Trump has long denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
    


            There are more than a dozen allegations included in the document. “Yellow highlighting is for the salacious piece,” one official writes to explain how the allegations were being sorted.
    


            Two versions of the document appeared to have been removed from the Justice Department's website for a time Friday afternoon before they were restored without any apparent changes. A DOJ official said the document was down “due to overload” and was back online.
    


            The allegations appear to be unverified, and the officials note that some are secondhand information. They appear to have been allegations that were received through the FBI's National Threat Operations Center, which takes tips by phone and electronically. The document notes that in many instances, there was no contact made with the individuals who sent in the allegations, or no contact information was provided.
    


            Some of the allegations were followed up on. One was sent to the FBI's Washington field office to conduct an interview, and another was deemed not credible, according to the document.
    


            “Was there anything in the file re follow up with the below individuals? 302s. etc?” one official writes.
    


            There are also allegations made in the document against former President Bill Clinton, who has denied wrongdoing related to Epstein.
    


            Asked for comment on allegations against Trump in the documents, the White House referred a reporter to the Justice Department press release, which says, “This production may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos, as everything that was sent to the FBI by the public was included in the production that is responsive to the Act. Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”

            The Justice Department laid out a list of Jeffrey Epstein's potential co-conspirators as part of its investigation into Epstein, but documents released Friday redacted several figures who were part of his inner circle.
    


            The undated diagram shows the names and photos of several known close associates of Epstein, including convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and Jean-Luc Brunel, a model agent with longtime ties to Epstein who faced rape charges in France. Brunel died by suicide in a French jail in 2022.
    


            The other people identified by the DOJ were known Epstein employees, none of whom were charged in the investigation, though the document indicates that the DOJ was investigating people close to the convicted sex offender for potential involvement.
    


            The Justice Department redacted the names and photos of five other individuals, including Maxwell's assistant and four Epstein employees, one of whom was listed as a ‘girlfriend/employee.'
    


            Victims and advocates have criticized the Justice Department for what they argue are heavy but inconsistent redactions of names and details in the millions of released documents.
    


            The document lists other close associates including Epstein's personal chef, pilots, and Peter Listerman, a model scout described in the file as a subject/witness and model “matchmaker.” It also lists Leslie Wexner, the billionaire business magnate who employed Epstein as a money manager who has said he severed ties with Epstein in 2007.

            The latest batch of documents indicates that, at least at one point, prosecutors felt they could charge more than just Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell with crimes.
    


            A draft indictment from the Southern District of Florida from the 2000s would have charged Epstein alongside apparently three others who are described as having been “employed” by Epstein. They are mostly described as facilitating appointments between Epstein and girls. But their names are redacted.
    


            The document, which followers of the case had been hoping to see, describes all of them as having conspired to “persuade, induce, and entice individuals who had not attained the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution.”
    


            It's not the much-rumored “client list” that many have hoped to see – but that the Justice Department has denied exists. But it is likely to lead to questions about who these people are and why they weren't ultimately charged.
    


            Epstein's sweetheart deal to avoid much more serious charges in the late 2000s – he pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges – is a major piece of this scandal.
    


From CNN's Holmes Lybrand



            A draft indictment that was never brought against Jeffrey Epstein alleged that from 2001 to 2005, Epstein and three unnamed defendants engaged in a conspiracy to “procure females under the age of 18” to engage “in lewd conduct” for money “to satisfy Jeffrey Epstein's prurient interests.”
    


            Instead of bringing the 60-count indictment against the four people, federal prosecutors in 2007 reached a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, who avoided federal charges and served 13-months in state prison over state prostitution charges.
    


            In a 2020 review, the Justice Department found that former US attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta had used “poor judgement” in the deal but did not find that Acosta had engaged in professional misconduct.
    


            According to the drafted indictment, the unnamed co-conspirators would call the girls to travel to Palm Beach, Florida, for Epstein, who would then use and pay the girls.
    


            The document also says that at least one of the girls would also “engage in lewd conduct” with one of the unnamed co-defendants for Epstein.
    


            The 19 girls mentioned in the document – all under Jane Doe pseudonyms – ranged in ages, including some as young as 14, and would be paid several hundred dollars and sometimes be used to solicit other friends who would be asked if they were “interested in engaging in similar activities.”
    


            In one instance, Epstein allegedly told one of the girls he was abusing “that if she reported to anyone what had occurred … bad things could happen to her.”
    


            One unidentified defendant, according to the document, was often tasked with leading the women from Epstein's kitchen to his master bedroom in Palm Beach where Epstein was waiting.
    


            The document is not signed by a grand jury foreperson and, in the place for Acosta's signature is a blank, unsigned space.

            One of Jeffrey Epstein's victims told the FBI that his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell once “presented her” to Donald Trump at a party and suggested that she was “available,” according to an internal FBI memo released Friday.
    


            The FBI memo is from mid-2021, a few months before Maxwell was convicted on federal sex trafficking charges. According to the memo, the witness said, ultimately, “nothing happened” between her and Trump, who has never been accused by investigators of involvement in Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes.
    


            The victim said Maxwell brought her to a party in New York when she was about 22 years old, though it was unclear what year this took place. Maxwell “seemed very excited that there would be a lot of great men for” the victim “to meet,” according to the interview notes. The victim said that during the party, Maxwell “presented [her] to Trump,” and that the victim “felt that Maxwell presented her” by giving a rundown of her accolades, “similar to a CV.”
    


            The memo said Trump invited the woman to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. She subsequently went on a tour there with the future president, Maxwell, and Epstein — and “by the things that Maxwell said, it was made clear that [she] was available,” the memo said.
    


            Maxwell said things such as, “Oh I think he likes you. Aren't you lucky,” according to the FBI memo, and also encouraged the victim to wear clothes that she thought Trump would like.
    


            “It was set up very much like how Maxwell introduced [her] to Epstein,” the memo said.
    


            FBI memos like these, known as 302s, memorialize tips and allegations from witnesses, but they do not typically contain information about whether the FBI could corroborate the information.
    


            In response to questions about the FBI memo, the White House referred CNN to a Justice Department statement that said the millions of documents in Friday's batch of Epstein files “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos” because “everything that was sent to the FBI by the public” was included in the public release.
    


            Trump has previously denied any wrongdoing with respect to Epstein.

Editor's Note: This report contains details that some readers may find disturbing.



            The Justice Department's newly released files related to Jeffrey Epstein on Friday include an FBI form that details a complaint from a woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her when she was 13 years old.
    


            This anonymous accuser previously launched lawsuits against Trump and dropped them, the last one right before the 2016 election.
    


            The FBI document details multiple instances of alleged abuse of Jane Doe by Trump, including rape. It also says Epstein was allegedly “angry that Trump was the one to take Doe's virginity” and also raped Doe. These descriptions mirror the allegations that Jane Doe made in her 2016 lawsuit.
    


            Trump had previously denied the woman's allegations, and the Justice Department has said of the documents, “This production may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos, as everything that was sent to the FBI by the public was included in the production that is responsive to the Act.”
    


            Jane Doe was expected to appear at a news conference in Los Angeles in November of 2016, but the event was abruptly canceled. Her lawyer at the time, Lisa Bloom, said her client was too afraid to show up.
    


            Asked by CNN for comment Friday, Bloom said she was no longer the woman's attorney and declined to comment.

            A newly released email chain shows Jeffrey Epstein and someone who appears to have been Ghislaine Maxwell strategizing in 2011 about how to deal with new allegations from a woman who claimed she had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
    


            Epstein first emails a former executive with Trump's resort empire named Nicholas Ribis about “the girl in the new papers” who had claimed to have worked at Mar-a-Lago in 1998 at the age of 15, when Epstein thought it was in 2000 when she was 17.
    


            “who would i go to verify, I dont' know how Donald would respond„?” (sic) Epstein wrote.
    


            Epstein forwards the message to “GMAX,” who responds: “I thought you said not to involve Donald.”
    


            While the name of the accuser is redacted, the details match the account of Virginia Giuffre, whom Trump said last year he was aware Epstein had recruited from Mar-a-Lago. Giuffre also made her allegations public around the time of these emails, in 2011.
    


            One of the big subplots involving Trump is what he knew and when about why Epstein was recruiting the likes of Giuffre. Trump has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein's crimes, and he has denied any wrongdoing.
    


From CNN's Marshall Cohen



            The Justice Department posted dozens of key FBI memos called “302s” on Friday — an important part of the massive drop of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            These memos contain the notes taken by FBI agents when they interview witnesses. They memorialize what the witness told investigators. They don't describe subsequent attempts to corroborate the information. But victims have been eager to see what's in these files.
    


            A witness told the FBI in June 2020 about former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's “relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” but “was hesitant” to discuss the matter in detail because Bannon was “friends with powerful people,” according to one of the memos.
    


            The identity of this witness is redacted, as is nearly all of the four-page document. But the FBI agents marked down that the witness previously worked in the marijuana industry.
    


            Bannon has never been accused by law enforcement of any Epstein-related wrongdoing. CNN has reached out to a Bannon spokesperson regarding the new FBI memo.
    


            Another one of the 302s contains notes from an apparent FBI interview with Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken Epstein survivors, who died by suicide in April. The interview occurred in July 2013 at the US consulate in Sydney, Australia, where Giuffre lived at the time.
    


            The partially redacted memo indicates that Giuffre told investigators about working as a teenager at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida, how she was recruited from there to work for Epstein, and about sexual abuse she was later subjected to by a redacted person that appears to be Epstein.
    


            Law enforcement has never accused Trump of wrongdoing regarding Epstein. The White House has said Trump kicked Epstein out of his club because he was “being a creep,” and Trump has said they had a falling out because he “stole people that worked for me,” such as Giuffre. Regarding Giuffre's time working at Trump's social club, he previously claimed “she had no complaints about us … none whatsoever.”
    


            Meanwhile, some of the 302s have been completely redacted, revealing nothing.

Editor's Note: This report contains some graphic and disturbing descriptions of sexual violence.



            Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused an underage girl who had confided in him about previously being molested, she told the FBI in a 2021 interview.



            The disturbing allegation come from an FBI memo known as a “302,” which describes a witness interview, but the document does not show whether the FBI was able to corroborate the claims.
    


            Many of the hundreds of survivors of Epstein's abuse have said they were eager for documents like these to be made public, so their stories could be told, and the depths of Epstein's misdeeds could be fully revealed.
    


            The partially redacted document says the girl told Epstein when she was around 14 years old that “her childhood was ‘shitty'” because she had been molested. Epstein responded that “he was sorry about that,” according to the interview notes.
    


            According to the notes, the witness told investigators that she later gave “uncomfortable” massages to Epstein on multiple occasions where they were both naked. She said Epstein sometimes touched her sexually against her wishes, and she tried to rebuff him.
    


            The notes say the victim “felt degraded when she went to Epstein's home” and that she “felt taken advantage of,” but that she said she also “felt happy because she had a bunch of money” from the paid massages.

            Elon Musk exchanged multiple emails with Jeffrey Epstein to coordinate trips to one of Epstein's Caribbean islands, according to documents released by the Justice Department on Friday.
    


            Musk had previously claimed that he rebuffed attempts from Epstein to get him to visit one of the two islands Epstein owned – Great St. James and Little St. James – in the US Virgin Islands. Little St. James was an epicenter of Epstein's decades-long abuse of girls and young women.



            But communications between the pair released Friday reveal that Musk tried in 2012 and 2013 to coordinate trips – at one point asking Epstein which day or night on the island would be the “wildest party.”
    


            It's not clear from the emails whether Musk ultimately visited.
    


            On November 24, 2012, Epstein emailed Musk: “how many people will you be for the heli to island.”
    


            Musk responded the next day that it would probably just be him and his then-wife.
    


            “What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?” Musk added.
    


            On December 13, 2013, Musk emailed Epstein: “Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?”
    


            Epstein responded two days later and said the beginning of the new year would be good, adding: “always space for you.” On Christmas Day, Epstein said in another email: “the 2 or 3 would be perfect. I will come and get you.”
    


            Musk first responded that he would need to fly back to Los Angeles on the night of January 2, before saying he could push his departure back a day.
    


            “When should we head to your island on the 2nd?” Musk asked Epstein.
    


            Representatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new emails.
    


            The emails show a level of communication between the pair that had not been previously revealed. Musk has tried to denigrate his opponents by trying to tie them to Epstein.
    


            During their explosive feud last year, Musk suggested that President Donald Trump had slowed the rollout of the Epstein files because the president's name was in them. That was part of the breakdown between the president and a man who had been one of his closest advisers.
    


            In September, after Musk's name was included in another batch of files, he sought to distance himself from the convicted sex offender. He said in a post on X at the time that “Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED.”

            Multiple emails released Friday between Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, former US treasury secretary and Harvard University president, show the two men gossiping about President Donald Trump during his first presidential term.
    


            “How guilty is Donald?” Summers asked in a May 2017 email in which he went on to discuss the idea that Russia helped Trump win in 2016, which Summers deemed “plausible but not certain.” (Trump has long denied any complicity with Russia in that election.)
    


            Epstein replied that “your world does not understand how dumb he really is.”
    


            In an earlier, October 2016 email, Summers asks Epstein, “How plausible is idea t=at trump is real cocaine user?” Epstein replied “zero.”
    


            In July 2017, Summers wrote to Epstein: “I think your friend is mentally ill.” Epstein responded that the person is “not my friend, and i ve told you that before.”
    


            While neither referenced Trump by name, they went on to discuss his foreign policy actions and whether, as Summers said, “he was better than Hillary.” Epstein defended his record, citing work with Israel and India.
    


            An earlier release of documents showed that Epstein and Summers corresponded for years after Epstein's initial conviction.
    


            Summers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He previously told CNN he is “deeply ashamed” of his correspondence with Epstein. Summers took leave from teaching at Harvard in November.

            After Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015, Jeffrey Epstein sat for a deposition in the case, which was first unsealed in 2024.
    


            In the deposition from September 2016, Epstein repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate when asked more than a dozen questions about his relationship with former President Bill Clinton or the Clinton Foundation.
    


            Some examples of the questions asked to Epstein were to “Please describe all dinners you've ever had with Bill Clinton” and “Please list every place you and Bill Clinton have ever been together.”
    


            Lawyers also asked Epstein repeatedly about whether Clinton visited his private island and flew on his private plane. They also repeatedly asked Epstein whether he's heard of the Clinton Foundation and for all his interactions with it.
    


            For every question, Epstein responded: “Fifth.”
    


            A spokesperson for Clinton has repeatedly said the former president cut ties with Epstein before he was charged with soliciting prostitution in 2006 and didn't know about his crimes. Clinton has also denied ever having visited Epstein's island.
    


            Recently, the Clintons rebuffed a subpoena from the Republican-led House Oversight Committee to have them testify in a congressional probe related to Epstein. The House voted to hold the Clintons in contempt earlier this month.

            Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein corresponded through intermediaries several times in 2011 and 2012 – years after Lutnick had vowed to never be in the same room with Epstein again, documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday show.
    


            The documents reveal a deeper relationship between Lutnick and Epstein than had previously been known. Lutnick, the former chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald and current Commerce Secretary, was a onetime neighbor of Epstein in New York.
    


            But he said in an interview last year that after a 2005 encounter at Epstein's home, he grew uncomfortable and vowed that he “will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”
    


            “So I was never in the room with him socially, for business — or even philanthropy,” he said in the October interview. “That guy was there, I wasn't going, ‘cause he's gross.”
    


            The documents released Friday undercut that claim and reveal Lutnick sought to meet with or call Epstein several times since 2005, including after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.
    


            A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            A 2011 email to Epstein from Epstein's assistant said: “Howard Lutnick returned your call.” Another email to Epstein from his assistant reads: “Howard Lutnick will come see you at 5 p.m.” That same year, the heading of an alarm message reads: “Drinks w/Howard Lutnick”



            The next year, both Lutnick's wife and assistant communicated with an Epstein assistant to set up a visit and lunch on one of Epstein's Caribbean islands, emails show.
    


            “Jeffrey Epstein understands you will be down in St. Thomas some over the holidays,” Epstein's assistant wrote in a November 20, 2012, email to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together.”
    


            The next month, Lutnick's wife, Allison, said in an email that was forwarded to Epstein: “We are looking forward to visiting you,” adding the Lutnicks were part of a large group that included another family.
    


            “We are heading towards you from St. Thomas,” Allison Lutnick wrote. “Where should we anchor exactly?” Representatives for Epstein asked what type of boat the Lutnicks would be arriving on so they could properly coordinate.
    


            “188 foot yacht,” Allison Lutnick responded.

            Howard Lutnick, the current US secretary of commerce and former CEO of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, was a longtime neighbor to Epstein. Lutnick lived next door to Epstein in Manhattan's Upper East Side neighborhood.
    


Lutnick once described Epstein showing him and his wife a “massage room” in Epstein's townhouse in 2005 that disgusted the couple, saying they decided they would “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”
    


            But an email from the newest batch of Epstein files shows that Lutnick sent an email to Epstein's longtime assistant in November 2015 inviting Epstein to a Democratic fundraiser for Hillary Clinton that Lutnick hosted. It's unclear whether Epstein attended.

            Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his wife, Nili Priel, stayed at an apartment in New York owned by Jeffrey Epstein multiple times, documents released by the Justice Department on Friday show.
    


            Though the couples' relationship with Epstein was previously known, email correspondence released in the DOJ's Epstein files on Friday shed new light into the closeness of the Israeli politician and Epstein.
    


            Like many powerful figures in Epstein's orbit, Barak, who said he first met the late financier in 2003, continued his association with Epstein for years after he became a convicted sex offender following a controversial plea deal in 2008.
    


            Barak has previously acknowledged his personal relationship with Epstein, but has said he never witnessed or participated in any improper behavior.
    


            Priel emailed Epstein in May 2017 letting him know that she and Barak would be leaving the apartment for a few days to go to Harvard and asked if a cleaner could come by the place while it was vacant. Epstein then forwarded the message to someone who said she would be there the next day.
    


            In a separate email exchange from Epstein's assistant, Lesley Groff, Groff writes that she will contact Priel about switching out the cable box in the Baraks' apartment for an Apple TV setup.
    


            Other emails showed Groff, Epstein and Priel often wrote each other about when the Baraks would be visiting New York and setting up meetings between him and Epstein.

            Kathy Ruemmler, the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and a White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, called Jeffrey Epstein “wonderful Jeffrey” and said “I adore him” in a December 2015 email exchange which appears to show Epstein booking and paying for her to have a first-class trip to Europe.
    


            The email exchange, dated December 25–26, 2015, appears to show Epstein telling a redacted individual to arrange Ruemmler's travel. The redacted individual explicitly proposed booking the f lights on Epstein's credit card.
    


            At the time, Ruemmler was the head of the white-collar crime practice at the law firm Latham and Watkins, which has said Epstein was never a client.
    


            When the redacted individual asked Ruemmler if the trip needed to be organized on Christmas Day, Ruemmler replied, “Merry Christmas! No, no, no – I am so sorry for the intrusion. Please enjoy the day. Jeffrey is just being wonderful Jeffrey.”
    


            A day later in response, Ruemmler provided her frequent-flyer number, and preferred route for an international trip to Geneva, with uncertainty about where she would return from.
    


            When the redacted individual organizing the trip for Ruemmler replied that Epstein is “so very kind,” Ruemmler responded, “I know, and I never feel as if I can return the kindness adequately. I hope you are having a wonderful day.”
    


            The redacted individual then told Ruemmler that Epstein considered her a “very good friend,” to which Ruemmler responded, “Well, I adore him. It's like having another older brother!”
    


            The December 2015 emails add to a body of past KFILE reporting that has raised questions about the nature and extent of Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein.
    


            As previously reported, Epstein referred to Ruemmler in a message as “my great defender,” sought her advice as he faced renewed scrutiny over his abuse of underage girls, and relied on her input while crafting responses to critical media coverage.
    


            KFILE previously reported that Ruemmler appeared repeatedly on Epstein's calendars for meetings, meals, and travel between 2014 and 2019, and that unsealed court records describe her providing legal advice on matters including media strategy, correspondence with lawmakers, and efforts to preserve Epstein's controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement.
    


            Epstein's estate has asserted attorney-client privilege over hundreds of emails involving Ruemmler, a claim that legal experts have said is inconsistent with the idea of a purely casual or informal relationship.
    


            Ruemmler has said she regrets ever knowing Epstein and has denied representing him or advocating on his behalf. Goldman Sachs, where she now serves as chief legal officer, has said her relationship with Epstein was professional.
    


            “As Kathy has repeatedly said, she had a professional relationship with Epstein. In fact, the plane ticket you're highlighting was in relation to a business meeting with the mutual client that Epstein referred to Latham and Watkins,” a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told CNN.

            In October 2014, Kathy Ruemmler, as White House Counsel to Barack Obama, sent Jeffrey Epstein a draft public statement declining further consideration for the position of US Attorney General — and asked for his feedback.
    


The email, dated October 23, 2014, shows Ruemmler writing simply: “Draft statement. Thoughts?”
    


            Ruemmler's statement, typos included, read:
    


            “I have always considered the Department of=Justice my professional home, and while I am deeply honored to be consider=d a candidate for Attorney General, I have informed the President that I m=st decline his further consideration.T he Attorney General serves a =nique role in the President's cabinet, and must be perceived as indepe=dent from the White House. Any perception of a lack of independence becaus= of my prior role as Counsel to the President would not serve the Presiden=, the Justice Department's, or the country's interest at this time= and I have so informed the President.”
    


            Ruemmler had left Obama's White House that May. She is currently the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs.
    


            Epstein replied with suggested edits, advising Ruemmler add the phrases “I believe” and commenting on how the statement would be received in “international news reports,” by saying she should add “United States,” after Attorney General.
    


            The email was sent a day before Ruemmler publicly declined the role, though it does not appear she used the statement she sent to Epstein.
    


            Ruemmler has said she regrets ever knowing Epstein and has denied representing him or advocating on his behalf. Goldman Sachs, where she now serves as chief legal officer, has said in the past her relationship with Epstein was professional.
    


            Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

            In the immediate aftermath of the Justice Department releasing millions of additional Jeffrey Epstein-related files on Friday, some survivors tell CNN that they have found numerous examples of victims' names appearing unredacted throughout the documents.
    


            One woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous as “Jane Doe,” has already found her name in multiple places, including in email exchanges she previously had with Epstein.
    


            The woman's lawyer, Jennifer Plotkin, who represents multiple “Jane Doe” Epstein victims, told CNN on Thursday that she had previously reached out to the DOJ asking that the department correct the fact that this client's name was exposed in previous batches of files. Plotkin said she never heard back from the agency.
    


            Other survivors tell CNN that they have also uncovered their own and other victims' names.
    


            The failure to properly redact victims' names came despite Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying in a press conference Friday morning that the agency prioritizes victims' privacy and well-being. Still, he added, “mistakes are inevitable,” and he encouraged anyone who sees problems to reach out to a DOJ email tip sheet.

Editor's Note: This report contains details that some readers may find disturbing.



            Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate at a Manhattan prison pleaded with the convicted sex offender not to kill himself in their shared cell, the man told federal investigators in a lengthy interview days after Epstein's death.
    


            The interview with Efrain Reyes on August 16, 2019, in which he detailed the time he spent with Epstein, was memorialized in several pages of handwritten notes taken by one of the Justice Department officials who was there. The names of the interviewers are redacted, but according to the documents, the assistant US attorney who took the notes and two FBI investigators were among the attendees.
    


            “REYES was JEFFREY EPSTEIN's cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in the Special Housing Unit (SHU), L Tier, Cell 220, until August 9, 2019,” an FBI document reads.
    


            Reyes – who would go on to plead guilty to federal narcotics charges – was transferred out of the prison in a routine, prearranged move. One day later, Epstein died by suicide in the cell, in which he was staying alone at the time.
    


            Reyes “told (Epstein) ‘don't hang yourself up in my cell. Don't try to kill yourself in this cell. I don't want to wake up to find you dead,'” according to the notes released Friday. “(Epstein) said ‘don't worry I'm never going to cause you trouble.'”
    


            Reyes told the investigators that Epstein, a billionaire inmate with an attentive legal team, would use his wealth to his benefit to make life more comfortable in prison.
    


            Epstein “would ask (correctional officers) for things (and) if they say no he would write down (their) name (and) say I'll tell my lawyer – everyone on eggshells,” Reyes said, according to the notes.
    


            For example, though inmates in the SHU were not allowed to have pens, Epstein had two, Reyes said.
    


            Reyes died in November 2020 from Covid.
    


From CNN's Alli Gordon and Marshall Cohen



            The latest tranche of Epstein documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday include fresh information about his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, including booking photos with weight and height details, as well as pictures of her New Hampshire home from search warrant requests.
    


            The newly released documents also contain dozens of Maxwell's financial records.
    


            There are documents from Maxwell-linked accounts at UBS, including one that described her investments and showed a balance of $773,775 in March 2019.
    


            There is also a letter describing a $1 million wire transfer in 2016, as well as IRS documents about her tax returns.
    


From CNN's Annie Grayer



            The Justice Department outlined in a letter to Congress how it conducted its review of the Jeffrey Epstein files and provided more specifics on what was redacted in the more than 3 million pages released on Friday.
    


            Approximately 200,000 pages have been “redacted or withheld based on various privileges,” the letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche states, such as attorney-client privileges or deliberative process privilege.
    


            Documents in a foreign language or that could not be uploaded for review due to technical issues were also not produced.
    


            The letter said that the Justice Department is still trying to obtain additional documents that could later be released, including grand jury materials from a federal criminal case out of the Southern District of New York that charged corrections officers who worked at the correctional facility where Epstein killed himself with falsifying records.
    


            Within 15 days of Friday's release, the Justice Department will submit to Congress a formal report that includes a list of all “government officials and politically exposed persons” found in the Epstein files and a summary all of the redactions, as mandated by the law passed by Congress.
    


            The letter said more than 500 attorneys and reviewers across DOJ helped process the files as a first step. Then 40 specialized attorneys conducted a second review.
    


            “In practice, virtually all of the time and attention of Department personnel who participated in the manual review and redaction efforts was devoted to maximizing the protection of victim-identifying information,” the letter states.

▶ Follow the latest developments on Friday's release of the Epstein files

WASHINGTON (AP) — A huge new tranche of files on millionaire financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released Friday revealed details of his communications with the wealthy and powerful, some not long before he died by suicide in 2019. 

The Justice Department said it was disclosing more than 3 million pages of documents, as well as thousands of videos and photos, as required by a law passed by Congress. By Friday evening, more than 600,000 documents had been published online. Millions of files that prosecutors had identified as potentially subject to release under the law remain under wraps, however, drawing criticism from Democrats. 

Here's what we know so far about the files now being reviewed by a team of Associated Press reporters:

The documents show Epstein exchanged hundreds of friendly texts with Steve Bannon, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, some months before Epstein's death. 

They discussed politics, travel and a documentary Bannon was said to be planning that would help salvage Epstein's reputation. 

In March 2019, Bannon asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.

A couple of months later, Epstein messaged to Bannon, “Now you can understand why trump wakes up in the middle of the night sweating when he hears you and I are friends.” 

The context is unclear from the documents, which were released with many redactions and little clear organization. 




Another 2018 exchange focused on Trump's threats at the time to oust Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he had named to the post just the year prior.

Around the same time, Epstein also communicated with Kathy Ruemmler, a lawyer and former Obama White House official. In a typo-filled email, he warned that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”

Bannon did not immediately respond to a message from the AP seeking comment. Ruemmler said through a spokesperson she was associated with Epstein professionally during her time as a lawyer in private practice and now “regrets ever knowing him.” 

Billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk e-mailed Epstein in 2012 and 2013 about visiting his infamous island compound, the scene of many allegations of sexual abuse. 

Epstein inquired in an email about how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter, and Musk responded that it would likely be just him and his partner at the time. “What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?” he wrote, according to the Justice Department records. 

It's not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Spokespersons for Musk's companies, Tesla and X, didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday.

Musk has maintained that he repeatedly turned down the disgraced financier's overtures. “Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,” he posted on X in 2025 

Epstein also invited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to the island in Dec. 2012. Lutnick's wife enthusiastically accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. The two also had drinks on another occasion in 2011, according to a schedule. Six years later, they e-mailed about the construction of a building across the street from both of their homes.

Lutnick has distanced himself from Epstein, calling him “gross” and saying in 2025 that he cut ties decades ago. He didn't respond to an e-mailed request for comment on Friday afternoon.

Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019, and found dead in his cell just over a month later. 

The latest batch of documents includes emails between investigators about Epstein's death, including an investigator's observation that his final communication doesn't look like a suicide note. Multiple investigations have determined that Epstein's death was a suicide. 

The records also detail a trick that jail staffers used to fool the media gathered outside while Epstein's body was removed: they used boxes and sheets to create what appeared to be a body and loaded it into a white van labeled as belonging to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. 

The reporters followed the van when it left the jail, not knowing that Epstein's actual body was loaded into a black vehicle, which departed “unnoticed,” according to the interview notes.

President Donald Trump has nominated senior economist Brett Matsumoto from the White House Council of Economic Advisers to head the beleaguered Bureau of Labor Statistics after he fired the agency's previous commissioner last year.

“For many years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, under WEAK and STUPID people, has been FAILING American Businesses, Policymakers, and Families by releasing VERY inaccurate numbers. That is why I FIRED the former Commissioner, and am pleased to nominate the very talented Brett Matsumoto as the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),” he announced on Truth Social late Friday.

In emphasizing Matsumoto's qualifications for the job, Trump noted that he once served as a supervisory research economist for the BLS.

“I am confident that Brett has the expertise to QUICKLY fix the long history of issues at the BLS on behalf of the American People,” Trump said. “Brett Matsumoto is a Brilliant, Reputable, and Trusted Economist who will restore GREATNESS to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Congratulations Brett!”

Trump has directed his ire toward the Department of Labor agency ever since former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer authorized the release of a weak jobs report last summer. Trump claimed the report was “rigged” to undermine the economic successes of his administration.

The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, following major downward revisions to the prior two months. An estimated 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June, according to the report scrutinized by Trump.

He then fired McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2024.

Matsumoto's pending confirmation now heads to the Senate for approval.

TRUMP NOMINATES KEVIN WARSH TO BE NEXT FED CHAIRMAN

Trump previously nominated Heritage Foundation economist EJ Antoni as BLS commissioner, but he later withdrew that choice over concerns Antoni wouldn't have been easily confirmed by the Senate. The newest nominee appears to be a less controversial choice.

Matsumoto earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Delaware and a doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015. He has served at BLS for the past decade, conducting research focused on measuring consumer prices.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted Friday to fund most of the government through the end of September while carving out a temporary extension for Homeland Security funding, giving Congress two weeks to debate new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country. 

With a weekend shutdown looming, President Donald Trump struck the spending deal with Senate Democrats on Thursday in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis. Democrats said they would not vote for the larger spending bill unless Congress considers legislation to unmask agents, require more warrants and allow local authorities to help investigate any incidents. 

“The nation is reaching a breaking point,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. “The American people are demanding that Congress step up and force change.”

As lawmakers in both parties called for investigations into the fatal shootings, Trump said he didn't want a shutdown and negotiated the rare deal with Schumer, his frequent adversary. Trump then encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES' vote.” 

The bill passed 71-29 and will now head to the House, which is not due back until Monday. That means the government could be in a partial shutdown temporarily over the weekend until they pass it. 

Speaker Mike Johnson, who held a conference call Friday with GOP lawmakers, said he expects the House to vote Monday evening. But what is uncertain is how much support there will be for the package. 

Johnson's right flank has signaled opposition to limits on Homeland Security funds, leaving him reliant on Democrats who have their own objections to funding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without immediate restraints.

It was unclear how involved Trump will be in the negotiations over new restrictions on immigration arrests — or if Republicans and Democrats could find any points of compromise. 

Senate Democrats will not support an extension of Homeland Security funding in two weeks “unless it reins in ICE and ends violence,” Schumer said. “If our colleagues are not willing to enact real change, they should not expect Democratic votes.”

Similarly, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that any change in the homeland bill needs to be “meaningful and it needs to be transformative.”

Absent “dramatic change,” Jeffries said, “Republicans will get another shutdown.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the two sides will “sit down in good faith,” but it will be “really, really hard to get anything done,” especially in such a short amount of time. 

“We'll stay hopeful, but there are some pretty significant differences of opinion,” Thune said. 

Irate Democrats have asked the White House to “end roving patrols” in cities and coordinate with local law enforcement on immigration arrests, including requiring tighter rules for warrants.

They also want an enforceable code of conduct so agents are held accountable when they violate rules. Schumer said agents should be required to have “masks off, body cameras on” and carry proper identification, as is common practice in most law enforcement agencies.

Alex Pretti, a 37 year-old ICU nurse, was killed by a border patrol agent on Jan. 24, two weeks after protester Renee Good was killed by an ICE officer. Administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, originally said Pretti had aggressively approached officers, but multiple videos contradicted that claim. 

The president's concessions to Democrats prompted pushback from some Senate Republicans, delaying the final votes and providing a preview of the coming debate over the next two weeks. In a fiery floor speech, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned that Republicans should not give away too much.

“To the Republican party, where have you been?” Graham said, adding that ICE agents and Border Patrol agents have been “slandered and smeared.”

Several Republicans have said that if Democrats are going to push for restrictions on ICE, they will push for restrictions on so-called “sanctuary cities” that they say do not do enough to enforce illegal immigration.

“There no way in hell we're going to let Democrats knee cap law enforcement and stop deportations in exchange for funding DHS,” said Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., ahead of the vote. 

Still, some Republicans said they believe that changes to ICE's operations were necessary, even as they were unlikely to agree to all of the Democrats' requests.

“I think the last couple of days have been an improvement,” said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. “I think the rhetoric has been dialed down a little bit, in Minnesota.”

After Trump announced the deal with Democrats, Graham held the spending bills up for almost a day until Thune agreed to give him a vote on his sanctuary cities bill at a later date.

Separately, Graham was also protesting a repeal of a new law giving senators the ability to sue the government for millions of dollars if their personal or office data is accessed without their knowledge — as happened to him and other senators as part of the so-called Arctic Frost investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by Trump supporters at the Capitol.

The spending bill, which was passed by the House last week, would repeal that law. But Graham said Thune had agreed to consider a separate bill that would allow “groups and private citizens” who were caught up in Jack Smith's probe to sue.

Elon Musk apparently wanted to visit Jeffrey Epstein's infamous island for the “wildest party” as seen in a 2012 email exchange with the late sex trafficker, according to the latest tranche of Epstein files released on Friday.

The private messages show the two shared a friendlier relationship than previously thought, and the exchanged pleasantries stand in contrast to Musk's past denial of his ties to Epstein.

In a November 2012 email, Epstein asked Musk, “How many people will you be for the heli to the island?” Musk responded one day later: “Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” The billionaire was in a romantic relationship with actress Talulah Riley at the time.

In January 2013, Musk told Epstein that he wouldn't be able to visit Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands because “logistics won't work this time around.”

In March of that year, Musk said he wouldn't be able to visit soon due to his demanding role as Tesla CEO. When Epstein asked if he could take a break in April, Musk explained that the visit “depends on how well Q1 goes” and that he hadn't been able to get much sleep.

Fast forward to the end of December 2013, Musk tried to coordinate another visit for the following month, but couldn't finalize travel plans for it either due to Epstein's schedule.

“Bad news- Unfortunately, my schedule will keep me in New York. I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda. so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future,” Epstein wrote.

Musk simply replied, “No problem.”

Based on the private correspondence, it doesn't appear Musk ever made it to Epstein's island. He has said as much in a September 2025 post and a 2019 interview with Vanity Fair.

The emails were included in the Department of Justice's release of more than 3.5 million pages of investigative material, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images related to the convicted sex offender. The disclosure is part of the department's effort to comply with a law passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump late last year requiring broad transparency around the Epstein investigations, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said during a Friday press conference.

DOJ SAYS NO EPSTEIN FILES WERE REDACTED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS

Musk was not the only well-known figure mentioned in the latest round of Epstein files.

Among the big names were Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, both of whom appeared to visit Epstein's island before the financier faced federal charges in 2019.

Nvidia plans to make a "huge" investment into OpenAI, probably its largest ever, CEO Jensen Huang said on Saturday, denying he was unhappy with the ChatGPT ⁠maker.

The chipmaker announced in September plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, a deal that would give OpenAI the cash and access it needs to buy advanced chips that are key to maintaining its dominance in an increasingly competitive landscape.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the plan ‌had stalled ‌after some inside the chip giant expressed ​doubts about the deal.

The report said Huang had privately underlined to industry associates in recent months that the original $100 billion agreement was non-binding and not finalised.

Huang has also privately criticized what he ⁠has described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach and expressed concern about the competition it faces from the likes of Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, the WSJ said.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Huang said it was "nonsense" to say he was unhappy with OpenAI.

"We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time and I really love working with Sam," he said, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

"Sam is closing the round (of investment) and we will absolutely be involved," Huang added. "We will invest ‍a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made."

Asked whether ‌it would be over $100 billion, he said: "No, no, nothing like ⁠that."

It was up to Altman to announce how much he wanted to raise, Huang added.

Amazon is in talks to invest billions in OpenAI, and the figure could be as high as $50 billion.

OpenAI is looking to raise up to $100 billion in funding, valuing it at about $830 billion, Reuters has previously reported.

Huang was speaking outside a Taipei restaurant, having hosted all Nvidia's key suppliers in Taiwan, including the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, in what Taiwanese media called the "trillion-dollar dinner" because of the combined market capitalization of those attending.

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

A combination of big Apple stock sales and steady gains for the share price of American Express has put the credit card company within a few billion dollars of becoming the most valuable holding in Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.

In mid-2023, the Apple stake's value of close to $180 billion was around $154 billion greater than the American Express holdings.

Since then, Berkshire has sold roughly three-quarters of the position.

Last Friday, Apple's lead narrowed to an all-time low was just $4.3 billion. This week it increased to $8.4 billion.

The Apple sales are, by far, the biggest factor in the narrowing margin, but American Express stock has outperformed Apple over the past 2 1/2 years with a 106% gain vs. Apple's 35% advance.

Buffett first bought 5% of AXP in 1964 when its share price was depressed after it fell victim to loan fraud involving fake salad oil. Berkshire added American Express shares in the 1990s but hasn't done any buying since late in that decade. 

Its stake as a percentage of AXP's outstanding shares has increased to 22%, however, due to the credit card company's stock buybacks over the year.

If Berkshire's Q4 portfolio snapshot, due to be released about two weeks from now, shows even more Apple sales, American Express could be the new number one.

Or, if AXP continues to outperform Apple, it may achieve that title without further reductions.

As Warren Buffett was appearing live on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday, February 24, 2020, futures were pointing to a drop of 3% for the stock market when it opened due to fears of a coronavirus pandemic.

Buffett, however, wasn't worried. He was, in fact, happy that stock prices would be going down.

Here are the seven ways he told viewers, in effect, "Don't panic!"

BECKY QUICK: Let's talk a little bit about the fact that the market's down almost 800 points this morning.

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.

BECKY QUICK: Concern for you?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well no, that's good for us actually.

I mean we're a net buyer of stocks over time. And just like being a net buyer of food, I expect to buy food the rest of my life, and I hope that food goes down in price tomorrow.

So, when stocks are down, no, we're going to be buying, on balance. And who wouldn't rather buy, you know, at a lower price than a higher price?

People are really strange on that. I mean they — most people, most of your listeners are savers and that means they'll be net buyers and they should want the stock market to go down. They should want to buy at a lower price.

But they got that feeling that they just feel better when stocks are going up.

2) 6:03 AM ET

BECKY QUICK: When you're looking at the futures down about 818 points this morning, I think probably the first thing viewers want to hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus, if this is a reason to panic, and if you are worried about this?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I don't know I have any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus...

If you're buying a business, and that's what stocks are, businesses — in fact, people will be better off if they say I bought a business today not a stock today, because that gives a different perspective on it — then presumably if you buy a farm, if you buy an apartment house, if you buy a business, you're going to own it for 10 or 20 or 30 years.

And the real question is this — has the 10-year or 20-year outlook for American businesses changed in the last 24 hours or 48 hours?

And we're going to — you'll notice many of the businesses we own — partially own — American Express, we've owned it for 20 years; Coca-Cola, we've owned it for 40 years — but those our businesses. And you don't buy or sell your business based on today's headlines.

3) 6:05 AM ET

BECKY QUICK: But if I think that I can buy something for potentially 10% cheaper, maybe more than that, if I wait a week or a month, maybe that's what I'm sitting around waiting for.

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if you think that you've got — you're going to get fabulously rich if you're right (LAUGHS). All you have to do is just keep buying in 10-day intervals and keep making your 10-day prediction.

If I knew what the market was going to do, obviously —

But you don't — I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.

I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.

4) 6:07 AM ET

WARREN BUFFETT: You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper, that's for sure.

And you really can't — you certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.

5) 6:46 AM ET

BECKY QUICK: For people who are just waking up, they're tuning in and they want to know what you think about this sell-off this morning — to see the Dow down 700, 800 points in the morning — what's your reaction when you see something like that?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, my reaction is that I like to buy stocks. So, I don't wish ill on anybody else, but I like that — if they want to sell them to me cheaper, I prefer it. (LAUGHS)

So, if that's a, you know, roughly, 3% decline or thereabouts — I don't know how many 3% declines I've had in my lifetime, but there have been a lot of them.

And I can't think of one that you shouldn't have bought on, you know, basically.

That doesn't mean stocks are going to go up or down next week or next month or next year.

But if there's something — if you like to own American businesses, you're getting a chance to buy at 3% cheaper.

BECKY QUICK: Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?

WARREN BUFFETT: It's — well, we certainly won't be selling. And, yeah, we may — we could easily be buying something, sure.

6) 8:02 AM ET

BECKY QUICK: Warren, we've talked this morning about the coronavirus, but there are people who are waking up across the country now, kind of tuning in at this hour, so maybe we should address this again.

With the markets indicated down 750 points ... how do you kind of wake up and read this and think through it?

WARREN BUFFETT: I don't think — it makes no difference in our investments. I mean, there's always going to be some news, good or bad, every day.

In fact, if you go back and read all the papers for the last 50 years, probably most of it — headlines — tends to be bad.

But if you look at what happens to the economy, most of the things that happen are extremely good. I mean, it's incredible what will happen over time.

So, if somebody came and told me that the global growth rate was going to be down 1% instead of a tenth of a percent, I'd still buy stocks if I felt like the business and I like the price at which — and I like the price better today than I liked it last Friday.

7) 8:59 AM ET

BECKY QUICK: Before we let you go, let's just go back to the futures again this morning because right now the Dow is indicated to open down about a hundred — or 830 points. Weakness again on concerns about coronavirus and what that means.

What's your mentality today as you kind of go out and look at the stock market and decide what you're going to do?

WARREN BUFFETT: We're buying businesses to own for 20 or 30 years. We buy them in whole, we buy them in part. They're called stocks when we buy them in part. 

And we think the 20 and 30-year outlook has not changed by coronavirus.

If enacted, President Donald Trump's proposal for a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates could change many policies for borrowers. Among them: how issuers decide to value credit card points.  

If you've accumulated any significant amount of credit card points, you should probably spend them now — but not because of the potential for a 10% interest rate cap, says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at The Points Guy.

"This is not a reason in and of itself to spend your points," Ewen says. "Even before this was announced, you should be spending your points."

Credit card points — rewards earned from card spend that can be redeemed for benefits like travel, cash back or merchandise — are funded mainly by fees paid by merchants on each transaction, along with interest and sometimes fees paid by cardholders, Ewen says.

That means a 10% interest rate cap could reduce issuer revenue. To offset that lost income, reward programs may lower the amount of points you can earn from spending on the card, increase redemption costs or offer fewer perks, Ewen says.

However, putting a timeline on when points could start to lose their value if an interest rate cap is implemented is a "fool's errand," because of all the uncertainty around Trump's proposal, he says. 

There are two main reasons you should be consistently spending your points, Ewen says:

Hotel, airline and credit card reward programs can change their redemption policies at will, and they don't necessarily need to give you advance notice of any upcoming changes, Ewen says.

"You don't know what the future is going to hold," Ewen says. Stockpiling points "can really come back to bite you if something changes significantly in the program that you are holding them in."

Changes rarely increase the value you can redeem for your points, Ewen says. Whether it's beneficial redemption rates or options to transfer your points to airlines or hotel loyalty programs, if your credit card comes with a perk you have active plans to use, Ewen says it may be wise to take advantage now.

Additionally, unlike money you put in a high-yield savings or investment account, your points don't earn interest. This means their real value erodes over time as prices rise — $100 worth of points with an airline will still be worth $100 next year, even if flight prices increase, Ewen says. 

"The idea of using your points now keeps money in your pocket to be used in other situations," Ewen says. "Sure, you can earn more through spending and other activities, but you're not going to see a balance increase just by leaving it there."

The number of points you should keep on hand will vary by person, and it largely depends on how many opportunities you have to redeem them, Ewen says. It can be useful to have some points saved for emergency situations like last-minute flights, he adds.

For those going on multiple domestic and international trips in a year, it may make sense to hold onto more points. Those who travel less frequently should start thinking about spending their points once they hit the mid to upper five-figure range, he says.

It's very common to see people saving points for a big trip like a honeymoon, Ewen says. Keep in mind that points can often be redeemed months ahead of time, and if price drops happen, especially with flights, you may be able to rebook and receive the difference back in points, though you should check with your provider first, Ewen says.

If you have points that can cover a flight right now, go ahead and spend your points on it, he says: "That is going to be your best option."

An explosion that hit a building ‍in the southern Iranian port city of ‍Bandar Abbas on Saturday was ‍caused by a gas leak, according to a preliminary assessment, the local head of the fire department said.

Earlier, Iranian state media reported that at least one person had been killed and 14 injured in the blast, which comes amid heightened tensions between ‌Tehran ‌and Washington over Iran's crackdown earlier this month on nationwide protests ​and over the country's nuclear programme.

"This (gas leak and accumulation) is the preliminary assessment. My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours," Mohammad Amin Liaqat, the fire department chief, said in a video published by Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.

A video published on social media showed ⁠people standing among debris and wrecked cars in front of a damaged building following the explosion.

Reuters was able to verify the location by analysing buildings, trees, and road layout, which matched satellite and file imagery. Reuters could not independently verify the date the video was filmed.

Separately, four people were killed after another gas explosion in the city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border, according to state-run Tehran Times. No further information was immediately available.

The explosions highlighted the jittery mood prevailing in Iran amid its clerical rulers' standoff with the Trump administration.

Before the reports of the two blasts on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused U.S., Israeli and European leaders of exploiting Iran's economic problems, inciting unrest and providing people with the means to "tear the nation apart".

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander had been targeted in the Bandar Abbas explosion were "completely false".

Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel was not involved in Saturday's ‍blasts. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump said on ‌Jan. 22 that an "armada" was heading toward Iran. Multiple sources said on Friday that Trump was weighing ⁠options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces.

Bandar Abbas, home to Iran's most important container port, lies on the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway between Iran and Oman which ‍handles about a fifth of the world's seaborne oil. The port suffered a major explosion last April that killed dozens and injured over 1,000 people. An investigative committee at the time blamed the blast on shortcomings in adherence to principles of civil defence and security.

Iran has been rocked by nationwide protests that erupted in December over economic hardship and have posed one of the toughest challenges to the country's clerical rulers.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA has ⁠said at least 6,500 people were killed in the ‌protests, including hundreds of security personnel. ​

Big Food is slimming down. 

As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. 

In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.

Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.

"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate," said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. 

February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.

For more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and "shrinkflation" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.

More recently, regulators, emboldened by the "Make America Healthy Again" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.

As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.

On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. 

For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. 

"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies," said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. "One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses."

While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.

To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. 

"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place," Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. "At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks]."

(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still "scratching my head" about the logic of the deal for both players).

Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.

Like many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.

However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.

"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company," Bain's Horsley said. "You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed."

Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. 

For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.

With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.

Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. 



But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.

"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell," RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. "They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change."

One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.

From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.

Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.

"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens," said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.

Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.

But acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.

A month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. 

On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.

And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve "insurgent brands," according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. 

Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.

But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.

"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around," AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.

The Justice Department on Friday released many more records from its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, resuming disclosures under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier's sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with the rich and powerful.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department was releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Epstein disclosure, as well as more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The files, posted to the department's website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release of documents in December.

Congressional Democrats, who have been key to pushing for the release of case files on Epstein, are arguing that Friday's release is only about half of the files that have been collected.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted after months of public and political pressure, requires the government to open its files on the convicted sex offender as well as his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

Here's the latest:

Epstein appears to have tried to connect the co-owner of the New York Giants with women Steve Tisch, the co-owner of the football team, emailed back and forth with Epstein several times in 2013, and in some they referenced women.

In one exchange, Tisch wrote to Epstein that he had lunch with one of Epstein's assistant's friends — "very sweet girl" — and asked if the financier knew anything about her.

"no, but i will ask," said Epstein, before inquiring if Tisch had contacted another woman, crudely describing her physical features.

In another email exchange, Tisch asked Epstein, "Is there somebody in NY you want me to meet?" Epstein's reply was redacted, but in a later email he said "tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic."

"Working girl?" asked Tisch in a response similar to characterizations the two appeared to use in describing women, including in one email where Tisch asks "pro or civilian?"

"I am happy to have you as a new but obviosly shared interest friend," wrote Epstein.

In an emailed statement, Tisch said that he had a "brief association" where they emailed about "adult women" and other topics, saying that he never took Epstein up on invitations or visited his island.

"As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with," said Tisch.

That was after multiple underage girls came forward and told police and FBI agents that they had been paid to give him sexualized massages.

Ultimately, the U.S. attorney in Miami at the time, Alexander Acosta, signed off on a deal that let Epstein avoid federal prosecution. He pleaded guilty instead to a state charge of soliciting prostitution from someone under age 18 and got an 18-month jail sentence.

One of the documents released Friday, though, was a draft indictment from that period that would have brought federal charges against not just Epstein but three other people who worked for him as personal assistants. The names of those people were blacked out in the Justice Department's records.

The draft indictment said those people were part of a conspiracy to recruit underage girls to perform lewd acts with Epstein, summon them to his house by phone, and then to pay them for their services.

They included emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles about President Donald Trump, commented on his policies or his politics, or gossiped about him and his family.

Among the records was a spreadsheet, created just last August, summarizing calls that had been made to the FBI's National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline set by prosecutors from people claiming to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump.

That document included a range of uncorroborated stories involving many different celebrities, and somewhat fantastical scenarios, occasionally with notations indicating what follow-up, if any, was done by agents.

Among the documents released Friday was a 58-page manual that dictated staff etiquette and duties in his Florida mansion, ranging from how to interact with Epstein and Maxwell to what to stock in their bathrooms.

"Remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at you. Respect their privacy," the manual says.

Staff were banned from addressing Epstein, Maxwell and their guests with their hands in their pockets, and from saying "yeah," "sure," "no problem," "you bet," "gotcha," "right" and "I dunno." They also could not talk about the weather or any other subject unless asked.

As part of the "pre-arrival preparations" for the primary bedroom, the air conditioning had to be set at 60 F (15.5 C), a gun was to be placed in a bedside table draw and tissue boxes could not be less than one-third full. Toothpaste containers in the bathrooms could not be less than one-half full.

Every car had to have two bottles of water and $100 in the glove compartment, and the gas tanks had to be at least three-quarters full.

Excerpts of the manual were introduced during Maxwell's trial in 2021 as a former employee of Epstein's Florida mansion testified.

The employee at Epstein's Florida estate, whose name was redacted, told the FBI his duties included fanning $100 bills on a table near Epstein's bed, placing a gun between the mattresses in his bedroom and cleaning up after Epstein's frequent massages, which often involved rubdowns from young women or girls.

The employee recalled wiping down vibrators used during massages, throwing out tissues, laundering towels and seeing used condoms on more than one occasion. He said he did not go into Epstein's massage room while he was receiving massages and did not witness any sexual activity between the females and Epstein.

FBI agents wrote that the employee told them Epstein also "enjoyed getting ice cream from a local ice cream parlor with the girls," allowed "some of the girls to drive one of his vehicles," and sometimes directed the employee to take them shopping at a local mall.

An employee at Epstein's Florida estate told the FBI in 2007 that he believed he saw underage girls in the financier's company and that Epstein once had him purchase flowers and deliver them to a student at Royal Palm Beach High School to commemorate her performance in the school play.

He said Epstein also directed him to rent a car for the girl, described by FBI agents as a "UF," or "Unidentified Female." The employee recalled another female person whom he said "looked very young."

Asked by an FBI agent if he believed some of the girls were under the age of 18, the employee nodded his head, "affirming that he believed some of the girls were under the age of eighteen," according to notes from the interview.

The FBI had started investigating Epstein in July 2006 and FBI agents expected Epstein to be indicted in May 2007, according to records released Friday. But the probe was ultimately abandoned in a deal that allowed him to plea guilty to state charges and avoid significant punishment.

In a letter to Congress, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche noted that tens of thousands of files had been redacted or withheld due to legal privileges such as protecting attorney-client work communications.

The letter obtained by The Associated Press said that the Justice Department within 15 days of Friday's release will submit to Congress a "formal report with a summary of redactions made and a list of all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials."

Blanche said the department "remains committed to protecting the privacy of victims and welcome continued engagement from victims and their counsel." He said officials have created an email inbox for victims to contact authorities if they need to raise concerns about redactions.

The group of survivors and their relatives said the massive cache of files released Friday protects the names of their abusers at their expense.

"This latest release of Jeffrey Epstein files is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors," reads the statement provided by the publicist of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most vocal Epstein accusers. "As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein's enablers continue to benefit from secrecy."

The group dismissed the notion that Friday's release represented all the documents that should be legally made public.

"This is not over. We will not stop until the truth is fully revealed and every perpetrator is finally held accountable," the statement reads.

On one occasion in December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean for lunch, according to documents released on Friday show. Lutnick's wife, Allison Lutnick, enthusiastically accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.

Lutnick has tried to distance himself from associations with Epstein, saying in a 2025 interview that he cut ties with the sex offender decades ago, calling him "gross."

The two men's lives continued to intersect as recently as 2018, documents show. That year, Epstein contributed to a philanthropic dinner honoring Lutnick, according to email exchanges. The year prior, the two men sent each other emails about the construction of a building across the street from both of their homes.

Lutnick didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday afternoon.

'The documents contain hundreds of friendly text messages between Epstein and Steve Bannon in the months leading up to Epstein's suicide in August 2019. Bannon, a conservative activist who had served as Trump's White House strategist earlier in the president's first term, bantered over politics with the financier, discussed get-togethers with him over breakfast, lunch or dinner and, on March 29, 2019, asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome: "Is it possible to get your plane here to collect me?"

Epstein told him his pilot and crew "are doing their best" to arrange that flight but if Bannon could find a charter flight instead, "I'm happy to pay." 

Apparently in France at the time, Epstein followed up with a text saying: "My guys can pick you up. Come for dinner." The exchange did not show how that played out. In their communications over months, the two at times touched on a documentary that Bannon was said to be planning to polish Epstein's sullied reputation.

On June 28, 2019, Epstein messaged Bannon: "Now you can understand why trump wakes up in the middle of the night sweating when he hears you and I are friends." The context is not discernible from that exchange. Bannon responded: "Dangerous."

On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. He was found dead in his cell just over a month later.

The billionaire Tesla founder reached out to Epstein on at least two separate occasions to plan visits to the Caribbean island where many of the allegations of sexual abuse purportedly occurred, according to email chains included in Friday's document release.

In a late November 2012 exchange, Epstein inquired how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter to the island he owned — Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

"Probably just Talulah and me," Musk responded, referencing his partner at the time, actress Talulah Riley. "What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?"

Musk messaged Epstein again ahead of a planned trip to the Caribbean in late December 2013. "Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays," he wrote. "Is there a good time to visit?"

Epstein responded by extending an invite for sometime after the New Year holiday.

"play it by ear if you want," he wrote. "always space for you."

"I will come and get you," Epstein wrote in a follow up email.

It's not immediately clear if the island visits took place.

Spokespersons for Musk's companies, Tesla and X, didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday. Musk has maintained that he repeatedly turned down the disgraced financier's overtures.

"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED," he posted on X in 2025 when House Democrats released an Epstein calendar with an entry mentioning a potential Musk visit to the island.

Epstein gave millions of dollars to research projects associated with Martin Nowak, a Harvard University math professor. In a 2018 email, Epstein assistant Lesley Groff asked someone about a missing key card for Nowak's office.

"We can't find it. ... it is kept in my office drawer and it is not there...do you happen to know where it is?" Groff asked. The email recipient is redacted.

In 2021, Harvard barred Nowak from starting new research or advising students for at least two years because of his ties to Epstein after the financier's 2008 sex crimes conviction. An investigation determined that Nowak gave Epstein an office in his campus research center, along with a building key card.

At the time, Nowak said he regretted the connection between Harvard and Epstein "and the hurt that it has caused."

Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019, and found dead in his cell just over a month later.

The latest batch of documents includes emails between investigators about Epstein's death, including an investigator's observation that his final communication doesn't look like a suicide note. Multiple investigations have determined that Epstein's death was a suicide.

To draw attention away from the "large news media presence" outside the jail after Epstein's death became known, officials concocted a plan.

According to an Aug. 16, 2019, memo, a jail supervisor told FBI agents that several employees had "used boxes and sheets to create what appeared to be a human body." That was loaded into a white van labeled as belonging to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and media members followed when it left the jail.

But Epstein's actual body, according to the interview notes, was loaded into a black vehicle, which departed "unnoticed."

As with many of the documents released Friday, names were blacked out, so the identities of the jail employees were not visible.

The files also include correspondence between the Justice Department and officials at the U.S. embassy in London, which acted as a go-between with officials in the United Kingdom.

In August 2021, a Justice Department attaché at the embassy emailed the prosecutors, expressing concern about a news article that said Andrew's refusal to speak with Epstein investigators was "straining relations" between the U.S. and the U.K.

The attache, whose name was redacted, wrote: "The Ambassador is concerned about the attached story, and I wanted to see if you have any sense of where this is coming from. Is this coming from victims' counsel? Anyone in your shop decided to push this?"

The attache also said that a British counterpart had reached out to ask whether a civil lawsuit naming Andrew as a defendant meant the now-former prince was "now a suspect instead of a witness (in British parlance)" in a criminal investigation. The attaché said he would respond that the lawsuit had no impact on Andrew's status.

Some of the records also document an attempt by prosecutors in New York to get Mountbatten-Windsor to agree to be interviewed as part of their Epstein sex trafficking probe.

The records include a diplomatic memo, sent to officials in the United Kingdom in April of 2020 where the FBI and prosecutors asked to interview the then-prince under oath. That interview would never take place. Lawyers for Mountbatten-Windsor declined to make him available for questions.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Britain's Prince Andrew, was friends with Epstein for years and settled a sexual misconduct lawsuit filed by one of Epstein's alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre claimed that she'd been directed by Epstein to have three different sexual encounters with Mountbatten-Windsor, starting when she was 17.

Mountbatten-Windsor denied her allegations.

The former prince's name appears at least several hundred times in the documents, sometimes in news clippings, sometimes in Epstein's private email correspondence and in guest lists for dinners organized by Epstein.

At least one of the files appears to show personal information that was meant to be kept from the public.

It's an email exchange that appears to be marked for redactions but leaves names and telephone numbers visible. The December 2019 emails captured officials discussing missing surveillance video from the New York jail where Epstein survived an apparent suicide attempt earlier that year.

During Trump's first term, Epstein emailed Kathy Ruemmler, a lawyer and former Obama White House official, to warn that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a "maniac."

"you might want to tell your dem friends that treatin= trump like a mafia don , ignores the fact that he has great dangerous pow.r.." Epstein wrote in a typo-filled email. "tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad =ituation.. gambino was never the commander in chief."

In a 2018 exchange, Epstein and Trump advisor Steve Bannon discussed the president's threats to oust Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he had named to the post just the year prior.

"should have been done months ago too old!!!!" Epstein wrote.

"Can u get rid of Powell or really get rid of mnuchin," Bannon replied, referring to then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

"no, mnuchin is ok," Epstein replied.

Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Powell after spending the past year assailing him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.

Others center around Ghislaine Maxwell's incarceration and her grievances related to her imprisonment conditions.

The records contain emails between investigators that discuss Epstein's death, including his last note — with the email stating that it does not appear to be a suicide note.

Thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein's jail suicide have already been released.

The House Oversight Committee has also issued a separate subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the files without redactions, but that has not been fulfilled. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, called the limited release of documents "outrageous and incredibly concerning."

Congressional Democrats who have been key to pushing for the release of case files on Epstein are arguing that Friday's release by the Department of Justice is only about half of the files that have been collected.

"The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions. This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld," said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill that mandated the disclosure.

Khanna said he was looking to see whether the files released Friday included FBI interviews with victims, a draft indictment and information prosecutors collected during a 2007 investigation into Epstein in Florida.

The House Oversight Committee has also issued a separate subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for the files without redactions, but that has not been fulfilled.

Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, called the limited release of documents "outrageous and incredibly concerning."

Over the years, prosecutors received tips from people with wild stories about being sexually abused by famous figures. In some instances, FBI investigators diligently reached out to these tipsters and alleged victims and listened to their implausible sounding stories — some involving the occult and human sacrifice — then wrote dry reports summarizing what the people had to say and sent them to their superiors.

Attorney Jay Clayton told New York federal court judges overseeing records in the sex trafficking cases against Epstein and Maxwell that some documents are being withheld temporarily while the government awaits further guidance from civil and criminal courts.

In a letter to the judges, Clayton says his office continues to engage with victims and their lawyers, including during a call Thursday. He said the Justice Department has invited victims to reach out if they believe anything has been published that should be redacted.

The huge cache of documents included email correspondence between prosecutors, printouts of thousands of emails that Epstein either sent or received, news clippings, and reports written by FBI agents summarizing their interviews with witnesses and alleged victims in the investigation.

As was the case with many previous releases of documents related to Epstein, much material was blacked out. Some of the reports on FBI interviews had entire pages blacked out, along with the name of the person who was being interviewed.

The deputy U.S. attorney general also responded to criticism about the Justice Department's handling of the files' release.

He said federal attorneys had to review all 6 million pages to ensure no victim information is released, and couldn't do so within the 30-day timeline set by the law. He noted various exemptions under the law, but said no material was being withheld under a national security or foreign policy exemption.

"There's not some tranche of super-secret documents about Jeffrey Epstein that we're withholding," he said about redactions in the files.

Justice Department lawyers made extensive redactions to the released files, including victim information that included their medical files.

They redacted images and videos, including removing any woman depicted in videos except for Ghislaine Maxwell.

Lawyers also withheld child sex abuse materials or anything depicting images of death, physical abuse or injury, as well as anything that would hurt an ongoing federal investigation, Blanche said.

Compiling accurate and thorough information takes time. A team of AP reporters is working to confirm information released by the Justice Department regarding Jeffrey Epstein.

These standards guide our reporting process:

1. We generally do not identify those who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to extreme abuse

2. We must make significant efforts to reach anyone who may be portrayed in a negative way in our content

3. We will not knowingly introduce rumor or false information into material

4. We abhor inaccuracies, carelessness, bias or distortions

5. We always strive to identify all the sources of our information

Blanche said that the release may not answer all the questions people have about Epstein or the handling of the allegations against him.

"There's a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don't think will be satisfied by review of these documents," he said.

"We did not protect President Trump. We didn't protect — or not protect — anybody," Blanche said.

Silver took a historic plunge on Friday, but there are signs traders should look out for that could suggest the pain isn't over.

That's according to Jeffrey Christian, a longtime commodities analyst and managing director at CPM Group.

The devil's metal — which has vaulted higher over the past year on a mix of economic factors and investor FOMO — just saw a brutal correction.

After rallying more than 200%, silver plunged more than 30% on Friday as the US dollar strengthened and investors reacted to Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve.

But the decline could keep going, Christian said, adding that he's on the lookout for a handful of signs to gauge whether silver was in for more pain.

Christian, for what it's worth, believes silver could remain elevated or rise through 2026, even after the big sell-off on Friday. That's because overarching concerns about inflation, the strength of the US dollar, and other risks that have driven more investors to pile into the precious metal as a safe-haven will still be a factor.

But, should silver's price retreat more, he believes traders could exit the market en masse. In the worst-case scenario, he sees the metal's price tanking to $68 an ounce, he told Business Insider, implying another 17% drop from the price late Friday afternoon.

"This is the way markets behave, and no one should be surprised that speculators have poured into a market that's moving parabolic, and no one should be surprised when they leave. It's happened over and over again," he said, adding that the Friday sell-off was a sign investors are already rushing to take profits.

Christian said his firm is keeping an eye on several indicators that could suggest that more froth will be taken out of the silver market.

Here's what they're looking out for.

Christian said he'd be looking for further signs that investors are losing interest in silver, which could slow down its momentum enough to cause more speculative traders to flee.

He pointed to measures of trading momentum in the price of silver itself, but also in bonds and holdings of ETFs related to silver.

The silver investing frenzy — which Christian suspects began in September, after the Fed signaled it would cut interest rates more aggressively than markets expected — didn't show many signs of letting up before Friday.

On Monday, retail traders snapped up a record net $171 million shares in the iShares Silver Trust ETF, according to data from VandaTrack Research. That outpaced flows in 2021, when retail investors orchestrated a short-squeeze of the metal, Ashwin Bhakre, the firm's head of product, wrote in a note this week.

Silver's Turnover Momentum — Vanda's gauge for how quickly investors are trading an investment — also spiked to 11.55 times its normal level at the start of the week, compared to Nvidia's Turnover Momentum of 7.54, Bhakre added.

"Silver has just become retail's new favourite toy," he wrote.

Another thing that could further slow down silver's momentum is if inventories rise, Christian said.

The silver supply-demand imbalance was already narrowing in recent years. The world's supply of silver was estimated to grow 2% over 2025, while demand was estimated to pull back 1%, according to a joint report from The Silver Institute and Metals Focus.

In a presentation to clients this week, Christian said he saw several signs that silver supply was poised to increase. He pointed to record amounts of silver that could be mined from reserves, and signals like how many silver refineries are backlogged.

"You're already seeing refineries backed up with silver that investors have been selling," he told Business Insider.

High open interest in silver futures is another factor that has supported the metal's price in recent months, Christian said.

Christian pointed in particular to active March 2026 silver contracts on the COMEX exchange. Open interest stands at around 500 million ounces of silver.

As those contracts approach delivery, some investors are expected to roll their contracts forward to a future month, keeping upward pressure on silver prices, Christian said. If open interest were to fall, that could remove a significant source of upward pressure on the price, he said.

"The spike may have peaked, but prices may hang up at high levels into March," he said of the outlook for silver during the sell-off on Friday.

Observers have been growing wary of silver amid its meme-like rally in recent months.

Marko Kolanovic, the former quant chief at JPMorgan, said he believed a 50% drop in silver prices was "almost guaranteed," citing past episodes of commodity speculation.

"Once you have the significant, substantial speculation, then of course there's risk that the move can go the other way," Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider

At an Amazon Fresh store in New York, some customers would walk in and ask employees: Do you have products from Amazon's other grocery store here?

"I would run into people looking for a specific product from Whole Foods," one employee at the store told Business Insider.

Amazon opened Fresh in 2020 after acquiring Whole Foods in 2017. Some assumed that Amazon Fresh would offer their favorite organic yogurt or premium meat because of the shared ownership. While Fresh stores did stock some Whole Foods 365 products, store employees said, Amazon sought to offer more affordable groceries and showcase its technology, such as Just Walk Out and smart shopping carts, at Amazon Fresh.

On Tuesday, the technology and retail giant said it would close its roughly 60 Fresh stores in the US. Meanwhile, Amazon plans to expand Whole Foods and its grocery delivery services as it tries to compete with grocery stores like Walmart and its Supercenters.

For Amazon, grocery represents an industry the company has yet to crack in the same way it did with books or cloud computing. Market-research firm Numerator estimates that Walmart controlled about 21% of the US grocery market, across online and in-store sales, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods each held roughly 1.6%. An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday that Numerator's figures "underrepresent" the company's grocery share.

The Fresh store closures also mark the latest setback in Amazon's efforts to expand its physical retail presence. Since opening its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in 2015, the company has tested a range of formats, including cashierless Amazon Go stores and 4-Star shops featuring curated merchandise. It has since shuttered all of those concepts.

Once Amazon Fresh closes, Whole Foods will be the company's sole remaining physical retail brand.

While Amazon acquired Whole Foods' reputation for quality standards and affluent, liberal-leaning shoppers when it bought the brand, it had to establish Amazon Fresh from scratch.

It offered more affordable groceries and items that Whole Foods doesn't sell, such as sugary sodas. Amazon also touted Fresh stores for their tech, such as the Just Walk Out checkout system and smart shopping carts.

Amazon said in Tuesday's statement that it never quite found "a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion" in the grocery industry.

Amazon Fresh tried a variety of promotions to draw customers into its stores. Store employees who spoke to Business Insider said some were more successful than others.

One store in Southern California set up free massage chairs for customers next to the produce section and had carnival-style games for kids as part of a daylong event a few months after opening, an employee said, adding that the attractions helped boost foot traffic.

Many stores gave customers who returned an Amazon order at a Fresh store $10 off if they spent at least $40 there. Staff said some shoppers overused the offer. At the Southern California store, a QR code leading to the coupon was often left out at the customer service desk, creating a standing discount for shoppers who noticed it, according to the employee.

"You wouldn't even have to return anything," the employee said. "They'd just scan it, and they'd use that every time they bought their groceries."

Amazon does not separately disclose sales for Whole Foods or Fresh. Instead, it reports revenue for its "physical stores" segment, which is largely made up of Whole Foods and has grown roughly 5% to 8% in recent quarters. That business generated $5.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter.

A more structural problem may have been what Amazon decided to carry in its stores.

Besides food, early versions of Amazon Fresh stores also included tech products, home goods, and other items Amazon sold online.

At the New York store, employees often had to throw away ready-to-eat foods from a hot bar, such as mac and cheese, after they sat largely untouched, an employee who worked there said.

The store also tended to be overstocked on health and beauty products, such as hair dye, this employee said.

"Just For Men is not really a hot seller at an Amazon food store," she said. "But we still have two cases of it in the back."

The eclectic offerings at Fresh stores left many customers without a clear reason to return, said Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst and editor of the website SupermarketGuru.

"They tried everything, and I think that that was, frankly, the downfall," Lempert said.

That strategy differed from grocery chains like Wegman's, Publix, or Whole Foods, which have established themselves for specific offerings, such as organic food or pub subs. "These retailers are curating the offerings," he said.

By narrowing its focus to Whole Foods, Amazon is now aiming for a more niche grocery proposition, said one of its corporate employees. The Fresh stores lacked a clear draw for shoppers, the person said, while chains such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Costco offer distinct reason for customers to visit.

Amazon is also seeking to appeal to more mainstream grocery shoppers by expanding pickup options for everyday staples, such as Coca-Cola and Doritos, at select Whole Foods locations, according to another employee, who had direct knowledge of the strategy. One upgraded Whole Foods store in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from a dedicated area in the back of the store.

Amazon's in-store technology, which the company promoted as one of Fresh's major advantages over rivals, got a lukewarm reception from many patrons, several store employees said.

One who worked at another Southern California store said in-person customers tended to bypass Amazon's Just Walk Out technology in favor of traditional or self-service checkout, he said. Amazon pulled the tech from Fresh stores in 2024.

Amazon then focused on Dash Carts, smart shopping carts, to speed checkout. An employee at a store in New Jersey said store managers never showed him or his colleagues how to use the Dash Carts — a problem when customers asked how they worked. Amazon told Business Insider that it trained some employees specifically for assisting customers, including instruction on using the Dash Carts.

Last year, Amazon put on hold plans to sell its Dash Carts to other retailers, according to people familiar with the matter. The company recently said the Dash Carts would expand to dozens of Whole Foods locations.

Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods was intended to accelerate a push into physical retail. Integrating the grocer into Amazon's broader ecosystem has proved challenging, however, according to current and former employees at both companies.

An update to the Whole Foods app that surfaced Prime discounts confused some customers, workers said. Amazon also became more involved in Whole Foods' day-to-day operations, pressing for more prominent Prime messaging throughout stores. That friction contributed to delays in rolling out Amazon's cashierless technology at Whole Foods locations, Business Insider previously reported.

Last year, Amazon put Whole Foods Chief Executive Jason Buechel in charge of the entire Fresh grocery operation.

Buechel has sought to ease the strain. Over the past year, he has worked to bring the businesses together under a "One Grocery" initiative, and Amazon began migrating Whole Foods employees onto Amazon's internal systems last year, Business Insider previously reported.

One of the SoCal workers said he had a sense that a big change might be coming.

Last fall, he said, a manager informed him that his role picking items from store shelves for online orders was being eliminated. The store, he said, was rarely busy, including at peak shopping times, such as after work or on weekends.

He got a job doing the same kind of work at one of Amazon's nearby grocery fulfillment warehouses, an area the company is doubling down on.

"That's where the future is," the worker said.

Intrigued by automated driving? Perhaps you've already tried one of the real Waymo or Zoox robotaxis in the United States. (Tesla's "robotaxis" probably don't count yet.)

China is the other real global hotspot for automated driving, with some of its biggest companies eager to expand around the world. Yet many people in the West — even many experts — don't really understand what's happening on China's streets. Often, we hear people simply claim that China is either way ahead or way behind.

Together, we have more than three decades of experience working on automated driving in industry and academia. Since meeting at Stanford University, we've collectively spent countless hours riding in Chinese as well as American robotaxis.

We wrote this piece to share our experiences in China and to help you plan — or even daydream — your own.

Perhaps you'll marvel as your robotaxi skillfully navigates streets filled not just with cars but with bikes going every which way. Or you might sit sheepishly as it tries to turn itself around in a crowded intersection. You'll see some passersby who are shocked you're in a car without a driver, as well as others who are just annoyed you're in their way.

In other words, you'll encounter everyday people as they — and you — try to make sense of the robotaxis coming our way fast.

Here's what we've learned about robotaxis in China on our (driverless) adventures, and here's how you can ride too.

China's three largest robotaxi developers are Baidu Apollo, Pony.ai, and WeRide. Each operates in China and is also pursuing services in other parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.

Baidu Apollo is the automated driving unit of Baidu (BIDU on Nasdaq), often compared to Alphabet, which owns both Waymo and Google. You can get the Baidu Apollo Go app by searching for 萝卜快跑 in a Chinese app store. The first part of this name intentionally sounds like "robot," but it actually means "radish."

Pony.AI (PONY on Nasdaq) is a startup based in both China and the United States. You can get the PonyPilot app by searching for 小马智行 in a Chinese app store.

WeRide (WRD on Nasdaq) is a startup that operates robotaxis, as well as automated shuttles along specific routes. You can get the WeRide Go app by searching for 文远知行 in a Chinese app store.

These companies differ in their approaches. For example, unlike many of its competitors, Baidu sometimes uses remote drivers rather than mere remote assistants. Perhaps as a result, Baidu already sends its robotaxis on some freeways without safety drivers inside. (Waymo only recently expanded its service to a few US freeways.)

Other companies are also developing automated vehicles in China — but, at least in our experience, they tend to be active in very limited areas or still rely heavily on safety drivers.

Many Chinese cities — including some megacities you may have never heard of — have at least some automated driving activity.

If you're coming in search of robotaxis, you can't go wrong with five of the more famous: Beijing (the capital), Shanghai (the financial hub), Wuhan (China's "Chicago"), and Guangzhou and Shenzhen (neighbors in the tech-heavy province of Guangdong near Hong Kong).

Whereas Waymo's robotaxis can pick you up almost anywhere in San Francisco or Phoenix, you'll need to go find the robotaxis in Chinese cities. Services are generally confined to pilot zones covering only portions of each city, and an individual robotaxi company might provide truly driverless service in only part of a given pilot zone.

That said, comparisons are difficult: While Beijing's primary pilot zone may appear small, it is roughly similar in geographic size and population to all of San Francisco.

Because Baidu, Pony, and WeRide are all active here, Beijing provides a good introduction to Chinese robotaxis. Most of the capital's automated driving activity takes place in the southeastern Yizhuang area. (You'll know you're there when you see numerous automated vehicles marked with a BJHAD logo in the shape of a car.)

Visit Yizhuang during the day — not during rush hours when services may pause or fill up, and not at night when they generally stop. Some robotaxi companies offer connections to and from South Railway Station and Daxing Airport, but these runs can be sporadic, may require advance booking, and currently use in-vehicle safety drivers.

Shanghai has several areas where, at least in theory, you can take a ride in a robotaxi. Remember that Shanghai is enormous; as in Beijing, you may need to travel by subway or taxi for an hour just to reach a robotaxi.

Pony serves a relatively small area east of Shanghai's famous central business district. From the CBD (or from the super-fast maglev train that serves Pudong Airport), head to Yunshun Road station. Yunshun Road is not Yunshan Road!

If you're near Hongqiao Airport (or its intercity rail station) on Shanghai's far west side, explore the various services in Jiading. We recommend a bus or taxi ride to Poly International Plaza to try out Baidu and Pony. Didi Rider (滴滴出行) and SAIC (上汽集团) also have limited operations nearby.

Locals like to say that Baidu chose Wuhan because the city's human drivers are notoriously bad. At this point, the city's ubiquitous Apollo robotaxis probably offer China's best example of an automated vehicle service that ordinary commuters rely on. You can even get to and from the airport without a human at the wheel.

As with all the companies, there are caveats: You might be within Apollo's service area but not near one of its designated pick-up points, and some major destinations are still just out of reach. If you're already in the center, start at Hongtu Avenue station near Jinyingtan Hospital.

Some of our more exciting robotaxi experiences (other than on Wuhan's freeways) were in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

Many "robotaxis" in these two cities actually had human safety drivers. And some of the vehicles that were driverless perhaps should not have been.

Shenzhen has officially opened the entire metropolis to robotaxis, but in practice, companies still serve only limited areas.

Guangzhou has integrated automated shuttles into parts of its public transport network, which shows how automated mobility is more than just robotaxis.

The apps you'll use to book your robotaxi trips are both fun and frustrating. Most are available only in Chinese, so a screen translation app compatible with the Chinese internet is essential.

Some apps won't show their robotaxis until you're physically in their service area. Some require you to manually set (and, crucially, to update) your desired service area in the settings; otherwise, they may incorrectly show no availability. And some let you choose between driverless and driver-supervised rides.

Alternatively, the mapping apps Baidu Maps and Amaps each show their preferred robotaxi company if you're in a service area and you've toggled the robotaxi option. (Look for the Chinese term 无人车.)

Once you request a ride, some apps indicate your queue position. But if robotaxi service has been suspended due to weather or other reasons, a perpetual queue might be your only clue that your ride isn't coming.

China has recently loosened some of its travel restrictions. This means citizens of many European countries do not need travel visas for short visits.

If you're a US citizen, you do need to get a visa in advance — unless you're spending only a few days there on your way to somewhere else.

Check with your regional Chinese consulate, or turn to a commercial visa service. It's not onerous.

You'll need a mainland Chinese phone number to register for most robotaxi services — as well as to use many other Chinese apps that are linked to physical things in the real world. A foreign number, Hong Kong number, or data-only eSIM is unlikely to suffice.

Fortunately, once you arrive in China (and sometimes even in the airport), you can buy or rent a prepaid Chinese phone. Remember to bring your passport — and make sure you get an actual mainland number (+86 followed by 11 digits).

You can also ask the salesperson for the best app to translate your screen from Chinese to English. Remember that the Chinese internet is quite different from the internet you know. For example, even with a VPN, you might not be able to use any Google services.

The Western app stores for Apple and Android have international versions of major apps such as WeChat (for messaging and payments), Alipay (for payments and public transport), and Didi (for taxis). Beyond these basic functions, however, many of these apps (or the miniapps within them) may still require a Chinese phone number.

Once your robotaxi trip is underway, you can change your destination — though the number of times varies by provider.

As long as the app or in-vehicle screen lets you, this is a great way to spend more time in robotaxis rather than waiting for them.

This also shows how a company handles route changes. For example, Pony will quickly undertake U-turns (or even three-point turns), which can make for interesting maneuvers on already chaotic streets.

If all this sounds complicated, don't worry: The quirks of early robotaxis are part of the experience. China is becoming more accessible to foreigners, and some of the hurdles we've described may have even fallen by the time you visit.

Regardless, the people you'll meet are almost always willing to help. Even if they don't speak English, they're impressively proficient with translation apps.

As with any trip, carefully consult travel guidance from your government. But if you'd like to be a robotaxi tourist, China should be high on your list. The country's robotaxis aren't perfect, but they're ahead of most of the world — and well worth the trip.

The U.S. is looking increasingly isolated when it comes to its global geopolitical and trade relationships as allies reassess their ties to the world's largest economy and consider going it alone. 

The new year has seen a number of nations and power blocs forging ahead with relationship resets, closer commercial ties and trade partnerships, sidelining a more hostile and volatile U.S. They include China's  "preliminary agreement" with Canada and rapprochement with the U.K., as well as the European Union's agreements with India and South American countries.

Those deals and negotiations come after a year of U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" trade and foreign policy in his second term in office, which has seen the White House hit friends and foes alike with punitive trade tariffs, and even territorial threats, as it asserts its economic and geopolitical dominance. 

But that strategy could be backfiring, particularly as the U.S.' friends and partners look to diversify their trade policies, in no small part to protect themselves from Trump's unpredictability.

"Given what's happening with the U.S. and its foreign policy, which was articulated in the recently released National Security Strategy ... the 'middle powers' need to find their own agency and figure out different approaches," Damian Ma, director of Carnegie China, an East Asia-based research center, told CNBC on Thursday.

"Countries are going to align based on particular, specific à la carte interests, rather than a comprehensive values-based alignment," he said, noting that while this was not a return to a divided Cold War mentality of opposing power blocs, it was more a "recalibration" of national interests.

"Where that recalibration and that new equilibrium ends is anyone's guess, but you're seeing countries starting to make moves finally. The U.K. and Canada are not going to be the only ones," he said, predicting a "flood of countries recalibrating their approach" to superpowers like China and the U.S. 

That recalibration has certainly gathered pace of late with a flurry of diplomacy and trade deals being pursued since the new year, none of which have involved the U.S. or President Trump.

China has been particularly busy, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo and Starmer all visiting Beijing this month.

China and Canada agreed to reduce trade barriers in early January, prompting a furious response from Trump, while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was in Beijing to reset ties with President Xi Jinping, with both sides agreeing to lower barriers to trade and travel.

The EU has also been busy, making progress in its trade deal with Mercosur, as well as signing a long-awaited free trade agreement with India last week. 

Those meetings have taken place after Trump's tirade against allies during his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he insulted and criticized various leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Carney.

Jimena Blanco, chief analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that there had been a measurable deterioration in how the U.S. communicated with its allies. 

"Our data measuring verbal tensions between countries shows worsening U.S. relations with some key allies over the last year," she told CNBC on Thursday. 

"The sharpest spikes were recorded with Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Japan, Ireland, New Zealand and France, reflecting the impact of public, tense exchanges between U.S. officials and their counterparts in allied nations."

But Blanco noted that U.S. allies have tended to respond to Washington's policy shifts by diversifying their economic exposure, rather than reversing their integration in the global trade system.

"The EU, Canada, Japan, Australia and the U.K. can't afford to disengage with the U.S. but are instead widening trade with large emerging markets as well as with each other," Blanco added, with emerging markets the "major winners" of this diversification. 

Likening this period of difficult relations with the U.S. as a rocky patch rather than grounds for divorce, analysts say the U.S.' allies have little choice but to try to keep the U.S. on side, while exploring other avenues of trade and cooperation.

"Europe is too dependent on the U.S. not only for its security, but also technologically and economically, to prefer the divorced life today," Ivan Krastev, chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, said in a Goldman Sachs report earlier this week.

"For Europe, while there is much talk about finding new allies, aligning with others won't be a quick or easy process," he noted, adding: "Instead, Europe will be focused on showing the U.S. that Europe matters."

Joseph Parkes, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed that the U.S. was too big to be isolated, ultimately: "It is simply too important from a tech, trade, currency and security perspective," he told CNBC on Thursday.

Nonetheless, key allies will aim to re-balance their global relationships in strategic areas in the long-term, he said.

"The nature of globalization will change. Trade fragmentation will create new and different groupings of countries seeking to increase economic resilience," he told CNBC on Thursday, with "geopolitical agility" increasingly important for businesses to navigate a more uncertain landscape. 

"The recent volatility has accelerated a shift away from 'just-in-time' towards 'just-in-case' to strengthen supply chains," he noted, with companies turning to 'nearshoring' and 'friendshoring' in order to source materials from trusted allies. 

In the meantime, Parkes said, governments would look to "expand trade agreements to build strategic flexibility and reduce market and supply-chain dependence on any given country."

A cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. 

The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the "wildest party," hosted by Epstein at his island. 

Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. 

"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED," Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. 

The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein "may have referred or attempted to refer" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.

The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.

Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.

"The world needs more romance," Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.

In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, "how many people will you be for the heli to island?" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, "What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?"

In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, "Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?"  

"I will send heli for you," Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, "Thanks."

In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, "Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's." He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. 

CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. 

Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. 

The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.

In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, "Are we in New Mexico?" 

Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. 

In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.

"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files," Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. "That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!"

Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said "went too far."

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin price has dropped below $80,000 for the first time since April 2025. Yet, its performance has still outpaced gold. While BTC dropped alongside broader risk assets, the losses were notably smaller than those seen in precious metals. 

This relative strength drew attention from new market participants. Many investors viewed the pullback as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at discounted levels.

Gold faced a sharp sell-off as the week came to a close. Between Thursday and Friday, the precious metal plunged nearly 10%. During the same period, Bitcoin declined by about 5.6%. This contrast highlights shifting investor preferences during market stress.

Although gold is traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin has shown greater resilience in the short term. The smaller drawdown suggests stronger demand support for BTC.

Investor behavior reflects this shift, as capital appears to favor Bitcoin over gold during recent volatility.

On-chain data reinforces this trend. Bitcoin's network recorded a surge in new addresses over the past 24 hours. Approximately 335,772 new addresses were created, marking a two-month high. This was the largest daily increase since November 2025.

The spike occurred as the Bitcoin price dipped toward $81,000. New participants likely viewed the decline as a favorable entry point.

Fresh address growth often signals expanding adoption and renewed interest. These inflows can strengthen demand and support price stability during corrections.

Bitcoin is trading near $78,000 at the time of writing. Recently, BTC broke down from a broadening ascending wedge. This bearish pattern projected a 12.6% decline, targeting the $75,850 region.

The sell-off intensified after Bitcoin lost the $82,503 support level. That breakdown confirmed short-term bearish momentum. However, reclaiming this level could shift sentiment. Improving on-chain metrics and rising address growth increase the chances of stabilization.

A stronger recovery would require Bitcoin to reclaim $87,210 as support. Achieving this would signal renewed buyer confidence and help BTC recover recent losses. If the downtrend persists, downside risk remains.

Failure to hold current levels could send Bitcoin toward $78,763. Losing that support could open the door to $75,895, invalidating the bullish outlook.

U.S. president Donald Trump's surprise nomination of former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair boosted the dollar, unwound the precious metals rally, and is bringing bitcoin below a key support level.

Onchain data shared by Glassnode shows bitcoin was consolidating just above key structural support around $83.4K, the lower bound of its short-term holder cost basis model.

A breakdown below that zone could open the door to a deeper slide toward $80.7K, the so-called True Market Mean.

That breakdown is occurring. Over the past 7-day period bitcoin BTC$83,460.68 lost more than 9.2% of its value and now trades at $81,200.

The broader market, measured via the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, lost 12.4% of its value over that period. That has meant the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to “extreme fear” over the week.

Glassnode's report notes that short-term holder supply held at a loss with BTC above that level remained at 19.5%, well below the 55% capitulation threshold, suggesting some resilience despite downside pressure. However, buyer conviction is being tested as price drifts lower.

On the derivatives side, funding rates remain muted, pointing to cautious speculative appetite. Options markets are pricing in greater demand for downside protection, with dealer gamma flipping negative below $90K. That increases the risk of volatility spikes if support breaks.

Taken together, the data paints a picture of a fragile but not yet broken market. Liquidity remains the key variable.

The crypto market may currently be gripped by fear, but that could be a good signal.

According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, sentiment across various cryptocurrency communities has plunged to extreme lows, levels that have historically preceded price recoveries.

In a report, Santiment highlighted the rise in bearish commentary on social media as a rare bright spot in an otherwise downbeat environment.

“While network fundamentals are stagnant, crowd sentiment has hit extreme negativity levels,” the firm wrote. “Historically, this excessive bearishness is a strong contrarian indicator that a local bottom could be near.”

While prices have been dropping throughout the last few months, long-term bitcoin holders are selling at the fastest pace since August. Crypto prices fell over the week, seemingly over the U.S. dollar's decline reversing.

Some industry observers say the current mood may be short-lived, however.

Bitwise's CIO Matt Hougan had recently joined CoinDesk's Markets Outlook, where he said crypto is in the late stages of a bear-market bottom. Historically, crypto markets have tended to move in the opposite direction of the crowd, the report points out.

Crypto markets extended their weekend slide with losses broadening across major tokens and high-beta altcoins, as futures liquidations piled up following weakness in bitcoin.

Ether bore the brunt of the damage. The second-largest cryptocurrency saw roughly $385 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, the largest of any asset, as its price slid sharply alongside a wider risk-off move. Bitcoin followed with about $188 million in liquidations, while losses accelerated across solana, XRP and a long tail of altcoins.

Liquidation data shows the selloff was skewed one-sided. Long positions accounted for the vast majority of forced exits, with short liquidations barely registering. That imbalance points to traders being caught leaning the same way after weeks of range-bound price action and repeated attempts to buy dips.

The damage was not limited to crypto-native assets. Tokenized commodities also featured prominently, with blockchain-based silver contracts posting unusually large liquidations relative to their size. 

The presence of metals alongside bitcoin and ether is indicative of how crypto venues are increasingly used as fast-moving macro trading rails during periods of stress.

Solana and XRP each saw more than $45 million in liquidations, while dozens of smaller tokens were swept up as liquidation engines fired across exchanges. In total, roughly $974 million was wiped out in the past 24 hours, with more than 240,000 traders forced out of positions.

Price action across majors reflected the pressure. Bitcoin slipped toward the low-$80,000 area, ether broke key short-term levels, and altcoins fell at a faster pace, reinforcing their sensitivity to leverage cycles.

With liquidity thinner over the weekend and risk appetite fading, the move looked less like panic and more like a mechanical reset. 

Whether that clears the path for stabilization or opens the door to another leg lower will depend on how quickly leverage rebuilds once markets reopen in full.

Bitcoin's slide below $84,200 has triggered a burst of panic on social media, with analytics firm Santiment saying negative commentary has jumped to the highest level of 2026 so far. 

The move pushed BTC sentiment to its lowest level since Nov. 21 and flipped the mood from cautious to outright fear, a shift that tends to show up when late sellers finally give up.

Santiment tracks the ratio of positive to negative commentary across social platforms and said the balance has skewed hard toward pessimism. 

That matters because crypto often turns on positioning and emotion as much as headlines. When the crowd leans too far one way, markets can run out of marginal sellers, especially after sharp drops that force traders to cut leverage or meet margin calls.

This does not guarantee a clean bounce. Fear spikes can stretch for days if macro markets keep wobbling or if bitcoin fails to reclaim key levels that traders watch, like $90,000. 

Choppy trading also fits the broader backdrop. Equities, gold, and silver have all seen pullbacks after big runs, and that cross-market de-risking can spill into crypto through liquidity and leverage.

Still, Santiment framed the fear jump as closer to capitulation than the start of a fresh euphoria phase, as retail traders tend to sell when pain peaks, while larger players with longer time horizons often buy into that forced selling. 

If bitcoin stabilizes and the fear wave cools, the same traders posting doom today can become tomorrow's rally chaser.

Ethereum's inability to hold the $3,000 level isn't a concern for long-term traders and investors. The world's second-largest crypto by market cap has a clear path to more than triple in value due to a combination of strong fundamentals and bullish technical patterns.

But even if this bullish outlook plays out, it only represents a 2x return from its all-time high of $4,946.05. Still, a 2x or 3x gain (or more), depending on when the token was purchased, is certainly nothing to complain about.

However, this type of return may pale in comparison to what early-stage crypto presale projects could offer. Digitap ($TAP), a fintech startup with a live crypto banking platform, is emerging as the better altcoin to buy for outsized gains.

Source: Digitap

Digitap is the world's first “omni-bank” platform that blends everyday fiat finance with digital assets. The project offers a live banking app for iOS and Android devices, as well as a web browser. Features include standard bank accounts, high-yield savings accounts, more than 20 foreign currency accounts, global money transfers, and crypto wallet support for more than 100 tokens.

Users can take advantage of a Visa card linked to their account balances. The AI-powered software identifies the cheapest way to convert crypto to fiat at the time of purchase if a user wants to spend their digital currency.

The recent addition of a Visa debit card is a game-changer for Digitap's status as the best crypto to buy. A partnership with one of the most recognized brands in payments signals that Digitap wants to be a serious contender in the banking industry. This immediate real-life utility of making crypto spendable also signals that Digitap has a tangible product from day one.

An optional no-KYC signup process also opens the door to a large market. There are an estimated 800 million adults worldwide without a bank account due to a lack of proper identification. Digitap can provide basic banking services, including a Visa card, to this overlooked community of hardworking people seeking financial inclusion.

Digitap's crypto presale of its native $TAP was launched last summer. During the peak of the crypto market selloff, when Ethereum tumbled from more than $4,000 to around $2,500, Digitap saw investor interest accelerate.

$TAP is offered to investors in different stages. After each round is sold out or expires, $TAP increases in value. The token was offered to investors at $0.0125 in the first round and has since increased to $0.0454. This paper's profit of more than 250% proved to be a much-needed breath of fresh air in a sea of red.

In fact, a well-diversified altcoin portfolio that lost 30% would have broken even with a mere 10% allocation to $TAP in the first round. Aside from its status as a top altcoin to buy and hedge against a weak market, Digitap's tokenomics are built for long-term value creation.

Half of the platform's profits are allocated toward buying back and burning tokens and funding staking yield. This model ties $TAP's value directly to the platform's success. Each transaction on the app plays a role in shrinking the token count from its maximum supply of 2 billion $TAP.



Ethereum's price has lost around 15% from its early 2026 highs above $3,200. However, according to some traders, this represents a technical reset rather than a trend break. As long as Ethereum reclaims key support levels and builds momentum, the coin has a clear path higher.

The $10,000 outlook is based on multiple signals lining up at once. These include Wyckoff-style accumulation patterns, cycle-based upswings, and liquidity correlations. When all factors align, traders are bullish on a coin's outlook.

On the fundamental side, on-chain activity adds another layer justifying Ethereum as a solid crypto to buy. Ethereum hit a record 2.78 million daily transactions on January 15, with daily transactions up roughly 20% over the past month. Daily active addresses are up about 50% over the same period.

Ethereum transaction fees also hit a multi-year low, with daily fees dropping below 150 ETH at one point. At the same time, smart contract deployments are hitting record highs. The takeaway is that cheaper fees are making Ethereum more usable, which could attract more developers over time.

Ethereum reaching $10,000 would represent a milestone for the entire crypto industry, similar to Bitcoin hitting $100,000. It would signal a robust industry and confirm that a bull cycle remains intact.

Older Ethereum investors who bought years ago would reap impressive returns if the token reaches five figures. However, for investors seeking the best altcoin to buy for explosive gains, Ethereum's high-end scenario is limited to roughly a 3x return from current levels.

Digitap's status as a crypto presale project offers an alternative. It is an early-stage project offering ground-floor valuations backed by a working product with real utility. If Digitap executes well and captures its target market, investors could see gains substantially higher than a 3x return.

In fact, Digitap could offer the type of gains Ethereum once delivered. Ethereum is up a mind-boggling 98,000% over its lifetime. Even a fraction of that type of return over time would be meaningful for investors.

The NFT ecosystem has transformed digital ownership, enabling creators, collectors, and investors to interact through blockchain-powered assets. Establishing a scalable NFT marketplace is a strategic business opportunity that goes beyond simply trading NFTs—it creates a secure, transparent hub where users can mint, buy, sell, and auction unique digital assets. Developing such a marketplace requires careful planning around business models, platform features, technology, and growth strategies, ensuring long-term value for stakeholders while maintaining adaptability to evolving trends and user expectations.

Building an NFT marketplace involves creating a digital platform that allows users to mint, buy, sell, and trade non-fungible tokens securely on the blockchain. It is more than a transactional platform—it acts as a hub for creators and collectors, facilitating digital ownership, royalties, and secondary sales. Developing a marketplace requires integrating blockchain technology, smart contracts, and secure wallets while ensuring a smooth user experience. A well-designed NFT marketplace provides a balance between creator empowerment, collector engagement, and business sustainability.

NFT marketplaces are evolving at a rapid pace, with 2026 seeing significant adoption across industries. Increased use of blockchain for art, gaming, and digital collectibles, along with broader acceptance by brands and institutions, drives marketplace growth. New technologies such as cross-chain trading, interoperability, and integrated analytics expand functionality and attract a diverse user base. Marketplaces that offer innovative use cases, secure infrastructure, and engaging user experiences are likely to lead growth, shaping the way digital assets are created, owned, and traded across the global ecosystem.

Selecting a sustainable business model is crucial when developing an NFT marketplace. The model influences revenue generation, user engagement, and the platform's scalability over time. Understanding different models helps in aligning the marketplace with target audiences and market goals. A clear business model also builds trust among users, attracting both creators and collectors. By evaluating commission structures, subscription options, and hybrid revenue streams, developers can choose a model that ensures profitability while supporting the growth of the NFT ecosystem.

A feature-rich NFT marketplace improves user experience, enhances security, and ensures efficient transactions. Identifying and integrating core features enables the platform to meet the expectations of creators and collectors. Scalability is achieved when these features operate seamlessly as user numbers increase. Providing intuitive interfaces, advanced search tools, and comprehensive minting and auction capabilities ensures that the marketplace can handle growing demand while fostering trust and engagement.

Choosing the right technology stack ensures that an NFT marketplace can operate efficiently, scale effectively, and maintain security standards. The stack includes blockchain selection, smart contract development, backend infrastructure, and frontend frameworks. Each component plays a vital role in the platform's performance and reliability. Proper technology integration allows seamless transactions, real-time data handling, and a smooth user experience, which are essential for building trust and fostering long-term engagement in a competitive NFT market.

Effective marketing is key to attracting and retaining users in an NFT marketplace. A well-planned growth strategy involves community engagement, strategic partnerships, educational content, and incentive programs. Each element contributes to user acquisition, increased transactions, and loyalty. A strong marketing approach ensures that creators and collectors understand the platform's value, encouraging active participation and long-term sustainability.

Legal compliance is critical to establishing trust and ensuring operational continuity in an NFT marketplace. Developers must adhere to intellectual property laws, AML regulations, taxation guidelines, and data privacy standards. Failure to comply can result in financial penalties or reputational damage. Implementing clear policies, reporting mechanisms, and verification processes ensures a secure and legitimate marketplace for all participants while maintaining credibility and sustainability.

Scalability ensures that an NFT marketplace can grow sustainably while maintaining performance and user satisfaction. Planning for infrastructure, smart contract efficiency, cross-chain interoperability, and analytics-driven improvements allows platforms to adapt to increasing demand. A scalable marketplace is capable of handling higher transaction volumes, attracting more users, and supporting long-term business growth without compromising the quality of service or security.

Building a scalable NFT marketplace requires a comprehensive strategy that combines robust business models, advanced technology, user-focused features, and growth-oriented marketing. As NFT adoption expands in 2026, marketplaces that emphasize security, scalability, and community engagement will remain competitive and profitable. By addressing regulatory requirements, optimizing platform performance, and continuously evolving through data-driven insights, developers and entrepreneurs can create marketplaces that support creators and collectors while contributing to the long-term development of the NFT ecosystem.

In recent years, very few individuals have found themselves at the center of public debate as intensely as Kyle Rittenhouse. His name has become more than just a reference to a single court case; it has evolved into a symbol of how modern society discusses justice, self-defense, media narratives, and cultural division. Whether people view him with support, criticism, or uncertainty, his story continues to spark conversations that go far beyond the courtroom.
Kyle Rittenhouse became widely known following the events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020. What followed was not only a legal battle but a cultural one. Social media, news outlets, and public figures weighed in almost instantly, often forming strong opinions before all facts were fully examined. This reaction highlighted a broader issue: how quickly narratives are created in the digital age and how difficult it can be for truth to move at the same speed as outrage.
At its core, the Rittenhouse case forced many people to confront uncomfortable questions. How should self-defense laws be interpreted? What responsibility do individuals have during moments of public unrest? And perhaps most importantly, how does media framing influence public perception before a trial even begins? These questions remain relevant today, which is why Kyle Rittenhouse is still discussed years later.
What makes his situation particularly notable is how polarized reactions became. For some, he represented a failure of social systems and accountability. For others, he became an example of how legal processes can be overshadowed by emotional narratives. Regardless of where one stands, it is hard to deny that his case exposed deep divisions in how people understand justice and personal responsibility.
Interestingly, this pattern of public reaction is not limited to legal cases. Similar dynamics appear in sports, entertainment, and even combat sports. A surprising comparison can be drawn with Sean Strickland, a professional mixed martial artist known for his blunt personality and controversial statements. While Strickland operates in a completely different arena, the way audiences respond to him reveals something important about modern culture.
Sean Strickland is often praised by supporters for being authentic and criticized by others for being provocative. Much like Kyle Rittenhouse, discussions about Strickland frequently move beyond facts and into identity-based reactions. People tend to project their own beliefs onto public figures, turning them into symbols rather than individuals. This process simplifies complex human stories into easily digestible narratives, often at the cost of nuance.
The comparison between Kyle Rittenhouse and Sean Strickland is not about equating their actions or professions. Instead, it highlights how society reacts to figures who do not fit neatly into acceptable molds. In both cases, public opinion tends to form quickly and solidify strongly, leaving little room for balanced discussion. This reflects a broader trend where debate becomes more about taking sides than seeking understanding.
Another key aspect of the Rittenhouse story is the long-term impact of public scrutiny. Becoming a widely recognized figure at a young age comes with lasting consequences. Legal outcomes may bring closure in court, but public judgment often continues indefinitely. This raises ethical questions about how society treats individuals after high-profile events and whether redemption or privacy is truly possible in the digital era.
Media literacy also plays a major role here. The way stories are presented can shape beliefs more powerfully than facts themselves. Sound bites, headlines, and viral clips often replace full context. Learning to slow down, verify sources, and separate emotion from evidence is increasingly important, especially when discussing sensitive topics like those surrounding Kyle Rittenhouse.
Ultimately, the ongoing interest in his story says less about one individual and more about the world watching him. It reflects a time where controversy drives engagement and where public figures are often reduced to symbols in larger ideological battles. Just as with Sean Strickland, reactions tend to reveal more about the audience than about the person being discussed.
In the end, the story of Kyle Rittenhouse remains relevant because it challenges people to think critically. It encourages deeper conversations about law, media responsibility, and the human tendency to rush to judgment. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale or a cultural mirror, his story continues to shape discussions in a society still learning how to navigate truth, emotion, and accountability in the modern age.

Ethereum price continued its freefall this week, and is now hovering near its lowest level since July last year. It has slipped by 47% from its all-time high despite improving network metrics. This article explains why the token has crashed despite its network growth and what to expect.

A closer look at key third-party data shows that the Ethereum network is firing on all cylinders, a trend that will accelerate after the upcoming Glamsterdam and Hegota upgrades.

Data compiled by Nansen shows that the network processed more than 67 million transactions in the past 30 days, an increase of 38%. At the same time, the number of active users jumped by 45% to 14.7 million, while network fees rose by 11% to over $12.39 million. 

Ethereum's growth is largely attributable to its stablecoin business, which has benefited from its relatively low fees. Data shows that Ethereum fees have dropped sharply in the past few months and are almost cheaper than some layer-2 networks.

Recent data suggest that the Ethereum network processed more than $8 trillion in stablecoin transfers in the fourth quarter. According to Artemis, it has handled over $1 trillion in volume in the last 30 days, with the number of stablecoin addresses soaring to over 7.2 trillion.

Stablecoin transactions and volume will continue accelerating in the coming years. Analysts believe that the supply of stablecoins will jump from over $300 billion today to over $1 trillion in the next few years.

Ethereum is also the most dominant chain in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. While the number of competitors such as Solana and Aptos has increased, data indicate that their dominance has accelerated in recent months.

Therefore, the Ethereum price has crashed because of the broader crypto market crash that has affected Bitcoin and most altcoins. It also happened as ETH ETF outflows accelerated in the past few weeks.

The weekly chart also explains why the ETH price has crashed in the past few months. This chart shows that the coin is in the process of forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a common bullish reversal sign. It has completed the formation of the head and the left shoulder. It also recently formed a bearish flag pattern.

Therefore, the ongoing Ethereum price crash is happening as the token targets the left shoulder section at $2,125. As such, it may drop towards that level in the coming weeks and then stage a strong rebound. However, a drop below $2,125 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

The FOI sought further details on a potential housing development in Lambeth - the site pictured would have been demolished and redeveloped for a new housing development, but the plans were scrapped after a resident ballot saw a majority of residents vote against the plans(Image: Facundo Arrizabalaga )

Lambeth Council has been rapped by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for failing to disclose information to a resident around a potential housing development in the borough.

During its investigation, the ICO encountered problems with the council after it failed to respond to an Information Notice within 30 days and continued to ignore further contact attempts.

In a ruling published on December 17, the ICO said it could have taken the council to the High Court for contempt of court but chose not to because of how "lengthy" it would have been, which would have caused further delays to the investigation. A Lambeth Council spokesperson said it will respond to the ICO report "in due course", adding that it was committed to openness and transparency in all of its work and ensuring it is held to the highest possible standards.

The resident had submitted a Freedom of Information (FoI) request to the council on November 28, 2024 which asked for pre-application information relating to the potential redevelopment of Bellevue Garden Mansions in Stockwell. The proposals from the housing association, Hyde Housing, involved the demolition and regeneration of a block of 10 Victorian terraces which date back to 1839.

The plans would have seen the loss of a communal garden, a local nursery and a green space which contains basketball courts which are heavily used by the Stockwell community. The plans were fiercely opposed by the community and a resident ballot saw 76.3per cent of residents vote against the plans. Following the results of the resident ballot, the plans were dropped.

The FoI sought all pre-application advice given by Lambeth Council to Hyde Housing regarding the development, as well as any emails, letters or meeting minutes between council officers and third-party representatives. The resident requested for several other details, including records of any site visits by council officers and evidence of any initial plans, proposals or concept designs.

The council responded on January 3, 2025, confirming that it held relevant information but ultimately rejected the resident's request, citing environmental and commercial exceptions. On two matters which related to environmental and heritage impact assessments, and correspondences or consultation with local resident groups and stakeholders, the council said it did not hold any information.

The resident complained to Lambeth Council 10 days later and asked for an internal review on the FoI refusal and asked the local authority to explain exactly what searches were undertaken to verify that some of the information did not exist. They also asked the council to consider providing the relevant information in a redacted format.

However on February 10, 2025, the council informed the resident of the outcome of the internal review and chose to uphold its original refusal. The resident noted that the wording of the internal review appeared "identical" to the refusal notice and failed to address any of the points he had raised.

The ICO contacted the council in July of last year and asked for a copy of the information it was withholding as well as legal arguments which supported its reasons for withholding information on commercial and environmental grounds. However the council failed to respond to the requests, which led to the ICO issuing a formal Information Notice in September 2025.

The council was legally required to respond to the Information Notice within 30 days, but did not respond until 48 days later. The council provided the ICO with copies of the withheld information but did not provide any legal arguments or the search explanations which showed that some of the information did not exist.

The council went on to provide the resident with redacted copies of some of the documents which related to their request, however the resident grew suspicious when it provided emails which only dated back to September 2024. Hyde Housing has had the site since 1999 and first informed residents of the plans in October 2023, so the resident suspected prior information was being withheld.

A spokesperson for residents who are involved with the FOI request told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): "Lambeth Council seems to be avoiding this issue. They wouldn't even let us speak for three minutes at a recent council meeting.

"The original stock transfer document between Lambeth and Hyde Housing guaranteed that Hyde would maintain and repair Bellevue Garden Mansions until 2029, not demolish them. We eagerly await Lambeth Council's response to the ICO's ruling on this matter."

In its findings, the ICO found it reasonable for the resident to question whether the council held any information which pre-dates September 2024, and concluded that the council may be holding back further information related to the FoI request.

In its conclusion, the ICO said: "On the balance of probabilities, the council is likely to hold further information falling within the scope of the request."

The ICO has ordered Lambeth Council to disclose the information it withheld and must take action within 30 days of the ICO issuing its decision otherwise it could face High Court action.

A spokesperson for Lambeth Council told the LDRS: "We receive over 3,000 FoI requests every year, and we work hard to respond to all of these fully – in compliance with regulations and within statutory timescales. Where problems do arise, we are committed to resolving these swiftly and fairly."

Crypto markets are doing what they always do before major upside. Price action looks boring on the surface, while serious capital moves behind the scenes. According to the report, Strive purchased an additional 334 Bitcoin, pushing total holdings to roughly 13,132 BTC, now worth over $1.1 billion at current prices. When smart money stacks during uncertainty, it usually precedes explosive rotations into high conviction crypto picks. That makes this the most important moment to decide what crypto to buy before the wider market catches on. DeepSnitch AI sits directly in that window, offering traders a presale backed by live AI security tools and aggressive bonuses that are drawing serious capital ahead of launch. Corporate Bitcoin accumulation signals the next expansion phase Recent news around Strive ramping up its Bitcoin exposure while cleaning up debt is a classic pre-rally signal. This is what smart money does before the markets rip. Institutions are not chasing candles. They are loading Bitcoin when the price is boring, and the sentiment is quiet, which usually means they are positioning ahead of a bullish expansion phase. Bitcoin remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now for stability and trend confirmation, but let's be real. Stacking BTC alone is not how traders print 300x. Bitcoin is the spark that flips the risk switch. Once confidence returns, capital rotates fast into presales and high conviction crypto picks where the real moonshots live. Best cryptocurrencies to buy right now: DeepSnitch AI, WLD and CC 1. DeepSnitch AI: The answer to every what crypto to buy now poll DeepSnitch AI is the clearest answer to what crypto to buy now for traders hunting 100x to 300x upside. Unlike most presales selling future hopeium, DeepSnitch AI already delivers live AI trading tools that traders are using today. AuditSnitch scans smart contracts before capital is deployed. SnitchScan tracks whale wallets across major blockchains. SnitchFeed delivers breaking crypto news faster than social platforms. SnitchGPT provides trading intelligence using live blockchain data. These tools are already active, which puts DeepSnitch AI in a completely different category from typical presales. The early demand has gone parabolic. Trader interest became so aggressive that the team extended the presale to allow more investors to capture bonuses and learn the tools before launch. Presales rarely delay launches unless demand overwhelms supply. That alone signals how much momentum is building. The bonus structure is what creates the real asymmetric upside. Bonuses scale up to 300%, meaning allocations can literally quadruple before listing. That kind of multiplier is only available before launch. Once the token lists, the opportunity disappears. This is exactly why traders are aggressively positioning early. DeepSnitch AI is audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, reducing contract risk and increasing confidence. It also sits at the intersection of AI utility and meme energy, which historically creates viral adoption when market sentiment flips bullish. Among all presales, DeepSnitch AI is clearly the strongest high conviction crypto pick right now. https://youtu.be/zERhUX4KPOU 2. Worldcoin (WLD) Worldcoin (WLD) is trading near $0.51 on January 29 after pumping over 11.5% in 24 hours, massively outperforming a flat market. The rally was driven by speculation that OpenAI could integrate Worldcoin's Orb technology into a humans-only social network, triggering a 40% intraday spike and an 831% surge in trading volume to $690M. This kind of narrative plus volume expansion is classic early bull behavior. If OpenAI confirms any linkage, WLD could push back toward $0.75 to $1.00 short term. For traders asking what crypto to buy now, WLD stands out among the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now as one of the strongest high-conviction crypto picks and emerging market favorites this cycle. 3. Canton Network (CC) When traders start asking what crypto to buy now, it is usually because capital is rotating beneath the surface, and Canton (CC) fits that setup cleanly. CC is trading around $0.16 on January 29 after gaining 3.15% in the last 24 hours and extending a weekly move of more than 9%, even as the broader market stayed soft. The move followed Bitcoin briefly reclaiming $90,000, which flipped sentiment and pushed money into selected altcoins with strong institutional narratives. Rising volume and bullish momentum are opening a path toward the $1 zone. In this environment, Canton is increasingly viewed among the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now, shaping into one of those high-conviction crypto picks that quietly turn into market favorites once momentum fully kicks in. Conclusion: DeepSnitch crushes competitors with AI utility and bonus multipliers Institutions stacking Bitcoin is a loud signal, even if it looks quiet on the chart. This is confidence building under the hood. This is smart money loading while the market is still hesitating, which is exactly how the strongest runs begin. At the same time, early investors piling into DeepSnitch AI for exponential upside, knowing that once a token goes live, the easy multiples are already off the table. For traders asking what crypto to buy now, this is not about chasing green candles or buying tops. This is about getting in early while conviction is forming and narratives are still underpriced. Don't sleep on DSNT bonus codes before presale ends. Visit the official presale and get real-time updates on Telegram and X. Frequently asked questions What crypto to buy now for maximum upside? What crypto to buy now comes down to early positioning, and DeepSnitch AI offers live tools, audits, bonuses, and real 100x potential in presale with launch coming soon. What are the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now? The best cryptocurrencies to buy right now include DeepSnitch AI since it offers working products, heavy demand, and presale leverage that others lack. What separates DeepSnitch AI from other presales? DeepSnitch AI separates itself by shipping live products, passing audits, and offering bonuses that amplify early positions.

Vitalik Buterin withdrew 16,384 ETH (about $45 million) for funding projects focused on privacy and open technology, emphasizing secure hardware and encrypted messaging. The Ethereum Foundation will adopt a five-year austerity plan to maintain its roadmap while fostering decentralization and user control over data and privacy.

According to reports, Vitalik Buterin has pulled 16,384 ETH from his reserves and plans to spend it on privacy and truly open technology.

That move is paired with a call for five years of thrift at the Ethereum Foundation so the foundation can keep building core software while staying healthy for the long run.

Reports say the funds, worth about $45 million, will back a broad list of projects: open silicon, secure hardware, private messaging, local-first operating systems, and tools that mix zero-knowledge proofs with other privacy tools like FHE and differential privacy.

He has already put money toward encrypted messaging and air quality work, and some new efforts aim to make secure hardware more affordable and verifiable.

The plan covers both pieces of tech and the systems people run on them. Simple apps for daily life are included, not just fancy research.

In these five years, the Ethereum Foundation is entering a period of mild austerity, in order to be able to simultaneously meet two goals:

1. Deliver on an aggressive roadmap that ensures Ethereum's status as a performant and scalable world computer that does not compromise on…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2026

Buterin is taking on what might once have been “special projects” of the foundation. He withdrew the ETH personally, and reports note he is looking at secure, decentralized staking to route future staking rewards into these efforts.

That shifts some financial risk from institutions to an individual who wants those projects to survive even when they are slow or controversial. Some of the initiatives are unlikely to attract fast capital. That is why personal backing matters.

The Foundation is said to be entering a phase of mild austerity so it can meet two clear goals at once: finish an aggressive technical roadmap and remain alive and independent into the far future.

The technical aim is to keep Ethereum fast and scalable without losing decentralization or security. At the same time, the team wants to protect users' ability to control their keys, their data, and their privacy.

Reports note that “Ethereum for people who need it” is the guiding line, rather than chasing large corporate deals that transform how people use the chain.

Gold and silver have recently dominated headlines, outperforming both Bitcoin and altcoins in the broader crypto market. While both precious metals recorded new all-time highs in 2026, many altcoins failed to reach similar milestones. Bitcoin, by contrast, did achieve an ATH in 2025; however, following that peak, its price retraced sharply to new lows. With this in mind, analysts argue that the strength of gold and silver does not pose a threat to digital assets. Instead, they interpret the divergence as a major bullish signal for Bitcoin and altcoins. 

Gold And Silver ATH Signals Bitcoin And Altcoins Upside

Crypto market expert Mark Chadwick delivered a detailed analysis of precious metals and cryptocurrencies on X this week, pointing to what he calls “the biggest price divergence” ever recorded between gold and Bitcoin. His chart and analysis suggest that a strong performance in gold could be a major indicator for a potential rally in cryptocurrencies. 

Chadwick noted that gold has surged aggressively, reaching an ATH of over $5,600 in January 2026. This price rally has pushed the metal into extreme overbought levels on higher timeframes. In contrast, Bitcoin is facing prolonged weakness and negative sentiment in 2026, despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025. 

The analyst suggested that this performance imbalance has reached levels that typically signal a major market shift. Gold and silver have been boosted by factors such as central bank accumulation, inflation hedging, and geopolitical pressures. At the same time, Bitcoin has been weighed down by tighter liquidity, reduced investor interest, and risk-off conditions. As a result, traditional safe-haven assets have entered overbought territory, leaving BTC and altcoins largely overlooked. 

Chadwick argues that markets move in cycles driven by sentiment and positioning. When one asset becomes excessively overbought, returns diminish, and capital seeks higher upside elsewhere. In past macro cycles, periods of strong performance in gold and silver have often been followed by capital rotating into higher-risk assets once fear subsides. 

Based on his analysis, Bitcoin's current positioning reflects exhaustion rather than structural weakness. Chadwick believes that when manipulation ends and capital starts flowing out of gold and silver into BTC, it could set the stage for a sharp rebound in the leading cryptocurrency. Since altcoins typically follow Bitcoin's performance, the analyst expects that once Bitcoin regains momentum, some of that profit could also rotate into select altcoins, fueling a price rally. 

How High Bitcoin And Altcoins Could Rally 

Chadwick has stated that Bitcoin's price could easily surge 10x as capital flows back into it and market sentiment and liquidity improve. However, the chart outlines a short-term rally, projecting a 91.60% rise to $170,000 from the $82,000 region. The analyst also predicted that altcoins could rise 50-100x, reflecting a staggering potential for gains in the crypto market. 

He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that smart money knows massive returns often come from diversification. From this perspective, the current ATHs of gold and silver do not undermine cryptocurrencies but signal an upcoming shift in capital.

That shift was evident in this week's results from Visa and Mastercard, where management teams paired financial performance with disclosures on stablecoin settlement and emerging use cases.

For Visa, the fiscal first quarter brought measurable traction. The company reported an annualized global stablecoin settlement run rate of $4.6 billion and said it now enables stablecoin card issuance in more than 50 countries. Ryan McInerney, Visa's CEO, framed the effort as part of a broader push to connect digital assets to everyday payments.

“Stablecoins have tremendous growth and disruption potential but are still in the very early stages of adoption for payments use cases,” McInerney said during the conference call with analysts. “Visa's goal remains clear: build the secure and seamless interoperable layer between stablecoins and traditional fiat payment at scale across the world.”

Visa outlined several concrete steps taken during the quarter. The company expanded stablecoin settlement with USDC into the United States to improve speed and liquidity for banks and FinTechs, and it launched a global stablecoins advisory practice to help clients with strategy, market entry planning and technology enablement. McInerney said Visa is also piloting Visa Direct stablecoin payouts, allowing U.S. platforms to send funds directly to workers' and users' stablecoin wallets.

Visa management emphasized that these efforts are not substitutive to other parts of the business.

“The stablecoin opportunity remains additive to what Visa is doing today,” McInerney said, pointing to on-ramps and off-ramps, settlement, money movement, consulting and value-added services as parallel growth paths.

Executives also noted they do not expect stablecoins to immediately reshape mature digital payment markets, saying demand today is strongest in regions with constrained access to U.S. dollars and in cross-border scenarios where settlement speed matters most.

Mastercard struck a similar tone on its earnings call, describing stablecoins less as a disruptive replacement and more as another form of currency that benefits from being routed through a trusted global network.

Michael Miebach, Mastercard's CEO, said: “For us, stablecoins and agentic commerce are emerging opportunities, ones where Mastercard has a natural role to play.” He added: “Most use cases for crypto and stablecoin today offer trading and the like. For us, it is another currency we can support within our network.”

Miebach pointed to Mastercard's work enabling stablecoin purchases, facilitating transactions and supporting stablecoin settlement directly on its rails. He underscored why payment networks matter to broader adoption: “Trust, interoperability and global acceptance are key in all payments. That's where we come in,” he told analysts.

During the quarter, Mastercard supported co-brand partners such as MetaMask as they expanded across geographies, worked with Gemini on what Miebach described as the first business-focused stablecoin co-brand and continued to broaden settlement capabilities, including partnerships with Ripple.

Stablecoins are also being woven into the networks' push toward agentic commerce, where artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents initiate transactions on behalf of consumers and businesses. McInerney, for example, described stablecoins and agentic commerce as parallel tracks, both dependent on tokenization and network-level security. Visa is working with more than 100 partners on agentic commerce and is integrating stablecoins into the same infrastructure stack that supports credentials, tokens and real-time payouts.

Both networks tied stablecoins to broader commercial ambitions.

Visa executives highlighted early progress in business payments and money movement, including stablecoin-enabled payouts through Visa Direct.

During the question and answer session with analysts, Visa's McInerney said that “in terms of stablecoins, the areas where we see product market fit are generally the areas around the world with significant TAMs and areas where we're actually underpenetrated today … It's countries around the world where there's high currency volatility or hard to access U.S. dollars … The second area where we are a good product market fit is around cross-border, whether that's remittances, at the consumer level or whether that's B2B payments, or even B2C payments for disbursements.”

That operational momentum is unfolding against a shifting regulatory backdrop.

PYMNTS reported this week that the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced a crypto market structure bill that would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission primary authority over spot digital commodity trading, while securities provisions remain under the Senate Banking Committee's jurisdiction and must be merged into a final package. PYMNTS also reported that the SEC and CFTC have begun aligning on shared data standards and coordinated supervision, signaling a move away from fragmented oversight.

A recently uncovered archaeological site in central China is changing how scientists understand early hominin behavior in East Asia. The discoveries suggest these ancient populations were far more capable and adaptable than previously assumed.

An international research team led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences carried out excavations at Xigou in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region of central China. Their work revealed evidence of advanced stone tool technologies dating from about 160,000 to 72,000 years ago.

The project, co-led by Griffith University, shows that hominins living in this area demonstrated creativity and flexibility during a time when several large-brained hominins lived in China. These included Homo longi and Homo juluensis, and possibly Homo sapiens.

Challenging Old Assumptions About East Asian Technology

"Researchers have argued for decades that while hominins in Africa and western Europe demonstrated significant technological advances, those in East Asia relied on simpler and more conservative stone-tool traditions," said expedition leader Dr. Shixia Yang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP).

Study co-author Professor Michael Petraglia, Director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, added: "The Xigou findings challenge the narrative that early humans in China were conservative over time."

According to the research team, close examination of the artifacts shows that the site's inhabitants used advanced stone toolmaking techniques. These methods produced small flakes and tools that supported a wide range of activities, pointing to complex and versatile behavior.

Earliest Composite Tools Found in East Asia

One of the most remarkable discoveries at Xigou was evidence of hafted stone tools, representing the earliest known composite tools in East Asia. These tools combined stone elements with handles or shafts.

Such designs required careful planning, skilled workmanship, and an understanding of how tool performance could be improved by combining materials. The findings indicate a sophisticated approach to technology rather than simple or static traditions.

Lead author Dr. Jian-Ping Yue of the IVPP said: "Their presence indicates the Xigou hominins possessed a high degree of behavioural flexibility and ingenuity."

A Long Record of Change and Diversity

The archaeological layers at Xigou span approximately 90,000 years, offering a long-term view of technological development. This record aligns with increasing evidence that hominin diversity in China was growing during this period.

Large-brained hominins identified at sites such as Xujiayao and Lingjing, sometimes referred to as Homo juluensis, may provide a biological context for the behavioral complexity seen in the Xigou stone tool collections.

"The technological strategies evident in the stone tools likely played a crucial role in helping hominin populations adapt to the fluctuating environments that characterized the 90,000-year-period in Eastern Asia," Professor Petraglia said.

Rethinking Human Evolution in East Asia

The research team says the discoveries at Xigou are reshaping views of human evolution in East Asia. The findings indicate that early populations in the region had cognitive and technical abilities comparable to those of early humans in Africa and Europe.

Dr. Yang added: "Emerging evidence from Xigou and other sites shows early technologies in China included prepared-core methods, innovative retouched tools, and even large cutting tools, pointing to a richer and more complex technological landscape than previously recognized."

The study 'Technological innovations and hafted technology in central China ~160,000-72,000 years ago' has been published in Nature Communications.

Largest galaxy survey yet confirms that the Universe is not clumpy enough

The six-year results from the Dark Energy Survey highlight unresolved tensions in standard cosmological theory

By Nature magazine 

The Dark Energy Survey observed around 150 million galaxies visible in Earth's southern sky.

Astronomers have released the most ambitious cosmic map assembled so far, confirming that matter in the Universe is less clumpy than standard cosmological theory would predict.

From 2013 to 2019, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) team repeatedly imaged a large section of Earth's southern sky to collect the positions, colours and shapes of around 150 million galaxies. Using a telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the team also detected and studied more than 1,500 supernova explosions of a type that can be used to track the expansion history of the Universe.

The team analysed four different aspects of the data: the brightness and other characteristics of the supernovae; the clustering of galaxies across space and time; the evolving size of remnants of pressure waves generated in the Universe's infancy; and the distortion of images of background galaxies by large concentrations of intervening invisible ‘dark matter'.

A few HN users who did try it gave up / failed for various reasons:- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46822562 (burning too many tokens)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46786628 (ditto + security implication)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762521 (installation failed due to sandboxing)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46831031 (moltbook didn't work)I smell hype in the air...

It's a masterclass in spammy marketing, I wonder if it's actually converting into actual users.

Seems like a Rorschach test. If you think this sort of thing is gonna change the world in a good way: here's evidence of it getting to scale. If you think it's gonna be scams, garbage, and destruction: here's evidence of that.

Actually, hang on... yep, to absolutely nobody's surprise, Simon Willison has also hyped this up on his blog just yesterday. The entire grift gang is here, folks.

First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. Obviously it's not as revolutionary as people are hyping it up to be, but it's a step in the right direction. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own.I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. But it still fills up its context pretty quickly, so you see diminishing returns.I was a skeptic until I actually installed it and messed around with it. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant.I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be.  I like the local files first mentality.  It makes me excited for a time when running local models becomes easier.I should add that it's very buggy.  It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through.

#1) I can chat with the openclaw agent (his name is "Patch") through a telegram chat, and Patch can spawn a shared tmux instance on my 22 core development workstation. 
#2) I can then use the `blink` app on my iphone + tailscale and that allows me to use a command in blink `ssh dev` which connects me via ssh to my dev workstation in my office, from my iphone `blink` app.Meanwhile, my agent "Patch" has provided me a connection command string to use in my blink app, which is a `tmux <string> attach` command that allows me to attach to a SHARED tmux instance with Patch.Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing?Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents.Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances.This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch.This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale. This is AWESOME.

I'd expect that if there is a usable quality of output from these approaches it will get rolled into existing tools similarly, like how multi-agents using worktrees already was.

They run 24/7 on a VPS, share intelligence through a shared file, and coordinate in a Telegram group. Elon built and deployed an app overnight without being asked. Burry paper-traded to 77% win rate before going live.The setup took a weekend. The real work is designing the workflow: which agent owns what, how they communicate, how they learn from corrections. I wake up to a full briefing every morning.It's not AGI. It's not sentient. It's genuinely useful automation with personality. The token cost is real (budget it) but for a solo founder, having 6 tireless employees changes everything

I'd say it's right on the edge of being useful, but given the number of bugs, it's not really that practically useful. It's moreso a glimpse into the future.

I don't have much motivation, because I don't see any use-case. I don't have so many communications I need an assistant to handle them, nor do other online chores (e.g. shopping) take much time, and I wouldn't trust an LLM to follow my preferences (physical chores, like laundry and cleaning, are different). I'm fascinated by what others are doing, but right now don't see any way to contribute nor use it to benefit myself.

1) Installation on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 system was messy. I eventually had codex do it for me.
2) It has a bunch of skills that come packaged with it. The ones I've tried do not work all that well.
3) It murdered my codex quota trying to chase down a bug that resulted from all the renames -- this project has renamed itself twice this week, and every time it does, I assume the refactoring work is LLM-driven. It still winds up looking for CLAWDBOT_* envvars when they're actually being set as OPENCLAW_*, or looking in ~/moltbot/ when actually the files are still in ~/clawdbot.
4) Background agents are cool but sometimes it really doesn't use them when it should, despite me strongly encouraging it to do so. When the main agent works on something, your chat is blocked, so you have no idea what's going on or if it died.
5) And sometimes it DOES die, because you hit a ratelimit or quota limit, or because the software is actually pretty janky.
6) The control panel is a mess. The CLI has a zillion confusing options. It feels like the design and implementation are riddled with vibetumors.
7) It actively lies to me about clearing its context window. This gets expensive fast when dealing with high-end models. (Expensive by my standards anyway. I keep seeing these people saying they're spending $1000s a month on LLM tokens :O)
8) I am NOT impressed with Kimi-K2.5 on this thing. It keeps hanging on tool use -- it hallucinates commands and gets syntax wrong very frequently, and this causes the process to outright hang.
9) I'm also not impressed with doing research on it. It gets confused easily, and it can't really stick to a coherent organizational strategy over iterations.I'm having it do some stuff for me right now. In principle, I like that I can have a chat window where I can tell an AI to do pretty unstructured tasks. I like the idea of it maintaining context over multiple sessions and adapting to some of my expectations and habits. I guess mostly, I'm looking at it like:1) the chat metaphor gave me a convenient interface to do big-picture interactions with an LLM from anywhere;
2) the terminal agents gave the LLMs rich local tool and data use, so I could turn them loose on projects;
3) this feels like it's giving me a chat metaphor, in a real chat app, with the ability for it to asynchronously check on stuff, and use local stuff.I think that's pretty neat and the way this should go. I think this project is WAY too move-fast-and-break-things. It seems like it started as a lark, got unexpected fame, attracted a lot of the wrong kinds of attention, and I think it'll be tough for it to turn into something mature. More likely, I think this is a good icebreaker for an important conversation about what the primetime version of this looks like.

Note that nothing about that depends on it being a local or remote model, it was just less of a concern for local models in the past because most of them did not have tool calling. OpenClaw, for all the cool and flashy uses, is also basically an infinite generator for lethal trifecta problems because its whole pitch is combining your data with tools that can both read and write from the public internet.

It also BURNS through tokens like mad, because it has essentially no restrictions or guardrails and will actually implement baroque little scripts to do whatever you ask without any real care as to the consequences.. I can do a lot more with just gpt-5-mini or mistral for much less money.The only "good" think about it is the Reddit-like skills library that is growing insanely.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: We hit the road for a driving tour of the week's news, making stops at Starbucks, Microsoft, and an Amazon Fresh store in its final days.

First up, Starbucks reports its first U.S. transaction growth in about two years — and announces plans for an AI “ordering companion” that translates cravings and concepts into custom drinks. We taste test a TikTok trend the old-fashioned way, ordering a “banana bread latte” at the drive-through.

Then we swing by the Microsoft campus after the company beat quarterly earnings expectations but saw its stock drop 12% in a single day. One of the reasons: investor concerns about the company's exposure to OpenAI, which now accounts for roughly 45% of Microsoft's contracted future cloud revenue.

Finally, Amazon is closing all of its Fresh grocery stores and Go convenience stores in the U.S., exiting its homegrown retail formats entirely. We visit a Seattle location during its clearance sale, and find a long line at a store whose original promise was no lines at all.

When Gino Palileo moved to Seattle from the Philippines in 2015, his first job in his new city was at an ice cream shop at the waterfront ferry terminal. Watching the green and white ferries crisscross Elliott Bay was the beginning of a lasting appreciation for vessels.

“When I started high school, we would go camping a lot, so we would take the ferries,” Palileo told GeekWire. “We'd maybe do two or three trips every year.”

When Palileo started college to study architecture, he got a 3D printer to help with designing and modeling. Now an architect splitting his time between Seattle and New York, he's stuck with 3D printing as a hobby — and this week he showed off a new passion project.

In a post on Reddit, Palileo shared images of prints he made of Washington State Ferries. The 1:400 scale models are rather intricate replicas of Olympic-Class vessels from the state's fleet: the M/V Chimacum, M/V Samish, M/V Suquamish and M/V Tokitae.

Palileo created his designs from scratch in Rhino 3D modeling software and then printed the ferry models — measuring about 9.8-inches in length — on a Prusa MK4S printer. The designs are available on his page on Prusa's Printables marketplace. 

The models feature the various ferry decks, railings, seating and more infrastructure. He might print little cars and trucks, or people.

“I'm very fond of these ferries; they're always fun to be on,” Palileo (@GP_3D) said in his Reddit post. “They all have beautiful names that honor tribes, peoples, and locations indigenous to the Puget Sound area.”

Commenters on Reddit demonstrated that the love is strong for ferries in the Seattle region — and for Palileo's craftsmanship:

A self-professed transit geek, Palileo said he has plans for other Seattle-related designs and prints. He might do the Monorail or maybe a Link light rail train. And he likes the Virginia V steamship moored at South Lake Union.

And when it comes to revisiting ferries, he's been eyeing a classic.

“I was thinking of maybe an older ferry — the Kalakala?” Palileo said. “It is a little bit more complicated than I thought so I went with the modern ones for now. But I do want to do that one and have a nice silver color for it.”

A few years ago, Selina Tobaccowala's daughter started leaving post-it notes around the house, telling everyone to “turn off the lights” and such.

Tobaccowala had just sold her last startup, Gixo, to OpenFit and was looking for a new challenge. “I saw the kids and thought, ‘Let me see if there's something there on the sustainability and climate side,'” she told TechCrunch. “There had to be something more than like turning our lights off.”

Without a background in climate science or hardware engineering, she wasn't sure where to start. So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys. 

“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey. 

What she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills. 

“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,'” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”

Tobaccowala co-founded HomeBoost to help people conduct their own home energy assessments. The company was part of the Startup Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.

HomeBoost's assessment process begins by mailing customers a BoostBox, a small kit that includes an infrared camera, a blacklight and a link to an app that takes customers through the process. As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.

Using data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report which suggests the most cost effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives. 

In many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users' energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people's homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said. 

“We talked to a bunch of consumers who'd gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,'” she said.

The HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.

HomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.

But not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.

The company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it's another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.

By bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It's a very unique situation where everybody's aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.

Project Genie can AI-generate "games" capped at 720p and 24 FPS.

Yesterday, Google announced Project Genie, a new generative AI tool that can apparently create entire games from just prompts. It leverages the Genie 3 and Gemini models to generate a 60-second interactive world rather than a fully playable one. Despite this, many investors were scared out of their wits, imagining this as the future of game development, resulting in a massive stock sell-off that has sent the share prices of various video game companies plummeting.

The firms affected by this include Rockstar owner Take-Two Interactive, developer/distributors like CD Projekt Red and Nintendo, along with even Roblox — that one actually makes sense. Most of the games you find on the platform, including the infamous "Steal a Brainrot," are not too far from AI slop, so it's poetic that the product of a neural network is what hurt its stock.

Unity's share price fell the most at 20%, since it's a popular game engine. Generally speaking, that's how most games operate: they use a software framework, such as Unity or Unreal Engine, which provides basic functionality like physics, rendering, input, and sound. Studios then build their vision on top of these, and some developers even have their own custom in-house solutions, such as Rockstar's RAGE or Guerrilla's Decima.

 




Project Genie evades all that and handles these building blocks itself, but remember that it doesn't actually build games, per se. When you ask it to make a clone of Super Mario 64, it will dupe it rather impressively, but all you get is basic movement with a free camera that can look around the map. There are no objectives, and the AI often forgets what it has already generated when filling in gaps.

Roads in these questionably-generated games would often have patches of grass in between, as if the model thought it was supposed to generate something else for a bit before swiftly recovering. This hallucinating behavior signifies the prototype nature of the tech, and Google has said Project Genie is an experimental tool for now, meant to help with things like previz for large games.

That ties into the issue with game development these days: how bloated some productions can get with insane budgets and lead times, yet still somehow end up delivering an underwhelming product. Tools like Project Genie could genuinely help here, saving developers time they'd otherwise spend in the early stages of the game, before level design is locked in.

But in that way, AI is the solution to an artificial problem that should've been solved without it; for all that matters, devs could still find a way to balloon productions out of control even with Project Genie and a hundred other generative AI models at the helm. Of course, instead of having that concern, investors are clearly more hopeful for an AI-assisted future, given the resulting stock market shenanigans.

Thanks to Meta, everyone wants a piece of the AI glasses pie. While Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses aren't quite at iPhone levels of popularity, they've sold a lot more pairs than most were expecting, and as a result, competitors are cropping up left and right.

No, really, smart glasses competition is getting serious: In the pipeline are forthcoming entrants from Google, Samsung, and maybe (just maybe) Apple. Needless to say, when (or if) those competitors enter the chat, Meta is going to have its work cut out for it. In the meantime, there are other options, and some of them have come surprisingly close to challenging Meta already.

I've tried quite a few last year, but for me, Rokid's latest pair, the $299 AI Glasses Style, might be the closest to giving Meta's Ray-Bans a run for their money so far.

Rokid AI Glasses Style

The AI Glasses Style have solid AI feature, look decent, and offer a viable alternative to Meta's Ray-Bans.

Pros

Cons

So here's the deal: the Rokid AI Glasses Style, despite their word-garbled name, are nicer than I expected, though I have some serious gripes about how they're being marketed.

One of the things that immediately drew my attention to these display-less smart glasses was the weight. Rokid's AI Glasses Style are advertised as weighing just north of 38g, which is notably less than the Ray-Ban Meta AI Gen 2 glasses. Meta's smart glasses weigh between 48g and 50g, for context. Lighter smart glasses? Hell yeah.

There's just one problem: that weight difference actually has a gigantic caveat. As I learned upon using them, the AI Glasses Style weigh 38.5g without the lenses. I bothered to weigh them myself at home, and they actually clock in at 45g, which is just 3g lighter than the lightest pair of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Womp, womp.

Why Rokid chose to list its smart glasses' weight without the lenses is beyond me (I think I know why, though), but I was aggravated to learn that the figure was a stretch of the truth. That's like listing a backpack's weight without the straps or a phone's weight without the chassis. It doesn't make sense since you're never, under any circumstance, going to be using your smart glasses without the lenses in them.

Weight makes a difference, too. A difference of 10g (which is actually only 3 to 5g) may not look like a lot on paper, but it makes a difference on your face, where gadgets can turn uncomfortable fast. That brings me to my next point of comparison: despite the small difference in weight, the AI Glasses Style don't feel nearly as comfortable as the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.

For me, that's mostly because of the frame. While Rokid's AI Glasses Style may look like a Ray-Ban dupe, they don't always feel like one after longer periods of wear. The bridge really took a toll on my nose after a while, and having worn Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses for hours upon hours collectively, I can't say that I felt the same fatigue wearing them.

That's partially because I have a big nose, but also because of a difference in design. While Rokid opts for a bridge with nose pads (presumably for a tighter fit), the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are smooth. Even just running your finger through the bridge of both, Rokid's smart glasses feel a lot more angular than the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. The actual frame design is where I feel the lack of EssilorLuxottica (the maker of Ray-Bans) the most, and while glasses are a specific thing to each person that wears them, the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses still have my vote in terms of comfort.

In appearance, Rokid's look fairly similar to Meta's, which is to say, like a Ray-Ban knockoff. That's not a bad thing, necessarily—EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban frames are iconic and popular for a reason. That reason is they fit well on lots of head shapes, they look generally stylish, but not obnoxious, and they mesh with lots of different styles of clothing.

Personally, I think the AI Glasses Style look pretty alright, but your take may vary. The frames, I've noticed, are a little wider than the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which isn't ideal for me since I don't have a particularly wide face, but they may look better on your head. The plastic is a bit cheap-feeling, but I've never been a shiny plastic kind of guy. I still prefer the matte option of the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.

Like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, you get almost the exact same set of tap and swipe controls on the glasses arm. One tap on the arm for things like play/pause, two taps for things like skipping songs, three taps to go back, and a tap and hold to launch the voice assistant. Swiping forward or backward controls volume. Nothing groundbreaking here, but they work as well as they should, though the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses might be a tad more sensitive.

One thing I do love about Rokid's AI Glasses Style is that they have loads of lens options. You can get prescription lenses, progressive lenses, polarized lenses, transition lenses, blue light-blocking lenses, or just regular tinted lenses like the pair. tried. Rokid has Meta beat here for sure.

Overall, the AI Glasses Style look similar, but feel a little worse than the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. You should be wary of deceptive marketing, too. These smart glasses are not significantly lighter than Meta's.

All of that said, these are smart glasses, and the smart part is where Rokid really competes.

Rokid's glasses don't just look like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses; they're also intended to be used in similar ways. One of the first things people will associate smart glasses with right now is audio, video, and pictures, so let's get into that first.

The Rokid AI Glasses Style have a 12-megapixel Sony IMX681 sensor, which shoots at a max resolution of 3,024 x 4,032 pixels for still photos, and videos at a 3K resolution. One difference between Meta here is that Rokid, with its companion app, allows you to shoot photos and videos in quite a few ratios (9:16, 3:4, and 4:3) to fit a number of different scenarios, including posting straight to social media.

I shot with the AI Glasses Style for a week, and they do a fairly decent job. Photos were fairly sharp for smart glasses, and comparable to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (they both use a 12-megapixel Sony sensor, so no surprise here). While I wouldn't want to do any professional photography with this camera, it's serviceable for snapping stuff on the fly. Surprisingly, despite the higher resolution of Rokid's sensor, I still prefer the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses' photos, maybe because of the difference in image processing. It's hard to put my finger on why, but I find Meta's version of slightly soft-looking photos more appealing. Here's a comparison: on the left is Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses and on the right is Rokid's AI Glasses Style.

Video is also solid and comparable quality-wise to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, with both topping out with a 3K resolution at 30 frames per second. Rokid gets the point here because its smart glasses can record up to a maximum of 10 freaking minutes as opposed to Ray-Ban Meta's AI glasses that top out at 3 minutes. I found this out by accidentally recording a 5-minute video after I tried and failed to use the voice assistant to stop recording. A happy bug, I guess?

Either way, if you're going to use the AI Glasses Style for action sports, or capturing video while riding your bike, or anything where you want to record for longer periods, that 10-minute recording limit is kind of great, especially with the option to shoot natively in different aspect ratios. Which pair of glasses you like for shooting pictures and videos may depend on your preference for image processing like me, but there's no denying that the AI Glasses Style blow Ray-Bans out of the water in terms of recording length.

It's worth noting here that, like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, there's an LED light that turns on when you're recording or taking a picture to let people know you've captured something. Whether anyone notices the light or knows what it means is another question entirely, but it's there at least.

Those videos wouldn't be complete without audio, and Rokid is also competitive in that arena. One of the best uses of smart glasses is as an open-ear audio product, so audio is more important than you might think on the surface, and Rokid's AI Glasses Style seem to understand that. I was pleased with the quality of sound coming from Rokid's new smart glasses as well as the volume.

I put these smart glasses through the same gauntlet as every audio product that I test, including using them on the New York subway, and they performed well. Sound is fairly clear, though a little more tinny-sounding than Meta's glasses, and the volume was loud enough, though I couldn't hear it as well as Meta's glasses (maybe Meta's glasses are more directional). I still think Meta takes this category, but Rokid doesn't leave the fight without landing some punches.

One thing I'll give Rokid here is its inclusion of more than one audio mode—one for general music listening and one for podcasts that EQs the sound to accentuate voices. I personally love the podcast setting since it does make voices more audible. I still wouldn't want to use the AI Glasses Style on a loud subway, but you could say that for pretty much any open-ear audio product. It's a nice flourish, and one that I'm going to assume Meta will look to replicate in the future.

As decent as the audio sounds, I have some notes on calling. I did 10 minutes of calling cumulatively with multiple people, and all of them could hear themselves on the call to a disruptive degree. I'm pretty sure that's because the microphones on the AI Glasses Style are picking up what the speakers are putting out because when I turned the volume down, the problem went away. For the record, I've had no such issue on the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, so I'm pretty sure this issue is solvable with software. If you're big on taking calls with smart glasses like I am, you may want to wait on using the AI Glasses Style for now.

The AI Glasses Style don't break the mold entirely when it comes to display-less smart glasses, but they do come with a few things that I wish Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses had.

One of those things is navigation. Unlike the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, you can use the AI Glasses Style to get walking, biking, or driving directions to locations, all by using the onboard voice assistant. It's kind of great. By saying “Hi Rokid, give me walking directions to the Brooklyn Museum,” the glasses start the navigation and give you turn-by-turn directions in your ear. If you pull open the companion app, you can also tap open a screen with a map to follow along. So many times while biking, I wished that Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses could launch navigation, so it's nice to see Rokid making that wish a reality.

Like other smart glasses, you can use AI translation, and there's a twist here, too. While most smart glasses are reliant on an internet connection to translate speech, Rokid's AI Glasses style come with a downloadable local model that allows you to load six different languages onto the glasses for offline translation. Those languages are English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and simplified Chinese. I tested the local translation by listening to a YouTube video in French, and the results were not bad.

The AI Glasses Style have similar problems to other AI models (translation can be a bit literal and doesn't always get sentence construction right), but it performed its duty better than I expected. I will say, however, that the local translation mode was a bit slow, so if you're using this feature in the real world, you may have to ask the person you're speaking with to slow down. Using online translation with Alibaba's Qwen AI model was much, much, faster for me (impressively so), but that will depend on your internet connection, obviously.

Like other smart glasses, the AI Glasses Style will convert speech into a translated voice on the speakers, but also gives you an option to convert your speech, which is displayed in text on the companion app. To use this “DuoTalk” feature, as Rokid calls it, you'll need to be online. I tested it by translating my speech into German, and it was equally as snappy as the other singular translation mode. Another nice touch on the translation front is the ability to direct your microphone to hear someone in front of you, or a 360-degree hearing mode to capture ambient noise. I'm going to assume most people will want to hear one person at a time, but maybe the 360-degree mode could be good for groups? Either way, the option is interesting.

In addition to translation and navigation, there are your usual smart glasses features like calling, though I wasn't able to get Rokid's companion app to recognize my contacts despite enabling permissions in iOS. There are also reminders, which work fine—I set a reminder to go grocery shopping and a voice popped up on time to remind me after I set it. Lastly, there's a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and then use the companion app to generate a summary or word-for-word transcription. This feature also worked fairly well and was able to capture audio in a quiet room and transcribe it accurately.

Like the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, there's also computer vision that you can use for stuff like image-based translation. I'd say there's parity here between Meta and Rokid. While Rokid's AI was able to translate some stuff from a Japanese poster I pulled up online, it couldn't read some of the smaller text. I don't find this to be a particularly important battleground for smart glasses, though, if I'm being honest, since the use case feels a little niche.

If there's a bright spot that I was hoping for software-wise, it's in the voice assistant department and Rokid did an admirable job here, too. The last time I used a pair of Rokid smart glasses, they failed to recognize my “Hey, Rokid” wake command over and over, but the company seems to have fixed that this time around. Using the voice assistant on the AI Glasses Style is snappy and pretty efficient. It doesn't get everything right all of the time, but it's definitely less sloppy than Meta AI.

I do have one problem with Rokid's voice assistant, and that's its tendency to shut down the microphone too early. If you're asking Rokid's AI something, I would suggest getting the whole thing out in one fell swoop, since it seemingly gets bored with your yammering quickly.

One thing that any person willing to wear smart glasses all the time seeks is battery life, and Rokid's AI Glasses Style push the envelope here. The AI Glasses Style claim a 12-hour battery life, which I was skeptical of at first, but after using the smart glasses for a week, I think Rokid may actually have achieved it. As of writing these words, I've had the AI Glasses Style on for several hours with intermittent use and have only seen a 15% dip in battery.

Obviously, the battery will depend on what you're doing. Rokid lists its battery life as a “typical use,” which is a gray area, and if you're constantly playing music on the AI Glasses Style, I would expect a lot less. Still, if you're listening sometimes, taking short calls, and using them incrementally throughout the day, you may manage to squeeze 12 hours out of the AI Glasses Style. For reference, the Meta Ray-Ban AI Glasses Gen 2 advertise a maximum of 8 hours of battery, so four more hours is nothing to scoff at.

Speaking of battery, one thing that I wish Rokid included was a charging case. With the purchase of the AI Glasses Style, all you get is a regular case. If you want one that charges, you'll have to spend an additional $99. To charge the smart glasses without a charging case, you'll need to use the included magnetic contact charger (a small dongle) that connects to USB-C and then clips onto the side of the glasses. I don't love the idea of having to rely on a cheap, glasses-specific dongle for charging (what if you lose it or it frays?), but that's what you'll get from Rokid in the standard purchase.

One last thing to be aware of: I did have some Bluetooth issues with the AI Glasses Style, which caused them to disconnect abruptly, though after I downloaded an OTA update, there haven't been any problems. Still, it's worth mentioning since other smart glasses I've tested, like the Even Realities Even G2 glasses, have had persistent problems with that sort of thing.

As I mentioned previously, I was surprised at how functional Rokid's AI glasses Style really are. They look decent, the AI features are functional and sometimes a cut above those offered by Meta, and audio, video, and picture are all competitive.

Whether these are the smart glasses for you will depend on what you want out of a pair. If you're looking for the most comfortable and sleekest look, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 AI glasses still win in my opinion, but if you're in it for the AI then the AI Glasses Style might be the better option.

If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that Rokid is competition, and while it probably won't unseat Meta from its pedestal any time soon, it goes to show you just how heated things are about to get. If Rokid can give Meta a scare, just imagine what Google or Samsung could do.

There's always a new vacuum to try. My office always has a new cordless stick vacuum next to my desk, waiting for me to test it and compare it to the competition.

The latest in the wings? Bosch's new vacuum featured at this year's CES. The Bosch Unlimited 10 ($699) stands out for incorporating two features from two popular vacuum brands: Dyson and Shark. The Unlimited 10 can fold in the middle of the long stick that connects the head to the motor, as a Shark PowerDetect can, and it has a compression lever for the dustbin to compress debris, like the new Dyson Piston Animal will when it launches this year. The Bosch also offers six power levels, with three specialty levels (quiet, car, and delicate carpet) on top of the classic automatic, eco, and turbo levels we see on the Shark and Dyson.

With the new vacuum in my home, along with a Shark PowerDetect ($300) and Dyson Gen5 Detect ($922), it was the perfect opportunity to see if the new Bosch can stand up to the competition. While the Dyson Gen5 Detect doesn't have the compression bin, I was curious how the Bosch would compare, given it has a price tag closer to a Dyson. Could this be the new leader of the cordless stick vacuum pack?

Ultimately, Bosch trailed both Dyson and Shark in most challenges, and I was frustrated to see it dump debris three times during the tests. Here's how each of my tests went and which vacuum pulled ahead.

I have a small black rug I use for my debris testing. For each vacuum, I poured a small amount of sand across it and tested how well the vacuum sucked it up. I was surprised that Shark was the only one that didn't respond to the sand by throwing it everywhere while trying to vacuum it up. Both Bosch and Dyson had this issue. Bosch picked up a lot of sand, but also blew sand pretty evenly all over the rug and dumped some of it back on the floor after I turned the vacuum off. It did the same thing on my stair test when I used it on a stair that my son's sandy feet had been on. Meanwhile, the air moving around the Dyson Gen5 Detect pushed it around, and even though the vacuum has tight suction, I had to go over the small rug multiple times and still didn't get all of it.

Meanwhile, the Shark PowerDetect has nice suction and a really smooth glide over carpet (though the increased power and glide feel like they're pulling you forward), which made it easy to sweep the rug and get almost all the sand in one go without sending it everywhere.

I really thought the Dyson would do better in this test, but its tight suction actually ground up the cereal flakes and made a little more of a mess than it cleaned. I used only the Dyson Motorbar head for this test, but I think switching to the Fluffy Optic head, which is designed for hard floors, would have been a better choice for debris like this. The Gen5 Detect comes with both heads, so you can choose the option that best suits the situation. Bosch's Unlimited 10 did much better at picking up cereal than it did sand. My only issue was that as soon as I was done, it dumped some of the cereal (and the sand from earlier) back out onto the rug when I switched it off.

Once again, Shark was the standout, easily vacuuming up the cereal and leaving no debris behind. Shark's carpet mode adds a zing to the power that feels a little like a puppy running away from you, but it did well at gathering the cereal and other debris on my living room rug when I tried it there later that day.

If you're a pet owner like I am, nothing really does it like a Dyson, especially the Gen5 Detect. It's our top pick for vacuuming pet hair for a reason, and I especially like it for deep-cleaning high-traffic carpet spots like stairs. I have two staircases in my house, and I used each vacuum on one half of it. Dyson pulled up much more gray cat hair and dusty debris from my stairs than the other two vacuums.

The other two did fine, but I could feel the spray of sand on my feet when I used the Bosch on a lower stair, where my son's sandy feet had been. (I used the Shark on the one above it and didn't get the same sensation.) The Bosch also got confused whenever I lifted it between stairs, causing it to frequently switch to hard-floor mode.

Bosch pulls ahead of its competitors in one area: It has more cleaning modes. While the Dyson and Shark have the classic trio of power levels (both have an Auto and Eco mode, and Dyson calls its more powerful mode Boost while Shark and Bosch call it Turbo), Bosch comes with three more options. There's a car mode, delicate carpet mode, and silent mode. Use the buttons below the power button to toggle between menu options on the colorful screen. The two buttons below are either to confirm (the checkmark button) or to go back (the curved arrow button). And while it isn't a different mode, Bosch also reacts when you switch between flooring types. It raised the power level for carpet and rugs, and lowered it when switched to hard floors. The screen also showed me when it toggled between these. It didn't do a perfect job, though; it read carpet that was more matted down from walking as hard floors, and didn't switch between flooring types as quickly as the Shark does.

The extra modes also don't feel hugely different. Silent is still noisy, and delicate carpet mode didn't seem to change anything. It's also a little slow to navigate to and switch between the modes. But if you'd like more vacuum modes than the classic trio, the Bosch offers them.

Bosch has the compression feature we'll see on Dyson's upcoming vacuums, but the current Gen5 Detect I'm testing doesn't have it. Neither does the Shark.

There's a lever on the back for this compression mechanism that you manually press down and a separate button to open the dustbin at the bottom. You can use the compression lever when it's both closed and open. It did help compress the hair and dust while I was vacuuming, helping me see if I had really filled the bin, though at a certain point it doesn't compress much more. It was helpful to push debris out if needed too, versus the times I've had to stick my hand in both the Dyson and Shark to get the stuck hair and dust out. Dyson has this same feature on the Piston Animal V16, which is due out this year, so I'll be curious to see which mechanism is better engineered.

If you're looking for a vacuum that can bend to reach under furniture, I prefer the Shark to the Bosch. Both have a similar mechanism and feel, but the Bosch tended to push debris around when I was using it with an active bend, while the Shark managed to vacuum up debris I couldn't get with the Bosch without lifting it and placing it on top of that particular debris (in this case, rogue cat kibble).

Dyson pulls ahead because the Dyson Gen5 Detect comes with three attachments and two heads. You'll get a Motorbar head, a Fluffy Optic head, a hair tool, a combination tool, and a dusting and crevice tool that's actually built into the stick tube. I love that it's built into the vacuum so that it's one less separate attachment to carry around, and it makes me more likely to use it.

But Bosch does well in this area, too. You'll get an upholstery nozzle, a furniture brush, and a crevice nozzle. It's one more attachment than you'll get with Shark, and Bosch also includes a wall mount that you can wire the charging cord into for storage and charging, and you can mount two attachments on it. But I will say, I like that Shark includes a simple tote bag to store the attachments in. The rest of my attachments are in plastic bags for each vacuum, and keeping track of attachments is the most annoying part of a cordless vacuum.

All three of these vacuums have a good build quality, but each one feels like it focuses on something different. Bosch feels the lightest of the three and stands up the easiest on its own, but all three do need something to lean against to stay upright. The Dyson is the worst at this; it also needs a ledge or table wedged under the canister, or it'll roll forward and tip over. The Bosch has a sleek black look and a colorful LED screen that will show you a picture of carpet or hardwood depending on what mode it's vacuuming in. The vacuum head itself feels like the lightest plastic of the bunch, though.

Dyson and Shark have a similar look and feel, with a silvery-gray design and pops of purple. Dyson feels a little more high-end, while Shark feels more utilitarian. You'll also get the bendable stick with the Shark or Bosch, but not with the Dyson. Dyson and Shark both have minimalist screens that show the power level and remaining battery life, though they're not as colorful as Bosch's.

None really has a bad quality. I wish I could say one was designed well enough to stand up freely, but I can't say that for any of these three. I'd mount the wall stands that come with each to safely store them between uses.

If you're looking for the best value for features and a single-head vacuum that can handle both carpet, rugs, and hard floors, the Shark PowerDetect cordless vacuum is the way to go. It's usually on sale for around $300, and the folding stick makes it really easy to vacuum underneath couches, side tables, barstools, and the like without having to crouch on the ground. It did the best in the general floor debris pickup if you're looking for something that will make your broom obsolete.

If you have more carpet than rugs and hard floors, and if you have pets, I'd recommend the Dyson Gen5 Detect. I'd switch to the Fluffy Optic head for hard debris, but the Motorbar does a fantastic job of pulling dust and hair out of carpet. It's just a little too strong for lightweight rugs if you mostly have a rug household.

Bosch

Bosch

The Bosch isn't a bad vacuum, save for the occasional debris dumping. It has more cleaning modes than the others, though I think you'll mainly use the standard three (Eco, Auto, and Turbo) that you can easily toggle between. This vacuum dumped debris on my floor three different times during my testing, which isn't a great sign for the future. You're better off spending less on a Shark PowerDetect or upgrading to a Dyson.

Looking for a do-anything SSD that won't break the bank? That's becoming an increasingly difficult ask, but Biwin has proven itself to be up to the task with drives like the Black Opal NV7400. This is a solid performer that runs cool in a sleek single-sided package. It would be great for your laptop, desktop, or PS5, and since it's available up to 4TB, you don't have to compromise on capacity. With SSD pricing and availability becoming so volatile, having another arrow in the quiver – that is, another SSD that'll work in a pinch – is not something to lightly dismiss, and Biwin has positioned this one well.

We're working with a DRAM-less drive that has a good controller paired with good flash, even if it's a different combination than what we normally see. The good news is, we found no real issues with the drive in any of our tests. We do have concerns about pricing and availability – the 4TB SKU in particular will set you back quite a bit – but that's more about timing than anything else. Under normal conditions, this would be a good drive with no hidden gotchas, so it is a good pickup if you catch a sale or need a drive at the last minute.

The Biwin Black Opal NV7400, or NV7400 for short, supports a wide range of capacities from 512GB to 4TB. At the time of review, pricing was at $146.99, $258.99, and $420.99 for the three largest, but availability is spotty. It's not too disappointing that the 512GB SKU is unavailable, as it's slower, and 1TB+ is a more popular target. Prices right now are obscene, so it's becoming more difficult to gauge them, but these are within the ballpark of what you should expect to pay for comparable hardware. As it stands, there are better deals to be had at all three available capacities, but prices are in constant flux, so do your due diligence.

The drive can hit up to 7,450 / 6,500 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,000K / 900K random read and write IOPS. These are good but not exceptional numbers. It's a good place to be for a PCIe 4.0 drive, and you don't have to worry about it being underwhelming. The drive has a robust 1000TBW, or 1PBW, of warrantied writes per TB of capacity and is covered for five years. This is excellent write endurance, and if you're someone who pays attention to that, make a note of this drive.

Biwin's software platform is known as Biwin Intelligence, and it's designed to work with a range of memory products: internal and external SSDs, mini SSDs, and CFexpress cards. It supports multiple functions, including S.M.A.R.T. reading, error scanning, performance testing, data backup, drive cloning, firmware updating, secure erasing, and the conveyance of drive and system information. This all-in-one SSD toolbox tackles everything you want for an SSD, and that could be a selling point if you don't feel like meddling around with other free or paid software applications.

The NV7400 is a single-sided drive at all capacities, which is a good thing in our book. Single-sided drives have wider compatibility and are usually easier to cool. Some of Biwin's past partners, such as Acer and HP, also use graphene labels to help spread heat, which works well in this configuration. It's at least sufficient when the drive is not going to get ridiculously hot.

As we can tell from the label, this drive is designed for up to 3.3V/2.0A, which translates to under 7W. This matches the highest power state, which is pegged at 6.50W, compared to some high-end PCIe 5.0 drives that can get up to 11.5W. This is pretty reasonable, and the drive should operate fine without a heatsink.

The NV7400 is using the Maxio MAP1602 SSD controller, which we've seen dozens of times. The four-channel, DRAM-less controller is powerful and power-efficient. The Lexar NM790 is probably the model for this controller, as it remains a very popular budget drive at capacities up to 4TB. Most commonly, this controller is paired with 232-Layer TLC flash from YMTC, but QLC also pairs well with it in drives like the HP FX700 and TeamGroup MP44Q. In this case, though, we're looking at Micron flash, which is more unusual. Generally, this flash is interchangeable with the YMTC of the same layer count, and many of the drives we've tested in the past could show up with the Micron flash instead, but this is the first time we're reviewing this combination.

The NAND flash packages are labeled BW29F4T08EMLCHQM. Whenever you see “29” in a flash string, you can be sure it's something from Intel or Micron from back in the IMFT joint venture days, as this code designates the manufacturer. The rest of the string decodes as “F” for flash, “4T” for 4Tb or 512GB packages, “08” for 8-bit flash, “EM” for TLC flash at four dies per package, “LC” for voltage and B58R, with “HQM” telling us the flash speed and package form factor. Look for our TeamGroup NV5000 review to see a similar breakdown on the Intel side of things.

It's likely that the most interesting thing about this string for you is the fact that it indicates TLC flash, which is always preferred over QLC. We've dug into both 232-Layer Micron and YMTC flash many times in the past, and this review will give us a chance to see how the two products line up when each is paired with the MAP1602 controller.

Sandisk SSD price explosion


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Sandisk, renowned for producing some of the market's best SSDs, has substantially increased prices across its SSD portfolio in early 2026. In fact, some of the company's SSDs cost almost three times more than their normal MSRP.

Sandisk, like other SSD manufacturers, has adjusted its SSD pricing to align with current market volatility. Our SSD price tracker, which monitors SSD pricing trends across U.S. retailers, shows that Sandisk raised SSD prices this month. The distressing price hikes are now live on Sandisk's official online store, where we can see firsthand the steep manufacturer markups. The price adjustment targets not only the premium drives but also the entire portfolio, making it a comprehensive price restructuring.

The flagship WD Black SN8100 series shows staggering price increases of up to 2.5X above their original MSRP. The newly added 8TB variant now commands an eye-watering price tag exceeding $2,500. Before the NAND shortage crisis, you could build a high-end gaming system with a Core Ultra 9 or Ryzen 9 chip and a GeForce RTX 5080 with that kind of money.

Despite announcing the rebranding of Western Digital's SSDs to the new Optimus moniker, Sandisk continues to use the previous branding in the meantime, likely to clear any remaining inventory. The Optimus drives are unavailable on Sandisk's webstore, although the company has projected an early 2026 release. Pricing for these Optimus SSDs is not yet available; therefore, the price increases apply to the existing WD Black and WD Blue lineups.

The price surges don't stop at the top end. Rising prices are trickling down to Sandisk's entire SSD product stack. The WD Black SN7100 series has increased in price by 2.1X to 2.9X, depending on capacity. The more budget-oriented WD Blue SN5100 series shows from 2X up to 2.8X higher prices in comparison to the original MSRPs.

Sandisk recently reported stellar Q2 2025 results, with revenue of $3.03 billion, an impressive 61% year-over-year increase, and surpassing the $2.69 billion forecast. The company's edge business was the highest earner, generating $1.678 billion in revenue, while consumer and data center generated respectable figures of $907 million and $440 million, respectively.

The ongoing data center expansion, fueled by the AI boom, has created exceptionally high demand for memory, and chipmakers are prioritizing enterprise products over consumer products. Sandisk is among the handful of companies benefiting from the shortage, with its data center business seeing a very healthy 64% growth. It's easy to see why consumer drives are affected in the current market.

All indications are that the NAND shortage will persist through 2026. Many manufacturers are expanding production capacity, but that takes time to materialize. The AI revolution shows no signs of slowing, so SSD prices may rise further before they stabilize. Sandisk SSDs may now sell for almost 3X what they did a few months ago, and that price is likely to increase further as the year progresses.

A homerun in data transfer, but not the good kind.

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become an unfortunate routine part of the modern internet, with botnets of compromised devices spreading ever wider. Unfortunately, the scale and frequency of those attacks have also been rising. The Aisuru-Kimwolf botnet recently smashed its previous record, hitting 31.4 Tb/s in December. To put it into perspective, that's bandwidth enough to stream nearly 2.2 million Netflix 4K movies at once.

An attack of that dimension is enough to easily knock many internet service providers offline, if not entire countries. In a blog post (via BleepingComputer), Cloudflare calls it an "unprecedented bombardment" targeting its customers, dashboard, and infrastructure. The company notes that these attacks are performed in a "hit-and-run" fashion, with gigantic bursts of traffic hitting everywhere at once, lasting from a few seconds to minutes.

Cloudflare also notes that the potential attack size grew by 7x in a single year, thanks to the growth of the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets. Aisuru is considered the "parent" botnet and comprises small, internet-connected devices such as IoT equipment, DVRs, and even virtual machines on hosting services. Aisuru's devices reportedly live primarily in the U.S. The botnet grows by gaining access to new devices via default credentials (e.g., username "admin", password "admin") and outdated firmware that contains known vulnerabilities.

 




As for Kimwolf, it can be regarded as a variant of Aisuru, but explicitly targeted at Android-based devices: mobile phones with outdated software or malicious apps, smart TVs, and set-top boxes, among others. Cloudflare says most of Kimwolf's two million minions live in Brazil, India, and Saudi Arabia.

The operators of the botnets have an interesting economy that they operate within. They sell access to the botnet to other cybercriminals, sometimes at surprisingly low prices, for tens of thousands of dollars. The renters then use the botnet to spread their malware, spam, or whatever nefarious activity has been scheduled for the day. The received funds help expand the botnet further.

Cloudflare does note that the Aisuru-Kimwolf network is "parasitic" and that its owners rent out "residential proxies", a term describing a set of devices in a residential setting, adding a layer of anonymity for attackers to hide behind.

On the technical side, UDP carpet-bombing is apparently the most commonly used technique, and the one employed for the 31.4 Tb last December. That entails spreading out the attack surface so wide that it makes it hard for the defenders to block it. Cloudflare adds that the combined botnet has also been targeting gaming services with hyper-volumetric HTTP attacks, sending gigantic amounts of legitimate-looking requests to online services that ultimately overwhelm the target's network or computing capacity.

From hunting the Higgs to warming your home


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The world's largest particle accelerator now has an important new mission: heating thousands of homes. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN has begun to funnel the waste heat from its cooling system to a new residential and commercial area in the nearby French town of Ferney-Voltaire, with the new linkup expected to be able to heat several thousand homes at once.

This new network is one of several initiatives that CERN is introducing to help it move towards more “environmentally responsible” research and to help reduce CO2 emissions. The LHC, the jewel in CERN's crown, is otherwise better known for its large-scale research around the building blocks of the universe, including the discovery of the Higgs boson particle in 2012.

Active since mid-January, the new setup has been made possible by the introduction of a new heat exchange system. The system draws the heat from the LHC's cooling system, which stretches all around the 16-mile accelerator, and funnels it directly into Ferney-Voltaire's new district heating network.

The heat, which would otherwise be an unused waste product, means that these homes don't require an active heating system, such as gas or electric, which helps prevent thousands of tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. As CERN itself explains, this is made possible by the LHC's design, with eight “surface points” across its 16-mile range – the eighth passing particularly close to Ferney-Voltaire.

The equipment at point eight requires extensive water cooling. Rather than pass this through a cooling tower, with the energy then lost, the new setup instead pushes the hot water through two 5 MW heat exchanges, housed in a new building that links CERN's exchange with the new Ferney-Voltaire heating system. However, CERN confirms that this 5 MW output could “theoretically” double when CERN is fully operational, as long as it doesn't impact the LHC's main research mission.

The residents of Ferney-Voltaire might have to wait a while before they can take full advantage of CERN's waste heat, however. The Large Hadron Collider is expected to shut down as part of its Long Shutdown 3 process for several years of upgrades and maintenance from mid-2026. This will reduce CERN's output to the new heating system to “between 1 and 5 MW,” excluding several months while the system isn't operational. CERN has other plans to capture waste heat, including at its Prévessin data center, where it expects to use heat recovery to warm most of the on-site buildings from late 2026.

This isn't the first project to reuse waste heat that we've seen, although it may be one of the largest in scale. For instance, a swimming pool in Redditch, England, has been funneling the waste heat generated by a nearby crematorium to heat its swimming pool since 2013. A more recent project, the Bunhill 2 Energy Centre, has captured waste heat from the London Underground train network to provide heat and hot water to over a thousand homes since 2020. Microsoft also announced a plan to use waste heat from a data center to warm residents in a Finnish town, and we've even seen a UK couple heat their home using a Raspberry Pi cluster.

CERN's efforts are an ambitious way to capture waste energy for the wider benefit of the residents close to its headquarters. With so many data centers built in ultra-cold climates during this AI boom period, the LHC's efforts could provide inspiration for future high-energy infrastructure – where there's heat, there's opportunity.

Samsung's first-ever Galaxy Z TriFold went on sale this past Friday, but it sold out in minutes. This folding phone differs from the 7th-generation Galaxy Z Fold7 in that its screen can expand to a whopping 10 inches, turning it into a proper tablet. That also means it commands an incredibly high price of $2,899. It's the first device of its kind here in the West, though Huawei has its own version in China.

You'll have to sign up at Samsung.com to receive notifications of when the next batch of Galaxy Z TriFolds will be available. The company says it has limited units at select Samsung Experience Stores across the US in states such as New York, Texas, California, and Minnesota.

Google hasn't been quiet about hinting at its future plans of converging Android and Chromebooks into a single operating system, reportedly known as Aluminium OS internally. But now we may have our first peek at what it'll look like, as picked up by 9to5 Google. Admittedly, the glimpse is a bit limited, but a couple of official images and a video have been pulled from a bug report that reveal the interface, which has since been removed by Google.

The brief look shows that Aluminium OS really does feel like Android and ChromeOS stitched together. The windowing and browser elements feel pulled from ChromeOS, while the rest of the interface seems to take more cues from Android. Specifically, the taskbar and start screen look a lot like the desktop mode in Android 16. The video shows two instances of Google Chrome running in split-screen, a common setup for Chromebooks, before briefly opening the Google Play Store in a separate window. Either way, according to what we're seeing here, Aluminium OS may not end up feeling like a significant divergence from what's available. That'll be important if Google hopes to keep the Chromebook business running in education markets.

While Aluminium OS will reportedly replace ChromeOS in the long run, that may take years, and Chromebooks themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. But rumors indicate that we will see an official launch of its cross-platform operating system sometime later this year as Google gradually integrates its platforms. —Luke Larsen

Vivaldi, an alternative web browser, recently released an update to its tab organization tools, but the update is more notable for what it doesn't include: AI. “While every major browser is racing to cram AI assistants into their products, Vivaldi is dropping a middle finger to that entire approach,” writes Vivaldi CEO Jon von Tetzchner.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

With Google's Chrome browser now integrating the company's Gemini 3 LLM model to handle tasks like booking flights and finding apartments, Vivaldi is positioning itself as the browser that remains AI-free. Instead, Vivaldi plans to double down on tools for humans because "human intelligence, equipped with genuinely powerful tools, beats artificial algorithmic assistants every single time," says Tetzchner.

The new “powerful tools” in this release include some improvements to Tab Tiling, Vivaldi's feature for having two tabs (two web pages, or more) side-by-side in the same window. Vivaldi 7.8 adds a new feature that allows you to tile tabs using drag and drop. Grab any tab in your tab bar and drag it onto the current tab, and Vivaldi will tile the two side-by-side. Where you drag it determines how the tab is tiled, to the left, right, top, or bottom, depending on where you want it.

Other new features in this update include easier access to Vivaldi's integrated mail client and a user-requested feature that allows you to restrict pinned tabs to a single domain. Vivaldi 7.8 can be downloaded from the Vivaldi website. —Scott Gilbertson

Samsung is always experimenting with new display technology, but sustainability fans will be especially interested in its most recent innovation: phytoplankton-based bio-resin in screens. The material is a part of a new color e-paper display from Samsung, where it is used in the housing.

“The display's housing has been independently verified by global safety and sustainability certification organization UL to consist of 45 percent recycled plastic and 10 percent phytoplankton-based bio-resin,” Samsung says. “This material innovation was developed as an alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics, which can reduce carbon emissions in the manufacturing process by more than 40 percent.”

The use of advanced modern plastics is on brand for the purpose of these screens; the new display is designed largely for retailers who might use traditional paper signage, allowing folks to change displays and images without printing new paper for every change of season or sale. They're rechargeable via USB-C and have a 1600 x 1200 resolution in a 4 x 3 aspect ratio. —Parker Hall

As a relatively new London-based brand launched in 2024, Spilt's winning aesthetic has been described (rather whimsically) as a MoonSwatch and Royal Oak mashup. But as a portion of every sale supports mental health charities, thankfully, there's more to Split than just good-looking timepieces. Until now, my clear favorite piece was the searingly yellow Sub-7. This new In the Skies model, however, might have just replaced it. Why? Well, who doesn't love an all-white watch? This piece, however, has a particular party trick—one for when things turn dark.

Some 18 months in development, the 42mm In The Skies is the first ever full-glow watch to reach production, beating IWC's much-anticipated Ceralume chronograph to the punch. And at just £1,800 (about $2,480), it is a safe bet that this watch is considerably cheaper than the IWC will be when it eventually hits stores.

Inside is a bi-compax automatic chronograph movement (allowing two sub-dials at 3 and 9 o'clock) from Seiko, visible through an exhibition caseback. And for protection from the elements, there's a screw-down crown and 100 meters of water resistance. The all-important, all-over glow is achieved by infusing a “secret ratio” of Japanese luminous powder directly into the strap and case materials during manufacture. If you like this as much as I do, you'd better be quick, as it's a limited edition of just 250 pieces. —Jeremy White

If you've ever strained to hear gate announcements for your flight (let's face it, we all have at some point), you'll be pleased that Frankfurt Airport is trialling Bluetooth Auracast to send gate announcements directly to a passenger's hearing aids, wireless earbuds, and smartphones. Forget about muffled loudspeaker announcements, because Auracast can send boarding calls, changes, or delays straight to supported smartphones, like Pixels or Samsung phones, and on to connected, Auracast-enabled earbuds or headphones. It also works with apps from Auracast-enabled GN hearing devices.

Auracast is the biggest advancement for the popular wireless connectivity standard Bluetooth in years. It enables multiple people to connect to the same audio stream simultaneously and has many possible uses, from watching a movie together on a smartphone in the back of a car to audio from TVs in public spaces like the gym. It can also enhance accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing, allowing them to stream audio directly to their hearing aids at public venues.

Initially being trialled at two busy gates in Frankfurt Airport, Auracast has been integrated into the German company, Sittig Technologies' PAXGuide announcement platform, which could enable it to roll out across the country without airports having to replace their existing systems. It's exciting to see such a well-known technology evolving to improve accessibility in public spaces. —Simon Hill

G.Network, a broadband internet provider focused on London, England, that mostly uses fiber optic lines, has entered administration (similar to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy) after a potential deal fell through because of rats. According to The Telegraph, the company was £300 million (more than $411 million) in debt and only had 25,000 paying subscribers. Community Fibre was considering acquiring the company's assets, but decided against it after discovering that its cables suffered from extensive rodent damage. Biodegradable cable covering complicated matters, as they attracted rats.

“Rodents like ducts and they like fibers, which are very tasty,” Community Fibre chief Graeme Oxby told the newspaper. “It's not something we've been particularly interested in because we think it's got quite a lot of structural issues and would be quite an expensive fix.”

Internet fiber optic cables have layers of protection, including conduits or ducting, casing, and insulation. This makes them robust enough that it would require a power tool to saw through them. However, they're still no match for rodent teeth. Rats can easily chew through cables, using these protective layers for nesting.

Moreover, some cable jackets are biodegradable, using soy-based or corn-based materials as part of their sheathing. This makes them attractive to the sensitive noses of rodents, as they smell like food and are more likely to be consumed.

Aside from this, The Telegraph reports that the majority of G.Network's lines are located under the middle of roads, not sidewalks. This makes repair costly, as the company has to close thoroughfares when it needs to replace damaged fiber. Furthermore, it causes disruption, causing traffic to back up in already congested London.

It's mostly for this reason that competitors aren't scooping up the distressed company as it enters administration. The firm is currently owned by FitzWalter Capital, a private-equity firm that specializes in investing in distressed companies, where they're either turned around or cut to pieces and sold for profit.

Community Fiber refused to bid on the company, with Oxby telling the newspaper that it hasn't even conducted a technical assessment of the distressed broadband firm. He also added that other factors were driving the decision not to acquire its competitor. Because of this, the future of G.Network and its rat-damaged fiber optic network remains unclear.

From the street, the only indication I've found Physical Intelligence's headquarters in San Francisco is a pi symbol that's a slightly different color than the rest of the door. When I walk in, I'm immediately confronted with activity. There's no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.

Inside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.

During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It's not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third — this one seems to have found its calling — is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.

“Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence's co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don't immediately grasp them. 

What I'm watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations — warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop — and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The pants-folder is someone's experiment. So is the shirt-turner. The zucchini-peeler might be testing whether the model can generalize across different vegetables, learning the fundamental motions of peeling well enough to handle an apple or a potato it's never encountered.

The company also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There's a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it's for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it's there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments.

The hardware itself is deliberately unglamorous. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that's with what Levine describes as “an enormous markup” from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. A few years ago, he says, a roboticist would have been shocked these things could do anything at all. But that's the point — good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.

As Levine excuses himself, I'm approached by Lachy Groom, moving through the space with the purposefulness of someone who has half a dozen things happening at once. At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of one of Silicon Valley's boy wonders, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite).

When I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: “Absolutely not, I've got meetings.” Now he has 10 minutes, maybe.

Groom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine's who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. Their names kept appearing in everything interesting happening in robotics. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it's like, This is it.”

Groom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he'd loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was “on vacation much more as an investor.” But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. “I was looking for five years for the company to go start post-Stripe,” he says. “Good ideas at a good time with a good team — [that's] extremely rare. It's all execution, but you can execute like hell on a bad idea, and it's still a bad idea.”

The two-year-old company has now raised over $1 billion, and when I ask about its runway, he's quick to clarify it doesn't actually burn that much. Most of its spending goes toward compute. A moment later, he acknowledges that under the right terms, with the right partners, he'd raise more. “There's no limit to how much money we can really put to work,” he says. “There's always more compute you can throw at the problem.”

What makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn't give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. “I don't give investors answers on commercialization,” he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. “That's sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now.

So what's the strategy, if not commercialization? Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won't need to start data collection from scratch — they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. “The marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it's just a lot lower,” he says.

The company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals — logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street — to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their “any platform, any task” approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today.

Physical Intelligence isn't alone in chasing this vision. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence — the foundation on which more specialized applications can be built, much like the LLM models that captivated the world three years ago — is heating up. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its “omni-bodied” Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing. 

Skild has even taken public shots at competitors, arguing on its blog that most “robotics foundation models” are just vision-language models “in disguise” that lack “true physical common sense” because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data.

It's a pretty sharp philosophical divide. Skild AI is betting that commercial deployment creates a data flywheel that improves the model with each real-world use case. Physical Intelligence is betting that resisting the pull of near-term commercialization will enable it to produce superior general intelligence. Who's “more right” will take years to resolve.

In the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. “It's such a pure company. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need — or new hardware or whatever it is — and then we do it. It's not externally driven.” The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap of what the team thought would be possible. By month 18, they'd blown through it, he says.

The company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully “as slowly as possible.” What's the most challenging, he says, is hardware. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.” Hardware breaks. It arrives slowly, delaying tests. Safety considerations complicate everything.

As Groom springs up to rush to his next commitment, I'm left watching the robots continue their practice. The pants are still not quite folded. The shirt remains stubbornly right-side-out. The zucchini shavings are piling up nicely.

There are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company's progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense.

If Groom has any doubts, he doesn't show it. He's working with people who've been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know. 

Besides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there's a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they'll figure it out. It doesn't always work out. But when it does, it tends to justify a lot of the times it didn't.

Antimicrobial resistance - when bacteria and fungi defend themselves against the drugs design to kill them - is an urgent threat to global public health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

To combat this threat, the Gerdt Lab at Indiana University Bloomington studies how to weaken bacteria's defenses against viruses.

"Bacteria get sick, too," said J.P. Gerdt, assistant professor of chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington. "Our lab tries to understand how their immune systems work so we can figure out how to inhibit them." 

Bacteriophages, the viruses that attack and kill bacteria,  can be a useful alternative to antibiotics. Antibiotics kill not just pathogens but also good bacteria, but bacteriophages can be deployed in a more targeted way to kill just one problematic strain of bacteria, leaving beneficial microbes untouched.

Bacteriophages are also useful in agriculture because they provide a more targeted approach to killing bacteria. Whereas many antibiotics tend to kill not just infection- and disease-causing bacteria but good bacteria as well, bacteriophages can be deployed to kill just one strain of bacteria.

However, just as bacteria have evolved antibiotic resistance, they can also become immune to bacteriophages.

That is where the Gerdt Lab's work comes in. Former lab member Zhiyu Zang, now a post-doctoral candidate at the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne, discovered a chemical molecule that when paired with the bacteriophage helps the virus overwhelm a bacteria's immune system.

This finding was revealed in Zang and Gerdt's paper "Chemical inhibition of a bacterial immune system," recently published in Cell Host and Microbe.

While antibiotics will likely remain the first line of defense for human bacterial infections, the Gerdt Lab's discovery could still apply to hard-to-treat infections in humans. It could also be applied in places like agriculture, where antibiotic overuse can worsen the spread of antibiotic resistance.

Just as millions of bacteria strains exist, there are potentially as many chemical molecules that could be deployed to inhibit bacterial immune systems. Gerdt hopes that in 10 to 15 years, his lab will create a library of inhibitors for different bacteria.

Gerdt and Zang's strategy with this paper was to begin research with a bacterium that was relatively easy and safe for undergraduates to study. Students like Olivia Duncan, who was an undergraduate when she worked in Gerdt's lab, helped Zang and Gerdt find molecules that chemically inhibited that bacterium's immune system.

"Our study is important not just because we found the first example of a small molecule that can inhibit a bacteria's immune system," Zang said. "It's also important because the immune system we're studying in this paper is present in around 2,000 different bacteria species."

This finding allows them to develop general rules and tools for a targeted approach to pathogenic bacteria with similar immune systems like  Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus, both often resistant to antibiotics and the cause of many deadly hospital-acquired infections.

Duncan, who is the second author on the paper and currently a Ph.D. student at Cornell University, worked with Zang to identify a chemical molecule that helped a virus evade the bacterium's immune system.

"Our goal is to have a collection of inhibitors that will work for different immune systems," Gerdt said. "We hope that this paper will be a catalyst for other labs to work on this with us as a community. That's what makes this paper so exciting: We're starting something new and seeing where it takes off."

Leading academics from universities and research organizations across Europe and America, and companies and SMEs interested in developing foods, supplements and pharmaceuticals targeting pain and inflammation will gather for the Algae4IBD Conference and Industry Summit, taking place at the Conference Center, Teagasc Food Research Center, Ashtown, Dublin 15 from March 4th-6th, 2026.

Organized by the Algae4IBD Consortium, of which Teagasc Ashtown are the Irish partners, this event will present findings from Algae4IBD Project that focused on the development and formulation of functional ingredients for health from algae and seaweeds, and their formulation into functional foods/nutraceuticals, pharma, and supplements. The Teagasc Algae4IBD team at Ashtown includes Dr Maria Hayes, Dr Dilip Rai, Dr Dolly Bhati, and Dr Oyenike Olatunji.

There are over three hundred different species of seaweeds found in Irish waters currently, and over 20,000 known microalgae. Some, like Kelp, form ocean forests and help to sequester carbon dioxide from the environment, while others are microscopic and provide a source of nutrition to fish and marine species and are also rich in nutrients like Polyunsaturated fatty acids like Omega-3 often found in food supplements.

Commenting ahead of the gathering, which will also bring together stakeholders from government organizations and policy makers from Ireland and Europe, Dr. Maria Hayes, Natural Products Chemistry Research Officer in the Teagasc Food Research Center, Ashtown, said:

"Seaweeds are a largely untapped Irish resource that could be used to create new products and markets for sectors impacted negatively by Brexit and recent EU quota negotiations for fish. They can be harvested and grown sustainably and could form a key resource for the Irish and European Bioeconomy.

"The key focus of the Algae4IBD Project was specifically generation, isolation and characterisation of these ingredients specifically to target pain and inflammation associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which affects greater than 3 million people in Europe including over 40,000 people in Ireland.

The problem of inflammation is an ever growing one, and is also associated with aging, and the results from the project are also relevant to the development of products to prevent inflammation associated with other metabolic diseases and aging as well as inflammation in animal health."

The lower hinge of immunoglobulin G (IgG), an overlooked part of the antibody, acts as a structural and functional control hub, according to a study by researchers at Science Tokyo. Deleting a single amino acid in this region transforms a full-length antibody into a stable half-IgG1 molecule with altered immune activity. The findings provide a blueprint for engineering next-generation antibody therapies with precisely tailored immune effects for treating diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that help the immune system recognize and eliminate foreign threats such as bacteria and viruses. The dominant antibody in the bloodstream is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which accounts for about 75 percent of circulating antibodies. Its structure is divided into two main functional units connected by a flexible hinge that must work together seamlessly.

A study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry on January 29th, 2026, reveals that deleting a single amino acid in an antibody's lower hinge can dramatically alter its assembly and immune signaling. The research was led by Associate Professor Saeko Yanaka and graduate student Yuuki Koseki from the Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), Japan, in collaboration with researchers from Kyushu University, Japan, Nagoya University, Japan, and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan.

To deepen our understanding of the role of the hinge region in shaping IgG1 architecture and function, we systematically deleted residues in the lower hinge region. Our study demonstrates that a single deletion mutation in the hinge region of IgG1 can produce half-IgG1 molecules." 

Saeko Yanaka, Associate Professor, Institute of Science Tokyo

An IgG antibody has three main structural components. Two matching arms, known as Fab regions, bind to specific antigens, while a stem-like Fc region connects them and relays signals to the immune system.

Connecting the Fab arms to the Fc stem is a short segment called the hinge. Although small, the hinge plays a critical role by allowing the different parts of the antibody to move together. It provides just enough flexibility for the antibody arms to adapt, enabling efficient target capture while maintaining immune signaling.

The IgG hinge has a "mosaic" design, with a rigid central core that holds the two heavy chains together through disulfide bonds, surrounded by more flexible upper and lower hinge segments.

Previous studies have mainly focused on how changes in the upper hinge and central core affect antibody function, overlooking the lower hinge. To investigate the effect of mutations in the lower hinge, the team performed systematic amino acid substitutions in the hinge region of trastuzumab, a well-known humanized IgG1 antibody used to target the HER2 protein in cancer therapy. By deleting a single proline residue (Pro230), they observed the formation of a 75 kDa half-size antibody species, known as half-IgG1. In this configuration, the disulfide bonding pattern was disrupted, and the two heavy chains were no longer stably linked.

Imaging studies revealed that the relative orientation of the Fab and Fc regions had changed. In a normal IgG antibody, the Fc region is arranged in a way that allows its two halves to pair and interact with immune receptors. In the half-antibody, this pairing surface was rotated inward toward the Fab region. This unusual arrangement likely causes the Fab arms to interfere physically, preventing the Fc region from forming its normal dimer.

Despite this disruption, the half-antibody was not completely inactive. It retained the ability to bind the high-affinity immune receptor FcγRI through a single interface. Because FcγRI can engage antibodies with high affinity, even a half-IgG molecule could still trigger immune signaling, although less efficiently than a full-length antibody.

Together, these findings show that the lower hinge plays a decisive role in maintaining antibody shape, stability, and function, leading the researchers to describe it as a "structural and functional control hub" in IgG1 with the potential to design therapeutic antibodies with customized immune effects.

"These insights redefine the role of hinge region and provide a blueprint for engineering antibody variants with tailored effector profiles for autoimmune disease, cancer, and beyond," says Yanaka.

An analysis of twin cohort data suggests that human life span is far more heritable than previously believed. The findings of the analysis show that once deaths from external factors, such as accidents or infectious disease, are accounted for, genetics may explain ~50% of how long we live. "[T]he study … has important consequences for aging research," write Daniela Bakula and Morten Scheibye-Knudsen in a related Perspective. "A substantial genetic contribution strengthens the rationale for large-scale efforts to identify longevity-associated variants, refine polygenic risk scores, and link genetic differences to specific biological pathways that regulate aging." Understanding the heritability of human life span is a central question in aging research, yet measuring the genetic influence on longevity remains challenging.

Although some genes linked to life span have been identified, external environmental forces, such as disease or living conditions, exert a powerful influence on how long someone lives and often obscure or confound potential genetic effects. Moreover, previous studies have produced widely varying estimates of human life-span heritability, fueling skepticism about the role of genetics in aging. These conclusions are striking, given that life span is far more heritable in laboratory mice and that most human physiological traits show much more genetic determination. According to Ben Shenhar and colleagues, this discrepancy may arise from overlooked confounders in previous research, particularly the heavy burden of "extrinsic" mortality – deaths due to external causes – in the historical populations that underpin these studies. These external causes of death likely dilute the measurable impact of genetics, which primarily shapes "intrinsic" mortality driven by aging and internal biological decline.

Shenhar et al. used mathematical models, simulations of human mortality, and multiple large-scale twin cohort datasets to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic sources of death. According to the findings, extrinsic mortality systematically depresses estimates of life-span heritability. Once deaths from external causes are properly accounted for, the authors show that the genetic contribution to human life span rises dramatically to roughly 55% – more than double previous estimates – suggesting that genetics is a central force in human aging. These revised estimates align human life span with the heritability of most other complex physiological traits and with the life-span heritability observed in other species.

It is estimated that Americans will consume 1.48 billion chicken wings during the Super Bowl, but a new Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine/Morning Consult poll finds that most Americans, 56%, would consider trying a plant-based alternative such as Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Bites while watching the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 8.

You can score a touchdown for your health this Super Bowl by passing on chicken wings, cheesy dips, and meaty chili and instead opting for plant-based favorites like buffalo cauliflower or black bean chili." 

Stephanie McBurnett, RDN, nutrition educator, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine

McBurnett suggests swapping classic Super Bowl party fare for plant-based options like Loaded Sheet Pan Nachos, Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Bites, Ultimate Baked Potato Skins, Barbecue Jackfruit Tacos, and Protein Power Three-Bean Chili, all recipes from the Physicians Committee's Universal Meals program.

Plant-based meals like these are lower in fat, loaded with fiber, and high in antioxidants, helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other conditions. Research also shows that a plant-based diet can help athletes like football players with performance and recovery.

"Choosing healthier options doesn't mean giving up the flavor, the fun, or the game-day experience-these plant-based dishes are satisfying crowd-pleasers," says McBurnett.

The poll, conducted among 2,202 U.S. adults from Jan. 16 to 19, 2026, also found that 86% of Americans plan on eating chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday or would if they were available. But most surveyed, 88%, don't know the health risks associated with consuming chicken.

Research shows that fried chicken, such as buffalo chicken wings, increases the risk of death from heart disease. Eating 300 grams of poultry-about the size of a large chicken breast-per week also increases the risk of gastrointestinal cancer and death from all causes. Urinary tract infections, the most common form of bacterial infection, are commonly caused by meat-borne bacteria, primarily from poultry.

"Whether you are an armchair quarterback or in the end zone, choosing a plant-based diet is a win for good health," adds McBurnett.

Ric Treble is a retired forensic chemist, who has studied the development of novel drugs for over thirty years. He provides support to the UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and was awarded an MBE in 2017 for services to forensic drug analysis.

Dr Caroline Copeland is a senior lecturer in pharmacology and toxicology at King's College London, and the director of the UK's National Programme on Substance Use Mortality. She heads a research group at King's aiming to improve healthcare strategies for people who use drugs.

In their new Frontiers in Pharmacology article, they examined the impact of national and international legislation on the emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They showed that the most effective legislations for reducing NPS deaths in the UK were those introduced in producer countries, but that this alone does not suffice to reduce drug deaths.

The illicit drug trade is international, and different countries have developed different strategies intended to minimize its negative effects, most commonly through controls on, or prohibition of, specified substances. But which approaches to banning substances are actually most effective in reducing harm? 

The advent of NPS, and the range of subsequent legislative controls introduced by different countries, has created a natural experiment. Using data from the UK's National Programme on Substance Abuse Mortality (NPSUM), our study examines how different national and international control strategies have translated into real-world outcomes within England, Wales, and Northern Ireland by examining NPS deaths.

Internationally, there has been a high degree of consistency in drug control. The United Nations (UN) annually reviews and updates the lists of substances (and precursors) named in its drugs conventions, based on recommendations from the World Health Organization's expert committee. All signatory nations of the conventions are then required to incorporate these controls into their national laws. However, this process of problem identification, data compilation, formulation of recommendations, and achieving international consensus followed by national legislation, is inevitably slow. In contrast, the appearance and spread of NPS within drug markets can be incredibly rapid, so there can be significant delays between local identification of issues arising from novel substances and the international introduction of new controls.

In response, some nations have therefore chosen to act sooner, introducing their own national controls in response to local concerns, in advance of, or in addition to, those required by the UN. This means that there is an international patchwork of legislation regarding emerging drug threats, with different substances being controlled in different countries at different times. Whilst challenging for policymakers, this variation provides a valuable opportunity to assess the impact of the application of different nations' controls on particular substances.

In the UK, there have been very few examples of the illicit synthesis of NPS and the vast majority of such substances are imported instead, often facilitated by internet trading and 'fast parcel' delivery services. To address the rapid appearance of NPS, the UK's Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) has been supplemented by other measures, such as the introduction of Temporary Class Drugs Orders (2011) and the much broader Psychoactive Substances Act (2016). These measures effectively prevented open sale of NPS via 'head shops' and UK-based websites. However, NPS remained accessible to both individuals and distributors via internet trading and traditional drug distribution networks. 

Over the period studied, the major sources of NPS in the UK were chemical supply companies based in China. In response to both local and international concerns, China introduced a series of national controls over and above those required by UN scheduling, initially on specifically named substances and, more recently, on whole families of NPS by means of 'generic' controls. 

When we compared trends in NPS detections within the NPSUM's mortality data with the timing of the UN's international control requirements and the UK's and China's national legislations respectively, a clear pattern emerged: controls implemented in the producing countries were associated with larger reductions in NPS detections in deaths than controls introduced solely within the consuming country.

National legislation within consumer countries is, of course, still essential. It enables national law-enforcement activity, including restricting the import and trafficking supply chain and the implementation of possession offences. However, national legislation and enforcement alone cannot eliminate drug use or its associated harms. For this reason, they must be complemented by wide-ranging harm-reduction strategies. However, legislative controls can also drive unintended consequences. Targeted bans on specific substances often stimulate the development of novel NPS, including the production of new, as yet uncontrolled, variants of substances controlled by name. This pattern has been particularly evident in the case of synthetic cannabinoids, where successive generations of legislation-avoiding substances have continued to appear, prompting the development of ever broader generic controls.

However, even generic controls have limits. Where entire families of drugs are prohibited, new drug families which produce similar effects may emerge instead. This dynamic is currently being seen in the case of highly potent synthetic opioids, a particularly concerning cause of drug-related deaths. Broad controls on fentanyl and their pre-cursors have been followed by the appearance of nitazenes and, as controls on nitazenes are being introduced, a new group of potent opioids, the orphines, has begun to appear. These cycles of control and innovation are therefore likely to continue.

Early legislative action by consumer countries remains necessary to limit the distribution and harms of newly emerging NPS. The findings of our study also demonstrate the particular effectiveness of prompt action to restrict production within source countries to prevent international distribution. If, as a result of Chinese legislative actions, production of NPS for the illicit drug trade becomes more geographically diverse, action to identify new sources of production and to encourage and support supplier nations to restrict production as soon as practicable will be required. This will present particular challenges if the substances being produced and exported are not perceived to present a threat within the producing country.

However, supply-side interventions alone cannot provide a lasting solution: as long as there is sustained demand for psychoactive substances, there will be strong incentives for suppliers to adapt, innovate, and profit. Reducing drug harms will therefore require not only responsive legislation and international co-operation, but also investment in education, prevention, and treatment to address the drivers of demand.

When the manufacture of plastic products moves into ordinary homes, new health problems arise, including emissions of particles and chemicals. Together with industry, researchers at örebro University are working to increase knowledge and safety in 3D printing. "We often underestimate what we cannot see," says Andi Alijagic, researcher at örebro University, about the safer use of 3D printers.

We can't say that 3D printing is inherently bad, but we can't say it's inherently safe either. Our goal is not to halt the use of 3D printers. Rather, we want to contribute to making their use safer by understanding the health effects of the particles and chemicals they emit."

Andi Alijagic, docent in biology and researcher in toxicology

Millions of people today use 3D printers at home, at school, and in industry. There are many advantages to using 3D printers: less waste, more efficient production, and better-adapted products."3D printing is an essential technology for sustainable, modern manufacturing. With the right knowledge, monitoring, and regulations, society can benefit greatly from this technology without risking human or environmental health," says Andi Alijagic.In the NanoSafety2 project at örebro University, researchers are collaborating with industry to develop a framework for measuring particle and chemical emissions and assessing their effects on the human body, as well as for making production safer through health and safety instructions, safer materials, and better-designed 3D printing processes.

Few schools have staff who can assess the risks associated with the materials used in their 3D printers. Families who purchase a 3D printer that manufactures plastic parts - whether in the kitchen or living room - rarely have adequate ventilation for its use."We currently have no way of knowing what long-term effects arise from the use of 3D printers in industry or in the home," explains Andi Alijagic."Only after long-term measurements and tests will we know more. At the same time, new plastic and metal materials and methods are being developed all the time, which may entail new risks," explains Andi Alijagic.Although there are no specific threshold values for 3D printers, there are guideline values for particles in the working environment. In Finland, such guidelines are already used to assess the risks of particle emissions from various processes, including 3D printing.

A groundbreaking study from Brown University Health researchers has identified a crucial factor that may help improve treatment for glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and common forms of adult brain cancer. The findings, published November 10 in Cell Reports, reveal how differences among cells within a single tumor influence the cancer's response to chemotherapy, and introduce a promising new therapy designed to tip the odds in the patients' favor.

Glioblastoma is notoriously difficult to treat. One of the key reasons is that no two cells within the tumor behave exactly alike. Even inside one tumor, some cells may respond to treatment while others resist it, allowing the cancer to persist and grow. For decades, scientists have known that tumors are composed of diverse cells, but the biological forces driving these differences, and their impact on treatment, have remained elusive.

Traditionally, researchers have focused on the overall behavior of a tumor by studying the average response across all the individual cells, using differences between the cells to interpret the average. Our study fundamentally flipped that approach. Rather than focusing on the average response, we focused on the differences between individual cells within the same tumor, and what we found could change how we treat glioblastoma."

Clark Chen, MD, PhD, senior author, professor and director of the brain tumor program, department of neurosurgery, Brown University Health

Chen's team discovered that a small molecule called miR-181d acts like a master switch that helps control how much of a DNA-repair protein called MGMT (short for Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase) each glioblastoma cell produces. MGMT is crucial because it allows cancer cells to fix the damage caused by chemotherapy, making them harder to kill. The problem is that not all tumor cells make the same amount of MGMT, some produce a lot, while others make very little. This uneven production means that while some cells die during treatment, others survive to fuel tumor growth.

When glioblastoma tumors are treated with chemotherapy, levels of miR-181d drop. This drop amplifies the differences among individual cells within the tumor, thereby allowing more cells to make more MGMT and survive treatment. The research team found that administering miR-181d into the tumor can reduce this effect, making the cancer cells behave more uniformly, and importantly, more likely to respond to chemotherapy.

"This is an exciting step forward," commented Gatikrushna Singh, assistant professor of neurosurgery, University of Minnesota and one of the study's key collaborators. "Scientifically, it helps explain why tumors maintain so much internal variability. Clinically, it opens the door to gene-therapy strategies that could be truly game-changing for many glioblastoma patients."

The discovery has already led to the development of a new potential therapy aimed at improving patients' responses to chemotherapy by stabilizing miR-181d levels within the tumor.

This study was a collaborative effort involving scientists from Brown University Health, the University of Minnesota, VisiCELL Medical Inc., Stanford University, and Johns Hopkins University.

Researchers at WashU Medicine have developed a nasal vaccine against the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, or bird flu, which has jumped from wild birds to livestock to humans. When tested in rodents, the vaccine elicited a strong immune response and prevented infections in animals exposed to H5N1.

Since it was first detected in the U.S. in 2014, H5N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has jumped from wild birds to farm animals and then to people, causing more than 70 human cases in the U.S. since 2022, including two fatalities. The virus continues to circulate among animals, giving it the opportunity to develop the ability to spread among humans and potentially cause another pandemic.

To mitigate the risk of such an event, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis developed an intranasal vaccine that elicited strong immune responses when tested in hamsters and mice and prevented infections in exposed animals. Because pre-existing immunity from prior seasonal influenza infection or vaccination could diminish the efficacy of H5N1 vaccines, the team also confirmed their vaccine remained effective regardless of prior flu exposure.

The results are published Jan. 30 in Cell Reports Medicine.

This particular version of bird flu has been around for some time, but the unique and totally unexpected event where it jumped across species into dairy cows in the United States was a clear sign that we should prepare for the event that a pandemic may occur. Our vaccine to the nose and upper airway  -  not the shot-in-the-arm vaccine people are used to  -  can protect against upper respiratory infection as well as severe disease. This could provide better protection against transmission because it protects against infection in the first place.”

Jacco Boon, PhD, Professor, WashU Medicine John T. Milliken Department of Medicine and co-senior author of the study

Although a bird flu vaccine already exists, it was developed based on older strains of the virus, may not be effective against current variants and is not widely available. To create a new vaccine to better protect against bird flu, Boon and his collaborators leveraged the nasal vaccine technology developed at WashU Medicine by study co-authors Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine, and David T. Curiel, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology. A COVID-19 vaccine based on their approach has been available in India since 2022 and was approved for clinical testing in the U.S. last year.

Strong immune responses depend on how well the body can recognize a pathogen. For the H5N1 vaccine's antigen, Boon and co-author Eva-Maria Strauch, PhD, an associate professor of medicine who specializes in antivirals and protein design, selected specific proteins from H5N1 representative of circulating bird flu viruses that had infected humans. They then created an optimal antigen  -  the bit of a pathogen the immune system reacts to  -  using common features of these viral proteins and inserted the antigen into a harmless, non-replicating virus called an adenovirus, which acts as the delivery vehicle for the vaccine. This approach to antigen design and adenovirus delivery is similar to the COVID-19 nasal vaccine.

The researchers tested the nasal vaccine in hamsters and mice and found near-complete protection against infection. In comparison, and as expected, current seasonal influenza vaccines provided little protection against H5N1 infection. Both animal models showed better protection against H5N1 infection from the nasal spray vaccine than from the same formula administered through traditional intramuscular immunization. Further, strong protection emerged even when the nasal vaccine was given as a low dose against a high exposure to bird flu.

Nasal delivery of the vaccine generated a strong immune response throughout the body, especially in the nose and respiratory tract. A particular advantage of this compared to intramuscular immunization, Boon noted, is that it provides much better protection against infection in the nose and lungs and therefore likely protects against transmission as well as against severe disease.

“We've shown that this nasal vaccine delivery platform we conceived, designed and conducted initial testing on at WashU Medicine can prevent H5N1 infection from taking hold in the nose and lungs,” said Diamond, the co-senior author of the study. “Delivering vaccine directly to the upper airway where you most need protection from respiratory infection could disrupt the cycle of infection and transmission. That's crucial to slowing the spread of infection for H5N1 as well as other flu strains and respiratory infections.”

In addition to testing the vaccine's effectiveness, the researchers investigated whether existing immunity from other flu vaccines would negatively affect the H5N1 vaccine's performance. They found that even with pre-existing immunity, the nasal vaccine still provided strong protection, a critical feature if the vaccine is to be of practical use since most individuals, except young children, have many prior immune experiences with influenza virus or vaccines.

The researchers said the next steps are to conduct additional studies of the vaccine in animals and in organoids representing human immune tissue, as well as to develop new versions of the vaccine that further minimize the effects of prior seasonal influenza infection and that promote greater antiviral responses.

The Global Virus Network (GVN), representing eminent human and animal virologists from more than 90 Centers of Excellence and Affiliates in over 40 countries dedicated to advancing research, collaboration, and pandemic preparedness, is monitoring reports of a Nipah virus outbreak in India and emphasizes that such cases, while very concerning and serious, are not unexpected or unprecedented. Sporadic Nipah virus infections have occurred almost annually in parts of South Asia, particularly in India and Bangladesh, and do not indicate a new or escalating global threat.

Nipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen carried by fruit bats, with human infections typically linked to localized exposure, such as contact with infected animals or contaminated food. Human-to-human transmission can occur but remains rare and usually requires very close contact during acute illness.

"Overall, the risk of regional or global spread of Nipah virus is very low," said Professor Linfa Wang, PhD, Director of the GVN Center of Excellence at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. "Similar outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in India and Bangladesh, driven largely by specific cultural and environmental factors rather than sustained human transmission."

Countries with strong public-health systems and surveillance capacity are well positioned to mitigate the risk posed by Nipah virus through early detection, clinical awareness, and rapid diagnostics.

GVN is monitoring the situation closely through its network of Affiliates and Centers of Excellence, including the Institute of Advanced Virology (IAV) in Kerala, a GVN Affiliate through the Centers of Excellence at University College Dublin and Hokkaido University. Researchers at IAV are engaged in Nipah virus research, surveillance, and development of new diagnostic testing.

While there are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for Nipah virus, promising candidates have shown effectiveness in animal studies. Professor Wang said, "Progress depends on sustained public-good investment and international cooperation."

The Global Virus Network underscores that the current outbreak does not represent a global emergency, but it does highlight the ongoing importance of surveillance, diagnostics, and globally connected scientific networks to detect and defend against emerging infectious threats.

PrECOG, LLC, today announced the publication of final results from the pivotal phase 3 PATINA study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The study evaluated whether adding palbociclib to anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy, following induction chemotherapy, could delay disease progression in patients with hormone receptor–positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. Results showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 44.3 months in the palbociclib arm, compared with 29.1 months in the control arm.

These results show that adding palbociclib, a well-tolerated, oral agent, to our standard treatment regimen provides a substantial and meaningful prolongation of response time and disease control for these patients who suffer from a currently incurable disease."

Angela M. DeMichele, MD, MSCE, PrECOG co-principal Investigator for PATINA and the Mariann T. and Robert J. MacDonald Professor in Breast Cancer Care Excellence, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine

The NEJM publication establishes PATINA as the first large, randomized phase 3 study to demonstrate a clinical benefit for CDK4/6 inhibition in HR+, HER2+ metastatic disease. The finding suggests a potential new maintenance-therapy approach for this patient population.

Approximately 10% of all breast cancers are HR+, HER2+, sometimes referred to as double-positive or triple-positive breast cancer. Current standard first-line treatment consists of dual anti-HER2 therapy plus chemotherapy, followed by maintenance HER2-targeted and endocrine therapy.

Despite substantial advances in treatment, resistance to both endocrine and anti-HER2 targeted therapies remains a persistent clinical challenge. Preclinical and early clinical data suggested that CDK4/6 inhibition may help overcome resistance to these therapies.

From June 2017 through July 2021, the trial enrolled 518 patients across 109 clinical sites in the U.S., Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either palbociclib with anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy (n=261) or anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy alone (n=257).

The PATINA study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., and supported by an academic collaboration led by Alliance Foundation Trials, LLC, as the global sponsor, in partnership with Breast Cancer Trials (Australia and New Zealand), Fondazione Michelangelo, GBG Forschungs GmbH, PrECOG, SOLTI, and Unicancer.

"The PATINA study exemplifies the power of global academic collaboration to answer clinically important questions that directly impact patient care," said Peter J. O'Dwyer, MD, chief executive officer and chair of PrECOG. "We are proud to have partnered with international research groups to help advance a potential new standard for frontline maintenance therapy in this distinct subset of metastatic breast cancer."

Bone marrow metastasis (BMM) from non-hematolymphoid malignancies with resultant cytopenia(s) can mimic primary hematolymphoid disorders. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics of BMM from non-hematopoietic tumors.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with BMM by non-hematolymphoid malignancies at our institution over the past 10 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics, histopathological findings of bone marrow, types of metastatic tumors, and prognosis were analyzed.

A total of 54 cases were included. The four most common malignancies with BMM, regardless of gender, were prostatic adenocarcinoma (29.6%), breast carcinoma (25.9%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (5.5%), and lung carcinoma (5.5%). The main clinical and laboratory manifestations were anemia (90.7%), reticulocytosis (80.5%), thrombocytopenia (73.9%), bone pain (55.5%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (39.6%), leukoerythroblastosis (35.3%), and leukopenia (24%). The vast majority (96.3%) of metastatic tumors were identified by morphology alone; however, in approximately 2.7% of cases, immunohistochemistry was required due to subtle morphologic features. In 29.6% (16/54) of patients, BMM was identified prior to or concurrently with other metastatic sites. The median time interval between the initial diagnosis of non-hematolymphoid malignancies and BMM was 29 months. Although patients who received anti-tumor treatment after BMM diagnosis showed significantly improved prognosis (P < 0.01), no significant differences were observed between those treated with immunotherapy versus chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (P = 0.145).

Prostate and breast carcinomas are the most common malignancies associated with BMM, with anemia, reticulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia being the most frequent clinical manifestations. While our data demonstrate that anti-neoplastic treatments, regardless of regimen, significantly improve overall survival after BMM, no significant survival differences were observed when prostate and breast carcinomas were compared with other types of BMM.

The rapid evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses, driven by high mutation rates and the consequent formation of complex quasispecies populations, present a formidable obstacle to conventional molecular diagnostic approaches. Widely used methods such as reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction are highly susceptible to performance degradation when primer or probe binding sites accumulate nucleotide mismatches. This vulnerability can lead to critical surveillance failures during outbreak responses, allowing emerging variants to evade detection and undermining containment efforts.

To fundamentally address this challenge, the researchers indicate that next-generation diagnostic technologies should evolve along two complementary pathways. The first pathway is designed for mutation-tolerant detection, with the primary objective of broad-spectrum screening. This strategy emphasizes resilience to genetic variation through several key methodologies: (1) Isothermal amplification techniques utilizing multi-target redundancy. (2) CRISPR/Cas-based detection systems engineered to tolerate distal mismatches or designed with multiple guide RNAs. (3) Synthetic biosensors targeting conserved motifs. The underlying principle involves leveraging multi-target redundancy, conserved genomic elements, and bioengineered component flexibility to preserve high analytical sensitivity across a diverse range of viral lineages amidst ongoing genomic drift.

The second path is dedicated to precise typing, requiring the technology to accurately identify single-nucleotide variations. This capability is paramount for high-resolution applications, including tracking transmission chains, discriminating vaccine-escape mutants, and confirming variants of concern. Technological precision is realized through the following methodologies: (1) Designing allele-specific probes for quantitative PCR. (2) Engineering CRISPR/Cas systems by introducing "synthetic mismatches" or utilizing high-fidelity Cas variants. (3) Employing Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute paired with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to achieve single-nucleotide resolution.

In summary, this dual-strategy framework-combining broad, tolerant surveillance for frontline screening with ultra-specific, discriminatory assays for confirmatory typing-forms an essential paradigm for managing the persistent threat of rapidly evolving pathogens. The forward-looking integration of these capabilities into multiplexed, portable point-of-care devices, dynamically informed by real-time genomic epidemiology data, will be critical for deploying targeted and effective public health countermeasures in a timely manner.

Denver Summit have signed defender Eva Gaetino from Paris Saint-Germain on a deal through to the 2028 season.

The 23-year-old center-back joins Summit ahead of their inaugural National Women's Soccer League season, becoming the second United States international to do so from France after USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps announced she will sign in June.

Gaetino signed for PSG in 2024's winter transfer window from University of Notre Dame and has made 45 appearances since, winning the Coupe de France Féminine that year and becoming the youngest American, 21 at the time, to score in the knockout rounds of the Champions League.

“Joining Denver Summit FC is an exciting next step for me,” said Gaetino on the club's website. “This club is building something special, and I'm honored to be part of it from the beginning.

“I'm looking forward to bringing my experience, competing at the highest level in the NWSL, and helping set the standard for this team.”

The defender has appeared for the United States on multiple levels and made her senior debut in 2024.

Summit were accepted as an NWSL expansion team last year and the 2026 season will be their first. They have unveiled 22 players on their roster so far and will be led by former Manchester City Women head coach Nick Cushing.

A little-known FIFA rule will block players from protesting against ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or displaying other political or religious messages during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will take place across the US, Mexico, and Canada, concerns have already been raised about the potential presence of ICE officers near or even inside stadiums.

ICE enforces immigration laws in the US and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration.

However, the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE falls under, has been subject to criticism in recent weeks after two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Nicole Renee Good – were shot dead by agents in Minneapolis in January.

The Trump administration's foreign policy is also subject to debate, with some suggesting World Cup nations may boycott the tournament. Although a mass boycott remains unlikely at this stage.

Political controversy, though, is nothing new in the lead-up to and during the World Cup. During the 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, FIFA threatened players with a booking for wearing the OneLove armbands.

Captains of seven different European nations were supposed to wear the armband to promote diversity and inclusion.

Germany's starting XI then covered their mouths during a team photograph ahead of their group stage match with Japan.

Then-head coach Hansi Flick said the gesture aimed “to convey the message that FIFA is silencing” teams.

No formal action was taken by FIFA.

But what are the rules on political messaging for the 2026 World Cup, and could players and federations face punishments?

According to the 2026 FIFA World Cup regulations, displaying political, religious or personal messages is strictly prohibited by world football's governing body, whether the action is made before, during or after a match. The same rule applies to press conferences, training sessions and any official activity organised by FIFA.

The official answer remains unclear, but given the fact that local officials have suggested that agents will be at the upcoming Super Bowl, a precedent could soon be set.

Speaking to SPORTbible earlier this week, Professor Simon Chadwick, who has worked with FIFA and Barcelona among other global sporting organisations, suggested that ICE agents being present inside World Cup stadiums was a possibility.

Chadwick also suggested that stadiums could be emptier than usual as fans may be “concerned” about their “liberty”.

He explained: “One of the big issues is, if you go back to the Club World Cup last summer, for example, in Florida, there were local Hispanic people who were saying, ‘We're not going to Club World Cup games' because it was announced that ICE agents would be in attendance at Club World Cup games.

“But what you've also got to keep in mind is that at the same time, not only might you get picked up by ICE, but you're also having to pay actually quite a lot of money for your tickets. So you add those two things together, and what do you get?

“Well, you get an American tournament for American people, right? So I think the stadiums will be full. I do believe that. And they'll be full of Americans. Because they're the ones who don't need to prove who they are and where they're from and whether they've got immigration issues. But they're also the people who've got the disposable incomes and are going to be best equipped to buy the tickets, which, as we know, are incredibly expensive.”

When directly asked whether he believes ICE agents will be present inside World Cup stadiums, Chadwick replied: “From my perspective, yes. Because I think what we now know is that the Trump administration's view of the world, certainly on American territory, is that they ultimately have jurisdiction over what happens.”

Three Liverpool vs Newcastle United predictions for their Premier League match on Saturday night, including value on a goalscorer bet.

Our betting expert expects Liverpool to continue where they left off in the Champions League and beat Newcastle this weekend.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Liverpool have faced some huge injuries to the front line and lost Mo Salah to the Africa Cup of Nations for a long while. As a result, they've scored only 16 goals in their 11 league matches at Anfield. Unusually, Liverpool scored more goals (19) away from home than at their stadium.

The Reds have also conceded an average of one goal per home match this season, offering hope to the visitors. Despite Newcastle's wealth of talented attackers, they've scored only 10 goals in their 11 away matches. 

However, they're certainly capable of piercing a makeshift home defence that will likely comprise Ryan Gravenberch at the back to cover Ibrahim Konate. Moreover, both teams have scored in 55% of Liverpool's home matches. The home side have seen the same outcome in three of their four most recent league fixtures.

Additionally, four of the last five head-to-heads produced goals for both teams (80%). Howe's men will likely get some joy at Anfield, especially with Yoanne Wissa starting to gain momentum.

Liverpool will hope that their two Champions League victories in the last two weeks can help turn their Premier League fortunes around. Amazingly, Slot's team haven't won a league match in their last five attempts, drawing four in that run.

Newcastle's away form has been woeful, as they've won only two of their 11 away dates in the league. Five defeats in that run suggest that the Magpies aren't difficult to defeat at Anfield. The head-to-head record leans heavily towards the Merseysiders, making a Liverpool win likely this weekend.

The Reds won the reverse fixture 3-2 at St James' Park, part of a run of eight wins across their previous nine Premier League meetings. The only victory for the visitors came in the League Cup final earlier this year. It's worth noting that Newcastle last beat Liverpool at Anfield in 1994.

Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the Premier League this season is their new signing, Hugo Ekitike. However, the Frenchman hasn't scored in this competition since before Christmas, so he will be eager to finally get onto the scoresheet.

Ekitike scored a goal just before the hour mark during the week. He currently has four goal involvements across his last five club appearances, although it must be noted that he didn't start last week at Bournemouth.

The forward scored Liverpool's second goal in the reverse fixture, so he knows what it takes to breach Howe's defence. Playing in front of the Anfield faithful, Ekitike is likely to find the back of the net.

Liverpool have suffered a disappointing Premier League campaign. The champions were largely expected to defend their title or at least be in the race. However, after 23 games, the Reds are 14 points behind the current leaders, Arsenal.

Arne Slot's men are sixth in the standings ahead of this round, but only two points behind rivals Manchester United. The Dutchman will hope his team can replicate their Champions League form in the domestic campaign. Liverpool beat Qarabag 6-0 on Wednesday night to secure an automatic place in the last 16 of that competition.

However, after losing due to a late goal against Bournemouth last weekend, they will want to avoid a similar situation in this round. Newcastle are always a difficult side to face, so the home team must play at their very best.

The visitors drew 1-1 away to Paris-Saint Germain in midweek, dropping out of the top eight in the Champions League. Out of six English clubs, they're the only ones that have to face a playoff, as the other clubs finished inside the top eight.

Nonetheless, it's a positive for Eddie Howe that his side are into the knockout phase of the competition for the first time. Perhaps being in the UCL has affected their domestic form, as they enter the round back in ninth place. However, being only five points behind fifth place means their ambitions for a European spot next season are still achievable.

Liverpool expected lineup: Alisson, Frimpong, Gravenberch, Van Dijk, Kerkez, Wirtz, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Salah, Gakpo, Ekitike

Newcastle expected lineup: Pope, Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Hall, Miley, Guimaraes, Tonali, Barnes, Gordon, Wissa

The president of Marseille, Pablo Longoria, has issued an update on the future of his manager Roberto De Zerbi following reports that the Italian tended his resignation earlier in the week. This came after the club missed out on qualification for the Champions League knockout stages on goal difference, with De Zerbi supposedly willing to leave southern France.

Marseille were sent packing in the Champions League group stage after an incredible last-minute header from Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin against Real Madrid ensured the Portuguese side would progress at the Ligue 1 side's expense. The late goal ensured that Benfica would leapfrog Marseille and claim the final qualification spot for the play-off round, in which they will face Real Madrid.

After the game, there were numerous reports that the Marseille boss had handed in his letter of resignation at the club. His contract at Stade Velodrome is due to run until the summer of 2027, but after the disappointing exit, there were rumours that the club would look to move on from the fiery Italian.

The confusion around De Zerbi's future only compounded when it was suggested that the former Brighton coach was willing to leave the club on his own terms. The side are currently third in the French top-flight, but have been cut adrift from the league leaders RC Lens and French champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Yet, days on from those initial reports, De Zerbi remains at the helm and the club's president has told the media what has, or has not, happened.

Speaking to BeIN Sports, the club's president insisted: "We need to move beyond all the drama, all the theatrics. Since that very heavy defeat, there have been the post-match emotions. There's still that feeling of disappointment. There's also the management aspect. Losing 3-0 against Bruges in the Champions League is a significant defeat. It's unacceptable. A president must remain serious. I never stated that the objective was to qualify for the Champions League this season. That's not a sign of ambition. It's the reality. In the last 30 years, OM has only qualified for the Champions League two seasons in a row once. At no point was there any discussion about the coach leaving. There was a calm, professional analysis between Medhi (Benatia), the coach (Roberto De Zerbi) and myself."

Longoria did admit that the early Champions League exit was a disappointment and a source of great frustration for supporters, adding: "With last week's disappointment, we created a lot of frustration among our fans, I share that, I understand. The priority is to qualify for the Champions League for a second consecutive season. That's very important. The Cup is another way to win a trophy. In a knockout match, anything can happen. But we want to go all the way in the competition."

De Zerbi returned to the dugout in Ligue 1 when his side travelled north to the French capital to face Paris FC. Marseille took the lead through a Mason Greenwood penalty after 18 minutes and held the lead throughout the first-half and into the break.

Should the visitors take all three points against Paris FC, they will narrow the gap on the teams above them. If they earn the maximum, the distance to Luis Enrique's side will be cut to just four points and RC Lens will be just five points in front.

However, PSG will have a chance to reclaim top spot from Lens on Sunday when they travel to Strasbourg. The league champions can take a two point lead at the top of the division against the side managed by former Wolves and Bournemouth head coach Gary O'Neil.

O'Neil succeeded compatriot Liam Rosenior after he moved to fellow BlueCo-owned club Chelsea. Rosenior has made a strong start to life in west London and could extend a good winning run on Saturday evening against West Ham. The new Blues boss will also be dreaming of making the Carabao Cup final, but will have to overhaul a 3-2 defeat against Arsenal on Tuesday night at the Emirates to make it there.

Arsenal ended their run of three Premier League games without a win with a dominant 4-0 win at Leeds United to move seven points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table, silencing those critics who have suggested their title hopes were about to collapse. The visitors suffered a major blow in the warm-up when they lost star man Bukayo Saka to injury, with Noni Madueke being drafted in off the bench to replace him, but it was the former Chelsea man who proved to be the difference in the first half as Mikel Arteta's superb squad again began to flex its muscle.

After a slow start to the game, Madueke started to cause Leeds problems down the right and it was his excellent ball in that was glanced in by Martin Zubimendi to break the deadlock. The England international then whipped in a wicked corner that was punched into his own net by Karl Darlow right on the goalline to make it 2-0.

Viktor Gyokeres wasted a golden chance to extend Arsenal's lead soon after the break but the Swedish striker made amends on 69 minutes when he beat James Justin to Gabriel Martinelli's cross to make it 3-0, before Gabriel Jesus came off the bench to put the gloss on a fine afternoon's work with a fourth for the league leaders.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from Elland Road...

David Raya (6/10):

Quiet afternoon in terms of saves, but handling was good when needed and distribution was tidy. 

Jurrien Timber (7/10):

Looks so much better playing in his natural position on the right of the back four. Booked in the second half.

William Saliba (7/10):

Made some good blocks and brought the ball out from the back at times to get Arsenal moving. 

Gabriel Magalhaes (8/10):

Good battle with Calvert-Lewin. Was put under pressure at times but coped well and was ultimately excellent as always.

Piero Hincapie (6/10):

Solid enough defensively. Would be nice to see him add a bit more in an attacking sense down the left-hand side.

Martin Zubimendi (7/10):

A typically excellent header to open the scoring. The timing of his runs and his ability in the air is so impressive. Strong showing all round.

Declan Rice (8/10):

Played pretty much in a pair alongside Zubimendi and helped Arsenal dominate the midfield battle. Really took control of the game in the second half.

Kai Havertz (7/10):

Almost played as a second striker alongside Gyokeres. His presence allowed Arsenal to play very direct at times. So important for Arteta to have him back.

Leandro Trossard (6/10):

A few nice touches and kept things moving on the left, but wasn't much of a goal threat. Played one excellent ball through to Gyokeres which deserved a better finish.

Viktor Gyokeres (7/10):

Kept the centre-backs busy as he scrapped for everything. Wasted a great chance to make it 3-0 and his touch continues to frustrate but eventually got his goal with a clever run and finish.

Noni Madueke (8/10):

Drafted into the XI at the last minute due to Saka's injury in the warm-up and played a starring role. Caused Leeds problems throughout and produced two wonderful balls in for Zubimendi's opener and Darlow's own goal.

Martin Odegaard (7/10):

Excellent cameo after a difficult week. Set up Jesus' goal and was on the front foot as soon as he came on.

Gabriel Martinelli (7/10):

Really good play down the right to set up Gyokeres' goal.

Gabriel Jesus (7/10):

Scored one superb goal, saw a header saved and sent another effort wide. Big impact.

Riccardo Calafiori (6/10):

Almost got on the scorsheet with a header late on.

Eberechi Eze (N/A):

On for the closing stages.

Mikel Arteta (8/10):

Aside from Saka's injury, he will be delighted. Excellent away win and his substitutes made a big impact.

Chelsea have suffered a blow in the build up to their Premier League clash against West Ham United with Estevao Willian having been left out of Saturday's fixture at Stamford Bridge. The Brazil international, who has been in excellent form for the Blues, is absent from the matchday squad as the club go in search of a sixth win from their first seven games under manager Liam Rosenior.

Ahead of Chelsea's Premier League game against Nuno Espirito Santo's West Ham, Estevao was a notable absentee when the team sheets arrived in west London.

And when asked why the 18-year-old winger was missing from the squad before kick-off, Chelsea boss Rosenior revealed the youngster has had to return to Brazil for “personal reasons”.

“Unfortunately for personal reasons Estevao has had to go home,” Rosenior told Sky Sports ahead of the game. “My love and my thoughts are with him and his family at this moment and I just hope he's okay.”

Rosenior - who has made an impressive start to life at Chelsea following his appointment earlier this month - has made seven changes to the side that beat Napoli 3-2 in the Champions League on Wednesday.

Chelsea XI: Sanchez; Gusto, Chalobah, Badiashile, Hato; Caicedo, Fernandez (c); Gittens, Palmer, Garnacho; Delap

Chelsea substitutes: Sharman-Lowe, James, Acheampong, Fofana, Cucurella, Andrey Santos, Neto, Joao Pedro, Guiu

Estevao has been in fine form for Chelsea in recent weeks, with the former Palmeiras ace having become the second-youngest Blues player to score and assist in a Premier League match in the 3-1 win over Crystal Palace last Sunday.

Following his move from Brazilian outfit Palmeiras, Estevao has scored six goals in 29 appearances for Chelsea, while he has also recorded two assists for Rosenior's men.

Hailing Estevao's excellent impact against Palace, Rosenior said “He is a player with special abilities, special talent. He's been ill but every time he's been on the pitch so far with me he's been outstanding.

“Off the pitch, I know his family are here with him and the club have worked really hard to help him settle. I also know Andrey Santos and Joao Pedro have helped him settle into this country.

“On the pitch, with any 18-year-old, you have to manage his minutes, and manage the games which you think are the right moments for him to have an impact. I'll keep doing that because I want him to have an outstanding season, and I want him to have an outstanding career as well.”

Looking to build on the wins over Charlton Athletic, Brentford, Pafos, Crystal Palace and Napoli across the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League respectively, Rosenior described Chelsea's game against West Ham as the “biggest game of the season” in his pre-match press conference on Friday.

“I'm going to find out so much,” Rosenior told reporters. “We have really good players, but if you want to be a consistent winning team, these are the games where you have to step forward and not be complacent.

“After an amazing win in Italy, to come back three days later, I want to see the consistency levels of the group. That's why for me this is a massive mark of where we're really at.”

Meanwhile, West Ham are looking to maintain their revival under head coach Nuno after putting together a three-game winning run across the league and the FA Cup.

While the Hammers are currently 18th and five points adrift of safety, the club are in good spirits following successive wins over Queens Park Rangers, Tottenham Hotspur and Sunderland.

“I'm not surprised Nuno has put his stamp on the team,” Rosenior said of West Ham. “All of his teams have always been really organised without the ball, whether that's in a 4-4-2 or a 5-4-1 shape, and they've always been very good in transition moments.

“[Jarrod] Bowen and [Crysencio] Summerville are real threats for them and that's something we've spoken about.”

German football federation confirms it met to discuss a boycott of the FIFA 2026 World Cup, which is co-hosted by the US.

The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to United States President Donald Trump.

“We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a FIFA World Cup can have, the federation said in a statement issued late on Friday. “Our goal is to strengthen this positive force – not to prevent it.”

The federation, known as the DFB, said its executive committee met and discussed the option of a boycott of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, a consideration first proposed last week by DFB Vice President Oke Gottlich.

Gottlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott.

In what appears to be a public rebuke to Gottlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public”.

The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament” from June 11-July 19.

Trump has sown discord in Europe with his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, while US actions in Venezuela and at home in dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament.

When president, however, Blatter opposed calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia over concerns about Ukraine.

“Football can not be boycotted in any country,” he said at the time.

Ahead of this summer's tournament, fans have concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.

Germany's team, at least, will be there.

“We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones – just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”

            The beloved defender has called time on her decorated career. 
        

Another USWNT star is hanging up her boots. 

Crystal Dunn announced her retirement from professional soccer, posting a heartfelt message on Instagram.

“This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished," she said. "I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give…This was not a decision made lightly, but was one made with immense gratitude for everything I've experienced as a professional soccer player. I've grown through multiple challenges,  celebrated incredible triumphs, and cherished every part of the journey…Turning the page is never easy. There is so much history, so many memories tied to spaces I'll never experience again.

The German soccer federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup which will take place in the USA, Mexico and Canada this summer

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Germany's soccer federation has definitively ruled out a boycott of the upcoming World Cup, despite internal pressure to send a strong message regarding the actions of Donald Trump.

The German Soccer Association (DFB) affirmed its commitment to the tournament, stating: "We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a FIFA World Cup can have. Our goal is to strengthen this positive force — not to prevent it." This statement was issued late on Friday.

The DFB's executive committee convened to discuss the possibility of boycotting the tournament, which is set to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This option was initially put forward last week by DFB vice president Oke Göttlich.

Mr Göttlich, who also serves as president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, had cited recent actions and statements by Mr Trump, suggesting it was time to "seriously consider" a boycott.

However, in what appears to be a direct rebuke to Mr Göttlich, the DFB declared that "debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public."

The federation confirmed that a boycott "is not currently under consideration," adding that the DFB is actively "in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament" scheduled from 11 June to 19 July.

Mr Trump's policies have previously caused significant discord in Europe, notably with his bid to acquire Greenland and threats of tariffs against European nations that opposed it. 

Furthermore, US actions in Venezuela and the handling of domestic protests in American cities have also sparked international concern.

Last week, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter advised fans to avoid the tournament. 

Supporters have already voiced concerns over high ticket prices, while potential travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could prevent fans from certain competing nations from attending.

Despite these issues, Germany's national team will participate. The DFB concluded: "We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer. 

“And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones — just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country."

Corinthians chase the inaugural FIFA Copa das Campeãs title on Sunday, facing Arsenal in London at 15:00 Brasília time. As reported by Meu Timao, the showpiece is staged at Emirates Stadium. Lucas Piccinato's side reached the final after beating Gotham FC 1-0.

The arena is Arsenal's home. In mid-2025 the club said their women would host all league matches there, plus Women's Champions League knockout ties. It also hosts the men, who lead the Premier League and reached the Champions League last 16 as league-phase winners.

Set in Holloway, north London, Emirates has straightforward public transport links. Arsenal station on the Piccadilly line is a three to five minute walk. The stadium opened on 22 July 2006 and holds 60,704.

Before the move, Arsenal played at Highbury, vacated on 7 May 2006 after 93 years. Corinthians appeared there in a 1965 friendly, which the hosts won 2-0.

Today it is among Britain's most modern venues, with Arsenalisation murals of 32 greats and bronze statues of Arsène Wenger, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Tony Adams, Herbert Chapman and Ken Friar. Visitors can take a self-guided tour, see the Arsenal Museum and shop at The Armoury.

Brazil's men have made Emirates their European base, playing nine games for eight wins and one defeat. Highlights include 3-0 against Argentina in September 2006, a 2-0 loss to Portugal in February 2007 and a 2-0 win over Senegal on 15 November 2025.

Matchdays favour public transport, with cars discouraged due to traffic and road closures. Highbury & Islington serves the south side and Holloway Road has entry and exit restrictions. London buses are cashless, accepting Oyster or contactless with a flat £1.75 fare.

DFB rejects plea to make stand against US president

‘Our goal is to strengthen this force – not to prevent it'

Germany's football federation, the DFB, has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls to send a message to Donald Trump. “We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a Fifa World Cup can have,” the DFB said. “Our goal is to strengthen this positive force – not to prevent it.”

The federation said its executive committee met and discussed the option of a boycott of this summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, a consideration first proposed last week by the DFB vice-president, Oke Göttlich.

Göttlich, who is also president of the Bundesliga club St Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott. In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public”.

The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament”.

Trump has sowed discord in Europe with his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, while US actions in Venezuela and at home in dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm. The former Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament, which starts on 11 June.

There has been disquiet in Germany over Trump's behaviour on the global stage. The Germany international and Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka said on Wednesday that Trump's actions have left him feeling “not only German but also European”.

The French government has ruled boycotting the World Cup, with the sports minister, Marina Ferrari, saying on Wednesday: “As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition. Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs.

“I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.”

Fans already had concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.

Germany's team, at least, will be there. “We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones – just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”

Germany face Curaçao in Houston, Côte d'Ivoire in Toronto and Ecuador in New Jersey in the World Cup group stage. Germany have won the trophy four times, in 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014.

Interim Manchester United boss Michael Carrick is reportedly keen on bringing Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford - if he gets the job permanently. The England international is on loan with La Liga's champions this season, with Hansi Flick's side having an option to make the move permanent this summer. Rashford wasn't wanted by former United head coach Ruben Amorim but that is seemingly not the case with Carrick.

Rashford swapped United for Barcelona on loan for the season, and so far, he has impressed at the Blaugrana. To date, he has scored nine goals, five of which have been in the Champions League, and bagged nine assists in 31 appearances. The 28-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements by ex-United boss Amorim at Old Trafford, and now it seems he is keen to make his stay at Camp Nou permanent. But whether or not they can afford his £26 million ($35.5m) buy option is another matter.

He said in December: "What I want is to stay at Barca. It's the ultimate goal, but it's not the reason I'm training hard and giving my all. The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles. I'm settling in really well at the club and in the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt very welcomed. For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies; last season was fantastic, but life moves very fast, things change, and the goal is to repeat those successes. I'm totally focused on that. Everything has been fantastic with the staff and my teammates; I have no complaints. I'm in the perfect place and environment to continue my journey as a footballer, so I'm just trying to give my best every day and help the team win. We'll see what happens next summer."

According to The Telegraph, although Carrick would like his old United team-mate Rashford back at the club next season if he is still in charge, it is 'hard to see that happening'. Indeed, Amorim previously said he would rather name his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach as a substitute than a player who doesn't give their all, in response to a question about Rashford. However, United were also keen to get his big salary off the wage bill, with his contract set to expire in 2028. Moreover, the report states he is 'happy' at Barcelona, Flick wants him permanently, and those close to the England forward say he has a 'smile back on his face'.

Indeed, Flick previously said on Rashford: "I'm very happy with Marcus Rashford. Speed, finishing, control, he has amazing quality, really."

The report adds that when Rashford was at United, he faced the lion's share of scrutiny from the media. But at Barcelona, that isn't the case. 

A source told the outlet: "The thing about Barcelona is that when something goes wrong or they lose, the inquest is not always about Marcus. That was never the case at Manchester United. There it felt like it was always on him."

Rashford is not always a regular at Barca, with his 18 starts in 31 matches evidence of that. Flick is keen to rotate his squad whenever possible, with Raphinha and Lamine Yamal often starting in Barca's attack at Rashford's expense. And so far, that doesn't seem to be an issue.

Another source added: "He is not one of the main players, like Yamal, and maybe he is liking it that way. He has even gone unnoticed a little – if you can go unnoticed playing for Barcelona – and has kept his head down. The attention tends to be elsewhere."

Aside from Rashford's future, be it at United or Barcelona or elsewhere, Carrick's side will hope to build on their impressive wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in recent weeks when they host Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday in the Premier League.

The 23rd FIFA tournament is set to take place across Canada, Mexico and the US this summer– however, it's been arguably overshadowed in recent months, thanks to the opinions and actions of a certain president.

World Cup games will traditionally see fans of competing nations flock in from around the world to watch their team play, but this won't be the case for 15 out of the 48 teams competing, thanks to travel bans issued by Donald Trump.

While the players and their coaching staff will be still be able to enter the US, the move means that fans from Haiti, Iran and Senegal may have issues making it stateside.

The US has also found itself embroiled in numerous political controversies in the past couple of months, which also threaten to overshadow the tournament. Internationally, there has been backlash to Trump's threats to take over Greenland, the administration's decision to abduct the President of Venezuela during a flying raid on Caracas, and the recent decision to send a 'massive armada' to the Middle East in order to intimidate Iran.

Advert

Meanwhile at home, the US has been troubled by ongoing unrest in the state of Minnesota, after protests against ICE raids in the state's capital Minneapolis saw US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti shot dead by federal agents.

Given the myriad of controversies involving both the US and its leader, it's not surprising that talk has turned to a potential boycott in several parts of the world.

Here is a rundown of all the countries which have either floated or commented on the idea of a World Cup 2026 boycott:

Oke Gottlich, vice-president of the German Football Association (DFB) recently discussed the prospect of Germany pulling out of the tournament in an interview with the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper.

"I really wonder when the time will be to think and talk about this [a boycott] concretely," he told the outlet. "For me, that time has definitely come."

Going on to reference the backlash to the 2022 Qatar games, he added: "Qatar was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? That's something that really, really, really bothers me."

Although Denmark's qualification hinges on play-off success in March, the nation has already responded to calls for a potential boycott, with the Danish Football Association noting they are 'aware of the current sensitive situation'.

Calls for a South African boycott have been led by politician Julius Malema, a member of the Economic Freedom Fighters party has called on the South African Football Federation to withdraw in protest.

"SAFA must take a decision to withdraw from having anything to do with the World Cup that is taking place in America," he said on a recent EFF podcast.

While authorities in Belgium have not ruled out boycotting the tournament, it is unlikely, with the Royal Belgian Football Association telling The Brussels Times: "We are currently focusing on sporting preparations for the World Cup, while also keeping an eye on developments outside of sport."

Like Belgium, the Netherlands is also facing calls to boycott the tournament from its people, with a petition calling for a boycott reaching over 163,000 signatures.

It is unacceptable for our footballers to go to a tournament organised by a president who is threatening to invade an ally," the petition reads. "Taking part in a sporting event as if nothing is happening legitimises Trump's expansionist policy.

French Sports Minister Marina Ferrari told local media that a boycott was not being discussed 'at this stage', but she did add that 'I'm not going to predict what might happen'.

The US decided to only grant four out of nine visas for the Iranian delegation back in November, leading to calls for Iran to boycott the World Cup draw.

A small group of delegates eventually attended the ceremony in Washington D.C.

There has also been calls for competing countries from the UK - England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales - to boycott the tournament.

The call came from Conservative former minister Simon Hoare and Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam Luke Taylor, with the pair saying competing countries from the UK should pull out in order to 'fight fire with fire' and embarrass Trump during a dispute over Greenland (via STV).

However, a boycott from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, should they qualify, is unlikely, given Keir Starmer's longrunning diplomacy attempts to keep President Trump onside.

WSL side host Brazilian champions in Sunday showdown

Slegers wary of complacency against a ‘very good team'

Renée Slegers praised the impact of trailblazing hijab-wearing footballer Nouhaila Benzina after Arsenal's defeat of Moroccan side AS Far earned them a place in Sunday's Champions Cup final against Corinthians.

Asked about the impact of Benzina competing in the new cross-continental club competition in London, with no hijab-wearing players currently playing in the Women's Super League, Slegers said: “The strength of football in society is that football is for everyone. It's really good that we have role models in all possible ways to show that football is for everyone. That just makes me happy. It's important. There are so many examples and different ways of how we can show that football is for everyone. This is one of them, so that's great.”

More widely, the Arsenal manager said the opportunity for clubs from continents much further behind the development of women's football in Europe and the US to showcase their leagues, countries and continents “means a lot”. She said: “Norms have to be broken to get where we want women's football to go. That's what they're doing. They're trailblazers and they're doing things that are bigger than what they maybe know they're doing.”

AS Far was a step into the unknown for Arsenal with it being the first time a European and African club team have played against each other in an official competitive match. Arsenal were untroubled by the Moroccan champions, earning a 6-0 win at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium on Wednesday. Corinthians will prove to be another unknown entity for the current European champions.

“We are very proud to be in this tournament, we are very proud to be the champions of Europe and we look forward to playing against the champions of South America,” said Slegers. “We are very respectful of the opposition, we are very humble also because of the unknown. So, we go into this game believing in ourselves and knowing how good we are. We are happy to play at the Emirates, our home stadium, but we will also respect the opposition. It's a final, so they're going to give absolutely everything, together with the fans. We're prepared for that.”

Slegers has the same squad available to her as she did for the game against AS Far. She is “really happy to have Chloe Kelly back” and “Leah Williamson is progressing really well”.

“Scheduling is very important,” Slegers said. “We grow the game and we want a lot of things, but we also have to have the players' health in mind in all the decisions we make. I'm really happy with the games that we're playing and at the moment with the squad that we have, the depth that we have and the availability that we have. We have the squad to do it.”

The energy of the Corinthians fans was one of the highlights of their semi-final victory over Gotham FC at Brentford. The noise from the crowd will be far from one-way at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

“They're going to bring the intensity together with their fans,” said Slegers. “They were amazing watching the game against Gotham with the energy they brought. Our fans are going to bring energy and the intensity as well. It will be a great football event.

“Football is growing everywhere around the world. AS Far is a good example of that; another continent, another culture, but there's so many things to the way they play and it's at such a high level and I think tactically you see that there's a trend globally.”

Regardless of the chaos around the competition, there is a chance for Arsenal to add to their rich history at the weekend, namely the opportunity to be crowned inaugural global club champions. “We're very excited about the final, we look forward to it and it's a special moment for us, for the players, for the club,” said Slegers.

“The team's in a good place. We have to work really hard to keep on delivering and sustain our levels. So we can't be complacent about anything, especially not going into this final because Corinthians are a very good team.”

Missed anything from the Australian Open final? Worry not. We have you covered from Elena Rybakina's third-set heroics to her on-court trophy presentation and more.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Elena Rybakina is the 2026 Australian Open champion after edging Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a gripping final on Rod Laver Arena.

The World No. 5 overturned a 3-0 deficit in the deciding set, breaking twice down the stretch to secure her second Grand Slam title and her first in Melbourne. The victory earned Rybakina AUD $4.1 million (USD $2.75 million) in prize money.

In case you missed it, here's a look back at the key moments from the 2026 Australian Open final:

Tonight's prize 🏆2001 and 2002 AO champion Jennifer Capriati brings out the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup onto RLA...@wwos • @espn • @tntsports • @wowowtennis • #AO26 pic.twitter.com/FflD9NIRoJ

Jennifer Capriati, a two-time Australian Open champion in 2001 and 2002, unveiled the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup ahead of the match, and she later presented it to Rybakina during the trophy ceremony. The Australian Open in 2001 was her first Grand Slam title when she defeated then-No. 1 Martina Hingis, become the lowest seed (12) to win the title at that point.

Sabalenka and Rybakina took the champion's walk just ahead of stepping onto the court. The roof at Rod Laver Arena is closed -- Melbourne received off-and-on rain throughout Saturday afternoon. Both the women's and men's doubles finals earlier were played with the roof open. Throughout the tournament, the roof has occasionally been closed because of heat.

Prior to their warm-up, the World No. 1 Sabalenka won the toss and chose to serve.

In the opening game, Sabalenka quickly displayed that signature power with an ace to go up 30-0, but Rybakina matched the aggression and responded with a forehand winner on the return. Winning three-straight points, she set up a break point and though Sabalenka saved it, Rybakina broke her serve in the deuce. She then held serve, notching another of her famous aces in the second game, for a 2-0 lead.

Following Rybakina's early break and hold, the players traded holds for five consecutive games. Sabalenka held Rybakina scoreless in the fifth game -- capping it with an ace -- to cut the deficit to 3-2.

Rybakina responded the next game by using her serve to stretch Sabalenka out wide and hold, but as the pattern has been since that early break, Sabalenka relied her serve to head into the changeover down 4-3.

Down 15-40, Sabalenka had a prime chance to get the break back and level the set at four games apiece. Of course it was only fitting Rybakina went to her reliable serve and struck an ace to save one. Then, on the next point, Sabalenka's backhand couldn't reach the trajectory of Rybakina's first serve. The Kazakh eventually won four straight points to hold for a 5-3 lead.

She capitalized on the opportunity and closed out the set 6-4 on her serve. Sabalenka took a change of attire break heading into the second and will serve to begin the first game.

In an 18-point second game, Rybakina saved three break points to tie the second set an one game apiece. Sabalenka had forced a deuce, even shouting a "Let's Go" to motivate herself after a forehand winner to temporarily have the Ad-40, but Rybakina remained calm and collected. Using her ability to dictate her opponent's court coverage, Rybakina had winners of her own to close the game. 

Aside from that first set Rybakina break, it's been a strong display on the serve, especially in the second set. Sabalenka took a 3-2 lead heading into the changeover. In the first, Sabalenka notched four aces and landed 68% of her first serves.

Nothing separating them right now.They're on serve at 3-2 in the second.#AO26 pic.twitter.com/UdAlWcHAH4

With Sabalenka leading 30-15 tied 3-all in the second set, the players initially traded shots on the baseline back and forth, before Rybakina forced Sabalenka to come to the net. Outstretched, Sabalenka dug to save the ball, forcing Rybakina to do the same.

It created a rapid exchange at the net, which Sabalenka won, much to the delight of the Rod Laver Arena crowd. Sabalenka then won the game heading into the changeover. See for yourself here:

Sensational from Sabalenka 😲The world No.1 is not going down without a fight! 🐯@wwos • @espn • @tntsports • @wowowtennis • #AO26 pic.twitter.com/8j9fjmxLXN

That coveted break finally came, and it came at the right same. After a couple winners and an error by Rybakina, Sabalenka had three set points to break Rybakina's serve and win the second set. She only needed one, however, as the World No. 1 found a way against a resilient Rybakina to break that potent serve -- it was her first in six break point opportunities.

Seeking her fifth Grand Slam title, Sabalenka started the final set with a hold and then another pivotal break of Rybakina. The Kazakh seems to be losing strength behind her serve, and only 54% of Rybakina's first serves have landed. 

Sabalenka had a pair of backhand winners, including a cross-court one with her signature roar, to secure the break and 2-0 lead in the third set. She then held serve, sprinting to a 3-0 lead heading into the changeover.

Rybakina put the match back on her serve, breaking Sabalenka for the second time all match to trail 3-2. The World No. 5 then leveled the decider at 3-all. Despite facing a break point in her ensuing service game, she saved it and won the game as Sabalenka's return sailed long.

The 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh champion then notched her third break of the match as Sabalenka's forehand went into the net. Rybakina had the crowd on their feet during the changeover and arguably the most loud it's been all evening

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

With a hold of serve to secure a 5-3 advantage, Rybakina has herself one game away from her second Grand Slam title and her first Australian Open. Sabalenka held to cut the deficit to 5-4, Rybakina will have a chance to close the match on her serve, as chants of "Kazakhstan" are scattering across the crowd, who just showered the players with applause as they returned to the court. 

Leading 5-4, 40-30, Rybakina secured the title with the perfect ending -- an ace. Though she had just six on the evening, she had 47 throughout the tournament and it was the 47th one that mattered most. She earns her first-ever Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup.

Recapping their semifinal thrillers, and previewing their high-stakes final.BySteve TignorPublished Jan 31, 2026 copy_link

You can't say Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic didn't earn their way through their semifinals. Both of them pulled off minor miracles to make it to Sunday.Alcaraz defeated an opponent, Alexander Zverev, who had beaten him here two years ago. More impressive, though, was the way he beat back what appeared to be cramps for nearly three sets and three hours.In the process, Alcaraz may have given players a new template for surviving an issue like this. He stayed calm, took his time between points, used his anticipation and ball-striking skills, and gradually regained full strength. When Zverev served for the match at 5-4 in the fifth, Alcaraz was ready. He hit a backhand pass winner, a strong backhand that drew an error, a forehand winner, and another big forehand to break. When he reached match two games later, he came up with a running, dipping pass for the victory.READ MORE: "This is bulls---": Zverev fumes about, then accepts, Carlos Alcaraz cramp drama at Australian Open“This one was one of the more demanding matches that I've ever played in my career,” Alcaraz said of the five-hour and 27-minute semi. “I think physically we just push each other to the limit today. We push our bodies to the limit, which I think the level of the fifth set was really, really high.”“Every step more, every just one second more of suffering, one second more of fighting, is always worth it.”

If it wasn't Alcaraz's very best, win, it was surely one of his most mature. Maybe he really was ready to go without Juan Carlos Ferrero, after all.What were the chances that the Alcaraz-Zverev adventure would be upstaged by the evening session? Leave it to 10-time champ Novak Djokovic to make it happen in Rod Laver Arena.Djokovic was also battling two opponents. The first was Jannik Sinner, the two-time defending champ, and a man who had beaten him five straight times. The second foe, as the match grew in length, was his own 38-year-old body. In three of the Grand Slam semis he played last year, Djokovic hadn't held up physically. This time he grew tired, huffed and puffed, and took as many seconds between points as he could, but he proved unbreakable—literally—in the fifth.READ MORE: Sinner had Djokovic's number, so the legend "had to change it" ahead of AO classicEight times Sinner reached break point in the final set, and eight times Djokovic foiled him. He found first serves, he found the corners with his  ground strokes, he dictated the rallies, he baited Sinner into going for too much, and he refused to miss. That's the vintage version of Djokovic, someone who believes that, whoever he is facing, and whatever happens from one point to the next, he'll won't lose in the end.“Definitely the finest in the last couple of years,” Djokovic said of his performance. “Doesn't get better than this.”It certainly doesn't get more clutch. Djokovic won 12 fewer points, hit 14 fewer aces, and fired 26 fewer winners than Sinner, but still found a way to beat him.“I'll think about finals later,” Djokovic said, “but for me, this is a win that almost equals winning a Grand Slam.”

He found first serves, he found the corners with his  ground strokes, he dictated the rallies, he baited Sinner into going for too much, and he refused to miss. That's the vintage version of Djokovic, someone who believes that, whoever he is facing, and whatever happens from one point to the next, he'll won't lose in the end.“Definitely the finest in the last couple of years,” Djokovic said of his performance. “Doesn't get better than this.”It certainly doesn't get more clutch. Djokovic won 12 fewer points, hit 14 fewer aces, and fired 26 fewer winners than Sinner, but still found a way to beat him.“I'll think about finals later,” Djokovic said, “but for me, this is a win that almost equals winning a Grand Slam.”

Unfortunately, it doesn't. Alcaraz and Djokovic will have to do it all over again on Sunday.Alcaraz will need to recover from a five-and-a-half-hour match that was played in high heat, and hope that his right leg cooperates.“I think the muscles are going to be tight,” he said. “I've just got to do whatever it takes to be as good as I can for the final.”Djokovic, meanwhile, will be recovering from a match that last four hours and 9 minutes, and ended around 1:30 in the morning.“He has 15, 16 years on me,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. “Biologically, I think it's going to be a bit easier for him to recover.”

Assuming both men are reasonably healthy, this clash of the dueling Houdinis will take us back a couple of years, to 2022-2024, when this was the sport's premiere rivalry, and they gave us a series of classics from Madrid to Wimbledon to Cincinnati to the Paris Olympics.Djokovic leads their head-to-head 5-4. While Alcaraz won their most recent meeting, pretty handily, at the US Open in 2025, Djokovic beat his younger opponent 12 months ago in the Australian Open quarterfinals.“I won against him last year here, also in a grueling match,” Djokovic reminded reporters.

Beyond their health, the relevant factors will be the same as always.Who will serve better? Alcaraz has had a good serving tournament, but Djokovic was razor sharp against Sinner, making 70 percent of his first serves and seemingly finding one whenever he needed it. That alone could keep him in the final.Who will hit his forehand more cleanly? This seems especially important after Alcaraz struggled to find his rhythm on that side for much of his semifinal. He dialed in eventually, but it took a while. He'll need to be cleaner from that side.Can Djokovic get into Alcaraz's head? He has surprised the Spaniard with sudden tactical changes in their past matches. And he used everything he had against Sinner on Friday. He served and volleyed on some key points, tore off a couple of clutch winners that left the Italian muttering in frustration, and urged the crowd to make more noise as often as possible. Last year here against Alcaraz, Djokovic seemed to be struggling physically, which threw the Spaniard off.

Who will be more fiercely determined? Each is going for something big: Alcaraz for the career Slam, and Djokovic for his all-time-best 25th major. Which means the edge in desperation may go to Djokovic; he knows his chances to break that record are dwindling fast.The biggest unknowable will be Djokovic's mental and physical stamina. On the one hand, he just beat Sinner in five sets, so he would seem to be ready for anything. On the other, we saw him run out of gas late in majors last year, and he just escaped defeat to Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals here.If Djokovic is still in vintage fighting form on Sunday, it might require a monumental, career-best effort from Alcaraz to beat him. I'll say he's up to it.Winner: Alcaraz

Seeking her fifth career Grand Slam singles title, Aryna Sabalenka won five consecutive games to lead 3-0 in the third set. The titanic task appeared all but complete, and no one would have blamed Elena Rybakina for capitulating on the other side of the net.Instead, Rybakina did what Sabalenka did—win five consecutive games of her own—then did what the world No. 1 couldn't: close it out.The always dangerous but still inconsistent 26-year-old put it all together Saturday night in Rod Laver Arena, and at this Australian Open, to win her second Grand Slam singles title. With an ace, she closed out a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Sabalenka to win her first major championship since Wimbledon 2022.

Rybakina has now won one hard-court tournament at the WTA 1000, season-ending tournament and Grand Slam levels. All have come at Sabalenka's expense. Most recently, she defeated the Belarusian at the 2025 WTA Finals, 6-3, 7-6 (0).Like last year's Australian Open final, Sabalenka won the second set but ultimately lost the match (to Madison Keys). The 27-year-old has reached four of the last five Grand Slam title bouts, but won only one (the 2025 US Open).“Thank you to my team for always being there, for enjoying me losing finals!” Sabalenka said with a smile during her runner-up speech. “But also sometimes to win them.”

Rybakina broke serve in the very first game of the match, then a holding pattern ensued until Sabalenka broke—at love—in the very last game of the second set.The Kazakh's eventual rally in the decider was all the more surprising given Sabalenka's pedigree on this surface: the last time she wasn't playing for a hard-court major was the 2022 US Open.“It's hard to find words but I want to congratulate Aryna for amazing results for a couple of years,” said Rybakina. “I know it's tough, but I hope we're going to play many more finals together.”

Neither player dropped a set before this final—the first time that's happened in a Grand Slam tournament since Venus and Serena Williams clashed for the 2008 Wimbledon title.Rybakina didn't have to be perfect to win this final, but she was close to flawless when it mattered most.

Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai, who last played a Grand Slam together at Wimbledon in 2022, reunited at the Australian Open to win the title. Mertens now has six Grand Slams, three in Australia, while Zhang has three. They defeated Danilina and Krunic in straight sets, with Mertens reclaiming the World No. 1 ranking.

Before entering this year's Australian Open, Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai had not shared a Grand Slam court since finishing as runners-up at Wimbledon in 2022. But a reunion for the two paid immediate dividends in Melbourne, ending a four-year gap between their major appearances as a pair.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

On Saturday, the Belgian-Chinese duo defeated Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic 7-6(4), 6-4 to win what is a ninth Grand Slam doubles title between them -- in just their seventh career event on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz as a pair.

"This is second time play together at the Grand Slam," Zhang said. "First time we make to the final, and this time we got the trophy. Very special. We show every team how good we are. We played so many great teams and then so many great singles player, doubles player. We played everything."

Mertens now holds six Grand Slam doubles titles, three of which have been captured in Melbourne. While Zhang secured her previous major trophies alongside the now-retired Samantha Stosur at the 2019 Australian Open and 2021 US Open, Mertens has now won a doubles major in each of the past three seasons. With the victory, Mertens is set to reclaim the No. 1 spot in the PIF WTA Rankings on Monday.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

"It's been definitely a good couple of months, especially on the Grand Slams and the WTA Finals," Mertens said. "I knew if we would win the semis, that I would be No. 1 again, so that was definitely a motivation to do well.

"Of course I was not really thinking about the spot. I was thinking about this trophy in the first place, but it does mean a lot. It's something to do well in singles and doubles, but to be No. 1 in something, it's amazing."

The No. 4 seeds pulled away against the No. 7 seeds -- who were contesting their second major final together after finishing as runners-up at Roland Garros last spring -- after coming from 4-1 behind in the first set. A four-game run put them in front, and despite failing to convert two set points in the 12th game, a 6-0 tiebreak lead proved enough of a margin earn them the set on a seventh set point. They later stormed out to a 5-0 lead in the second set, and needed almost every bit of that cushion. They didn't wrap up the win until five games later -- and after two championship points slipped away at 5-2.

In addition to the Wimbledon fortnight at which they finished as runners-up to Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova, Mertens and Zhang were also finalists in Birmingham that year. On the way to their first-ever team title, they saved three match points in the second round against teenagers Iva Jovic and Victoria Mboko in a match they won 7-5, 4-6, 7-6[10].

Currently ranked World No. 6, Mertens was assured of getting back to World No. 1 regardless of the final result. She will log her 40th week on top next week.

The championship duo will be a pairing for the foreseeable future, with their next tournaments scheduled to be at the WTA 1000s in Doha and Dubai.

"That's the plan for the moment," Mertens said. "The result was here this week, we feel confident to play with each other. We were confident. We trust each other."

Mertens now has six Grand Slams, three in Australia, while Zhang has three. They defeated Danilina and Krunic in straight sets, with Mertens reclaiming the World No. 1 ranking.

After producing Houdini-like escapes in the semi-finals, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are now seeking their own piece of history in Sunday's Australian Open final. Separated by 16 years, Alcaraz and Djokovic stand on opposite ends of their career, pursuing vastly different milestones.


The 22-year-old Alcaraz is aiming to become the youngest player to complete the Career Grand Slam. In his way is the 38-year-old Djokovic, the most decorated men's Grand Slam champion in history. The Serbian boasts as many Australian Open trophies as he does losses (10) at the season's first major and now seeks to become the oldest champion in tournament history.


“History is on the line for both of us every time we play,” Djokovic said of his rivalry with Alcaraz. “The final of a Grand Slam, there's a lot at stake, but it's no different from any other big match that I play.”


The highly anticipated final also begs the question: Which player can dig into his deepest reserves and rise for one more effort? Alcaraz on Friday won the longest semi-final in tournament history, ousting last year's finalist Alexander Zverev in a five-hour, 27-minute thriller. “We pushed our bodies to the limit,” the Spaniard said afterwards.


Meanwhile, Djokovic survived two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner after four hours and nine minutes, an instant classic that the Serbian described as “one of [my] best performances in the last decade or so”. 


Who can deliver one more heroic effort?


“Biologically, I think it's going to be a bit easier for him to recover,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. “My preparation is as it should be, and I won against him last year here, also in a gruelling match. Let's see how fresh we both are able to be.”


Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in their most recent encounter at last year's US Open, yet was full of praise for the Serbian's physicality after the match, saying “He looks 25 years old physically, so to maintain that level at 38, it's impressive”.


The margins between Alcaraz and Djokovic have been razor thin throughout their inter-generational rivalry. Just 12 months ago, Djokovic downed Alcaraz inside Rod Laver Arena, where they will battle Sunday, beginning at 7:30 p.m. local time / 3:30 a.m. ET / 9:30 a.m. CET. Djokovic leads Alcaraz 5-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but has dropped three of their five encounters at the majors.

After falling to Alcaraz in New York last September, Djokovic spoke candidly about facing Alcaraz and Sinner, who together have combined to win the past eight majors.

“It will be very difficult for me in the future to overcome the hurdle of Sinner, Alcaraz, in the best-of-five on the Grand Slams,” Djokovic admitted at the time. “I think I have a better chance at best of three, but best of five, it's tough.”

But as Djokovic reminded on-court interviewer Jim Courier on Friday, he said it would be “difficult, but not impossible”. 

With a $4,150,000 champion's payout at stake, the showdown between Djokovic and Alcaraz promises to be a tug of war from the baseline. If last year's clash in Melbourne is any guide, Alcaraz and Djokovic will take large cuts at the ball and lean on first-strike tennis, dictating play with ferocious hitting. Look for both players to stretch their opponent corner to corner, testing the physical capacity of their rival in the early stages.

Return points could prove decisive, potentially swinging momentum and making all the difference. In their most recent meeting, Djokovic won just 16 per cent (8/50) of his first-serve return points, less than half of what Alcaraz achieved at 34 per cent (19/56) en route to a straight-sets win.
Regardless of who wins, the record books will be rewritten.
"I look forward to it," Djokovic said. "I play tennis competitively mainly to be able to reach the finals of Grand Slams."
Alcaraz added: "I am really happy to play my first final in Melbourne. It was something I was chasing a lot, pursuing a lot — having the chance to fight for the title."

Novak Djokovic is now one win away from clinching his 11th Australian Open title—and making tennis history—after taking down two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in a thriller on Rod Laver Arena.Djokovic had to dig deep over the course of five sets and more than four hours to prevail 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 against his generational rival. Along the way, he snapped five-match losing streak to the 24-year-old Italian that stretched back to 2023. That run included three Grand Slam semifinal defeats—at the 2024 Australian Open, 2025 Roland Garros and 2025 Wimbledon—making Friday night's victory all the more significant."I wouldn't dare to call it (my) finest ever, but definitely the finest in the last couple of years," Djokovic said of his semifinal performance. "Under the circumstances, in semis against Sinner, who has been playing best tennis of his life in last couple of years, particularly here, two-time defending champion? It doesn't get better than this."Read More: Carlos Alcaraz battles into first Australian Open final with marathon win over ZverevThe 24-time Grand Slam champion—who lost in the semifinals at all four majors last year—now has a chance to break his title tie with Australian legend Margaret Court.

Standing in his way is world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, setting up a blockbuster rematch of the 2024 Wimbledon final and the Paris Olympics gold-medal match. The 22-year-old Spaniard advanced earlier in the day after a marathon battle with No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev, edging through 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5 in nearly five and a half hours."I look forward to it," Djokovic said. "Look, I play tennis competitively mainly to be able to reach the finals of Grand Slams. Here I am, so I cannot complain about anything.

Defending champion Sinner seized control early with a commanding display in the opening set. Djokovic began to find his rhythm late in that first set and carried the momentum into the second, coming out aggressively to level the match.

The world No. 2 leaned heavily on his powerful serve to maintain control. Sinner struck 26 aces, landed 75 percent of his first serves (100 of 133) and won 80 percent of those points across five sets. But Djokovic, widely regarded as one of the greatest returners in the game, continued to probe for openings and apply pressure whenever opportunities arose.Sinner appeared poised to break through in the final set, earning eight break points across three different Djokovic service games—including a tense moment at 4-3, when the Serbian trailed 0-40 as Sinner pushed to recover the lone break of serve. Staring down the prospect of a decisive super tiebreak, Djokovic held his nerve, saving three break points on his way to closing out the victory.Djokovic has now won 17 of his last 18 four- and five-set matches at the Australian Open. His only loss in that span came against Sinner in the 2024 semifinals.

Melania Trump's new Amazon MGM documentary — the most expensive in history  — is even beating out Jason Statham's new action for a third-place finish behind 'Send Help' and 'Iron Lung' after galvanizing older conservative females and earning an A-CinemaScore. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Following a campaign targeting targeting older conservatives that was topped off by Thursday night's premiere in Washington D.C. attended by President Donald Trump and packed with his acolytes, the first lady's documentary Melania is opening to the best numbers in a decade for a documentary with a better-than-expected $8 million or more.


	If that sunny forecast holds, the film will come in No. 3 behind fellow newcomers Send Help and Iron Lung after icing out Jason Statham's new action pic, Shelter. No one saw that coming, with many suggesting Melania was a bomb before it even opened based on empty, or nearly empty, seat maps in cinemas across the country. The pic is galvanizing conservatives in the South and South-central part of the country, and specifically older females over the age of 55, who made up 72 percent of the opening-day audience. And a stunning 78 percent of all ticket buyers were 55 and older.

					'Melania' Doc Premieres in D.C. as Director Brett Ratner Says $75 Million Price Tag "Wasn't About Corruption"		
			









	Yet all bets are off when it comes to comparisons given the context around Melania, which is directed by the controversial filmmaker Brett Ratner. For one, Amazon MGM Studios plunked down $40 million for worldwide licensing rights in a deal widely seen as a move to cozy up to the White House. It's also a play for Amazon's streaming service, Prime, where it could debut close to President's Day weekend (it could remain in theaters as well). Whatever the case, it makes Melania the most expensive doc in history.

	











	And that's before Amazon spent $35 million on a global marketing campaign for the PG-rated film. A domestic theatrical campaign for even the biggest docs generally runs no more than $5 million to $7 million. There are exceptions, including former vice president Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Sources say the domestic marketing spend was close to $15 million on each of those titles because of the awards factor, not adjusted for inflation. Both picked up the Oscar for best picture. 


	Almost two decades later, Moore's Oscar-winning Fahrenheit 9/11 remains the top-grossing doc of all time among any genre, not just political, and still holds the record for top openings. Fahrenheit debuted to $23.9 million domestically from 868 theaters on its way to a North American cume of $119.2 million and $222 million globally, not adjusted for inflation.


Melania is clearly benefiting by promotion from the bully pulpit, as the President Trump entreats his followers to see the film, while grassroots marketing campaigns from conservative groups are expected to send moviegoers to theaters in red-leaning states and top markets, such as Orange County in California.


	Critics are trashing the doc, as reflected by its current 6 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. Many box office pundits say Trump supporters expect negative reviews from what they consider to the left-leaning media. Indeed, audiences gave Melania an A Cinemascore, while its audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is a stellar 98 percent, the highest of any film in the top 10 this weekend.

	











	Heading into the weekend, tensions were high. Melania was tracking to open in the $5 million range from 1,778 theaters, or at least enough to beat the $5 million debut of Angel Studios' doc After Death from 2,645 theaters in 2023 and claim the best opening for a documentary in a decade. But exhibitors weren't so convinced, based on sluggish ticket sales and an endless stream of social posts showing auditoriums where only a smattering of tickets had been sold (it's hard to remember a non-concert doc that's been so scrutinized in terms of its opening number). Some cinema owners downgraded their projections to as low as $2 million to $4 million. By Friday afternoon, almost every Hollywood studio showed Melania coming in between $8 million to $9 million after looking at matinee and early evening grosses and consulting with exhibitors.


	The decision to open Melania in more than 20 markets overseas, where Prime Video has a huge footprint, was a bold move, considering how controversial of a figure her husband is. He's presently in a tussle with South Africa, where a distributor pulled Melania from release earlier this week. And there's been a torrent of bad press coming out of Europe regarding empty theaters (just as in the U.S.).


	From Amazon's point of view, ponying up $40 million and $35 million on marketing is part of making good on its promise to become a major theatrical player and help struggling cinemas with a varied slate of product, alongside servicing its streaming customers. Since it is a doc, Melania may only play exclusively in cinemas for two weekends (or at least 10 days). While Amazon is more inoculated from churn than rival streaming services, it still has to attract new subs, along with feeding its conservative-leaning Prime members. And it will get two marketing campaigns for the price of one by going relatively quickly to the home, a popular tactic across all of Hollywood.

	











Melania is opening opposite a slew of films, including 20th Century's Rachel McAdams thriller Send Help, the Sam Raimi-directed title that now looks to open $16 million or $18 million domestically, likewise ahead of expectations after earning a glowing 93 percent critics score and 89 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. 


	The darkly comic horror-thriller stars McAdams and Dylan O'Brien as coworkers stranded on a desert island. According to THR‘s review, the R-rated pic “boasts an audacious concept that is superbly realized by Raimi's filmmaking, which milks every bizarre situation for all it's worth.”


	In a second twist, indie pic Iron Lung from Mark Fischbach (aka the Markiplier) of YouTube gaming fame, is also tipped to open in that range. At least one rival studio is showing it coming in ahead of Send Help; box office observers say it will all come down to how front-loaded Iron Lung is. The film, helmed by Fischbach in his directorial debut, is based on the submarine simulation horror game of the same name that was developed and published by David Szymanski, who helped with the film's screenplay and makes a cameo.


	Disney's 2025 year-end holiday holdovers Zootopia 2 and Statham's Shelter, which is coming in on the low end of expectations with $5 million.

A disheveled panhandler, clutching a Santa hat and sporting a terrible fake beard, sits on a curbside, flanked by minimalist holiday decorations out of place with the glaring summer sunlight. A smartly dressed man, surrounded by bodyguards, strides up and lays the following introduction on the audience: “Boss, you've been working undercover as a homeless man for six months now to investigate your uncle's crimes. Now that your uncle's in prison, it's time for you to return to the Jones Group.” You see, the bearded man isn't actually homeless. He's the title character of Found A Homeless Billionaire Husband For Christmas, an ideal example of a vertical drama—a type of shortform, phone-native, movie-like content produced by companies claiming millions upon millions of American users, all while being deeply exploitative trash. 

The world of vertical dramas is an addictive, algorithm-powered economy with unbelievable dollar totals and salacious, absurd films with titles like In Love With A Single Farmer-Daddy or Help! My Hot Boss Has My Nudes! This all-too-real niche has been popularized over the last few years by a handful of Chinese-backed American corporations, producing content that is utterly alien in composition and laughably amateurish in execution, in pursuit of maximum profit. It might be the most purely cynical form of entertainment currently in production; concepts formulated and pitched by robots to other robots, to separate humans from dollars.

The typical vertical drama is a three-act feature between 90 and 100 minutes, chopped up into 60 to 80 chunks, which are referred to as “episodes,” as if you're watching the fastest, bluntest TV series ever made. In the U.S., a few dozen competing companies produce indistinguishable vertical dramas this way, but the two biggest are ReelShort and DramaBox, each of which claims more than 50 million unique monthly users. If they're to be believed, vertical dramas are the most popular films being made today.



 

The defining feature of each vertical drama mini-chunk is the rise and fall of tension over the 90- to 120-second cycle: Characters appear with subtitled descriptions of who they are, as voiceovers announce “I'm ____, and I feel ____ about ____.” These characters converse, argue or flirt, a threat arises (such as the reveal of a secret identity or a potential humiliation), and then it cuts to a brief black-screen cliffhanger. The next “episode” begins, the hurdle is instantly overcome, and the process starts again. The entire thing is predicated upon the viewer not remembering the previous rug-pull that happened two minutes earlier, and two minutes before that. It's the apex of goldfish-brain entertainment, taking the ethos of an old Flash Gordon serial and distilling it into content consumed in marathon sessions.

ReelShort's slogan boasts that “every second is drama,” and that the company's mission is to create “fast-paced drama for busy women,” among other things. Indeed, it quickly becomes obvious that women are overwhelmingly the target demographic, although nailing down a generational window is more tricky. The gamified, “coin”-based economy involved in purchasing these vertical dramas smacks of the mobile game addiction common to Gen X and Boomers, but the style of content reaches far past your aunt who has sunk $20,000 into Candy Crush Saga, displaying more prominent Gen Z hallmarks, like universally hardcoded subtitles. Perhaps the most important descriptor is “busy,” which could just as easily be “attention deficient.” Ads depict scenarios like a woman getting into an elevator and having just enough time to watch the next 90-second episode before continuing on with her day. If that sounds suspiciously similar to the pitch for Quibi, it's not far off—but replacing the A-list stars, ambition, and big budgets with non-actors, laughable production standards, and salacious premises.

Vertical dramas were born in China (where they're referred to as duanju) during the 2010s, before exploding into widespread popularity there during the quarantine era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The leading production/exhibition companies in the U.S., like ReelShort and DramaBox, trace their ownership back to Chinese conglomerates, and much of the content has itself been transliterated from film scripts originally written in Chinese or Korean, with American production teams employed to hastily localize the stories. The almighty algorithm rules everything: If any given vertical drama proves popular, the companies immediately greenlight several more that repeat it almost verbatim, right down to confusingly similar titles. And this doesn't just apply to broad themes—vertical drama producers also identify small, individual elements or story beats (such as a woman being bullied and slapped) and then repeat that element in every production until it stops driving engagement. This gives your average vertical drama an intense feeling of uncanny familiarity once you've watched a few. Repetition is a feature; the core consumer apparently just wants more of the same.

To feed that addiction, they're going to pay through the nose. Vertical drama apps are built to obfuscate the sense of how much you're paying, with “coins” purchased in bulk, in amounts from hundreds to thousands. Individual episodes might cost upward of 60 coins per two-minute piece of footage—and given that each drama has 70 or more episodes, this means the viewer can easily spend $20 or $30 to watch 90 minutes of some of the cheapest slop imaginable. People are paying much more to watch Tricked Into Having My Ex-Husband's Baby on their phones than it would cost to see Sinners in IMAX. 

It's difficult to trust the markers of popularity vertical drama producers boast about. Viewership metrics often seem absurd or impossible—already a common experience with streamers, which tend to withhold view numbers, or speak in vague and misleading terms about how many people are watching. Vertical dramas, on the other hand, tend to directly provide extremely gaudy viewership numbers: The Washington Post wrote that ReelShort's How To Tame A Silver Fox had been “watched 356 million times,” which would work out to more than one view for every member of the U.S. population. ReelShort now claims “393.5 million” views for that film. Is it more likely that How To Tame A Silver Fox is one of the most beloved and widely viewed films in human history, or that ReelShort has added together the views of the 70+ “episodes” to reach that final number? This number-fudging isn't even necessary: If you divided by 70, it would still imply more than 5.6 million views for this single vertical drama, which is a shocking enough figure. But the companies can't help themselves from aggrandizing these accomplishments.



Vertical dramas are also dirt cheap and lightning fast to make—we're talking budgets of $100,000, and filming schedules of a week or less, allowing a project to progress from pitch to release in the space of a few months. Pay for most of the performers is necessarily low, but it's still enticing to those looking to break into the industry, and there's no shortage of obvious non-actors supplementing their ranks in every production. The monolithic players of the entertainment industry, meanwhile, are clearly paying attention to the lucrative nature of vertical dramas, which would seemingly disprove the need for massive budgets, CGI, or star power. Disney made DramaBox one of the participants in its 2025 Accelerator Program, “to help Disney innovate in short-form content, with plans to adapt Disney's book properties into these bite-sized series for new audiences, focusing on emotional hooks and rapid production for platforms like TikTok and Reels.” Netflix has likewise already stated its intention to produce more vertical video content, which has thus far been interpreted as some kind of plan to ape TikTok. Consider instead, the possibility of an entire wing of Netflix's mobile app dedicated to vertical dramas.

If millions of Americans are consuming vertical dramas on a daily basis, what exactly are they watching? The answer is a hodgepodge of genres, primarily fitting into romance, fantasy, and thriller buckets. Subcategories include everything from “wallflower” to “janitor,” “protective husband,” “twisted lover,” “chef,” “super warrior,” “CEO,” and “rugged CEO,” which ReelShort separates into an entirely distinct category. Some titles reek of crude translations (Marry To Top Star At 40s) or keyword-cramming (Forced Into An Arranged Marriage, Only To Find Her Fiancé's Uncle Is Her Now-Successful Ex).

These stories ape the zeitgeist, whether that means Hallmark-style holiday features, costume-driven royal intrigue stories, kink-centric workplace dramas, or timeless fantasies of being whisked away from mundanity by a fabulously wealthy man who can solve all of life's problems. Most any sports niche is also well covered—especially hockey, even in advance of the viral success of Heated Rivalry. The most common approach appeals to women with fetishes for being controlled by dangerous, violent men with the most slight of redeeming qualities. This dynamic is especially present in the “mafia” and “mob” genres, in which mousy heroines find themselves abducted or indentured into the service of chiseled male mafiosos who occasionally threaten them with death or torture, but also possess secret hearts of gold. He may be a prolific murderer, but he also tells the female lead that “you make me want to be a better man.” A number of these stories involve women being forced to abandon their lives, only to be transformed into contented tradwives for powerful men. Titles in this niche include Bound By Honor: Kidnapped By The Mafia King, My Sugar-Coated Mafia Boss, and Falling For My Ex's Mafia Dad, the latter of which doubles as an example of the prolific subgenre in which young women are enchanted by older men connected to their families or former lovers. These are countered by the “reverse harem” films, in which a woman is courted by a squad of hot, single-trait guys.

Romantasy is also a major player, but it goes beyond simple mimicry of A Court Of Thorns And Roses—the very style of romantasy prose influences how almost all vertical dramas handle the protagonist's perspective. Universal, audible inner monologues coax the viewer to insert themselves into the fantasy. The ReelShort category “Magic & Mates” spins more variations on women indentured to werewolf “alphas” than you could possibly imagine.

Then there are the aforementioned “billionaire” stories, which involve 27-year-old captains of industry masquerading as janitors or vagrants, only to fall in love with gig economy workers unaware of their secret wealth. These dramas dare to ask, “Could you possibly forgive the man you're dating when he reveals that he's one of the richest people on the planet?” Morally, this subgenre is never quite what you expect: Rather than conveying the idea that even homeless people are real people, with dignity, the message is that you shouldn't judge these men because they might turn out to be secretly more powerful and wealthy than you. Vertical drama billionaires are also universally outfitted with the most hilariously slapdash facial hair ever committed to screen. The men all start out looking like they've just walked out of Spirit Halloween so there can be a scene where he “shaves” and debuts his babyfaced perfection.



One element unites these disparate subgenres: They revolve around sex, but are sexless in execution. Even vertical dramas directly ripping off sexually explicit romantasy series remove actual sex or nudity, perhaps to get around accusations of pornography that could threaten their viability in app stores. Instead, viewers are teased by the constant insinuation of sex, or the occasional encounter that is interrupted or somehow supposed to have happened while two characters are fully clothed, and many “morning after” scenes. Shirtless men and hunks wrapped in towels dominate the proceedings, and even films in the erotica category (Swallow Me Whole, Surrender To My Professor, Submitting To My Ex's Dad) are less sexual than a daytime soap. Bizarrely, though, there's no such skittishness about language; even innocuous films are riddled with F-bombs.

Even when you've grasped the narratives' combination of trashy and saccharine, you'll still be entirely unprepared for how they look and sound. Vertical dramas make Ed Wood and Tommy Wiseau films look like Oscar bait. They don't even have the infamy-generating advantage, as in the case of something like The Room or Plan 9 From Outer Space, of having been the product of a delusional artist's singular vision. Rather, these are cynical, mass-produced products from studios that simply do not give a damn.

The most basic limitations of shooting an entire feature film vertically, for native playback on phones—composition, blocking, cinematography—are luxuries you can't afford when you know your viewer is watching on a screen too small to make out fine details. This leads vertical dramas to focus their shots on static characters and their faces, which often end up cropped by sides of the screen anyway. Rare action scenes involve fistfights that sprawl out of the frame, leading to the audience missing half of each movement. Punches whiff their intended target by a foot or more, but are sold by the intended recipient anyway because they know there will be no second take. The same idea applies to the vertical drama philosophy around lighting, which is “no lighting.” Sets are reused repeatedly, with the same low-ceilinged office building unconvincingly doubling as everything from a fancy restaurant, to an airport terminal, to a mansion. 

This absence of basic professionalism pales in comparison to the aesthetic choices wielded by the sound teams. Dialogue goes from crisp, to muffled, to echoey from scene to scene. Clearly ADR'd lines fly in out of nowhere at twice the volume of the other dialogue. Some vertical dramas are suffused with obnoxious stock music; others have no music at all, which might be worse. One mob drama, filled with gunfire and digitally added muzzle flashes, has zero gunshot sound effects. Yet, nearly every vertical drama is full of inexplicable sound effects unrelated to anything happening on screen. Every conversation is punctuated in a style that mimics obnoxious reality TV—someone finishes a sentence, then there's a bwip like a drop of water falling into a bucket, without any indication of what that is meant to imply. Every 30 seconds or so, one of these sound effects will be employed, whether it's a cartoony sproing, or the shwing of a kung fu movie sword slicing through the air. Rarely are they relevant. It's like a wheel is being spun, and a soundboard is being hit at random. Their blatant, torrential misuse begins to feel like an aural hallucination, and is so omnipresent that you'll find Reddit threads of people trying to understand what they could possibly mean.

Why does the consumer not demand better, considering the incredible expense? Are the people paying $20 a pop aware that there are actual feature films out there—many of them free to access—brimming with the genuine titillation and payoff that vertical dramas are denying them, not to mention bonuses like professional actors? How did these companies unearth such a large user base of people who like romantasy, but wish it contained no fantasy, no sex, and no action? This cognitive dissonance rears its head in the comments of vertical dramas that are uploaded in full or in parts to external sites like YouTube—people dunk on the abysmal quality, while admitting that they can't stop watching. The addictive urge is especially present for incomplete stories: People insist that it isn't worth paying for, while simultaneously begging for tips about where they can find it uploaded in full. It is an audience at war with itself, furtively ashamed at its own fixation.

One area where they're united, though, springs from the form itself—a style of content that blatantly steals IP and assigns no value to originality. One of the highest-rated vertical dramas on IMDb, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, has somehow been below the notice of Taylor Swift's attorneys. Yellowstone: King Of Montana is an amalgam of every Taylor Sheridan show. Many of the “mafia” dramas even steal the title font of The Godfather. It makes sense then that piracy of vertical dramas is rampant, with any given film being endlessly stolen and reuploaded in every corner of the web you could think of, and some you would never suspect. Search for Found A Homeless Billionaire Husband For Christmas on Google, and you might expect ReelShort's original version to be a top result. Instead, you'll stumble upon users who have uploaded the full 90-minute film everywhere else, starting with a YouTube version in the wrong aspect ratio with garbled sound, which has still amassed more than 1.5 million views. The same film can also be found uploaded in full on Dailymotion and even as a 90-minute Facebook reel on a user's personal page. That Facebook user has uploaded countless vertical dramas in their entirety, and no one seems to notice or care. Theft is the native tongue of this subculture, baked into the experience at a foundational level, powered by the ravenous imperative to consume.

It's fitting that the vertical drama user base has no qualms about stealing and republishing this content, when the very form itself relies on that type of thievery in order to satisfy the ravenous demand for escapist storytelling among audiences. It's not that the drive to broad escapism is difficult to understand, but a side effect of this particularly bizarre and hyper-commercialized caricature of escape—the simple act of rotating a screen 90 degrees—has upended the traditional conception of filmmaking and birthed something hideous, exploitative, insulting, and somehow still addictive in its place.

Jennifer Hudson, Kesha and John Legend were also among those paying homage to Carey at the annual fundraiser.

	With 19 No. 1 smashes on the Billboard Hot 100 spanning four decades and nine more that reached the top 10, there was no way that performers could even scratch the surface of Mariah Carey's voluminous catalog of hits Friday night (Jan. 30) when she was honored as MusiCares' Person of the Year in Los Angeles, but they gave it a try.

	To be sure, tackling songs by one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time is not for the faint of heart and add on the nerves of performing in front of said vocalist and credit is due for any of the artists who even felt up to the task. In general, the performers fell into three buckets: Belters, devotees and innovators.

Jennifer Hudson, who opened the show with a medley of Carey's hits, including “Vision of Love” and “Make It Happen,” obviously fell in the belter category, as one of the few vocalists with the mighty prowess to power through Carey's hits. It was an audacious beginning that surely did nothing to quell any butterflies subsequent performers may have had.


	Also falling squarely in the belter class were Kesha with a spiky version of the swaggering “Obsessed,” Adam Lambert, who delivered an expressive, heartwrenching take on “Can't Let Go” from the B stage in the middle of the floor, and Teddy Swims, who built his way up to the full force of Harry Nilsson's “Without You,” a rare case of a Carey cover.

	











	The devotees smartly didn't try to match Carey's pyrotechnics, instead delivered sturdy, sweet homages that were reverential in the best possible way from Charlie Puth's emotional “I Still Believe,” John Legend's piano and string-laden inspired version of “Hero” and trio FLO's gorgeous rendition of “Dreamlover.”


	The innovators were led by the Foo Fighters, with The Pretty Reckless' Taylor Momsen on lead vocals as the make-shift unit provided the most creative and revelatory performance of the night. They delivered electrifying versions of two songs from Carey's grunge (yes, you read that right) album, Someone's Ugly Daughter, which she recorded in 1995 under the name Chick with a different singer taking lead vocals. They powered through the heavy “Hermit” and the poppier “Love Is a Scam” with thrashing verve. The Foos' guitarist Pat Smear, who had been sidelined with a broken foot when the band played a benefit two weeks ago, is such an avid Carey fanboy that he returned to the stage, playing seated with his broken appendage in a cast and extended.


	Maggie Rogers didn't upend her version of “Honey” in quite so drastic a fashion, but she started the tune as a languid slow groove before turning up the heat. Billy Porter, who also proved to be one of the style icons of the night with a straightened ombre bob, glittery eye shadow and a floor-length white and gold duster over gold velvet pants, freestyled through a compelling take on “Always Be My Baby,”  while Icelandic sensation Laufey delivered a jazzy, rhythmic rendition of “It's Like That” that felt fresh and innovative.


	Instead of a single host, a number of artists introduced the singers, though it seemed a lost opportunity to have top-tier acts including Stevie Wonder (who teasingly held a harmonica the whole time as if he were going to play at any second), Babyface, Richard Marx and (especially) SZA only speak instead of perform.

	











	Universal Music Publishing Group chairman/CEO Jody Gerson introduced Carey, declaring, “I would argue that she is the architect of the modern pop vocal,” while also praising Carey's songcraft. “Her songs are structurally sophisticated with key changes, extended bridges, modulations and unconventional phrasing,” she continued. “She blends pop accessibility with R&B, gospel and hip-hop songwriting traditions in ways that open the door to genre fluid pop, especially for female artists who follow. Mariah is not only one of the most successful songwriters in popular music history, she is, quite simply, one of the very best.”


	Carey, who follows such past honorees as Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen and Dolly Parton, called the evening “overwhelming in the best possible way,” as she looked around the room, commenting how blessed she felt to be surrounded by “so many friendly and familiar faces, people I've worked with, people I've long admired, even people I thought I'd never see again,” adding the last part with a laugh.


	In addition to her musical accomplishments, Carey was also honored for her philanthropy, for which she is renown. She has supported many charities related to disaster relief, HIV/AIDS education and Make-A-Wish, and also founded in 1995 Camp Mariah, her eponymous summer camp she runs in conjunction with the Fresh Air Fund.


	She stressed the importance of continuing to give back generously to MusiCares, which serves as the Recording Academy's philanthropic arm and is dedicated to helping those in the music community. “But tonight is not only about me, it's about this incredible organization, MusiCares, whether it's providing health care, financial support or simply offering a shoulder to lean on, MusiCares reminds us that behind all the glitz and glamor, there are real people who need care and community… We have to remember this organization thrives because of generosity, yours, mine, ours.”

	











	The evening closed the only way it possibly could: Even though Christmas is in the rearview mirror and it was 85 degrees in Los Angeles on Friday, Jon Batiste led several of the performers and presenters, including Kesha, Puth, Porter, FLO, Rita Wilson and Gayle King, in a spirited rendition of Carey's holiday classic, “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” complete with a wintery, snow-laden backdrop. Though honorees have the option to perform — most recently, both Jon Bon Jovi and The Grateful Dead did a handful of numbers — Carey opted to limit her participation to the second half of “All I Want for Christmas,” joining the merry carolers on stage as the evening concluded.

Padraic McKinley's “The Weight” is a throwback to a bygone era of moviemaking, starring Ethan Hawke as a man on a mission to escape a work camp in 1930s Oregon and reunite with his daughter. It's filled with viscerally thrilling set pieces that look far more expensive than they actually are, providing retro adventure thrills on an indie scale. 

Ahead of the film‘s Sundance premiere, McKinley and stars Ethan Hawke, Julia Jones, and Austin Amelio visited the IndieWire Studio, presented by Dropbox, to break down the influences that shaped one of the festival's most exciting films. 

 










“It's an old-school adventure movie,” McKinley said of the film. “It's got a lot of heart, and hopefully it's a throwback to the kind of movies we all liked, analog action-adventure films.”

Hawke echoed those sentiments, explaining that he wanted to make a film about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. 

“I love what Pat just said, it's analog,” Hawke said. “It's not an action movie full of superhumans, it's an action movie full of humans going through really human situations. It's very simple. It's the kind of action movie I grew up loving, and we challenged ourselves to see if we could make one that simple and that classic.”

 










Which specific movies inspired McKinley and the team? Hawke provided a list of adventure classics and character-driven dramas, citing the work of filmmaking masters like William Friedkin and John Huston and legendary leading men Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. 

“‘Sorcerer' is one we love to mention, but ‘Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' there's aspects of ‘Cool Hand Luke.' I always loved that Newman/McQueen action hero that was a real person, character-driven drama. A guy who doesn't need to say too much, but gets things done.”

You can watch IndieWire's complete conversation with the team behind “The Weight” in the video above. 

Dropbox is proud to partner with IndieWire and the Sundance Film Festival. In 2026, 68% of feature films premiering at Sundance used Dropbox during production. Dropbox helps filmmakers and creative teams find, organize, secure, and share the content that matters most to any project.

Hollywood continues to mourn the tragic loss of Catherine O'Hara. The Emmy-winning actress passed away on January 30, “following a brief illness,” according to TMZ. She was 71.

Catherine was the second youngest of seven siblings—Marc, Maureen, Patricia, Michael, Tom, and Mary Margaret. Among her three sisters, Mary Margaret was the one who got into the entertainment industry.

Here are five fast facts to know about Catherine's beloved sister, Mary Margaret.

Mary Margaret and Catherine grew up in a large Irish Catholic family in Toronto. The sisters shared a close relationship, even after pursuing different career paths.

During Catherine's induction into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2007, Mary Margaret famously performed a touching serenade for the actress.

Catherine previously admitted she was ‘grateful' her parents gave her six siblings, allowing them to navigate the loss of both parents together.

“[I was] especially grateful … that they had given us each other because we were all together,” she said in an interview with “Wiser Than Me” podcast. “They had seven kids … And that they that just seemed like the most beautiful gift that they'd given us each other to be with.”

Mary Margaret studied music at the Ontario College of Art and Design and was signed by Virgin Records. In 1988, she released her only full-length solo album, “Miss America.”

The album was widely considered a masterpiece, with The Guardian calling Mary Margaret a “cult hero.”

Aside from her album, she released a “Christmas” EP in 1992 and contributed songs to the film “Apartment Hunting” in 2001.

Mary Margaret's music inspired some of the biggest names in the industry. During a concert in 1999, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe brought O'Hara on stage and dubbed her a “national treasure.” Other musicians who are fans of the singer include Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Dave Matthews, Morrissey, and more.

Mary Margaret studied painting and graphic design at the Ontario College of Art. Her love for art is reflected in her music as she designed the artwork for her own albums and even contributed lettering for other artists.

She also appeared in several films, including the indie drama “Museum Hours” in 2012 and the horror sci-fi “Splice” in 2009.

In 1978, Mary Margaret and her brother, Marcus O'Hara, started the Martian Awareness Ball as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebration in Toronto. To this day, the event continues to be part of the annual festivities, often held at the Horsehoe Tavern.

Itonje Søimer Guttormsen hopes her IFFR film, which also features references to news, including Donald Trump, gives people "courage to live" amid "this apocalyptic feeling" and "insane men ruling the world."


							By

	How is this elevator pitch? The film's title is Butterfly, its setting is Gran Canaria, and its ensemble cast includes none other than best actress Oscar nominee and Sentimental Value star Renate Reinsve. If you're not sold yet, let us mention this plot outline: Two very different and estranged half sisters, laughable performance artist Lily and the much more quiet and restrained Diana, are forced to reunite in their childhood home in Gran Canaria after their parents' deaths, only to inherit an unfinished resort and an esoteric retreat. After all, their uninhibited mother, Vera, worked as a hostess at the resort.

	The second feature from Norwegian writer-director Itonje Søimer Guttormsen (Gritt) just world premiered in the Big Screen Competition of the 55th edition of the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR). Reinsve's The Worst Person in the World co-star Helene Bjørneby, Numan Acar, and Lillian Müller also star.

	For Søimer Guttormsen, it marks a return to IFFR five years after her fiction debut screened in its Tiger Competition. Protagonist Pictures is handling sales on the movie from Mer Film, Quiddity Films, Zentropa International Sweden, and Nord Film and producer Maria Ekerhovd.


Butterfly explores “one of contemporary culture's persistent habits: talking nonsense about ourselves, inventing images and narratives of our lives and even our pasts that may be fanciful at best and often hollow,” notes IFFR festival director Vanja Kaludjercic. And she adds that the filmmaker “finds humor within darker currents, teasing out the vanity, absurdity and everyday strangeness that shape the stories we tell about who we are.”

	











	In an interview with THR, Søimer Guttormsen discussed her inspiration for Butterfly, working with Reinsve and her other cast members, bringing back Gritt lead Birgitte Larsen – yes, as Gritt! – and developing her own film universe, taking on traditional gender roles, and what's next for her.


Where did the idea to tell this story of the family of this butterfly woman, who leads an alternative lifestyle come from?


	It came to me very much from above, like ‘bang!', in 2008. The idea was the story of two sisters being very different, and their mother's crazy journey as they grew up. I started wondering why they were so different. The two sisters came to me very clearly, and then I realized that they grew up in a very strange situation to which they responded very differently. 


	It's funny, though, because I have no relationship with this kind of tourism at all. For holidays, we never went to these places. But Gran Canaria is the most visited place for Norwegians. There's a Norwegian community there. There is a Norwegian church, a Norwegian school. So this is where people either go on holiday or they go there when they're older to [spend their retired] life there.


Does Gran Canaria have a certain reputation in Norway?


	It's very common for Norwegians to go there, but a lot of people tend to hide the fact that they go there. They're a bit embarrassed because it's seen as a bit trashy now. But when I came up with this idea, for me, it was obvious that this woman, coming from the harsh Norwegian working class in the '70s, felt like going there to live a more glamorous life and be a part of this tourism machine that in the '70s was quite glamorous.

	











Things didn't quite remain all that glamorous for her… 


	Yes, she had this breakdown with alcohol. Being very addicted to the male gaze and being this party queen with two children felt adequate. But the funny thing is that when I started go there to research, I met so many women in their 70s now – blonde, beautiful – who really came there as tourists and hosts in their early days, and ended up living in the mountains, being cavewomen and healers. So suddenly, this journey of the mother that I had invented, I found to be quite plausible.


Did you meet any people on the island who ended up in Butterfly? 


	I really wanted to go and work with real people, and work with the island and find people there. So, the film is full of people who played themselves. They are real people. The film is a collage of all of those impulses. 


Also featuring in the film is Gritt from your first movie. How early did you know that she would be part of Butterfly?


	When I worked on that film, it was a long process, 11 years. We made it first as a short film and then had many attempts before the full feature film came out. I felt this is a woman I want to follow until she's old. So, she will be a part of my universe. I want my different films to be in the same universe, so that I can never use the same actor in a different role. So if, let's say, Lily or Diana show up in another feature film, they will be played by the same actress. 


	When I was doing my field work and went back and forth to Gran Canaria for three years, writing this story, I found this location with horses up in the mountains. And I just saw Gritt sitting there, making her embroidery in a chair, with my inner eye. So it was just obvious to me. Also, I had planted a seed in the [first] film that Gritt's mother lives in Gran Canaria.

	











Tell me a bit more about this amazing cast, led by Renate and Helene! 


	That was an amazing process. I like to write for certain actors instead of doing it all in a casting process. When we started the casting, I had just seen The Worst Person in the World. And, of course, I thought Renate was amazing, but I thought she was not hard enough. She was so charming and soft. And I was looking for something else for Lily. So we went through 55 great actors and models, but when I met Renate, I felt differently about her. She definitely gave off a little Lily vibe. And then she really connected with the script and the character.


	This is very Norwegian of me, but I was resisting using such a famous person, although she wasn't that famous back then. I was doubting if this was good for the fiction. So, it took me a long time, three rounds.


	With Helene, it was different because she starred in my graduation film. So we had worked together. I knew that she was an exceptional talent, but she lives in a different place, so I kind of forgot about her a bit. So, I wrote the role for someone else, but then Helene appeared for a screening of Gritt, and we reconnected, and she was just brilliant. And, of course, the two of them had such amazing chemistry.


Watching Butterfly, I thought about the difference between the family you have when you're born and the family you choose, but also trauma related to sexuality, and more themes that all feel interrelated… 


	There are so many themes that have been important for me over time. So I'm curious about which themes you see and the ones the audience notices. But it's all about all of these things. 

	











	I was taught in film school to be precise – there has to be about one thing, there has to be one line. But no, I don't think so, not so much with the films I make. Life is complex. It's all intertwined. At the core, the film is speaking about belonging and mercy and, when you think everything is fucked, the possibility to heal and change and [leave behind] your old truths and reach new [views] of yourself and the other. So it's maybe a film about reconciliation and community.


And transformation?


	Yes, they are very different people at the beginning and at the end. As the mother dies, through her death, I feel she's mothering them post mortem. We don't have to go and reconcile with our mother at the deathbed.


Butterfly includes very timely references, including news reports about U.S. President Donald Trump, refugees, amd supply chain issues due to the war in Ukraine. How important was it for you to root the film in this day and age? 


	Thank you for bringing that up, because it's so important to me. During the edit process, people would suggest we could take out some of that. But for me, it's so important to lean into this reality, this crazy world we're living in now. This crisis is the backdrop of the film. 


	My biggest wish is for this film to give some courage to live. I want people to feel like they want to go and build something together, or have a party or a gathering, invite strangers to dinner. We are in such unstable times, but there is also a possibility to create something new. And in this chaos and cracks, and who knows what's going to be happening next, we can come together and start anew. What we should we do is not focus on this apocalyptic feeling, but celebrate life. That's the best reaction to these stupid, insane men ruling the world now and trying to grab and dominate the world. Have joy, have fun, come together and do not be paralyzed by fear.

	











You mentioned men, and I felt the film commented on the patriarchy and the male gaze. Can you touch on that a little bit?


	In my previous film, Gritt wants to defeat the patriarchy and capitalism. That's her very outspoken mission. In this film, it's more subtle


	Vera is a mother who, as this blonde beauty, was trapped in the role of the pleasing woman. She was very much thriving in the male gaze and addicted to the male gaze, and she transmitted that to her daughters in different ways. 


	Lily is turning into this dark heroin chick, but she's also living off her beauty, and she's also living off men, being the muse for an artist in Hamburg etc. And then you have the other daughter, declining sexuality altogether, being [nearly] allergic to sexuality. This is what they inherit from their mother.


	Chato, the male in the film, is talking about this mother wound as a poisonous notion of being an object instead of a subject, which is part of the patriarchy. He is a catalyst, which I find very positive, because it is not ruling out the men, because I think we need men and women in this healing of the patriarchy.


Do you have any new project in development?


	I have a stage production in the early stages that will be a ritual, because I run this performance group called Lilithistene (The Lilithists), which is inspired by Lilith, the first woman in the Genesis who is [known as Adam's first wife who left Eden to explore the unknown] and was thrown out.


	I'm also working on a new film, which is like a response to this one, which is all over the place and has a lot of dialogue. So this new film takes place at a silent retreat. But it is in the early stages, so I think it will develop – and there will be some speaking.

When news of Catherine O'Hara's passing was announced on Friday, January 30, social media was flooded with tributes. O'Hara was 71 at the time of her death. Candace Cameron Bure was among those who shared their thoughts, and the actress celebrated O'Hara with a short but touching post.

O'Hara's career spanned decades. During her work in the entertainment industry, she met and collaborated with many people and inspired fans and colleagues with her acting. She was so loved. 

Bure made her tribute on her Instagram Stories. The former Hallmark star posted a photo announcing O'Hara's passing from E! News, and in the text over the photo, she shared her thoughts. “I just loved her,” she wrote. “Who didn't?! What a legend.” She ended her message with two broken heart emojis. 

Bure's comments about loving O'Hara have been widely shared, with celebrities including O'Hara's longtime friend and collaborator, Eugene Levy, sharing her sentiments. “Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today. I had the honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years,” Levy said in a statement to People. 

He continued, “From our beginnings on the Second City stage, to SCTV, to the movies we did with Chris Guest, to our six glorious years on Schitt's Creek, I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and the entire O'Hara family.”

Other tributes include one from Dan Levy, Pedro Pascal, “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon, “Home Alone” star Macaulay Culkin, actress Christina Ricci, “Beetlejuice” director Tim Burton, and many more, who have publicly mourned her passing. 

Bure competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 18 in 2014 alongside professional partner Mark Ballas, and placed third on the ABC dance competition. She has had an incredible career and met many people whom she cared about, including her “Full House” co-star Bob Saget. Bure has been open about her grief and remembered Saget with heartfelt posts on Instagram. 

Saget died from head trauma and was found at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando, Florida, on January 9, 2022, People reports. He was 65.

Just three weeks ago, Bure penned a touching post on Instagram in honor of Saget. The actress shared several photos of them together over the years and included her thoughts in the caption. “I miss you. Not just today, but every day,” she wrote.

	The 20-year-old artist tackled the track in-studio alongside his band, just one week after landing inside the top 10 of Australia's annual Hottest 100 countdown himself. Introducing the cover, sombr praised Dean as “a really inspiring and incredible artist,” adding that the song immediately stood out to him.

	“It feels so timeless and I love the production, I love the lyrics,” he said. “Everything about it. Amazing.”


	Originally released by Dean in 2024, “Man I Need” was crowned No. 1 in triple j's Hottest 100 of 2025, marking one of the year's most talked-about wins. Sombr's rendition strips the track back emotionally while reshaping it sonically, layering distorted vocals and a driving indie-rock pulse over the song's core melody.




	The Like a Version appearance marks sombr's debut on the platform and arrives during a breakout period for the New York–based artist. Known for blending alt-pop and indie rock with diaristic, emotionally raw songwriting, sombr has quickly built momentum over the past year with a run of globally resonant releases.


	In 2025, he released his debut studio album I Barely Know Her, a 10-track project co-produced with Tony Berg that explored themes of heartbreak, longing and life in New York City. The album included several of his biggest tracks to date, including “Back to Friends,” which became his breakout global hit and made the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Undressed,” which topped charts in multiple countries, and “12 to 12,” which finished at No. 8 in the Hottest 100.


	His rising profile has also been reflected on the awards circuit, with nominations at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards for best new artist and best alternative (winning in the latter category), alongside a growing slate of high-profile live performances.

When it comes to filming TV shows and films, a common refrain regards the difficulty of shooting with animals. Some animal lovers don't care; for example, Taylor Cole, on the set of Hallmark‘s “Double Scoop,” loved the experience. “I love animals of all kinds, and I bottle-fed a calf, I milked a cow, I held a baby goat,” she told EntertainmentNow in 2025. While that may be true for some animals, Emilie Ullerup had a word of caution when it comes to one creature.

“They say don't work with kids and animals, I say just don't work with donkeys, honestly.” Ullerup told the “Rom-Com Love Podcast” about filming her rom-com “Missing the Boat.” 

In “Missing the Boat,” which premieres on Jan. 31, Ullerup and Kristoffer Polaha play strangers who meet on the same cruise. When they both fail to get back on the boat after stopping at a port, hilarity ensues as they attempt to catch up to it. In one scene in particular, the duo used donkeys to travel. Ullerup said that she lost count of how many takes of the scene they had to do.

“They just kept rolling because I think we stopped yelling ‘cut' and ‘action' because there was no point,” the “Nature of Love” star admitted. “‘Cause that donkey was going to do what that donkey did.”

“We have a scene where we're riding the donkeys, obviously, and we had a drone, which is like a flying camera over us,” she continued. “And they forgot to tell us that my donkey was terrified of drones. So, anytime it came remotely close, it just starts taking off down this hill with a drop-off two meters to my left. And I was like, ‘I have no control of this donkey, and I just hung on for dear life.”

“I just kept yelling, ‘Get that drone away from us! ‘Get that drone away from us!'” she revealed. “And nobody could hear us because they were all so far away.”

One aspect of the donkey scene that viewers might catch is the fact that Polaha's character had a carrot to help keep his donkey from straying. Ullerup said that she was offered a carrot, as well, but she struggled to hold the carrot and guide the donkey. 

“I couldn't control the donkey and the carrot,” she said.

The “Catch of the Day” star can laugh about it now, recognizing that the donkey, the drones, and her yelling made the situation “a movie in itself.”



Darling story! Glad you were ok!!

Hilarious. Hope they got that on camera. Glad no one was hurt but you have to admit it was funny now.

	Earlier on Friday, Jan. 30, news reports announced an upcoming Netflix documentary exploring the early years and success of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the impact of the band's original guitarist Hillel Slovak, who died in 1988 of an accidental heroin overdose. 


	Directed by Ben Feldman, Variety reported that The Rise of the Red Hot Chili Peppers includes input from members Anthony Kiedis and Flea and is set to premiere on March 20. “At its heart, this is a deeply relatable story — about the friendships that shape our identities and the lasting power of the bonds forged in adolescence,” Feldman said in a statement at the time. “What's less relatable, of course, is that here those friends went on to create one of the greatest rock bands in history. I'm profoundly grateful to the band and to Hillel's family for their trust and generosity, and to Netflix for helping bring this story to the world stage.”

	However, following the announcement, the band later released their own statement distancing themselves from the project. “About a year ago, we were asked to be interviewed for a documentary about Hillel Slovak. He was a founding member of the group, a great guitarist, and friend. We agreed to be interviewed out of love and respect for Hillel and his memory,” wrote the band in a post shared on social media. “However, this documentary is now being advertised as a Red Hot Chili Peppers documentary, which it is not,” they clarified. “We had nothing to do with it creatively. We have yet to make a Red Hot Chili Peppers documentary. The central subject of this current Netflix special is Hillel Slovak and we hope it sparks interest in his work.”

	The group originally encompassed Slovak, Kiedis, Flea, and drummer Jack Irons. It has since gone through several iterations following Slovak's tragic death, with Irons leaving the group soon after.

	Before a musician played a single note at First Avenue, the iconic venue in the heart of Minneapolis, seemingly every voice in the room on Friday afternoon was chanting the words “fuck ICE.” This was a Tom Morello concert, but even more than music, everyone was unified under the show's banner: “a concert of solidarity & resistance to defend Minnesota.” This was a prelude to a larger protest just blocks away and a benefit for the families of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Everyone was already plenty fired up, so naturally, they came unglued when Morello revealed that his surprise guest was none other than Bruce Springsteen.


	Two days after the release of his protest song “Streets of Minneapolis,” which very specifically references the killings of Good and Pretti by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration, Springsteen stood alone in the venue that Prince made famous. When the screaming fans finally got quiet, he discussed the song's rapid creation and release before playing it for the first time in public. 

	











	“So I write this song, and I recorded it the next day, and I sent it to Tom Morello,” he said. “Now I know Tom is an excitable man. I say, ‘Tom, what do you think? It's kind of soapbox-y.' And he says, ‘Bruce, nuance is wonderful, but sometimes, you have to kick them in the teeth.” He dedicated his performance to ”the people of Minneapolis, the people of Minnesota, and the people of our good country of the United States of America.” 


	Springsteen's solo acoustic performance of the song was understated compared to the production heard on the studio version, but back-up singers or a full band would've gotten in the way of the essential truth of the moment. Arguably the biggest rock star on the face of the planet made a surprise appearance in an occupied and embattled city, and here he was singing the names of their murdered neighbors — about the blood on the ice-covered pavement. Amid a vacuum in leadership at the highest level, here was the Boss pointing a finger directly at the responsible parties. This was certainly solidarity, and when he sang the words “Alex Pretti and Renee Good,” the crowd cheered emphatically. As the song wound down, cheers gave way to a chant spurred on by Springsteen himself: “ICE out now!”

	It was an unbelievably generous moment that certainly defined the afternoon, but Morello and his band returned to the stage to rev up the power once again after that. Springsteen and his sometime bandmate traded verses and massive guitar solos on 1995's “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” a song the pair have performed together numerous times. Morello lifted and inverted his guitar mid-solo to reveal the words “arrest the president” while Bruce beamed and laughed next to him. Every single person in the room seemed to be on the same page. 


	All the musicians who'd graced the stage earlier returned for a closer of John Lennon's “Power to the People,” but not before Morello proclaimed that we'd all experienced the greatest brunch-hour concert in history. Springsteen, Morello, and the rest stood smiling onstage as the house speakers blasted “Let's Go Crazy.” 


	It was an afternoon hinged entirely on the topics of protest and resistance. Morello's own set featured union anthems and Woody Guthrie classics, and more importantly, fiery rhetoric. “Brothers and sisters, thank you for welcoming us to the battle of Minneapolis,” he opened. “Minneapolis is an inspiration to the entire nation. You have heroically stood up against ICE, stood up against Trump, stood up against this terrible rising tide of state terror. You have stood up for your neighbors and for yourselves and for democracy and for justice. Ain't nobody comin' to save us except us, and brothers and sisters, you are showing the way.”

	With a mention of the capital-R Revolution who made the room famous, Morello turned the mic stand around and urged the crowd to scream along to “Killing in the Name.” Prior to the special guest reveal at the end, this was the most ecstatic moment — a room of people screaming “fuck you, I won't do what you tell me.” With all respect to the group performance of “This Land Is Your Land,” Al Di Meola's solo acoustic shredding, and Rise Against's cover of Neil Young's “Rockin' in the Free World,” Morello's greatest gift to this crowd was an outlet for their deeply understandable rage. 


	“I heard the Trump administration has claimed that outside agitators have come to Minneapolis to stir up trouble,” Morello said between songs, eliciting boos from the audience. “I would like to confirm that we are those outside agitators, and we're gonna stir up a shit-ton of trouble.” The show wrapped up just after 2 p.m., and later, Morello walked out into the streets to join the protest. Well before any of the musicians grabbed their coats and made it out of the building, though, one audience member called out to the crowd that was freezing outside First Avenue to follow him and protest. A horde of people followed that dude's lead — concrete evidence that the tenets of resistance didn't fall on deaf ears.

	Amid her resignation from Georgia's 14th congressional district, Marjorie Taylor Greene provided her input on Don Lemon‘s arrest during an onscreen appearance.


	During Friday's episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, the politician said “I completely support his arrest” following Lemon's Thursday indictment for covering an anti-ICE protest at a Minneapolis church earlier this month.


	“Well, I'm gonna say he violated the FACE Act,” she told Maher. “He went into a church, disrupted their worship, and then later in an interview, compared them to white supremacists. That's not journalism, that's activism.”

	Greene addded, “So, I don't think that's journalism. That's not first amendment, going in and harassing people in the middle church. And Don Lemon came to my office with the ‘Tesla Takedown' guy, that organized it, and we had to call Capitol Police.”


	Fellow panelist Joe Scarborough argued that “there's no doubt this was meant to scare other reporters, scare other journalists” from covering ICE‘s ongoing acts of violence in public.


	“Well, I think it's bullsh*t to disrupt church,” said Greene. “I don't think Christians should be harassed in church, especially by activists and reporters.”


	On Friday, Lemon was released from custody on a no-cash bond, after which he thanked everyone outside the Los Angeles courthouse for their support.


	“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” said Lemon. “In fact, there is no more important time than right now this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.”

MTG… the new voice of reason.

To anonymous below: MTG has to shut up because she's a “former” politician? But Hollywood celebrities can say whatever they want politically??? You are the problem dum dum.

She's not in politics anymore. She gave up her invite to the party, her seat at the table. Let's stop giving her rantings anymore oxygen. Stop inviting her on anymore interview shows and mentioning her name in print. It's time for her to sit down and STFU.

There is a difference from being part of a protest and simply reporting on the protest.  They would need to prove that he was somehow organizing them going into and disrupting the services.  I saw the actual protest leader say she allowed him to come along but he had no idea where he was going other than the address she provided him just before they left.

Then let's have tucker Carlson arrested in CA. Or any of the right win podcasters, thats not journalism, they are fanning he flames of division. Lock them up!

	Once upon a time, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara took mushrooms and went to a Grateful Dead concert in Las Vegas. 


	It's a memory Cranston shared when stopping by Jimmy Kimmel Live! in September, and one some fans are looking back at fondly following news of O'Hara's death on Friday, Jan. 30, at the age of 71.


	Before you get too excited about any tripped out details, it was all in the name of Hollywood. Or so, Cranston says. The actor recalled taking the drug to prepare for his scene as Continental Studios CEO Griffin Mill in Seth Rogan's The Studio. In the show, the studio exec gets high on mushroom chocolates and things get chaotic quickly. However, the real world issue was that Cranston had never taken the drug himself. 


	“I'm playing this character who is wiped out and I had never had any experience in that. Not many drugs at all, as a matter of fact, and so I didn't know really how to behave,” Cranston told host Kimmel. “So I was asking Seth Rogen and Ike Barinholtz, ‘You guys are huge druggies! What can you tell me?'” he continued, adding that they recommended microdosing at first.

	“We were in Las Vegas shooting this crazy show with Seth Rogen and we all decided to go to the Sphere to see the Grateful Dead,” Cranston said, before concluding: “If God wasn't telling me to do microdosing, what was he telling me?”Soon, O'Hara joined in the effort, but not without hesitation. Cranston said that they were “nervous” and “clutching each other,” despite Barinholtz assuring them he'd take care of the duo. Eventually, Cranston said they were given “thin square chocolates,” but the result was anti-climatic. “I took it. Nothing. I didn't feel anything,” said the actor. “It felt like maybe I took three sips of wine.”

From 'SCTV' to Christopher Guest mockumentaries, O'Hara's comic legacy was already secure — but 'Schitt's Creek' allowed viewers to (re)discover a timeless talent.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	A funny thing happened to Catherine O'Hara over the past decade.


	Actually, many funny things probably happened to, and because of, Catherine O'Hara over the past decade — but over the past decade, Catherine O'Hara got really famous.




	If people take umbrage at that statement, I don't blame them. Catherine O'Hara was definitely famous before Schitt's Creek, but she was famous in a fragmented way that isn't uncommon in the modern media landscape.


	Yes, she was a Canadian national treasure and had been since the launch of SCTV. If you made a Mount Rushmore of comic sketch performers, Catherine O'Hara would be on it. But while John Candy and Rick Moranis and even O'Hara's career-long professional partner Eugene Levy experienced above-the-title stardom, O'Hara went from being the most valuable performer in a sketch ensemble to being the most valuable performer in countless other ensembles, including Christopher Guest's troupe of improvisational geniuses.

					Catherine O'Hara Remembered by Macaulay Culkin, Dan Levy, Seth Rogen, Tim Burton and More: "A Rare Light in This World"		
			









	So O'Hara was already Canada-famous and comedy-famous, but she was famous in a way that the internet was constantly discovering that the mom in Home Alone was Catherine O'Hara — partially a reflection of the internet's goldfish memory and partially a reflection of O'Hara's status as a comic character actor, a plug-and-play performer who might only get a scene or two in your movie or an episode or two in your sitcom, but would absolutely guarantee laughter.


Schitt's Creek, though, did something different. What started as an exercise in nostalgia, the pure joy of watching O'Hara and Levy riffing off each other so potently after all these years, became an exercise in both discovery and affirmation.

	











	It was discovery, because for younger viewers, SCTV doesn't necessarily exist. It isn't streaming anywhere and, at least to the best of my memory, never has been. That's a travesty. O'Hara turned out to be a perfect performer for the YouTube/Quibi/TikTok era.


	Fine.


	She turned out to be a perfect performer for any era.


	And I mean ANY era. One thing that's striking if you watch the clips from SCTV that are floating around YouTube is that O'Hara could do anything. SCTV let her sing, dance, explode with zaniness and offer quiet support. Put a young Catherine O'Hara in the 1930s and she would have been a screwball comedy star without equal, which I'm not just saying because O'Hara's Katharine Hepburn impression was one of her very best bits. Put a middle-aged O'Hara in the '50s or '60s and one can only imagine what Billy Wilder might have written for her.


	But if you're an actor capable of giving any snippet of dialogue, literally however short, a line reading from a different, far funnier planet, you're made to be celebrated in brief bursts, in cutdown montages, in degraded vintage sketches digitized from somebody's collection of old VHS tapes. If I needed to list somebody capable of generating hilarity in three seconds or less, I'm not sure I'd put anybody above Catherine O'Hara. Heck, on Schitt's Creek, she and the writers often set aside monologues or punchlines and innovated the idea of a punch-syllable.


	It was a discovery, though, because for every time Moira Rose made you die laughing from the emphasis she placed in a word that turned it from a piece of ongoing conversation to the sort of giggle-inducing inflection that forced viewers to pause — lest they miss the next alien intonation — there were quiet scenes between O'Hara and Levy that elevated what, by all rights, should have been a silly, low-brow comedy with a dirty pun as its title.

	











	There was a broad, somewhat forgettable sitcom that Schitt's Creek often was in its first season, but then there was the show that Levy and O'Hara were starring in — and as Schitt's Creek progressed and evolved, the whole series rose to their level and every member of the cast did as well. That, I think, is what O'Hara learned as she cut her teeth on SCTV and through those Guest classics — namely when to be a star of an ensemble and when to be support, when to make a scene your own and when to let other people shine.


	As a result, O'Hara went from famous to FAMOUS, from being beloved by 25 different niche audiences to being universally beloved, from being respected and adored to being decorated and celebrated. Sometimes when performers make this transition, it comes when their careers are winding down. But with O'Hara, it seemed like she was still fully in ascension, that she was ready to embrace the acclaim and parlay it into opportunities. She was wonderful in The Studio. She showed rarely utilized dramatic chops in The Last of Us — a side she'd hinted at before, because many of her best comic roles were grounded in a certain human desperation, but rarely had the opportunity to utilize. Heck, she got to be named honorary mayor of Brentwood.


	Catherine O'Hara died on Friday at 71. The past decade has shown that as great as we already knew she was, there were new depths she had to explore and, more than that, available opportunities for her to explore those depths.

	











	But the universal adoration came when she could appreciate it and, more than that, when she could turn it into those opportunities to do more, or different, or whatever she wanted to be doing. I always worry, when people pass away and the internet collectively grieves, that the person in question perhaps didn't know or didn't have the chances to use that love-equity to do more. My sense is that O'Hara knew and did much with her chances, both the ones that came when select audiences first found her five decades ago and the ones that came when everybody found her a decade ago.


	I'm going to take that as sad and also reassuring, and I'm going to watch some YouTube clips of O'Hara's funniest SCTV moments, before closing with this:

Earlier today we noted that HBO has been reaping big benefits from getting back to certain TV basics, with its massively successful The Pitt essentially asking “What if you gave people who are very good at making medical dramas a lot of freedom and support to make a medical drama?” Now the network (and its attendant streamer, HBO Max) is starting to look like it might try to do the same thing with that other cornerstone of the TV procedural market, the tried-and-tested cop show. Specifically, Deadline reports that HBO Max has tapped network TV vet Milo Ventimiglia to star in American Blue, with “man who makes a lot of movies about cops, and also one time about a Suicide Squad” David Ayer set to direct the pilot.

Created and written by Jeremy Carver—whose credits include serving as showrunner on Supernatural during its middle seasons—the show certainly does sound like a slightly more sober take on the modern cop show, casting Ventimiglia as Brian “Milk” Milkovich, who “returns to his hometown of Joliet, Illinois, to rescue a beleaguered police force while seeking redemption of his own.” (Embracing all the qualities available to a male TV cop show protagonist, Milk is described as being both “quietly determined” and “a natural-born leader.”) Deadline notes that the show is being produced on what we refuse to just give in and call “The Pitt blueprint,” i.e., casting a famous guy to star in a show set in a well-trod genre that's able to put out 15 episodes of TV a year. (“Ah,” we say, sitting down to 9 million re-runs of Tom Selleck's Blue Bloods: “It's a Pitt-a-like!”)

Ventimiglia (serving as a co-executive producer) comes to the series after basically a million years on This Is Us, and significantly less on his 2023 crime drama The Company You Keep. Ayer, meanwhile is one of several executive producers on the show. Although he's done a lot of cop movies over the years—most notably Oscar-winner Training Day, but also End Of Watch, 2003's S.W.A.T., and, if you want to get loose with definitions, the 2017 Will Smith fantasy police debacle Bright—he's largely steered clear of TV. (The main exception being directing early episodes of 2020 Fox show Deputy.)

	Catherine O'Hara played Moira Rose, a former soap opera star, in Schitt's Creek for six seasons.


	Co-created by Dan and Eugene Levy, the role landed O'Hara an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe as the Canadian comedy swept the awards in its final season.


	Moira Rose was an eccentric and glamorous character who believed she was a star, even when her and her family, played by her longtime colleague Eugene Levy, Dan Levy and Annie Murphy, were forced to move into a motel in the remote titular town after losing their fortune.


	Following O'Hara's unexpected death at age 71 on Friday, the Levy men and the cast of Schitt's Creek paid tribute to the star behind the star.

	Dan Levy, who played Moira's son David Rose, wrote on Instagram, “What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years. Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.”


	Eugene Levy was close friends with Hara and worked with her in a variety of roles over the years. The pair started out in Toronto-based improv troupe The Second City, before joining the cast of sketch series SCTV in 1976 and then working on Christopher Guest films including Best In Show and A Mighty Wind.












	“Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today. I had the honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years,” said Eugene, who played Moira's husband Johnny Rose, in a statement. “From our beginnings on the Second City stage, to SCTV, to the movies we did with Chris Guest, to our six glorious years on Schitt's Creek, I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and the entire O'Hara family.”


	Annie Murphy, who played daughter Alexis Rose, wrote, “Ha-ha-HAAAA?!?! Her laugh was a perpetual Yes, And… It challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was. Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her.”


	Eugene's daughter Sarah Levy, who played Twyla on the show, wrote, “This one cuts deep. What an honour it has been to know and work with and love Catherine O'Hara. Cheers to all that you brought to this world – you will be so, so missed.”


	Jennifer Robertson, who played Jocelyn Schitt, wrote, “Being in Catherine O'Hara's orbit was a beautiful and magical gift. She was an absolute star who never understood why people made such a fuss over her. Catherine was truly one of a kind. Her passing is a loss for everyone who knew and loved her, and a loss for Canada. You will be deeply missed Catherine.”


	Tim Rozon, who played Mutt Schitt, remembered O'Hara having “the kindest eyes, the warmest smile, and the best laugh that would fill the room.”


Schitt's Creek ran for six seasons on CBC Television from 2015 to 2020, earning the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series and the Golden Globe for Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy for its final season.

Don Lemon was released from federal custody on his own recognizance Tuesday after a U.S. Magistrate judge, with a tinge of impatience in her voice, summarily rejected a list of pre-trial conditions that the government wanted placed on the former CNN anchor.


	Lemon emerged from the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles holding hands with his husband, Tim Malone, as a helicopter circled overhead and passing motorists honked in apparent support. He was still wearing the cream-colored suit he had been photographed in the night before at a party linked to the Grammy Awards. He faced the cameras after having been charged in a grand jury indictment with conspiracy to disrupt a church service in Minnesota on Jan. 18. Officials allege he deprived congregants of their right of religious freedom.


	“I want to thank everybody for their support. It really, it truly means the world to me,” he said. “I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.”

	Lemon, who now works as an independent journalist with a YouTube show and podcast, struck a defiant tone regarding his 14-page grand jury indictment, which came after a judge in Minnesota previously rejected charges against him sought by President Trump's Justice Department. “Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something I've been doing for the last 30 years, which is covering the news,” Lemon said. “The First Amendment protects that work for me and for countless other journalists. I stand with them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”

	Earlier in the afternoon, Lemon confidently walked into the courtroom packed with media, members of his family, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, a representative from his talent agency, and several men wearing Department of Homeland Security uniforms. He waved and blew a kiss to his husband in the gallery before taking his seat.

	U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue took the bench, and Lemon confirmed that he had reviewed the grand jury indictment accusing him of conspiring to interfere with the First Amendment rights of churchgoers during a protest at Cities Church in St. Paul. The church is led by a pastor, David Easterwood, who also serves as an official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.


	Before the hearing, federal pretrial services recommended that Lemon be released under what is known as general supervision. The government, however, pressed for stricter conditions. While he never asked for ongoing detention, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Robbins requested that Lemon be required to post an unsecured $100,000 appearance bond, surrender his passport, and have his travel restricted to New York, Minnesota, and Washington, where his lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell, is based.


	“Why?” Judge Donahue interrupted, sounding a little annoyed. The prosecutor argued that Lemon's conspiracy charge was “a very serious felony,” asserting that Lemon had “knowingly stormed a church to terrorize people.” He alleged that Lemon confronted congregants and physically obstructed them. Lemon, 59, shook his head and let out a slight laugh at the characterization.


	Lemon's local defense lawyer, Marilyn Bednarski, called the proposed restrictions “inappropriate,” citing Lemon's lack of any criminal record, his long and highly public career in journalism, and his intention to contest the charges.


	“My client is not a flight risk,” Bednarski said. “He is one of the most recognizable figures in the world. He has no criminal convictions, no property or assets abroad, and he is committed to fighting this case. He's not going anywhere.”

	The prosecutor attempted to interject, but the judge responded, “Hold on.” When she finally announced her decision, it was a sweep for the defense. Judge Donahue rejected the idea of the $100,000 bond and said there would be no supervision of Lemon's release. He only needs to seek court permission for any international travel, she said. From the bench, she ordered that Lemon was free to take a pre-planned trip to France in June, so long as it doesn't conflict with scheduled proceedings in the criminal case.

	











	Lemon was ordered to appear Feb. 9 for a hearing in the case in federal court in Minnesota.


	After the protest at the church, the Justice Department sought charges against eight people, including Lemon, but a federal magistrate judge only allowed charges against three to proceed, finding insufficient evidence against Lemon and the others. In the 14-page indictment unsealed Friday and obtained by Rolling Stone, the government revealed it got a grand jury to charge nine people over the incident. The indictment added Lemon and another independent journalist named Georgia Fort, along with Black Lives Matter leader Trahern Jeen Crews.

	Lemon and Fort were livestreaming as dozens of anti-ICE protestors entered the church and interrupted the service, yelling and blowing whistles. The indictment alleges Lemon and Fort participated in a “takeover-style attack” that was “traumatizing to church members.”


	“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” Lowell said in a statement released while Lemon was still in custody. “The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable. There is no more important time for people like Don to be doing this work.”

Catherine O'Hara passed away on January 30 at the age of 71, leaving behind a legacy forever intertwined with “Schitt's Creek,” the series that introduced her brilliance to a new generation. 

As Moira Rose, O'Hara delivered one of the most original performances modern comedy has seen. 

With a voice unlike anything on television and a wardrobe as bold as her personality, O'Hara turned Moira into the unmistakable soul of “Schitt's Creek.” Now, mourning this loss, Dan Levy shared a deeply personal tribute honoring O'Hara, his beloved on-Screen mom on the show.

In his statement, he reflected on a relationship that long predated their on-screen work together. Levy noted that O'Hara had spent decades collaborating with his father, Eugene Levy, making her part of his extended family well before she portrayed his mother on television.

“What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years,” Levy wrote.

Levy emphasized that O'Hara's presence in his life held a close place in his heart as it was about familiarity, warmth, and shared history. 

Having worked closely with his father for more than half a century, O'Hara was woven into the fabric of his upbringing.

“Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family,” he shared. “It's hard to imagine a world without her in it.”

Known for her unmatched comedic instincts, O'Hara left behind memories that Levy said he will hold onto forever. Their time together, both personally and professionally, was defined by humor and mutual affection.

“I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her,” Levy wrote, capturing the intimacy of their bond.

Levy closed his tribute by turning his thoughts to O'Hara's family, acknowledging the loss felt far beyond the entertainment world.

“My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and every member of her big, beautiful family.”

For Levy and countless others, O'Hara's legacy lives on not only through her iconic performances, including her role on Schitt's Creek, but through the deep personal connections she forged over a lifetime of creativity, kindness, and laughter.

The show concluded after six seasons, a decision led by Daniel Levy and Eugene Levy, who believed the story had reached its natural endpoint. Daniel later explained that extending the series risked diluting its meaning.

“I at no point wanted to compromise on quality or storytelling,” Daniel told Variety. “It just didn't feel like it was worth the risk to take it any further.”

He added that the heart of the series was always about connection. “The goal was at the end of this show, this family will realize the value of love. Money can temporarily bandage a lot of things. But they would never be able to buy the kind of closeness that they have by the end of the series.”

Even after the finale, O'Hara remained closely tied to the cast and openly expressed hope for a reunion. In 2024, she shared her wish to step back into Moira's world, if only briefly.

“I would love to,” she told People at the time. “We did a bit of a tour after we finished the show, and it was so much fun. I'd love to just be with them all again. Doing a movie would be wonderful. Yeah, I hope it happens.”

Although the cast never reunited on screen, O'Hara's Moira Rose forever remains unforgettable!

Hilary Duff's “toxic” mom-group pals, including Mandy Moore, were on-hand Thursday to support the singer during her LA stop on the Small Rooms, Big Nerves Tour. 

“Broke my brick time to say that my bud is a sensational icon queen giving us all what we needed,” Moore gushed atop a pic of Duff onstage. “You are forever a superstar, @hilaryduff!!!!”

In another slide, the “This is Us” alum shared footage of her fellow hitmaker performing her track “Mature,” labeling it “My fav song!”

She tagged the “Lizzie McGuire” star's husband, Matthew Koma, and her own spouse Taylor Goldsmith, capturing their enthusiasm while “grooving out” to the music at the Wiltern in LA.

According to People, Janice Lee and Gaby Dalkin — who are also members of the high-profile mom-group — were also in attendance. 

The show of support comes amid an ongoing feud after Ashley Tisdale blasted the group as “toxic” in an essay for The Cut earlier this month — without dropping names.

She also claimed she cut ties with them in a text message after being left feeling excluded and “not cool enough” for them.

“This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore,” she recalled texting. 

Moore, Duff, and Meghan Trainor are A-list celebrities who have been photographed at mom group activities with Tisdale in the past.

Since then, family and friends have taken sides in the rift. Duff's husband, Matthew Koma, blasted the former Disney Channel star as “tone deaf” and “self obsessed” with a mocked-up cover of “The Cut.”

Zac Efron's brother Dylan Efron defended Tisdale during Wednesday's episode of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” calling the “High School Musical” star “sweet.”

“I try to stay out of that, so I don't know too much,” he said when a caller asked about the drama. “All I know is Ashley, since I was a kid, she's been so sweet to me.” 

He added, “So I can't envision her doing anything malicious to the mom group. Hopefully, it's just a misunderstanding? I honestly don't know what's going on, though.”

Duff's estranged sister Haylie Duff also appeared to side up with Tisdale, as the duo has been spotted hanging out multiple times over the past week.

The “Napoleon Dynamite” actress shared a photo of her daughter, Lulu, 7, playing beneath a table with Tisdale's daughter Jupiter, 4 — which Tisdale reshared via Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they headed out to a Malibu restaurant with their kids in tow.

Meanwhile, as the feud rages on, a source told Page Six earlier this month that the drama didn't sprout from one specific incident. 

 “It's a myriad of things, not just one specific,” the insider said.

Melania Trump's documentary — the most expensive in history — is coming in ahead of expectations at the Friday box office after being declared a bomb before it even opened. In a separate twist, 'Send Help' could itself in a close race for No. 1 with YouTuber Mark Fischbach's 'Iron Lung.' 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Following last night's premiere in Washington D.C. attended by President Donald Trump and packed with his acolytes, the first lady's documentary Melania is on course to open to a better-than-expected $8 million or more at the North American box office, according to early Friday returns.


	If that sunny forecast holds, the film will pull off a surprise victory and come in a solid No. 3 behind fellow newcomers Send Help and Iron Lung after icing out Jason Statham's new action pic, Shelter. No one saw that coming.

	However, all bets are off when it comes to comparisons given the context around Melania, directed by the controversial filmmaker Brett Ratner in what he hopes marks his Hollywood comeback. For one, Amazon MGM Studios plunked down $40 million for worldwide licensing rights in a deal widely seen as a move to cozy up to the White House. Whatever the case, it makes Melania the most expensive doc in history.

					'Melania' Doc Premieres in D.C. as Director Brett Ratner Says $75 Million Price Tag "Wasn't About Corruption"		
			









	And that's before Amazon spent $35 million on a global marketing campaign for the PG-rated film. A domestic theatrical campaign for even the biggest docs generally runs no more than $5 million to $7 million. There are exceptions, including former vice president Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Sources say the domestic marketing spend was close to $15 million on each of those titles because of the awards factor, not adjusted for inflation. Both picked up the Oscar for best picture.

	











	Almost two decades later, Michael Moore's Oscar-winning Fahrenheit 9/11 remains the top-grossing doc of all time among any genre, and not just political, and still holds the record for top openings. Fahrenheit debuted to $23.9 million domestically from 868 theaters on its way to a North American cume of $119.2 million and $222 million globally, not adjusted for inflation.


	Heading into the weekend, tensions were high. Melania was tracking to open in the $5 million range from 1,778 theaters, or enough to beat the $5 million debut of Angel Studios' doc After Death from 2,645 theaters in 2023 and claim the best opening for a documentary in a decade. But some exhibitors weren't so convinced, based on sluggish ticket sales and an endless stream of social posts showing auditoriums where only a smattering of tickets had been sold (it's hard to remember a non-concert doc that's been so scrutinized in terms of its opening number). Some cinema owners downgraded their projections to as low as $2 million to $4 million. By Friday afternoon, almost every Hollywood studio showed Melania coming in between $8 million to $9 million after looking at grosses and consulting with relieved exhibitors.


Melania clearly appears to benefiting by promotion from the bully pulpit, as President Trump entreats his followers to see the film, while grassroots marketing campaigns from conservative groups are expected to send moviegoers to theaters in red-leaning states and red-leaning top markets, such as Orange County in California. 

	











	It won't be helped by movie critics, however, as early reviews from major media outlets have been scathing. (Many box office pundits say Trump supporters will expect negative reviews from what they consider to the left-leaning media.)


	The decision to open Melania in more than 20 markets overseas, where Prime Video has a huge footprint, was a bold move, considering how controversial of a figure her husband is. He's presently in a tussle with South Africa, where a distributor pulled Melania from release earlier this week. And there's been a torrent of bad press coming out of Europe regarding empty theaters (just as in the U.S.).


	From Amazon's point of view, ponying up $40 million is part of making good on its promise to become a major theatrical player and help struggling cinemas with a varied slate of product, alongside servicing its streaming customers. Since it is a doc, Melania may only play exclusively in cinemas for two weekends (or at least 10 days), meaning a potential streaming launch timed to the Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend. While Amazon is more inoculated from churn than rival streaming services, it still has to attract new subs, along with feeding its conservative-leaning Prime members. And it will get two marketing campaigns for the price of one by going relatively quickly to the home, a popular tactic across all of Hollywood


Melania is opening opposite a slew of films, including 20th Century's Rachel McAdams thriller Send Help, the Sam Raimi-directed title that now looks to open $16 million or $18 million domestically, likewise ahead of expectations after earning a glowing 93 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. The darkly comic horror-thriller stars McAdams and Dylan O'Brien as coworkers stranded on a desert island, and sports a glowing 93 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes. According to THR‘s review, the R-rated pic “boasts an audacious concept that is superbly realized by Raimi's filmmaking, which milks every bizarre situation for all it's worth.”

	











	In a second twist, indie pic Iron Lung from Mark Fischbach (aka the Markiplier) of YouTube gaming fame, is also tipped to open in that range. At least one rival studio is showing it coming in ahead of Send Help; box office observers say it will all come down to how front-loaded Iron Lung is. The film, helmed by Fischbach in his directorial debut, is based on the submarine simulation horror game of the same name that was developed and published by David Szymanski, who helped with the film's screenplay and makes a cameo.


	Disney's 2025 year-end holiday holdovers Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash are expected to round out the top five, followed by Amazon's Mercy.


	Statham's Shelter may only manage seventh-place finish with $4 million in its opening. The Black Bear released had hoped to come in between $5 million and $7 million.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	I just paid to go see Melania so you don't have to. You're welcome.


Amazon MGM Studios withheld this so-called documentary/infomercial from the prying eyes of critics with not even a Thursday preview. It is a move that doesn't give one comfort that they are about to see a masterpiece, but in its own way, Melania is a masterpiece of manipulation.


	To be fair, though, I am not the audience for this mash note to America's first lady. However, I did sit and watch it at the 11:35 a.m. show on opening day at Cinemark in West Los Angeles with an audience of about 25 mostly gray-haired patrons (all the handicap parking spots were taken) who seemed pleased to be there and not at the latest Jason Statham movie next door. They sat attentive throughout, and guess what? They even applauded when the end credits rolled after a couple of graphics touting her “achievements” since returning to the White House a year ago.

	











	The size of the audience in the smallish auditorium surprised me on a Friday morning. I thought based on social media chatter and filling the internet with screen shots of empty presales that I might be the only customer. In fact it's estimated that box office for the weekend appears to be overperformaning predictions.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The focus is on Melania's return as first lady, and director Brett Ratner puts his cameras on her with unfettered access — supposedly — in the 20 days leading to Donald Trump‘s second inauguration. The film also marks Ratner's return to filmmaking after being accused of sexual misconduct by several women. This is his first feature as a director since Dwayne Johnson's Hercules in 2014. You can't say he is not versatile in subject matter.

	











RELATED: ‘Melania': What The Critics Are Saying About Amazon's Controversial Big-Budget Documentary


	Aside from looking like the whole thing was written and produced by her staff, Melania makes the cardinal sin of just being simply, butt-numbingly boring, especially in the forever-taking last act of sitting through the inauguration all over again in eye-drooping detail. There is nothing in this section that Fox News viewers didn't see the first time around, with one exception when Donald Trump lets Ratner's cameras film his rehearsal for the big speech and catches Melania's single contribution replacing the word “warmonger” with the word “unifier.” At least that cleared that up.


	The last instance of a first lady doing a show like this one was when Jackie Kennedy gave her famous tour of the White House. That clearly was staged every bit as carefully as this movie seems to be. But then, to my knowledge Mrs. Kennedy didn't receive $40 million for her participation. You have to give this Mrs. Trump (there have been three of them) props for bilking Jeff Bezos out of that kind of cash for a documentary, not to mention another $35 million in marketing.


	So what doe we get for that investment? Clearly choreographed sequences with Melania and her fashion designer, Melania and her architects, Melania and her staff, Melania talking via Zoom to the French first lady Brigitte Macron and on and on. We go with her to New York City and Trump Tower as well as St. Patrick's Cathedral, where she mourns the one-year anniversary of her mother's death on January 9, 2025, with priests who give her a blessing. We go of course to Mar-a-Lago, we see her renovations to the Rose Garden and the Bowling Alley among other first-term White House memories. One of my favorite moments is when she is doing staged interviews with staff for job returns. To one she asks the piercing question, “So what new suggestions would you have for my East Wing office?” If I were the applicant and had the hindsight we do now, I might have said, “Do you mean before or after your husband bulldozes the whole thing?” At the very least it would have been nice for this film to let us know where her new office is now since the president destroyed the old one, the building and the White House movie theater, which meant they had to set up a screen in the East Room to even show this movie there last weekend.

	This is not to say there aren't some fun things. When Ratner asks (off camera) about a favorite singer, it takes her not a nanosecond to respond with Michael Jackson, and favorite song (“dere are so many”) is “Billie Jean.” Right on cue we hear that song in the limo, with Melania doing a pretty good lip sync, something she does as well for Trump's beloved “YMCA” while exiting the last of the inaugural balls. Also, as she enters the area of the inauguration, we hear her voice-over talking about coming to this country as an immigrant and that this is what America was made of and how important it is to remember that and welcome that. Oh god, pleaseeeeeeee show this movie to Stephen Miller. I will provide the popcorn.


	One rare instance of completely unedited honesty came in the course of a phone call to her press secretary. A man on the end of the line is heard relaying a request from Puck and a Hollywood reporter there named Matt Belloni. He would like an interview with Melania about her reported Amazon deal. When the press secretary asks why, he replies he just wants to know about the movie and asks if she will pass on the request. When she hangs up, somebody off camera asks, “You aren't gonna do that for those Hollywood media types.” (Or meaner words to that effect.) “Of course not,” she answers. I guess Ratner left this all in as some comment on the Trump world's view of Hollywood.

	











	Another interesting moment came with her husband as details were laid out for them on the way inauguration day January 20 would go down. “Why are we opposite the College Football National Championship game?” Trump pouts. “Didn't we have this date first?” Yes, for a couple of hundred years, Donald. “I am sure they did this on purpose,” he snarks.

	To be fair, there also is a lot of emphasis on the good work she does for foster children, and kids in general — her pet projects, we are told. It is well known she asked the president to demand that Putin return the thousands of Ukranian kids Russia uprooted and sent to Moscow, separating them from their families. If I may offer an idea, Mrs. Trump? Please whisper in your husband's ear that it would only be right to also return the many kids, including a well-publicized Spider-Man backpack-wearing 5-year-old abducted by ICE on his way to school in Minneapolis and sent to a detention camp with others in Texas.


	At any rate, if any of this sounds as compelling — as it seemed for the audience I watched it with for one hour and 44 minutes Friday morning — then go for it. It just feels to me to be a movie whose release is off-key with so much wrong in this country and this world in the year that has passed since it was shot. Melania seems a little too rich for these times.

This will sweep the Razzies next year.

It's self-serving and dull because she is self-serving and dull. She's the most boring public figure we've seen in a long time.

Loved it, love her!

YOU NEED HELP.

This whole thing is a giant miscalculation by people who live in a bubble surrounded by sycophants who on an hourly basis tell them they are God's gift to mankind.That includes the Director who I'm certain lives and breathes in the same bubble as the entire Trump Klan.

I'm shocked! I heard it was doing really, really, really good!

It is really really good. That is why people love it and will watch it.

Catherine O'Hara's career as an actress was one not to be forgotten. From her role as Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek” to Kate McCallister in “Home Alone,” Delia Deetz in “Beetlejuice,” and many more, O'Hara dedicated her life to acting before she died on Jan. 30, 2026.

Despite lighting up the screens with her humor and illustrious performances, O'Hara said just two years before she passed away that the one role she wanted to be remembered for was her role as a mom to her two kids, Matthew Welch, 32, and Luke Welch, 29.

When TMZ caught up with O'Hara in February 2024 at LAX, the beloved actress was asked, “You've been in so many legendary roles. When all is said and done, which one role would you most like to be remembered for?”

As O'Hara looked around the airport, pondering how to answer, she finally found the words. “Mother of my children,” she said.

When the reporter questioned O'Hara again, looking for her to dish on what acting role she would like her fans to remember her by, she still continued to put her family first.

“His wife,” she said with a laugh as she stood next to her husband, Bo Welch.  

Throughout the years, O'Hara expressed the deep love she felt for her family. In a 2019 interview with 519 Magazine, the late actress talked about her intention to put her two kids and her husband ahead of her career — no matter what. 

“I'm with my family as much as I can be. In deciding what work I might get involved in for my whole working life, my family's always come first,” she shared. “I have two sons, and when they were babies, I thought, ‘What's the point? What's the point in having children if I'm not going to be with them?' So that was always no. 1 consideration and always will be.”

Despite her devoted attention to her sons, the iconic premise in “Home Alone,” where O'Hara's character forgot her son Kevin at home during a trip to Paris for the holidays, even played out in her real life with Matthew and Luke.

In a 2024 interview with People, O'Hara recalled how she and her husband once boarded the subway in NYC without their two sons. “We turned around, the doors are closing, and they just weren't on,” she told the outlet. “I screamed, and people screamed with me. Everybody joined in.”

Fortunately, the doors reopened for O'Hara's two boys before it began to travel, but the “Where the Wild Things Are” star said that it made her feel “sick” to think of what could have happened if their family had been separated.

It is a sad day in the entertainment industry: Catherine O'Hara has passed away. Her death was announced on Friday, January 30, with her rep confirming the news and revealing that she had died in her Los Angeles Bentwood home “following a brief illness,” TMZ reports. She was 71.

Social media has been flooded with tributes for O'Hara, as many fans, friends, and loved ones remember her brilliance. She was loved by many for her work and for who she was. Among those who cared for O'Hara is actor Eugene Levy.

O'Hara and Levy were longtime friends and collaborators, having starred on multiple projects together, including the Emmy Award-winning series, “Schitt's Creek.” Their films include “Waiting for Guffman,” Best in Show,” “A Mighty Wind,” and “For Your Consideration.” 

The pair had a beautiful friendship, which began in the ‘70s. In an interview with Buzzfeed, they reflected on how they first met. 

“I was a waitress at Second City … and Eugene was in the cast, and I auditioned for the cast,” O'Hara said of the Toronto-based improv troupe. “At that time, Joe Flaherty, who was directing, said, ‘I heard you auditioned. Keep up the day job. Keep up the waitressing.' But even waitressing at Second City was a cool job. My sister was a waitress there, my brother was a waiter there, and Eugene was in the cast, so I, of course, remember Eugene because I saw him on stage.”

Levy also reflected on their first meeting, saying, “I remember the audition, and it was a really good audition, and I think the general feeling was she was just a little young.” They noted that six months later, she had joined the cast, replacing Gilda Radner.

O'Hara and Levy's work together on “Schitt's Creek” earned them both Emmy Awards. In 2020, O'Hara accepted her Award for  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, and she used it as an opportunity to thank Levy and his son, Dan Levy, for creating the series and for including her in it. 

“I will forever be grateful to Eugene and Daniel Levy for the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to be fully her ridiculous self,” O'Hara said in her Emmy Award acceptance speech.

Their attendance at events was welcomed by fans, and they always seemed to be having a great time. The world will miss this friendship.

The mogul, who's moving to the U.S., says "I think now is finally our moment" after the stars released their first full-length studio album.

	Global pop groups are rising in popularity, but Japan-based XG is a pioneer in the space.


	The seven-member group was formed as part of a joint venture titled XGALX (a partnership between Japanese entertainment conglomerate Avex and producer Jakops) and hit the worldstage in 2022. XG's members were all from, trained and based in Japan, promoted their releases through the K-pop system in Korea, and performed entirely in English. At the time, it was unheard of. 




	The vision came from Jakops, both the CEO of XGALX and XG's lead producer. Knowing the 39-year-old's origins provides a good window into just how XG's formula came to be. Jakops, whose real name is Simon Junho Park, was born in Seattle, Washington to a Japanese mother and a Korean father. He spent his formative years in Korea, eventually debuting in K-pop boy group DMTN before shifting his focus to working as an independent artist under the name Jakops. As a producer, he began contributing to the creation of music for large K-pop acts.

	“I've seen a lot of different cultures,” the executive tells The Hollywood Reporter, explaining his desire to form a group like XG came from being interested in different music systems in different cultures.

	It's mid-December and Jakops sits in the conference room of a Koreatown hotel. He's made the trip to L.A. with XG for their U.S. television debut on NBC's The Voice, performing “Gala,” their 2025 Met Gala-inspired single. “From the get go it was all about the global reception and the global resonance,” Jakops says of XG, but perhaps he's also speaking a bit for himself, as he later admits L.A. might become a larger fixture in his life. 

	











	XG — which released their first full-length studio album, The Core, last week — was Jakops' first major project under his, at the time, newly formed joint venture. The young members of XG spent five years training under Jakops and his team, documenting the process in their 2023 YouTube documentary series, Xtra Xtra. Jakops says he trained the group from the start with the intention to sing in English and hit a global market. 


	Their debut single, “Mascara,” set them on a path to success, but the duel 2023 singles “Shooting Star” and “Left Right” launched the group into the global conversation. The bright, cutesy, quirky aesthetic of the early early aughts paired with the R&B and pop sound of girl groups like 3LW or TLC landed XG in a sweet spot creatively, and they've continued down that road since. 


	“We wanted to do something that had never been done before, that [had] never been seen before, something very unique,” Jakops explains. “We had to have a very clear idea of what we were doing and why we're doing it because no formula really fit what we were trying to do.”


	In the years since, global girl groups, which XG previously categorized themselves as, have become increasingly popular with the rise of acts like Katseye, up for best new artist at the 2026 Grammy Awards, and Girlset, formerly known as VCHA. It's fair to argue that XG was ahead of its time and laid the groundwork for this new type of group, but it's also important to note that the moniker no longer fits the group. 

	











	Generally speaking, the Idol system in the landscape of J-pop and K-pop, has a notoriously abysmal history of openly LGBTQIA+ performers. But last month, XG member Cocona, 20, made history and joined the small group of openly LGBTQIA+ idols, coming out as transmasculine nonbinary in an Instagram post on their 20th birthday. The rapper, the youngest member of the group, also shared that they had undergone top surgery earlier in the year. 


	Cocona's choice was not only brave, but it was a massive step forward for the world of idol performers. Jakops, who has been training Cocona since they were a pre-teen, stood firmly in support of Cocona, as both an artist in his group and a person, posting to Instagram shortly after Cocona did. “Sometimes I feel like I share the DNA with the seven members. They really feel like family,” Jakops admits. 


	“When I first met Cocona, they were a very young child, and really, we built this group together [with the other members]. XG bet their lives on what we were about to do,” he continues. Having trained with the members of the group for so long, he laments that he's been able to watch all of them grow and become the people they are today. 


	“It was a very moving and touching happy moment for me to see them find their own identity, and looking at each individual member as an individual, how they're able to be true to themselves,” Jakops says. “It's about respect and respecting that and that space, so it's for us, [about] cherishing that truth as a company, but as individuals. When they look in the mirror, they're able to see themselves in a way that I think gives courage and hope to the world.”

	











	XG, Jakops explains, is currently in the midst of a “big shift” as it finds new meaning. “[It's] a good shift, a good evolution,” he says. The shift comes in the form of the group's name, previously an abbreviation for Xtraordinary Girls, which has become to mean Xtraordinary Genes, going back to the group's futuristic, alien career-long storyline. 


	But the group is also undergoing a more personal shift, as Jakops and XGALX plan to buck typical idol tradition of what performers can and can't do. All members of the group have reached adulthood, Jakops points out, and like most K-pop and J-pop groups, XG had rules they had to follow during their trainee and early days. 


	“I want their success and happiness,” Jakops says of the seven members of XG, pointing out that given the strict lifestyle idols live it's harder to make friends and live the life one might expect a group of 20-somethings to live. But the producer is hoping to change that for XG, sharing that in October, he told the members there's a trust amongst them and the rules that were needed before are no longer needed. 


	“I told them two months ago, you guys are all free. You guys are adults, [go] find, I don't know, a boyfriend or [you can be] more social. You guys are free,” he recalls. “[Going forward], it's more their own life.” 


	Jakops is also looking at changes in his life, aligning with the company's position on the U.S. as not only an important market for the group but a center for culture. In May, Jakops will move to the U.S. for possibly up to six months. He jokes that even though he's 39, he feels like he's going back to university again.

	











	“There's always been this notion in Korea and Japan to be recognized by the U.S., to be recognized internationally. We tried really, really hard, and I think now is finally our moment,” he says. But for now, it'll just be Jakops moving to the U.S., as he says XG will not be joining him when asked if the plan is for all to move. 


	“We'll keep the scale rather small and then see how it goes — everyone in my company doesn't even know about this plan yet — but during this trip I was able to find my result and make up my mind,” he says. 


	“The members of XG are very supportive, and they're cheering me on for this new initiative,” he says. He knows the members well, laughing when he admits,”I think after I get settled, they're going to say they want to come too.”

	While the White House can try to pretend that Bruce Springsteen‘s anti-ICE song, “Streets of Minneapolis” — which denounces the killing of unarmed U.S. citizens, including Renée Good, and federal tyranny — is “irrelevant,” Springsteen, the people of Minneapolis, and U.S. citizens across the country loudly disagree.


	On Friday afternoon, a benefit concert organized by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, billed as “A Concert of Solidarity & Resistance to Defend Minnesota!”, kicked off at Minneapolis' famed First Avenue club. The show was brought together to raise money for the families of Good and Alex Pretti, who were both fatally shot by ICE agents.


	Springsteen appeared onstage as the surprise guest and delivered the first live performance of the protest song to cheers in the crowd. Morello then joined him for a rendition of his “Grapes of Wrath”-themed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”


	Before playing “Streets of Minneapolis,” Springsteen said, “I wrote this song and I recorded it the next day, and I sent it to Tom Morello.” Springsteen said he told Morello, “I think it's kinda soapboxy,” to which the guitarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is wonderful, but sometimes you have to kick them in the teeth.”

	“So this is for the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the people of our good country, the United States of America,” said Springsteen before diving into the song. As he sang, “In our chants of ‘ICE out now'/Our city's heart and soul persists/Through broken glass and bloody tears/On the streets of Minneapolis,” the packed audience raised their fists in the air and shouted: “ICE Out now!”

	When announcing the concert earlier this week, Morello wrote in a statement: “If it looks like fascism, sounds like fascism, acts like fascism, dresses like fascism, talks like fascism, kills like fascism and lies like fascism, boys & girls it's f*cking fascism. It's here, it's now, it's in my city, it's in your city and it must be resisted, protested, defended against, stood up to, exposed, ousted, overthrown and driven out. By you and by me. 


	“We are coming to Minneapolis where the people have heroically stood up against ICE, stood up against Trump, stood up against this terrible rising tide of state terror,” he continued. “Where the people have stood up for their neighbors and themselves, for democracy and justice. Ain't nobody coming to save us except us and it's now or never.”

Astronomers have solved the mystery of how some stars stay youthfully bright and blue, despite being almost as old as the universe itself: They cannibalize their stellar siblings.

Known as blue straggler stars, these age-defying celestial objects have mystified astronomers for more than 70 years. "Blue stragglers are anomalously massive core hydrogen-burning stars that, according to the theory of single star evolution, should not exist," researchers wrote in a paper published Jan. 3 in the journal Nature Communications.

To investigate these puzzling stars, researchers used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze 48 galactic globular clusters and more than 3,400 blue straggler stars in the Milky Way. Their observations revealed that these "forever young" stars stay youthful by siphoning the gas from their partners, like stellar vampires. This fuel injection allows the vampire stars to shine more brightly, and to appear more blue and youthful, long after they should have started fading away.

Scientists previously posited that blue stragglers can form in two ways: through violent collisions between two stars, or through more subtle interactions in binary systems as pairs of stars orbit each other and trade gas.

The team found that the latter scenario is more likely.

Galactic globular clusters provide the perfect place to study stellar interactions between gas-siphoning binary systems. These spherical clusters contain thousands or millions of stars, held together by their collective gravity. With so many stars inhabiting a region only tens or hundreds of light-years across, clusters are among the most dense stellar environments in the cosmos. Therefore, they host many stellar collisions and plenty of binary systems.

Clusters are also incredibly ancient. "Their age is of the order of 12 [billion years], hence comparable to the age of the Universe," which is 13.8 billion years old, Francesco Ferraro, lead author of the study and an astronomy professor at the University of Bologna in Italy, told Live Science via email. "In fact they are the oldest population in our Galaxy." This means the single stars in each cluster hosting the blue stragglers formed at the epoch of galaxy formation.

Older stars also emit different wavelengths of radiation. So the researchers utilized JWST's ultraviolet filters to distinguish blue stragglers from their elderly cluster-mates — because hotter -- younger stars emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths than older, redder populations that emit poorly in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

 




Perhaps counterintuitively, the researchers found that blue stragglers are rarer in dense stellar environments, even though these regions are more likely to facilitate interactions between stars. Instead, stragglers are significantly more common in calm, low-density regions where stars are spaced farther apart and "fragile binary systems are more likely to survive."

The researchers used an established, quantitative measure that relates the number of blue stragglers to the host cluster's characteristics, like luminosity. This measure revealed that blue straggler populations vary greatly, from three to 58 blue stragglers per unit of luminosity — equivalent to the brightness of 10,000 suns. Accordingly, luminosity is related to a cluster's overall mass and, therefore, its density.

Using that same measure, the researchers calculated that the number of regular stars in a cluster remains relatively constant. This suggests that stragglers and binary systems are especially sensitive to the density of their environments.

"Crowded star clusters are not a friendly place for stellar partnerships," study co-author Enrico Vesperini, an astronomer at Indiana University, said in a statement. "Where space is tight, binaries can be more easily destroyed, and the stars lose their chance to stay young."

Therefore, dense environments, such as those nearer the centers of clusters, may not be the stellar speed-dating venues they were assumed to be. The gravitational influences from large stellar populations create a cosmic-bumper-car-like effect that disrupts binary systems early in their evolution, before they can turn into blue straggler stars. As a result, the formation and survival efficiency of stragglers is 20 times higher in calmer, low-density environments, the researchers found.

In addition to solving an astronomical mystery, this study offers a "new way to understand how stars evolve over billions of years," study co-author Barbara Lanzoni, an astronomer at the University of Bologna, said in the statement.

But after billions of years, blue stragglers may not get to live out their quiet lives in peace. Because they are significantly more massive than their sibling stars, they are more likely to sink to the core of their clusters through a process called dynamical friction. Although this is unfortunate for these calm-loving stars, astronomers can then use them as a "dynamical clock" to extrapolate a cluster's age based on the distribution of its blue stragglers.

Finally, these sprightly, fresh-faced stars highlight a dynamic stellar balance. Had they been born more massive, they would have died long ago as supernovas or white dwarfs. Their modest size, below 0.8 solar masses, have allowed them to survive long enough to renew their lifespans — at the cost of consuming their siblings.

Shy 63-year-old's decision to blow up London traffic camera linked to online conspiracy theories and Islamophobia

To his neighbours, Kevin Rees did not seem like an extremist. The shy 63-year-old lived on a tree-lined street in suburban Sidcup, in Bexley, south-east London. He appeared to be enjoying retirement after a career mending dishwashers and other domestic appliances. “He's a quiet character – I've lived opposite him for 10 years and never really spoken to him,” says Sam, who declined to give her full name.

Behind the lace curtains, Rees was much more abrasive, at least online. Under the user name the “Exterminator” he ranted about London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) which in 2023 was expanded to the capital's outer borough, including Bexley.

It was only when Rees's online ire went beyond keyboard skirmishes and crossed over into real life violence that his neighbours realised they had an extremist in their midst.

This week, at Woolwich crown court, Rees was found guilty of blowing up a Ulez camera with a homemade bomb. The explosion, a jury agreed, was likely to endanger life.

This dark turn is now being seen as a cautionary tale about how increasingly influential online communities, such as anti-Ulez groups, can radicalise even suburban pensioners.

Rees began tinkering with homemade weapons and explosive materials that he kept in his loft. At 6.45pm on 6 December 2023 he lit the fuse on a home bomb. It blew up a Ulez camera on Willersley Avenue, a residential street four minutes' drive from Rees's front door.

Shrapnel from the blast travelled 100 metres. It dented a van, blew out a car tyre, splintered a window frame in a child's bedroom and damaged a wendy house.

“Any of us could have been hurt. It just shows that you don't know what's going on in individual homes when someone in a quiet household was making a bomb inside,” Sam said. “They've got a little Smart car, which would qualify for Ulez, so I don't know why he did it.”

As well as the explosion charge, on Wednesday Rees was also convicted of three counts of having a prohibited weapon.

Bethan David, head of counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said it was “pure chance that no one suffered serious injury or worse”. She said she hoped Rees's conviction would send “a clear message to other protesters considering taking the law into their own hands”.

If the message has been heard in the corners of the internet that Rees once occupied, it does not seem to have sunk in. Despite the grave nature of Rees's crime and the threat it posed to passersby, including children, the attack has been openly celebrated online as an act of heroism.

“Give him a medal,” said one Facebook comment that was liked by more than 1,300 users. When the CPS posted on X about the conviction, it was criticised in the replies while Rees was praised for his “public service”, patriotism, and “doing the lords [sic] work”.

Stefano Borella, leader of the Labour group on Bexley council, whose 76-year-old mother heard the bomb blast, said: “It disappoints me that he's being hailed as a hero, but it doesn't surprise me.

“Social media is the cesspit of humanity, but the silent majority would be very shocked by this, whatever their views of Ulez. The problem is, Rees looked at anti-Ulez Facebook groups and was enthused by that behaviour.”

Borella also criticised Conservative-led Bexley council for failing to condemn Rees's attack at the time. He said: “If you don't condemn it, people will think it's OK. If this is had been an Islamist attack, there would have been protests and condemnation.”

The anti-racist group Hope Not Hate is also alarmed by how Rees was radicalised. Georgie Laming, its director of campaigns, said: “The anti-Ulez movement has for some time now been co-opted by the far right. Local residents join groups to protest traffic measures and are suddenly confronted with conspiracy theories, disinformation, and Islamophobia.

“It's very worrying to see this kind of acceleration. This type of reckless sabotage goes well beyond any mainstream opposition to Ulez. It's extremism.”

Rees told the court he joined anti-Ulez groups because he was “bored” and looking for “a community”. He denied the charges against him and blamed his arrest on “Facebook police”.

In 2024 Greenpeace's Unearthed team and the Observer, published an investigation into a network of 36 private anti-Ulez Facebook groups with 38,000 members. The groups, which included a number of local Conservative politicians, celebrated vandalism against Ulez cameras by so-called blade runners. They were also found to be a platform for racism, Islamophobia, and conspiracy theories.

The article highlighted the Bexley group, where members complained of Islamists taking over Britain and there was a call for Khan to be “taken out”. Confronted in court with his own Facebook posts against Khan and Ulez, Rees said he was “strongly opposed” to the mayor. “I dislike what he has done to London,” he said.

John Oxley, associate fellow at the centre-right thinktank Bright Blue, said Rees's case “deserves more attention”. He said: “We worry about young people online, but actually there's some vulnerable older people who spend a lot of time in some fairly toxic online spaces.”

Oxley said vandalism against Ulez and speed cameras was often treated in the media as “Dad's Army-ish” because of sympathy for the cause in the press. He said: “Considering this was a bomb going off in a suburb of London, the coverage has been remarkably light. If you've got these networks of people who've been radicalised and are stewing in this information environment, what could be next?”

Rees is due to be sentenced later this year.
