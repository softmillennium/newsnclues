                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have you covered from Elena Rybakina's third-set heroics to her on-court trophy presentation and more. MELBOURNE, Australia — Elena Rybakina is the 2026 Australian Open champion after edging Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a gripping final on Rod Laver Arena. 5 overturned a 3-0 deficit in the deciding set, breaking twice down the stretch to secure her second Grand Slam title and her first in Melbourne. Rybakina outlasts Sabalenka in three sets to capture first Australian Open title Tonight's prize 🏆2001 and 2002 AO champion Jennifer Capriati brings out the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup onto RLA...@wwos • @espn • @tntsports • @wowowtennis • #AO26 pic.twitter.com/FflD9NIRoJ Jennifer Capriati, a two-time Australian Open champion in 2001 and 2002, unveiled the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup ahead of the match, and she later presented it to Rybakina during the trophy ceremony. The Australian Open in 2001 was her first Grand Slam title when she defeated then-No. The roof at Rod Laver Arena is closed -- Melbourne received off-and-on rain throughout Saturday afternoon. 1 Sabalenka won the toss and chose to serve. In the opening game, Sabalenka quickly displayed that signature power with an ace to go up 30-0, but Rybakina matched the aggression and responded with a forehand winner on the return. Winning three-straight points, she set up a break point and though Sabalenka saved it, Rybakina broke her serve in the deuce. She then held serve, notching another of her famous aces in the second game, for a 2-0 lead. Following Rybakina's early break and hold, the players traded holds for five consecutive games. Sabalenka held Rybakina scoreless in the fifth game -- capping it with an ace -- to cut the deficit to 3-2. Finding a rhythm now.Both players holding since the early break, with Rybakina edging ahead 3-2.#AO26 pic.twitter.com/EJONo9skYE Rybakina responded the next game by using her serve to stretch Sabalenka out wide and hold, but as the pattern has been since that early break, Sabalenka relied her serve to head into the changeover down 4-3. Down 15-40, Sabalenka had a prime chance to get the break back and level the set at four games apiece. Of course it was only fitting Rybakina went to her reliable serve and struck an ace to save one. The Kazakh eventually won four straight points to hold for a 5-3 lead. Sabalenka took a change of attire break heading into the second and will serve to begin the first game. In an 18-point second game, Rybakina saved three break points to tie the second set an one game apiece. Aside from that first set Rybakina break, it's been a strong display on the serve, especially in the second set. Sabalenka took a 3-2 lead heading into the changeover. Nothing separating them right now.They're on serve at 3-2 in the second.#AO26 pic.twitter.com/UdAlWcHAH4 Sensational from Sabalenka 😲The world No.1 is not going down without a fight! After a couple winners and an error by Rybakina, Sabalenka had three set points to break Rybakina's serve and win the second set. She only needed one, however, as the World No. 1 found a way against a resilient Rybakina to break that potent serve -- it was her first in six break point opportunities. Seeking her fifth Grand Slam title, Sabalenka started the final set with a hold and then another pivotal break of Rybakina. The Kazakh seems to be losing strength behind her serve, and only 54% of Rybakina's first serves have landed. Sabalenka had a pair of backhand winners, including a cross-court one with her signature roar, to secure the break and 2-0 lead in the third set. She then held serve, sprinting to a 3-0 lead heading into the changeover. Despite facing a break point in her ensuing service game, she saved it and won the game as Sabalenka's return sailed long. With a hold of serve to secure a 5-3 advantage, Rybakina has herself one game away from her second Grand Slam title and her first Australian Open. She earns her first-ever Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. We have you covered from Elena Rybakina's third-set heroics to her on-court trophy presentation and more.</p>

This time he grew tired, huffed and puffed, and took as many seconds between points as he could, but he proved unbreakable—literally—in the fifth.READ MORE: Sinner had Djokovic's number, so the legend "had to change it" ahead of AO classicEight times Sinner reached break point in the final set, and eight times Djokovic foiled him.

"I just wish this match today was a final," Djokovic said after defeating Alcaraz in the Australian Open quarterfinals. Alcaraz has had a good serving tournament, but Djokovic was razor sharp against Sinner, making 70 percent of his first serves and seemingly finding one whenever he needed it. That alone could keep him in the final.Who will hit his forehand more cleanly? He dialed in eventually, but it took a while. He'll need to be cleaner from that side.Can Djokovic get into Alcaraz's head? He has surprised the Spaniard with sudden tactical changes in their past matches. He served and volleyed on some key points, tore off a couple of clutch winners that left the Italian muttering in frustration, and urged the crowd to make more noise as often as possible. Last year here against Alcaraz, Djokovic seemed to be struggling physically, which threw the Spaniard off.

Which means the edge in desperation may go to Djokovic; he knows his chances to break that record are dwindling fast.The biggest unknowable will be Djokovic's mental and physical stamina. On the other, we saw him run out of gas late in majors last year, and he just escaped defeat to Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals here.If Djokovic is still in vintage fighting form on Sunday, it might require a monumental, career-best effort from Alcaraz to beat him.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play On Saturday, the Belgian-Chinese duo defeated Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic 7-6(4), 6-4 to win what is a ninth Grand Slam doubles title between them -- in just their seventh career event on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz as a pair. "This is second time play together at the Grand Slam," Zhang said. "First time we make to the final, and this time we got the trophy. We played so many great teams and then so many great singles player, doubles player. Mertens now holds six Grand Slam doubles titles, three of which have been captured in Melbourne. While Zhang secured her previous major trophies alongside the now-retired Samantha Stosur at the 2019 Australian Open and 2021 US Open, Mertens has now won a doubles major in each of the past three seasons. 1 spot in the PIF WTA Rankings on Monday. "It's been definitely a good couple of months, especially on the Grand Slams and the WTA Finals," Mertens said. 1 again, so that was definitely a motivation to do well.

I was thinking about this trophy in the first place, but it does mean a lot. 4 seeds pulled away against the No. 7 seeds -- who were contesting their second major final together after finishing as runners-up at Roland Garros last spring -- after coming from 4-1 behind in the first set.

They later stormed out to a 5-0 lead in the second set, and needed almost every bit of that cushion. They didn't wrap up the win until five games later -- and after two championship points slipped away at 5-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After producing Houdini-like escapes in the semi-finals, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are now seeking their own piece of history in Sunday's Australian Open final. Separated by 16 years, Alcaraz and Djokovic stand on opposite ends of their career, pursuing vastly different milestones. “The final of a Grand Slam, there's a lot at stake, but it's no different from any other big match that I play.” The highly anticipated final also begs the question: Which player can dig into his deepest reserves and rise for one more effort? Meanwhile, Djokovic survived two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner after four hours and nine minutes, an instant classic that the Serbian described as “one of [my] best performances in the last decade or so”. “My preparation is as it should be, and I won against him last year here, also in a gruelling match. Let's see how fresh we both are able to be.” Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in their most recent encounter at last year's US Open, yet was full of praise for the Serbian's physicality after the match, saying “He looks 25 years old physically, so to maintain that level at 38, it's impressive”. The margins between Alcaraz and Djokovic have been razor thin throughout their inter-generational rivalry. Just 12 months ago, Djokovic downed Alcaraz inside Rod Laver Arena, where they will battle Sunday, beginning at 7:30 p.m. local time / 3:30 a.m. After falling to Alcaraz in New York last September, Djokovic spoke candidly about facing Alcaraz and Sinner, who together have combined to win the past eight majors. With a $4,150,000 champion's payout at stake, the showdown between Djokovic and Alcaraz promises to be a tug of war from the baseline. If last year's clash in Melbourne is any guide, Alcaraz and Djokovic will take large cuts at the ball and lean on first-strike tennis, dictating play with ferocious hitting. Look for both players to stretch their opponent corner to corner, testing the physical capacity of their rival in the early stages.

In their most recent meeting, Djokovic won just 16 per cent (8/50) of his first-serve return points, less than half of what Alcaraz achieved at 34 per cent (19/56) en route to a straight-sets win.
