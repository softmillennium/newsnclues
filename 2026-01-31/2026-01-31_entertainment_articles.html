                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Melania Trump's new Amazon MGM documentary — the most expensive in history  — is even beating out Jason Statham's new action for a third-place finish behind 'Send Help' and 'Iron Lung' after galvanizing older conservative females and earning an A-CinemaScore. If that sunny forecast holds, the film will come in No. 3 behind fellow newcomers Send Help and Iron Lung after icing out Jason Statham's new action pic, Shelter. No one saw that coming, with many suggesting Melania was a bomb before it even opened based on empty, or nearly empty, seat maps in cinemas across the country. 'Melania' Doc Premieres in D.C. as Director Brett Ratner Says $75 Million Price Tag "Wasn't About Corruption" For one, Amazon MGM Studios plunked down $40 million for worldwide licensing rights in a deal widely seen as a move to cozy up to the White House. And that's before Amazon spent $35 million on a global marketing campaign for the PG-rated film. There are exceptions, including former vice president Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Almost two decades later, Moore's Oscar-winning Fahrenheit 9/11 remains the top-grossing doc of all time among any genre, not just political, and still holds the record for top openings. Melania is clearly benefiting by promotion from the bully pulpit, as the President Trump entreats his followers to see the film, while grassroots marketing campaigns from conservative groups are expected to send moviegoers to theaters in red-leaning states and top markets, such as Orange County in California. Critics are trashing the doc, as reflected by its current 6 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. Many box office pundits say Trump supporters expect negative reviews from what they consider to the left-leaning media. Indeed, audiences gave Melania an A Cinemascore, while its audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is a stellar 98 percent, the highest of any film in the top 10 this weekend. Melania was tracking to open in the $5 million range from 1,778 theaters, or at least enough to beat the $5 million debut of Angel Studios' doc After Death from 2,645 theaters in 2023 and claim the best opening for a documentary in a decade. But exhibitors weren't so convinced, based on sluggish ticket sales and an endless stream of social posts showing auditoriums where only a smattering of tickets had been sold (it's hard to remember a non-concert doc that's been so scrutinized in terms of its opening number). By Friday afternoon, almost every Hollywood studio showed Melania coming in between $8 million to $9 million after looking at matinee and early evening grosses and consulting with exhibitors. Since it is a doc, Melania may only play exclusively in cinemas for two weekends (or at least 10 days). While Amazon is more inoculated from churn than rival streaming services, it still has to attract new subs, along with feeding its conservative-leaning Prime members. And it will get two marketing campaigns for the price of one by going relatively quickly to the home, a popular tactic across all of Hollywood. Melania is opening opposite a slew of films, including 20th Century's Rachel McAdams thriller Send Help, the Sam Raimi-directed title that now looks to open $16 million or $18 million domestically, likewise ahead of expectations after earning a glowing 93 percent critics score and 89 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. The darkly comic horror-thriller stars McAdams and Dylan O'Brien as coworkers stranded on a desert island. According to THR‘s review, the R-rated pic “boasts an audacious concept that is superbly realized by Raimi's filmmaking, which milks every bizarre situation for all it's worth.” At least one rival studio is showing it coming in ahead of Send Help; box office observers say it will all come down to how front-loaded Iron Lung is. Disney's 2025 year-end holiday holdovers Zootopia 2 and Statham's Shelter, which is coming in on the low end of expectations with $5 million. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A smartly dressed man, surrounded by bodyguards, strides up and lays the following introduction on the audience: “Boss, you've been working undercover as a homeless man for six months now to investigate your uncle's crimes. Now that your uncle's in prison, it's time for you to return to the Jones Group.” You see, the bearded man isn't actually homeless. It might be the most purely cynical form of entertainment currently in production; concepts formulated and pitched by robots to other robots, to separate humans from dollars. The typical vertical drama is a three-act feature between 90 and 100 minutes, chopped up into 60 to 80 chunks, which are referred to as “episodes,” as if you're watching the fastest, bluntest TV series ever made. In the U.S., a few dozen competing companies produce indistinguishable vertical dramas this way, but the two biggest are ReelShort and DramaBox, each of which claims more than 50 million unique monthly users. If they're to be believed, vertical dramas are the most popular films being made today. The defining feature of each vertical drama mini-chunk is the rise and fall of tension over the 90- to 120-second cycle: Characters appear with subtitled descriptions of who they are, as voiceovers announce “I'm ____, and I feel ____ about ____.” These characters converse, argue or flirt, a threat arises (such as the reveal of a secret identity or a potential humiliation), and then it cuts to a brief black-screen cliffhanger. It's the apex of goldfish-brain entertainment, taking the ethos of an old Flash Gordon serial and distilling it into content consumed in marathon sessions. ReelShort's slogan boasts that “every second is drama,” and that the company's mission is to create “fast-paced drama for busy women,” among other things. Indeed, it quickly becomes obvious that women are overwhelmingly the target demographic, although nailing down a generational window is more tricky. The gamified, “coin”-based economy involved in purchasing these vertical dramas smacks of the mobile game addiction common to Gen X and Boomers, but the style of content reaches far past your aunt who has sunk $20,000 into Candy Crush Saga, displaying more prominent Gen Z hallmarks, like universally hardcoded subtitles. Perhaps the most important descriptor is “busy,” which could just as easily be “attention deficient.” Ads depict scenarios like a woman getting into an elevator and having just enough time to watch the next 90-second episode before continuing on with her day. If that sounds suspiciously similar to the pitch for Quibi, it's not far off—but replacing the A-list stars, ambition, and big budgets with non-actors, laughable production standards, and salacious premises. The almighty algorithm rules everything: If any given vertical drama proves popular, the companies immediately greenlight several more that repeat it almost verbatim, right down to confusingly similar titles. And this doesn't just apply to broad themes—vertical drama producers also identify small, individual elements or story beats (such as a woman being bullied and slapped) and then repeat that element in every production until it stops driving engagement. This gives your average vertical drama an intense feeling of uncanny familiarity once you've watched a few. Vertical drama apps are built to obfuscate the sense of how much you're paying, with “coins” purchased in bulk, in amounts from hundreds to thousands. People are paying much more to watch Tricked Into Having My Ex-Husband's Baby on their phones than it would cost to see Sinners in IMAX. It's difficult to trust the markers of popularity vertical drama producers boast about. Viewership metrics often seem absurd or impossible—already a common experience with streamers, which tend to withhold view numbers, or speak in vague and misleading terms about how many people are watching. Vertical dramas, on the other hand, tend to directly provide extremely gaudy viewership numbers: The Washington Post wrote that ReelShort's How To Tame A Silver Fox had been “watched 356 million times,” which would work out to more than one view for every member of the U.S. population. Is it more likely that How To Tame A Silver Fox is one of the most beloved and widely viewed films in human history, or that ReelShort has added together the views of the 70+ “episodes” to reach that final number? This number-fudging isn't even necessary: If you divided by 70, it would still imply more than 5.6 million views for this single vertical drama, which is a shocking enough figure. But the companies can't help themselves from aggrandizing these accomplishments. Vertical dramas are also dirt cheap and lightning fast to make—we're talking budgets of $100,000, and filming schedules of a week or less, allowing a project to progress from pitch to release in the space of a few months. Pay for most of the performers is necessarily low, but it's still enticing to those looking to break into the industry, and there's no shortage of obvious non-actors supplementing their ranks in every production. Disney made DramaBox one of the participants in its 2025 Accelerator Program, “to help Disney innovate in short-form content, with plans to adapt Disney's book properties into these bite-sized series for new audiences, focusing on emotional hooks and rapid production for platforms like TikTok and Reels.” Netflix has likewise already stated its intention to produce more vertical video content, which has thus far been interpreted as some kind of plan to ape TikTok. The answer is a hodgepodge of genres, primarily fitting into romance, fantasy, and thriller buckets. Subcategories include everything from “wallflower” to “janitor,” “protective husband,” “twisted lover,” “chef,” “super warrior,” “CEO,” and “rugged CEO,” which ReelShort separates into an entirely distinct category. Some titles reek of crude translations (Marry To Top Star At 40s) or keyword-cramming (Forced Into An Arranged Marriage, Only To Find Her Fiancé's Uncle Is Her Now-Successful Ex). These stories ape the zeitgeist, whether that means Hallmark-style holiday features, costume-driven royal intrigue stories, kink-centric workplace dramas, or timeless fantasies of being whisked away from mundanity by a fabulously wealthy man who can solve all of life's problems. The most common approach appeals to women with fetishes for being controlled by dangerous, violent men with the most slight of redeeming qualities. This dynamic is especially present in the “mafia” and “mob” genres, in which mousy heroines find themselves abducted or indentured into the service of chiseled male mafiosos who occasionally threaten them with death or torture, but also possess secret hearts of gold. He may be a prolific murderer, but he also tells the female lead that “you make me want to be a better man.” A number of these stories involve women being forced to abandon their lives, only to be transformed into contented tradwives for powerful men. Titles in this niche include Bound By Honor: Kidnapped By The Mafia King, My Sugar-Coated Mafia Boss, and Falling For My Ex's Mafia Dad, the latter of which doubles as an example of the prolific subgenre in which young women are enchanted by older men connected to their families or former lovers. The ReelShort category “Magic & Mates” spins more variations on women indentured to werewolf “alphas” than you could possibly imagine. Then there are the aforementioned “billionaire” stories, which involve 27-year-old captains of industry masquerading as janitors or vagrants, only to fall in love with gig economy workers unaware of their secret wealth. These dramas dare to ask, “Could you possibly forgive the man you're dating when he reveals that he's one of the richest people on the planet?” Morally, this subgenre is never quite what you expect: Rather than conveying the idea that even homeless people are real people, with dignity, the message is that you shouldn't judge these men because they might turn out to be secretly more powerful and wealthy than you. Vertical drama billionaires are also universally outfitted with the most hilariously slapdash facial hair ever committed to screen. The men all start out looking like they've just walked out of Spirit Halloween so there can be a scene where he “shaves” and debuts his babyfaced perfection. One element unites these disparate subgenres: They revolve around sex, but are sexless in execution. Even vertical dramas directly ripping off sexually explicit romantasy series remove actual sex or nudity, perhaps to get around accusations of pornography that could threaten their viability in app stores. Instead, viewers are teased by the constant insinuation of sex, or the occasional encounter that is interrupted or somehow supposed to have happened while two characters are fully clothed, and many “morning after” scenes. Shirtless men and hunks wrapped in towels dominate the proceedings, and even films in the erotica category (Swallow Me Whole, Surrender To My Professor, Submitting To My Ex's Dad) are less sexual than a daytime soap. Bizarrely, though, there's no such skittishness about language; even innocuous films are riddled with F-bombs. Vertical dramas make Ed Wood and Tommy Wiseau films look like Oscar bait. Rather, these are cynical, mass-produced products from studios that simply do not give a damn. The most basic limitations of shooting an entire feature film vertically, for native playback on phones—composition, blocking, cinematography—are luxuries you can't afford when you know your viewer is watching on a screen too small to make out fine details. This leads vertical dramas to focus their shots on static characters and their faces, which often end up cropped by sides of the screen anyway. Punches whiff their intended target by a foot or more, but are sold by the intended recipient anyway because they know there will be no second take. The same idea applies to the vertical drama philosophy around lighting, which is “no lighting.” Sets are reused repeatedly, with the same low-ceilinged office building unconvincingly doubling as everything from a fancy restaurant, to an airport terminal, to a mansion. One mob drama, filled with gunfire and digitally added muzzle flashes, has zero gunshot sound effects. Yet, nearly every vertical drama is full of inexplicable sound effects unrelated to anything happening on screen. Every 30 seconds or so, one of these sound effects will be employed, whether it's a cartoony sproing, or the shwing of a kung fu movie sword slicing through the air. Their blatant, torrential misuse begins to feel like an aural hallucination, and is so omnipresent that you'll find Reddit threads of people trying to understand what they could possibly mean. Are the people paying $20 a pop aware that there are actual feature films out there—many of them free to access—brimming with the genuine titillation and payoff that vertical dramas are denying them, not to mention bonuses like professional actors? One area where they're united, though, springs from the form itself—a style of content that blatantly steals IP and assigns no value to originality. One of the highest-rated vertical dramas on IMDb, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, has somehow been below the notice of Taylor Swift's attorneys. Instead, you'll stumble upon users who have uploaded the full 90-minute film everywhere else, starting with a YouTube version in the wrong aspect ratio with garbled sound, which has still amassed more than 1.5 million views. The same film can also be found uploaded in full on Dailymotion and even as a 90-minute Facebook reel on a user's personal page. That Facebook user has uploaded countless vertical dramas in their entirety, and no one seems to notice or care. It's fitting that the vertical drama user base has no qualms about stealing and republishing this content, when the very form itself relies on that type of thievery in order to satisfy the ravenous demand for escapist storytelling among audiences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Hudson, Kesha and John Legend were also among those paying homage to Carey at the annual fundraiser. In general, the performers fell into three buckets: Belters, devotees and innovators. Sombr Covers Olivia Dean's Hottest 100 Winner 'Man I Need' for triple j's Like a Version It was an audacious beginning that surely did nothing to quell any butterflies subsequent performers may have had. The devotees smartly didn't try to match Carey's pyrotechnics, instead delivered sturdy, sweet homages that were reverential in the best possible way from Charlie Puth's emotional “I Still Believe,” John Legend's piano and string-laden inspired version of “Hero” and trio FLO's gorgeous rendition of “Dreamlover.” They delivered electrifying versions of two songs from Carey's grunge (yes, you read that right) album, Someone's Ugly Daughter, which she recorded in 1995 under the name Chick with a different singer taking lead vocals. The Foos' guitarist Pat Smear, who had been sidelined with a broken foot when the band played a benefit two weeks ago, is such an avid Carey fanboy that he returned to the stage, playing seated with his broken appendage in a cast and extended. Maggie Rogers didn't upend her version of “Honey” in quite so drastic a fashion, but she started the tune as a languid slow groove before turning up the heat. Billy Porter, who also proved to be one of the style icons of the night with a straightened ombre bob, glittery eye shadow and a floor-length white and gold duster over gold velvet pants, freestyled through a compelling take on “Always Be My Baby,”  while Icelandic sensation Laufey delivered a jazzy, rhythmic rendition of “It's Like That” that felt fresh and innovative. Universal Music Publishing Group chairman/CEO Jody Gerson introduced Carey, declaring, “I would argue that she is the architect of the modern pop vocal,” while also praising Carey's songcraft. “Her songs are structurally sophisticated with key changes, extended bridges, modulations and unconventional phrasing,” she continued. “She blends pop accessibility with R&B, gospel and hip-hop songwriting traditions in ways that open the door to genre fluid pop, especially for female artists who follow. Carey, who follows such past honorees as Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen and Dolly Parton, called the evening “overwhelming in the best possible way,” as she looked around the room, commenting how blessed she felt to be surrounded by “so many friendly and familiar faces, people I've worked with, people I've long admired, even people I thought I'd never see again,” adding the last part with a laugh. She has supported many charities related to disaster relief, HIV/AIDS education and Make-A-Wish, and also founded in 1995 Camp Mariah, her eponymous summer camp she runs in conjunction with the Fresh Air Fund. “But tonight is not only about me, it's about this incredible organization, MusiCares, whether it's providing health care, financial support or simply offering a shoulder to lean on, MusiCares reminds us that behind all the glitz and glamor, there are real people who need care and community… We have to remember this organization thrives because of generosity, yours, mine, ours.” The evening closed the only way it possibly could: Even though Christmas is in the rearview mirror and it was 85 degrees in Los Angeles on Friday, Jon Batiste led several of the performers and presenters, including Kesha, Puth, Porter, FLO, Rita Wilson and Gayle King, in a spirited rendition of Carey's holiday classic, “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” complete with a wintery, snow-laden backdrop.

It's filled with viscerally thrilling set pieces that look far more expensive than they actually are, providing retro adventure thrills on an indie scale. “It's an old-school adventure movie,” McKinley said of the film. “It's got a lot of heart, and hopefully it's a throwback to the kind of movies we all liked, analog action-adventure films.” Hawke echoed those sentiments, explaining that he wanted to make a film about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. “It's not an action movie full of superhumans, it's an action movie full of humans going through really human situations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hollywood continues to mourn the tragic loss of Catherine O'Hara. The Emmy-winning actress passed away on January 30, “following a brief illness,” according to TMZ. Catherine was the second youngest of seven siblings—Marc, Maureen, Patricia, Michael, Tom, and Mary Margaret. Here are five fast facts to know about Catherine's beloved sister, Mary Margaret. The sisters shared a close relationship, even after pursuing different career paths. During Catherine's induction into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2007, Mary Margaret famously performed a touching serenade for the actress. Catherine previously admitted she was ‘grateful' her parents gave her six siblings, allowing them to navigate the loss of both parents together. “[I was] especially grateful … that they had given us each other because we were all together,” she said in an interview with “Wiser Than Me” podcast. In 1988, she released her only full-length solo album, “Miss America.” Aside from her album, she released a “Christmas” EP in 1992 and contributed songs to the film “Apartment Hunting” in 2001. 's Michael Stipe brought O'Hara on stage and dubbed her a “national treasure.” Other musicians who are fans of the singer include Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Dave Matthews, Morrissey, and more. Mary Margaret studied painting and graphic design at the Ontario College of Art. In 1978, Mary Margaret and her brother, Marcus O'Hara, started the Martian Awareness Ball as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebration in Toronto.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Itonje Søimer Guttormsen hopes her IFFR film, which also features references to news, including Donald Trump, gives people "courage to live" amid "this apocalyptic feeling" and "insane men ruling the world." The film's title is Butterfly, its setting is Gran Canaria, and its ensemble cast includes none other than best actress Oscar nominee and Sentimental Value star Renate Reinsve. If you're not sold yet, let us mention this plot outline: Two very different and estranged half sisters, laughable performance artist Lily and the much more quiet and restrained Diana, are forced to reunite in their childhood home in Gran Canaria after their parents' deaths, only to inherit an unfinished resort and an esoteric retreat. After all, their uninhibited mother, Vera, worked as a hostess at the resort. A Syrian and a Somali-Austrian Director on Their Displacement Film Fund Shorts and Cinema as an Act of Survival: Rotterdam 'Accept Our Sincere Apologies,' Set in a Grand Hotel in Venice That Feels Like a Golden Cage, Investigates Loneliness and Identity For Søimer Guttormsen, it marks a return to IFFR five years after her fiction debut screened in its Tiger Competition. Protagonist Pictures is handling sales on the movie from Mer Film, Quiddity Films, Zentropa International Sweden, and Nord Film and producer Maria Ekerhovd. Butterfly explores “one of contemporary culture's persistent habits: talking nonsense about ourselves, inventing images and narratives of our lives and even our pasts that may be fanciful at best and often hollow,” notes IFFR festival director Vanja Kaludjercic. In an interview with THR, Søimer Guttormsen discussed her inspiration for Butterfly, working with Reinsve and her other cast members, bringing back Gritt lead Birgitte Larsen – yes, as Gritt! Where did the idea to tell this story of the family of this butterfly woman, who leads an alternative lifestyle come from? It came to me very much from above, like ‘bang! The idea was the story of two sisters being very different, and their mother's crazy journey as they grew up. I started wondering why they were so different. It's funny, though, because I have no relationship with this kind of tourism at all. For holidays, we never went to these places. But Gran Canaria is the most visited place for Norwegians. So this is where people either go on holiday or they go there when they're older to [spend their retired] life there. Does Gran Canaria have a certain reputation in Norway? It's very common for Norwegians to go there, but a lot of people tend to hide the fact that they go there. But when I came up with this idea, for me, it was obvious that this woman, coming from the harsh Norwegian working class in the '70s, felt like going there to live a more glamorous life and be a part of this tourism machine that in the '70s was quite glamorous. Things didn't quite remain all that glamorous for her… But the funny thing is that when I started go there to research, I met so many women in their 70s now – blonde, beautiful – who really came there as tourists and hosts in their early days, and ended up living in the mountains, being cavewomen and healers. Did you meet any people on the island who ended up in Butterfly? So, the film is full of people who played themselves. Also featuring in the film is Gritt from your first movie. How early did you know that she would be part of Butterfly? When I worked on that film, it was a long process, 11 years. We made it first as a short film and then had many attempts before the full feature film came out. So, she will be a part of my universe. I want my different films to be in the same universe, so that I can never use the same actor in a different role. So if, let's say, Lily or Diana show up in another feature film, they will be played by the same actress. When I was doing my field work and went back and forth to Gran Canaria for three years, writing this story, I found this location with horses up in the mountains. And I just saw Gritt sitting there, making her embroidery in a chair, with my inner eye. Tell me a bit more about this amazing cast, led by Renate and Helene! I like to write for certain actors instead of doing it all in a casting process. She definitely gave off a little Lily vibe. This is very Norwegian of me, but I was resisting using such a famous person, although she wasn't that famous back then. So, it took me a long time, three rounds. With Helene, it was different because she starred in my graduation film. I knew that she was an exceptional talent, but she lives in a different place, so I kind of forgot about her a bit. So, I wrote the role for someone else, but then Helene appeared for a screening of Gritt, and we reconnected, and she was just brilliant. Watching Butterfly, I thought about the difference between the family you have when you're born and the family you choose, but also trauma related to sexuality, and more themes that all feel interrelated… There are so many themes that have been important for me over time. So it's maybe a film about reconciliation and community. As the mother dies, through her death, I feel she's mothering them post mortem. We don't have to go and reconcile with our mother at the deathbed. Butterfly includes very timely references, including news reports about U.S. President Donald Trump, refugees, amd supply chain issues due to the war in Ukraine. How important was it for you to root the film in this day and age? Thank you for bringing that up, because it's so important to me. During the edit process, people would suggest we could take out some of that. We are in such unstable times, but there is also a possibility to create something new. Can you touch on that a little bit? In my previous film, Gritt wants to defeat the patriarchy and capitalism. She was very much thriving in the male gaze and addicted to the male gaze, and she transmitted that to her daughters in different ways. Lily is turning into this dark heroin chick, but she's also living off her beauty, and she's also living off men, being the muse for an artist in Hamburg etc. This is what they inherit from their mother. Chato, the male in the film, is talking about this mother wound as a poisonous notion of being an object instead of a subject, which is part of the patriarchy. He is a catalyst, which I find very positive, because it is not ruling out the men, because I think we need men and women in this healing of the patriarchy. Do you have any new project in development? So this new film takes place at a silent retreat. But it is in the early stages, so I think it will develop – and there will be some speaking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news of Catherine O'Hara's passing was announced on Friday, January 30, social media was flooded with tributes. O'Hara was 71 at the time of her death. Candace Cameron Bure was among those who shared their thoughts, and the actress celebrated O'Hara with a short but touching post. The former Hallmark star posted a photo announcing O'Hara's passing from E! What a legend.” She ended her message with two broken heart emojis. Bure's comments about loving O'Hara have been widely shared, with celebrities including O'Hara's longtime friend and collaborator, Eugene Levy, sharing her sentiments. “Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today. I had the honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years,” Levy said in a statement to People. He continued, “From our beginnings on the Second City stage, to SCTV, to the movies we did with Chris Guest, to our six glorious years on Schitt's Creek, I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and the entire O'Hara family.” Other tributes include one from Dan Levy, Pedro Pascal, “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon, “Home Alone” star Macaulay Culkin, actress Christina Ricci, “Beetlejuice” director Tim Burton, and many more, who have publicly mourned her passing. Bure competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 18 in 2014 alongside professional partner Mark Ballas, and placed third on the ABC dance competition. She has had an incredible career and met many people whom she cared about, including her “Full House” co-star Bob Saget. Bure has been open about her grief and remembered Saget with heartfelt posts on Instagram. Saget died from head trauma and was found at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando, Florida, on January 9, 2022, People reports. Just three weeks ago, Bure penned a touching post on Instagram in honor of Saget. Not just today, but every day,” she wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sombr praised Dean as "a really inspiring and incredible artist," adding that the song immediately stood out to him. Sombr has put his own spin on Olivia Dean's Hottest 100-winning song “Man I Need,” delivering a fuzzy, indie-leaning cover for triple j's long-running Like a Version series. Introducing the cover, sombr praised Dean as “a really inspiring and incredible artist,” adding that the song immediately stood out to him. Inside MusiCares' Person of the Year Gala Honoring Mariah Carey, Featuring Foo Fighters, Busta Rhymes, Laufey & More Originally released by Dean in 2024, “Man I Need” was crowned No. Sombr's rendition strips the track back emotionally while reshaping it sonically, layering distorted vocals and a driving indie-rock pulse over the song's core melody. Known for blending alt-pop and indie rock with diaristic, emotionally raw songwriting, sombr has quickly built momentum over the past year with a run of globally resonant releases. In 2025, he released his debut studio album I Barely Know Her, a 10-track project co-produced with Tony Berg that explored themes of heartbreak, longing and life in New York City. The album included several of his biggest tracks to date, including “Back to Friends,” which became his breakout global hit and made the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Undressed,” which topped charts in multiple countries, and “12 to 12,” which finished at No. His rising profile has also been reflected on the awards circuit, with nominations at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards for best new artist and best alternative (winning in the latter category), alongside a growing slate of high-profile live performances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before a musician played a single note at First Avenue, the iconic venue in the heart of Minneapolis, seemingly every voice in the room on Friday afternoon was chanting the words “fuck ICE.” This was a Tom Morello concert, but even more than music, everyone was unified under the show's banner: “a concert of solidarity & resistance to defend Minnesota.” This was a prelude to a larger protest just blocks away and a benefit for the families of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Everyone was already plenty fired up, so naturally, they came unglued when Morello revealed that his surprise guest was none other than Bruce Springsteen. “Now I know Tom is an excitable man. As the song wound down, cheers gave way to a chant spurred on by Springsteen himself: “ICE out now!” Springsteen and his sometime bandmate traded verses and massive guitar solos on 1995's “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” a song the pair have performed together numerous times. Morello lifted and inverted his guitar mid-solo to reveal the words “arrest the president” while Bruce beamed and laughed next to him. It was an afternoon hinged entirely on the topics of protest and resistance. “Brothers and sisters, thank you for welcoming us to the battle of Minneapolis,” he opened. Bruce Springsteen's Protest Anthem, Plus Noah Kahan and More Songs You Need to Know This Week White House Calls Bruce Springsteen's ICE Protest Song ‘Random' and ‘Irrelevant' “I heard the Trump administration has claimed that outside agitators have come to Minneapolis to stir up trouble,” Morello said between songs, eliciting boos from the audience. “I would like to confirm that we are those outside agitators, and we're gonna stir up a shit-ton of trouble.” The show wrapped up just after 2 p.m., and later, Morello walked out into the streets to join the protest. Well before any of the musicians grabbed their coats and made it out of the building, though, one audience member called out to the crowd that was freezing outside First Avenue to follow him and protest. A horde of people followed that dude's lead — concrete evidence that the tenets of resistance didn't fall on deaf ears.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid her resignation from Georgia's 14th congressional district, Marjorie Taylor Greene provided her input on Don Lemon‘s arrest during an onscreen appearance. During Friday's episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, the politician said “I completely support his arrest” following Lemon's Thursday indictment for covering an anti-ICE protest at a Minneapolis church earlier this month. “Well, I'm gonna say he violated the FACE Act,” she told Maher. “He went into a church, disrupted their worship, and then later in an interview, compared them to white supremacists. Greene addded, “So, I don't think that's journalism. And Don Lemon came to my office with the ‘Tesla Takedown' guy, that organized it, and we had to call Capitol Police.” Fellow panelist Joe Scarborough argued that “there's no doubt this was meant to scare other reporters, scare other journalists” from covering ICE‘s ongoing acts of violence in public. “Well, I think it's bullsh*t to disrupt church,” said Greene. “I don't think Christians should be harassed in church, especially by activists and reporters.” On Friday, Lemon was released from custody on a no-cash bond, after which he thanked everyone outside the Los Angeles courthouse for their support. “I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” said Lemon. “In fact, there is no more important time than right now this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Earlier today we noted that HBO has been reaping big benefits from getting back to certain TV basics, with its massively successful The Pitt essentially asking “What if you gave people who are very good at making medical dramas a lot of freedom and support to make a medical drama?” Now the network (and its attendant streamer, HBO Max) is starting to look like it might try to do the same thing with that other cornerstone of the TV procedural market, the tried-and-tested cop show. Specifically, Deadline reports that HBO Max has tapped network TV vet Milo Ventimiglia to star in American Blue, with “man who makes a lot of movies about cops, and also one time about a Suicide Squad” David Ayer set to direct the pilot.

Created and written by Jeremy Carver—whose credits include serving as showrunner on Supernatural during its middle seasons—the show certainly does sound like a slightly more sober take on the modern cop show, casting Ventimiglia as Brian “Milk” Milkovich, who “returns to his hometown of Joliet, Illinois, to rescue a beleaguered police force while seeking redemption of his own.” (Embracing all the qualities available to a male TV cop show protagonist, Milk is described as being both “quietly determined” and “a natural-born leader.”) Deadline notes that the show is being produced on what we refuse to just give in and call “The Pitt blueprint,” i.e., casting a famous guy to star in a show set in a well-trod genre that's able to put out 15 episodes of TV a year. (“Ah,” we say, sitting down to 9 million re-runs of Tom Selleck's Blue Bloods: “It's a Pitt-a-like!”)

Ventimiglia (serving as a co-executive producer) comes to the series after basically a million years on This Is Us, and significantly less on his 2023 crime drama The Company You Keep. Ayer, meanwhile is one of several executive producers on the show. Although he's done a lot of cop movies over the years—most notably Oscar-winner Training Day, but also End Of Watch, 2003's S.W.A.T., and, if you want to get loose with definitions, the 2017 Will Smith fantasy police debacle Bright—he's largely steered clear of TV. (The main exception being directing early episodes of 2020 Fox show Deputy.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Catherine O'Hara played Moira Rose, a former soap opera star, in Schitt's Creek for six seasons. Moira Rose was an eccentric and glamorous character who believed she was a star, even when her and her family, played by her longtime colleague Eugene Levy, Dan Levy and Annie Murphy, were forced to move into a motel in the remote titular town after losing their fortune. Dan Levy, who played Moira's son David Rose, wrote on Instagram, “What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years. Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.” Eugene Levy was close friends with Hara and worked with her in a variety of roles over the years. The pair started out in Toronto-based improv troupe The Second City, before joining the cast of sketch series SCTV in 1976 and then working on Christopher Guest films including Best In Show and A Mighty Wind. “Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today. I had the honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years,” said Eugene, who played Moira's husband Johnny Rose, in a statement. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and the entire O'Hara family.” Annie Murphy, who played daughter Alexis Rose, wrote, “Ha-ha-HAAAA?!?! Her laugh was a perpetual Yes, And… It challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was. Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her.” Eugene's daughter Sarah Levy, who played Twyla on the show, wrote, “This one cuts deep. Jennifer Robertson, who played Jocelyn Schitt, wrote, “Being in Catherine O'Hara's orbit was a beautiful and magical gift. She was an absolute star who never understood why people made such a fuss over her. Her passing is a loss for everyone who knew and loved her, and a loss for Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hilary Duff's “toxic” mom-group pals, including Mandy Moore, were on-hand Thursday to support the singer during her LA stop on the Small Rooms, Big Nerves Tour. “Broke my brick time to say that my bud is a sensational icon queen giving us all what we needed,” Moore gushed atop a pic of Duff onstage. “This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore,” she recalled texting. Moore, Duff, and Meghan Trainor are A-list celebrities who have been photographed at mom group activities with Tisdale in the past. Since then, family and friends have taken sides in the rift. Zac Efron's brother Dylan Efron defended Tisdale during Wednesday's episode of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” calling the “High School Musical” star “sweet.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. He added, “So I can't envision her doing anything malicious to the mom group. Duff's estranged sister Haylie Duff also appeared to side up with Tisdale, as the duo has been spotted hanging out multiple times over the past week. The “Napoleon Dynamite” actress shared a photo of her daughter, Lulu, 7, playing beneath a table with Tisdale's daughter Jupiter, 4 — which Tisdale reshared via Instagram Stories on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they headed out to a Malibu restaurant with their kids in tow. Meanwhile, as the feud rages on, a source told Page Six earlier this month that the drama didn't sprout from one specific incident. “It's a myriad of things, not just one specific,” the insider said.</p>
