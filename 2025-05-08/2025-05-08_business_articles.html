The U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument in Washington.

Senate Democrats blocked stablecoin legislation backed by the digital assets industry amid a furor over President Donald Trump's extensive and growing portfolio of crypto ventures.

Backers of the bill failed to muster enough support to bring it up for consideration with only 48 senators voting in favor Thursday, short of the 60 votes needed. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump congratulated Robert Francis Prevost after his election as pope Thursday, making him the first American-born pontiff in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. Prevost, 69, of Chicago, will be known as Pope Leo XIV. "It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!" Leo has not always had positive words for the U.S. president and his administration, however. A verified X account linked to the new pope shared an article in February criticizing Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, over his interpretation of Jesus' teachings. "JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others," read the headline of the article shared by Prevost's account. Vance in an X post Thursday afternoon congratulated the new pope, writing, "I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church." In April, the account re-posted another tweet criticizing Trump over his administration's mass-deportation efforts. "Do you not see the suffering? Prevost was chosen on the second day of a papal conclave in Vatican City. The cardinals' selection of the successor to Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88, was revealed by white smoke billowing from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel. Days after returning from Francis' funeral in Rome, Trump joked to reporters that he'd "like to be pope." Trump later posted an AI-generated image of himself dressed as the pope, drawing criticism. Former President Joe Biden wrote on X later Thursday, "Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Former President Barack Obama, who has lived and worked in Chicago, wrote on X, "Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV." "This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith," Obama wrote.

Apple Inc.'s silicon design group is working on new chips that will serve as the brains for future devices, including its first smart glasses, more powerful Macs and artificial intelligence servers. 

The company has made progress on the chip that it's developing for smart glasses, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The move indicates that Apple is ramping up work on such a device, which would compete with the popular Ray-Ban spectacles offered by Meta Platforms Inc.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire Bill Gates announced on Thursday that he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years. In a blog post, the Microsoft co-founder wrote that he was motivated by the many challenges facing the world, such as children's health and climate change, as well as the late Andrew Carnegie's admonishment of wealth hoarding. "People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them," Gates wrote. Gates is currently the world's fifth richest person with a $168 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $200 billion commitment assumes his charitable foundation's endowment will grow through investments. After Bill Gates has given away "virtually all" of his wealth, the foundation will close at the end of 2045, he said. Gates is one of few billionaires to publicly step up their charitable giving as nonprofits and universities reel from federal funding cuts. Despite his increase in giving, he said philanthropists cannot cover the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by the U.S. and other wealthy countries. "The United States, United Kingdom, France, and other countries around the world are cutting their aid budgets by tens of billions of dollars. "It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people." The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gates criticized Elon Musk for his role in cutting U.S. foreign aid. In February, Musk's so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. The federal agency disbursed $42.5 billion in 2023, according to government data, that provided lifesaving assistance, including health care, clean water and food across the globe. In early March, the agency estimated that the cuts would have dire consequences, including 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition going untreated and up to 166,000 additional deaths from malaria. Gates, his then-wife and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 as a commitment for the world's richest people to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetime or wills. Gates told the New York Times that he doesn't know whether Musk will follow through. "The Giving Pledge — an unusual aspect of it that you can wait until you die and still fulfill it. He could go on to be a great philanthropist," he said before pointing to Musk's involvement in the foreign aid cuts. Musk has given away less than 1% of his wealth, according to Forbes. The publication estimates his out-the-door giving — gifts that have been paid, not just pledged or parked in a foundation — at $620 million over his lifetime through 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.4% higher, trimming earlier gains, with Germany's DAX up 1%. The risk-sensitive technology sector rose 1.64% amid optimism in U.S. markets over trade talk progress. Sterling was slightly higher against the euro and U.S. dollar. See CNBC's full coverage of the U.K.-U.S. deal here. The bloc also said it was launching a public consultation on a list of U.S. imports worth 95 billion euros ($107.5 billion) that could be subject to new import duties as a part of EU retaliatory measures. In London, the Bank of England on Thursday cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 4.25%. Two of its members voted to cut rates by 50 basis points, while another two wanted to hold rates steady. It came after Sweden's Riksbank held its key interest rate steady, citing uncertainty in the global economy as a direct result of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. Also in focus was the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision — the U.S. central bank on Wednesday held steady on rates as it highlighted rising inflation and unemployment risks. The Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a range of between 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since December. Despite a decline in the U.K.'s FTSE 100, British firms including engine-maker Rolls Royce and aerospace firm Melrose both closed higher on news of a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement. Shares of the companies closed 3.7% and 5.2% higher, respectively. "The contents of the deal remain very limited in their totality and we await the full detail before we can say if there is a winner from this negotiation," Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter, said in emailed comments. "However, for the U.K. this deal appears to be ultimately favourable for some of its largest exports, specifically cars, auto parts and aerospace engines to name some of the key areas." "The final details are being written up," Trump said. "In the coming weeks we'll have it all very conclusive." He said that the deal includes "billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports," and that the UK will "reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products." While the event was ongoing, Trump's Truth Social account posted a screenshot indicating U.S. tariffs on the UK will stay at 10%. A former adviser to a British Prime Minister has said the U.K.-U.S. trade deal expected later today is likely to be "far short of anything comprehensive." Andrew Hood, international trade lead at London based law firm Fieldfisher and former general counsel to Prime Minister David Cameron, said there were "some" differences between how the U.S. and the U.K. were portraying the trade deal expected to be announced. "The President described it as full and comprehensive, but it looks more likely to be focussed on reducing tariffs in certain key sectors, notably for cars. It may include steel and other specific sectors but it is a long way off the full Free Trade Agreement the UK and US have been negotiating for almost exactly 5 years," Hood said. "It appears likely to help address the trade friction created by the President's recent announcements, but will be far short of anything comprehensive." In addition to launching a WTO complaint against the U.S. on Thursday, the European Commission also said it would open a public consultation on a list of goods that could become subject to EU countermeasures against U.S. tariffs. The goods — which include certain types of livestock, wine, chocolate and machinery, among other things — are worth 95 billion euros ($107.5 billion), according to the European Commission. The European Union announced on Thursday that it was launching a WTO dispute against the U.S. in relation to the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, as well as new levies on cars and car parts imported into America. "The EU's objective is thus to reaffirm that internationally agreed rules matter, and these cannot be unilaterally disregarded by any WTO member, including the US." Yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — moved higher across the board on Thursday afternoon, after the Bank of England trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, with prices falling and yields rising when investors are less willing to lend to the government issuing the debt. Gilts with short-term maturity periods saw the biggest selloff, with yields on both 2- and 5-year gilts rising by around 7 basis points at 12:17 p.m. in London. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office told CNBC an announcement on Britain's trading relationship with the U.S. was imminent. "Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today." The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, bringing it down to 4.25%. Two of its members wanted to cut rates by 50 basis points, the central bank said, while another two wanted to hold rates steady. Here's what the decision could mean for your money. "We don't want to be the leader in terms of the pricing change in U.S. markets," chief financial officer Markus Neubrand told journalists on a press call after the company's earnings release. "There are other players in our industry where the U.S. is far more relevant. The retailer maintained its full-year guidance earlier on Thursday and said it is not quantifying the potential implications of tariffs at this stage. Shares of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall gained 1.7% by 10:35 a.m. in London, after the defense giant posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings. The company said Thursday that its sales grew 46% year-on-year in the three months to March to hit 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion), with its defense segment seeing a 73% jump in sales. Rheinmetall confirmed its 2025 full-year guidance of 25% to 30% sales growth, noting that it saw "further upside potential" as regional governments ramp up defense spending. Danish shipping giant Maersk on Thursday posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but warned that the current level of U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. The company, widely regarded as a barometer of global trade, reported preliminary underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.71 billion for the first three months of the year. That's up 70% from $1.59 billion over the same period a year earlier and above the $2.57 billion expected by analysts in an LSEG poll. Sweden's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 2.25% in a decision announced on Thursday morning. Policymakers said that although inflation was slightly elevated at 2.3%, they expect prices to stabilize. However, they noted that increased uncertainty overseas meant the outlook for the Swedish economy was weaker than they had forecast in March. Officials added that new tariffs were expected to dampen demand in Europe, putting downward pressure on inflation — but they said trade developments remained "very hard to assess." "The Executive Board assesses that monetary policy is currently well-balanced and that it is wise to await further information to obtain a clearer picture of the outlook for economic activity and inflation." Spanish lender Banco Sabadell's first-quarter profit surged above expectations to reach 489 million euros ($552 million), figures released on Thursday morning showed. Analysts had been forecasting 405.9 million euros in quarterly net profit. German sportswear brand Puma on Thursday retained its full-year guidance, saying it is not calculating the potential impact of tariffs at this stage. The retailer, which relies heavily on manufacturing Asia, nevertheless said it has moved to reduce its U.S. imports from China. "We already reduced U.S. imports from China and we will continue to remain agile and ready to manage the increased market volatility and swiftly respond to changing external conditions," he added. Neubrand added in an earnings call that the company is "constantly reviewing price adjustments" and is considering "cost optimization" for products in the United States. That comes after Rival sportswear giant Adidas warned last week that the levies would lead to price hikes for all of its U.S. products. Puma on Thursday reported a slightly better-than-feared 52% year-on-year decline in first-quarter operating profits excluding one-time costs to 76 million euros. That was less than the 58% decline to 66 million euros anticipated by analysts in an LSEG poll, but well below last year's 159 million euros. Sales were flat at 2.07 billion euros versus expectations of 2.04 billion euros, led by weaker demand in the U.S. and China. The U.S. had been a key growth driver for Puma over recent quarters amid soft sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific, most notably China. The world's largest brewer AB InBev on Thursday flagged a "strong start" to the year, with first-quarter profits at the top end of its outlook as sales volumes dipped less than anticipated. That was well ahead of analyst expectations for 3.1% growth, according to Reuters. AB InBev, whose brands include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, also reported a better-than-feared 2.2% decline in first-quarter beer sales. First-quarter revenues totaled $13.63 billion, slightly above the $13.78 forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll. Germany's Siemens Energy on Thursday posted a better-than-expected 20.7% annual jump in quarterly revenue, citing increased demand thanks to "favorable market trends" that ultimately led to one of the company's best quarters. However, Siemens Energy also warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime — and retaliatory measures from other countries — is expected to have a direct impact on its bottom line. "Siemens Energy is closely monitoring developments and continuously analysing their potential impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations," the company said in its earnings release. "For the second half of the fiscal year 2025, a limited direct impact on Siemens Energy's Profit of up to a high double-digit million € amount, after mitigation measures, is currently expected." Britain is reportedly set to sign a trade deal with the U.S., making it the first country to do so after the world's largest economy announced stiff "reciprocal" tariffs against friends and foes alike in April. The New York Times reported the development after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday night stateside that there will be a briefing about a trade deal next day, without revealing any details. U.S. equity positioning may not be all that upbeat despite recent trade developments and quarterly results, according to Citi. However, the uplift from bullish flows has been considerably restrained," Chris Montagu, the firm's global head of quantitative research, wrote in a note on Wednesday. Montagu found that positioning momentum levels are actually close to neutral for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. "Limited bullish flows were overshadowed by increasing short positioning, leading to a decline in positioning levels for the S&P," he continued. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged rising headwinds to the central bank's dual mandate on Wednesday. "My gut tells me that uncertainty about the economy is extremely elevated. The downside risks have increased," Powell told reporters. However, he added, "The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen, but they haven't materialized yet. … And that tells me more than my intuition," reiterating the Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged. European markets are expected to open higher Thursday. It's a busy day for earnings, with Maersk, Siemens Energy, Heidelberg Materials, Henkel, Infineon, Lanxess, Puma, Rheinmetall, Bosch, Norwegian Air, Swisscom, Zurich Insurance, Adecco Group, InterContinental Hotels Group and Banco Sabadell all due to report. Monetary policy announcements are due from Riksbank, Norges Bank and Bank of England on Thursday, with the latter widely expected to cut interest rates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Gates sharply criticized Elon Musk in an interview with The New York Times published on Thursday, calling out the Tesla cofounder's role in cutting foreign aid as part of his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. The Microsoft cofounder said that cuts made to foreign aid, particular programs administered by the now-shuttered US Agency for International Development, were "stunning." He put it in the wood chipper, because he didn't go to a party that weekend," Gates told the Times of Musk. Gates also referred to an instance early in President Donald Trump's term in which administration officials said that the US had been sending condoms to Gaza via foreign aid. In reality, the US had been providing contraceptives to a province in the African country of Mozambique. "They cut the money to Gaza Province in Mozambique. That is really for drugs, so mothers don't give their babies HIV," Gates said. Will they go meet those babies who got HIV because that money was cut? The Gates Foundation has invested heavily in public health initiatives around the world, often focusing on childhood diseases. This isn't the first time Gates has been critical of Musk — or vice versa. Gates has argued that Musk has destabilized the politics of foreign countries through his support for right-wing causes in the United Kingdom and Germany. Musk, DOGE, Tesla, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.</p>

Tech Reviews:

Whoop MG.

Review: The Whoop 5.0 and MG — short for medical grade — are meant to appeal to a broad user base beyond just athletes.

Whoop Inc., the maker of increasingly popular, screen-less fitness bands, debuted updated hardware on Thursday with more compact designs, improved battery life and blood pressure tracking in the highest-end model.

With the new devices — the Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG, short for medical grade — the company is looking to gather a wider audience and add to an array of gadgets pitched as smartwatch alternatives. Both products also include improvements to sleep tracking, a suite of women's health features, Vo2 max measurement and the ability to estimate a wearer's physiological age, while the medical-focused model includes heart health monitoring, a tentpole of other wrist-worn devices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew LaBrot might seem to be an unlikely face of the Tesla resistance. He trained Tesla employees how to sell the electric cars across North America. But over the past two years, LaBrot, a self-described Democrat, became increasingly disenchanted with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. His feelings began to turn after Musk's purchase of Twitter, and they soured further over Musk's work for President Donald Trump. On April 24, LaBrot set up a website protesting Musk's leadership at Tesla. The next day, he took his Cybertruck to a Tesla Takedown protest in California. "I wasn't planning on working anywhere else," LaBrot told Business Insider. While hundreds of protests outside Tesla facilities have sprung up across the country, Tesla employees have largely refrained from speaking publicly on the issue. He rose quickly at the carmaker, eventually stepping into a program management role for sales and delivery training in North America. It also afforded him tremendous opportunities: He moved up the corporate ladder, and the company's stellar stock performance helped him purchase his first house in 2022. He first began to question Musk's leadership after the billionaire took over Twitter, later rebranded as X, in 2022. Musk spent at least $277 million in political contributions supporting Trump and other Republican candidates ahead of the presidential election. He also held $1 million giveaways for voters who signed his super PAC's petition. LaBrot was especially offended by a salute Musk made during Trump's inauguration celebration in January, which LaBrot and other critics believed was a Nazi salute. In October of last year, Musk said he didn't think his political activities would affect Tesla, saying sales were at an all-time high. "The CEO of any given company is going to have political views. At the end of the day, what matters is if Tesla makes a great product, and people like buying great products." LaBrot said his on-the-ground experience didn't support Musk's prediction. As foot traffic began to drop, LaBrot said, Tesla's sales training team was told it was more important than ever to win over each customer who came through the doors. Tesla began pushing more sales promotions and incentives, which was unusual, LaBrot said. Now, salespeople were fighting to close on every reservation. LaBrot said he was used to handling the typical EV hurdles: range anxiety, misinformation, user error. "We didn't have to do a ton of overcoming objections because those customers just stopped coming," LaBrot said. Earlier this year, LaBrot said, Tesla's sales team hit another level of panic as EVs began piling up in sales lots. Even Tesla's refreshed Model Y wasn't selling as they'd hoped, he said. Tesla released the vehicle in January and already has a surplus of inventory, LaBrot said. It released a cheaper version of the refreshed Model Y on Tuesday. In California, a key market for the company, Tesla registrations fell more than 15% during that quarter. Analysts say there are multiple factors at play when it comes to Tesla's sales, including customer alienation over Musk's political views, the company's aging vehicle lineup, increased competition from companies overseas, and the overall US electric vehicle market. By early 2025, LaBrot was growing increasingly frustrated with Tesla. He was unhappy with the company's lack of internal communication about how Musk's political views might be affecting sales numbers, as well as scant guidance around how sales workers should handle protests and vandalism. "They're talking about struggling sales and how do we increase the close rate, without talking about this humongous elephant in the room," he said. As the months went on, LaBrot said, he began to voice more of his concerns to his coworkers and in a meeting with other corporate sales staff. The tipping point came April 22, when Musk announced that he would be spending less time with the White House DOGE office and turning his attention back to Tesla. Two days later, LaBrot posted his website, which he kept anonymous. It contained an open letter calling for Tesla to find a new CEO. "When it went live, I felt so relieved, like a weight had been lifted," LaBrot said. "This statement I've been trying to put into words, been expressing in company meetings — finally publishing it was a really good feeling." While the open letter was written as if it came from multiple Tesla employees, LaBrot said that he was the only author — but that some coworkers had expressed similar sentiments to his. In conversations with more than a dozen current and former employees, many told BI they had concerns about Musk's leadership and political focus. He said he was told his employment was terminated for using company resources to build a website that did not align with the company's perspective. LaBrot denied that he used Tesla resources to build the site. Since his firing, LaBrot has continued to attend Tesla protests and says he has received support from some former Tesla employees. Musk's politics aside, LaBrot says he remains a cheerleader for the brand. "I still firmly believe in the company," he said, "and what we're working towards." Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?</p>
