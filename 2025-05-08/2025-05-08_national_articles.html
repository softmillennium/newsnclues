Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, former World Championship Wrestling president Eric Bischoff and Real American Freestyle COO Israel 'Izzy' Martinez join 'Fox & Friends' to announce the launch of their new freestyle wresting league. Real American Freestyle announced the additions of a handful of superstar champion wrestlers to its roster on Thursday with the first event only months away. David Carr, Kyle Dake, Trent Hidlay, Kyle Snyder and Aaron Brooks will participate in the unscripted wrestling series. The five men enter the league via SuckerPunch Entertainment, a sports management agency that specializes in combat sports. Aug. 9, 2024; Paris, France; Aaron Brooks (USA) celebrates after defeating Javrail Shapiev (UZB) in a men's freestyle 86kg bronze medal match during the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Champ-de-Mars Arena. "David, Kyle, Aaron, Trent, and Kyle represent the best of the best, and that's who we're targeting for Real American Freestyle," pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, the commissioner of Real American Freestyle, said in a news release. "Our goal is to give these athletes an opportunity to continue their careers, create a platform for greatness, and inspire a legacy that lasts Dake won a bronze medal at the Tokyo and Paris Olympics as well as a four-time national champion at Cornell. Brooks was a four-time national champion at Penn State and won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics.

He served on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during President Donald Trump's first term. Ben Askren, Kennedy Blades, Zahid Valencia were announced as the first wrestlers to join Real American Freestyle upon its launch. Hogan and Eric Bischoff explained to Fox News Digital last month they are trying to make freestyle wrestling mainstream. "It's a completely underserved sport, meaning there's no professional league that allows these amateurs to evolve like they would in any other sports and it's such an underserved market, and I know, having spent a little bit of time in amateur wrestling as a kid, these are unique athletes," Bischoff said. Aug. 11, 2024; Paris, France; Kyle Snyder (USA) wrestles during his loss to Amirali Azarpira (IRI) in a men√≠s freestyle 97kg bronze medal match during the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Champ-de-Mars Arena. "Every athlete is committed, they have to be disciplined, but there's something about individual sports, particularly, wrestling, it's just a different kind of grind, and you have to be wired a little differently to be successful at it."

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addresses airport safety concerns and discusses his plan to improve an 'antiquated' travel infrastructure on 'The Story.' President Donald Trump touted his administration's efforts to rebuild and modernize U.S. air traffic control, as the Department of Transportation rolled out its three-year plan to build a brand-new, "state-of-the-art" system to address critical safety needs, while blasting former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for having "no clue." "Under President Trump, America is building again," Duffy said Thursday, upon rolling out the new proposal for a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a brand new, state-of-the-art air traffic control system." "Decades of neglect have left us with an outdated system that is showing its age," Duffy said, noting that building the new system "is an economic and national security necessity, and the time to fix it is now." Under the new air traffic control system proposal, the FAA would replace infrastructure, including radar, software, hardware and telecommunications networks, to manage modern travel. The plan would ensure facilities are equipped with better technologies to reduce outages, improve efficiency and reinforce safety. "We're going to be buying a brand-new, state of the art system that will cover the entire world," Trump said earlier Thursday. The plan consists of four infrastructure components: communications, surveillance, automation and facilities, according to the Transportation Department. A Southwest plane lands at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Dec. 30, 2022. The plan also would address runway safety by increasing the number of airports with Surface Awareness Initiative to 200. Officials expect this to be complete by 2027. It also proposes replacing 15 towers and 15 co-located TRACONs, or Terminal Radar Approach Controls, which are facilities that manage air traffic in the airspace surrounding busy airports. Officials also proposed the installation of new modern hardware and software for all air traffic facilities, which would create a common platform system throughout all towers, TRACONs and centers. The proposal also includes the deployment of additional technologies to the Caribbean and Alaska to provide accurate, real-time surveillance and weather information for air traffic control and pilots to ensure "safe and efficient flights for these critical locations." Officials stressed the need for a new air traffic control system, saying the FAA is grappling with a "rapidly growing, complex and demanding aviation sector," as commercial air travel returns to pre-COVID levels. Officials also pointed to novel challenges, including drones and advanced air mobility. Officials said the FAA's current systems "are showing their age," which leads to "delays and inefficiencies." The Department of Transportation stressed that the current National Airspace System is "safe," but stressed that maintaining safety is necessary. The proposal is based on a three-year framework to reinvest in the National Airspace System, and called for an "emergency supplemental funding increase." "Modernization of the NAS can no longer take 10+ years to complete; it must be done now," the proposal states. "We need an immediate infusion of funding to address critical infrastructure needs." Duffy, on Thursday, said the project would take three to four years. "We need all of the money up front." "So I'm going to ask the Congress for upfront appropriations to give us all the money. I'll come before the Congress every, every quarter and give them an update of how far we've built, how much money we've spent." Duffy added that if the Department of Transportation is not given the money, it would take "10 to 15 years to build this." "And by the time we get done with it, what we're going to build is already going to be old technology," Duffy said. "So we want to build this in three to four years, and we can do it with the help of Congress." A report issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in March shows that the Trump administration inherited an outdated FAA system from the Biden administration with "severe shortcomings" that resulted in dangerous travel conditions across the country. GAO said that under the Biden administration the FAA "did not prioritize or establish near-term plans to modernize unsustainable and critical systems." The GAO's 2025 report said the 2023 national airspace prompted an operational risk assessment, which found that of the 138 air traffic control systems, "51 (37%) were deemed unsustainable by FAA and 54 (39%) were potentially unsustainable." Trump, on Thursday, blasted the current "ancient infrastructure," saying that "it's buckling under the weight of more than a billion flying passengers a year and supporting hundreds of billions of dollars." "Pete Buttigieg, who was the secretary of transportation, had no clue what the problem was," Trump said. Trump said Buttigieg "wants to run for president." "The federal government now pays $250 million annually just to keep up the old equipment and keep it running." Meanwhile, Duffy on Thursday said the administration has assembled an "unprecedented coalition of support" from labor to industry, stressing that support is "indicative of just how important it is to this administration to get done what no one else could." Duffy added: "The American people are counting on us, and we won't let them down." The rollout of the proposal comes just days after the FAA issued a ground delay for Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey due to staffing shortages, weather and construction. It also comes after air traffic controller audio was made public from when radar and radio communications with planes were briefly lost at Newark Liberty International Airport on April 28. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association confirmed the incident to Fox News Digital, writing that the FAA's operation in Philadelphia had "temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them."

Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost steps out onto the balcony to address the crowd as he is elected the next pope in St. Peter's Square, Vatican, Thursday, May 8, 2025. Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti announced Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost's election as pope to the thousands of faithful who descended on St. Peter's Square after the 133 voting cardinals deliberated in the Sistine Chapel for roughly 24 hours. Prevost, a 69-year-old Augustinian, appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica wearing the traditional red cape of the papacy ‚Äî a cape that Pope Francis had chosen not to wear after his election in 2013. His first words as pope were "Peace be with you," which he said in Italian, and delivered a message to the faithful building bridges, peace and dialogue "without fear." Prevost then switched to Spanish to recall his years as a missionary and later archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. He did not deliver any words in English. Prevost succeeds the late Pope Francis, who died at age 88 on April 21 following health challenges. Prevost, whose views are close to those that Francis held, thanked his predecessor in his remarks. Newly elected Pope Leone XIV appears on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, Thursday, May 8, 2025. As a result, Prevost had a prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals have. Prevost was born on Sept. 14, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois. He is also a citizen of Peru, where he lived for years as a missionary and later as an archbishop. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Villanova University in 1977 before taking his solemn vows and studying theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in 1982.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cardinals had been in lockdown for one day and 24 minutes. More than an hour later, the protodeacon of the College of Cardinals appeared before the masses gathered in St. Peter's Square to make an announcement: ‚ÄúAnnuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus papam!‚Äù ‚Äî in English, ‚ÄúI announce to you a great joy: We have a pope!‚Äù An emotional Prevost, 69, emerged to greet the cheering crowd shortly after 7:24 p.m. Prevost, who was born in Chicago and is a graduate of Villanova University, is an Augustinian who spent years as a missionary and then archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. His first words as pope were, ‚ÄúPeace be with you,‚Äù before offering a message of peace and dialogue ‚Äúwithout fear.‚Äù He wore the traditional red cape of the papacy, something Pope Francis had declined to wear in 2013. It had been rumored that he emerged as an alternative pick from a voting bloc that had hoped to install Cardinal Luis Tagle from the Philippines. Tagle and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis, had been seen as early favorites for the position. President Donald Trump quickly posted his congratulations on Truth Social. ‚ÄúCongratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!‚Äù If one wishes to consider what societal and cultural changes the new pope will need to confront, they need only look at the tens of thousands of people from all over the world gathered in St. Peter's Square during the conclave. By 2013, Facebook was peaking in relevance, and suddenly, it was common for Catholics and non-Catholics alike to remark on the conclave from the comfort of their homes. This week, drones have been spotted occasionally flying around Vatican City. Well-edited ‚Äúfancam‚Äù montages of users' favorite cardinals appeared on X, Instagram, and TikTok. Users bonded over their shared boredom, watching the chimney for smoke signals. Much of this online conclave fanaticism was coming from people who do not even believe in the Catholic faith.</p>

The development came after India fired attack drones into Pakistan on Thursday, with one wounding four soldiers, the Pakistani military said, a day after missiles struck several locations and killed more than two dozen people.

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) ‚Äî India fired attack drones into Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least two civilians, the Pakistani military said. India said it ‚Äúneutralized‚Äù Pakistan's attempts to hit military targets. It was not possible to verify all of the claims. Rubina Begum wails as she stands outside her house damaged by Pakistani artillery shelling, at Salamabad village in Uri ,north of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Thursday, May 8, 2025. The exchanges came a day after Indian missiles struck several locations in Pakistan, killing 31 civilians, according to Pakistani officials. New Delhi said it was retaliating after gunmen killed more than two dozen people, mostly Hindu tourists, in India-controlled Kashmir last month. India accused Pakistan of being behind the assault. Both sides have also traded heavy fire across their frontier in disputed Kashmir, and Pakistan claimed it killed scores of Indian soldiers. Shesh Paul Vaid, the region's former director-general of police, said there was a complete blackout in Jammu following loud blasts. Vaid told The Associated Press that the Jammu Airport likely was under attack and that some of the 50 loud explosions he heard likely were because ‚Äúour defense system is at work.‚Äù Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has vowed to avenge the deaths in India's missile strikes, raising fears that the two countries could be headed toward another all-out conflict. The relationship between countries has been shaped by conflict and mutual suspicion, most notably in their dispute over Kashmir. They have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region, which is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety. A Kashmiri village boy walks inside a house damaged by Pakistani artillery shelling, at Salamabad village in Uri ,north of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Thursday, May 8, 2025. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the latest tensions between India and Pakistan. About 2,000 villagers also fled their homes in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Mohammad Iftikhar boarded a vehicle with his family on Thursday as heavy rain lashed the region. India fired several Israeli-made Harop drones at Pakistan overnight and into Thursday afternoon, according to Pakistani army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, who said 29 were shot down. Two civilian were killed and another wounded when debris from a downed drone fell in Sindh province. ‚ÄúThe armed forces are neutralizing them as we speak,‚Äù he told state-run Pakistan Television. People holding Indian national flags rally's in support of the Indian Army as they celebrate the success of ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor', in Guwahati, India, Thursday, May 8, 2025. In Lahore, local police official Mohammad Rizwan said a drone was downed near Walton Airport, an airfield in a residential area about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the border with India that also contains military installations. India's Defense Ministry said its armed forces ‚Äútargeted air defense radars and systems‚Äù in several places in Pakistan, including Lahore. At a news briefing, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday rejected India's claim that Islamabad carried out any attack in Indian Punjab. ‚ÄúThese accusations are an attempt to incite anti-Pakistan sentiment among the Punjabi Sikh population in India,‚Äù he said. Seated alongside Dar, the military spokesperson, Sharif said Pakistan shot down 29 Indian drones after they violated its airspace. Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told parliament that so far Pakistan has not responded to India's missiles attacks, but there will be one. Later Thursday, Indian authorities ordered a night-time blackout in Punjab's Gurdaspur district, which borders with Pakistan. The Harop drone, produced by Israel's IAI, is one of several in India's inventory, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance report. According to IAI, the Harop combines the capabilities of a drone and a missile and can operate at long ranges. Earlier, the army said one Indian soldier was killed by shelling Wednesday. Students place candles during a candle light vigil for children killed in the Indian missile strikes, in Islamabad, Pakistan Thursday, May 8, 2025. India's Foreign Ministry has said that 16 civilians were killed Wednesday during exchanges of fire across the de facto border. Pakistani officials said six people have been killed near highly militarized frontier in exchanges of fire over the past day. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri denied that New Delhi has targeted civilians and a key dam, as Pakistan has alleged. He, in turn, accused Pakistani forces of targeting civilians, including at a Sikh Temple in Kashmir, where he said three Sikhs were killed. Flights remained suspended at over two dozen airports across northern and western regions in India, according to travel advisories by multiple airlines. Pakistan resumed flights nationwide after a suspension at four airports, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced a new framework Thursday for a bilateral trade deal with the United Kingdom, his first trade deal since launching an overarching tariff agenda last month. White House officials previously told the Washington Examiner that the administration was close to agreeing to deals with a number of trading partners. The groundwork was always going to be a little bit easier than, say, China or something like that,‚Äù one White House aide said ahead of Thursday's announcement. Trump first announced the deal Thursday morning on Truth Social but was joined by members of his Cabinet and, by phone, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office just before lunch to speak on the agreement. ‚ÄúSo there could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement. Trump told reporters that, while the exact details of the deal won't be finalized for several weeks, it will provide ‚Äúmillions of dollars of increased market access for American exports,‚Äù including agricultural products such as beef, ethanol, and industrial products. Trump also claimed that the U.K. would drop some of its targeted trade barriers on American products and that the deal would include a ‚Äúfirst of its kind‚Äù economic security agreement. I don't want to insult people by saying that, but I can say it's certainly one of our greatest right at the top, and they're the first one we're talking about.‚Äù People said we couldn't do a global tariff. They said no one would want to deal with us,‚Äù added U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer. Following his remarks, Trump did take issue with a reporter's question about the president's ‚Äúconclusive‚Äù framing, given that there is ‚Äúmuch more work still to do.‚Äù But this is a maxed-out deal, not like you said it. While the exact content of the deal is unknown, American Enterprise Institute foreign policy senior fellow Dalibor Rohac says real, serious, and comprehensive free trade agreements take years to negotiate. ‚ÄúWhat the U.S.-U.K. agreement will likely involve [is] cuts to the absurd, arbitrary tariff rates imposed on April 2, in exchange for some minor British concessions, which may or may not be trade related,‚Äù Rohac told the Washington Examiner. ‚ÄúIt is good if the president is looking for a politically palatable off-ramp ‚Äî but no one should be under the illusion that this is about actual trade liberalization or strengthening of the trans-Atlantic trade and economic links,‚Äù he said. In a statement before the announcement, Trump said it was an ‚Äúhonor‚Äù to sign this first trade deal of his second term with the U.K. ‚ÄúMany other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!‚Äù Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Thursday's developments an ‚Äúimportant step towards fair and reciprocal trade with our partners around the world.‚Äù Still, reports indicated that this first deal will have a limited scope and include commitments to future exchange of goods between the countries. U.K. officials told CNN that, despite the principal agreement, Trump will maintain the same 10% flat tariff he levied on all trade partners in April. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he would roll out his long-teased tariffs on pharmaceutical products ‚Äúover the next two weeks.‚Äù The Trump administration will look to face down that challenge this weekend. Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are traveling to Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend for meetings with European leaders and the first direct talks with trade emissaries from Beijing since Trump launched his tariff agenda.</p>

But Trump's baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place, and the Republican president suggested that even higher import taxes would be charged on other countries trying to reach deals with the U.S. Cars are parked at Port of Tilbury, England, Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025. ‚ÄúThat's a low number,‚Äù Trump said of the U.K.'s 10% tariff rate, adding that other countries would face higher tariff rates in their deals because the U.S. runs trade deficits with them and ‚Äúin many cases they didn't treat us right.‚Äù The announcement provided a political victory for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump's claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms. ‚ÄúIn the coming weeks, we'll have it all very conclusive,‚Äù Trump said. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the baseline 10% tariffs would stay in place and that an unspecified British company would be announcing the purchase of $10 billion in aircraft from Boeing. U.K. officials said that Trump's auto tariffs would go from 27.5% to 10% on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminum would go from 25% to zero. Starmer said Britain would preserve its health and safety standards on food products. The U.K. government also said it would also reduce tariffs on 2,500 U.S. products such as olive oil, wine and sports equipment, bringing down the average tariff rate 1.8%. ‚ÄúTo be able to announce this great deal, on the same day 80 years forward, almost at the same hour,‚Äù Startmer said, ‚ÄúI think is incredibly important and makes this truly historic.‚Äù Starmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and promoted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. While celebrating the planned deal, Trump talked up the U.S. economy's future despite worrisome signs of a possible slowdown and increase in inflation that could hurt most Americans' financial well-being and lead to layoffs. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands at a joint press conference in the East Room at the White House Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025, in Washington. Trump said that fewer container ships arriving from China meant ‚Äúwe lose less money‚Äù from the trade deficit, even though the goods in those ships are used by U.S. manufacturers and sold by retailers in ways that can support jobs while holding down prices. Asked about companies saying they would need to raise prices because of the tariffs, Trump said, ‚ÄúI think they're saying that just to try and negotiate deals with me.‚Äù Trump suggested that he might put 100% tariffs on Mattel toys if they don't relocate their factories to the United States. Trump has maintained that there is ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù no inflation. The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., making it a bit easier to find common ground at a time when Trump has staked his tariffs on eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the U.S. No new deals have been reached with America's largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the U.S. as an incentive for Brexit. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade agreement after three years of negotiations. Steel rods produced at the Gerdau Ameristeel mill in St. Paul, Minn., await shipment, May 9, 2019.

We focus on being useful to you ‚Äî breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But there's another trend pushing American childhood in a more communal direction: Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kids' lives. Susan Miller, a 67-year-old grandma in the Washington, DC, area, told me that while her mom had 13 granddaughters, she has four grandchildren. Having fewer grandkids ‚Äúgives you more time with them,‚Äù she said. Longer life expectancy also means kids actually get more years with their grandparents than they used to, even though people are having kids later in life, according to Ashton Verdery, a sociologist at Penn State University. These trends are ‚Äúlikely leading to deeper relationships between grandchildren and grandparents,‚Äù Verdery said. Beyond participating in impromptu ballet performances, grandparents provide a host of benefits for kids. They can also offer kids a fresh perspective and sometimes come at child care with a more relaxed outlook than their stressed-out adult children, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University who has studied grandparents raising grandchildren. Experts say policymakers should embrace reforms that allow grandmothers and grandfathers to spend time with their grandkids because they want to ‚Äî not because their families have no other choice. Close relationships between grandparents and grandchildren are far from new. ‚ÄúIntergenerational caregiving by grandparents, especially grandmothers, reaches back to the dawn of our species,‚Äù Tobi Adejumo, a doctoral candidate at the University of Colorado Denver who has studied grandparent care, told me. Multigenerational households have long been common in many communities, with Asian American, Black, and Latino families all more likely than white ones to have grandparents and grandkids under one roof. In the early US, people often became grandparents while still raising their own young kids, limiting how much time they could spend with grandkids. But today, smaller families and later childbirth mean grandparents are less likely to still be actively parenting. While the falling birth rate may be bad news for older adults who want lots of grandkids to spoil (or for those who end up not having grandchildren at all), it also means grandmothers and grandfathers have more quality time to spend with each child. The way grandparents and grandchildren relate to each other is also shifting. Older adults are more active than they once were, making them more able to play with their grandkids, said Donna Butts, executive director of Generations United, a nonprofit that works to connect children and older people. So not only can grandparents buy their grandkids presents, but they can also take them on outings and travel to visit them more easily. Meanwhile, skyrocketing child care costs and parents' increasingly demanding jobs have led to an increased need for help from grandma and grandpa, said Jennifer Utrata, a sociologist at the University of Puget Sound who studies grandparenting. More grandparents are responding to this need by providing child care on a regular basis, sometimes stepping in for multiple days per week, a phenomenon some call ‚Äúintensive grandparenting.‚Äù While grandparent care has historically been more common in communities of color and immigrant communities, it's now on the rise among white, middle-class families, Utrata said. One 2023 poll found that more than 40 percent of working parents relied on their children's grandmother for child care, Hill reports. Miller, the DC grandma, often cares for her grandchildren in the summer and on visits, including staying with them while their parents took a two-week trip. In addition to taking some pressure off parents, grandparents can have a big impact on kids' worldview, experts say. They can serve as role models but may also be less focused on work than parents in the middle of their careers, and more able to make kids the center of attention, Kelley said. Spending time with grandparents can also transform a child's view of aging. People who have close relationships with grandparents will often say they ‚Äúdon't look at older people as icky‚Äù but rather as ‚Äúvibrant,‚Äù Butts said. Of course, grandparents can also offer high-quality, trusted care at a time when that's hard to come by. But regular caregiving can also be hard on grandparents, even if they're in good health. The demands of intensive grandparenting fall disproportionately on grandmothers, who can struggle to balance their own needs with those of their grandkids, Utrata said. Some grandparents retire early to help with grandchildren, which can be a financial strain, especially in low-income families, Adejumo said. Many grandparents pay for necessities like food and diapers while watching their grandkids, adding to the financial stress. Vice President JD Vance has suggested that grandparents could ‚Äúhelp out a little bit more‚Äù as a way of addressing the high cost of day care. But ‚Äúwe should not be foisting our child care challenges on an older generation,‚Äù Utrata said. Affordable, accessible child care would help grandparents be involved in their grandkids' lives without pressure or exhaustion, Utrata said. In California and other states, grandparents can receive subsidies for taking care of grandchildren, but they are often too low to cover the real cost of care, Adejumo said. There's a growing recognition in American society that making sure parents are healthy and financially stable also benefits kids. The Trump administration's tariffs are indeed hitting baby goods, with stroller manufacturer UPPABaby announcing price hikes. Trump, meanwhile, says all costs are down, except for ‚Äúthe thing you carry the babies around in.‚Äù He also says tariffs might mean American kids have ‚Äútwo dolls instead of 30.‚Äù However, after a legal challenge and widespread criticism, the administration is no longer planning to eliminate all funding for Head Start in its proposed budget.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The prosecutor whose murder case against a former Michigan police officer ended in a mistrial said he's not certain if he will bring charges again Former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr appears at the Kent County Courthouse in Grand Rapids, Mich., Thursday, May 8, 2025. Body worn camera footage showing former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr with a Taser7 and Patrick Lyoya is shown during the third day at the Kent County Courthouse with his wife Brandey in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. Judge Christina Mims declares a mistrial after the jury could not reach a verdict in the murder trial for former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr at the Kent County Courthouse in Grand Rapids, Mich., Thursday, May 8, 2025. Supporters of former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr hug after Judge Christina Mims declared a mistrial at the Kent County Courthouse in Grand Rapids, Mich., Thursday, May 8, 2025. Former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr appears at the Kent County Courthouse in Grand Rapids, Mich., Thursday, May 8, 2025. The result came at the start of the fourth day of deliberations and was a partial victory for Christopher Schurr, who still could face another trial. We are in pain,‚Äù Lyoya's father, Peter Lyoya, said of the outcome, speaking through an interpreter. Defense attorney Matthew Borgula said he talked to jurors and learned that most wanted to acquit Schurr. ‚ÄúWe cannot declare victory because there really is no winning here. The mistrial occurred a day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted in the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop. His death was the first post-George Floyd case that revealed the limits of an unprecedented reckoning over police reform and racial injustice in Black America. Schurr told jurors he feared for his life after losing control of his Taser during an intense struggle across front yards in a residential neighborhood. Videos were an important part of the trial and were repeatedly shown to the jury, including critical images recorded by a man who was with Lyoya. Judge Christina Mims had urged the jurors to keep working after they said Tuesday that they were struggling to reach a consensus. Besides murder, they also could consider a lesser charge of manslaughter. Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker said he would need more time to decide, adding that he won't ‚Äúbow to public pressure‚Äù from supporters or critics. Obviously the jury thought differently,‚Äù Becker said. The shooting happened on April 4, 2022, when Schurr, who was patrolling alone, stopped a Nissan Altima for improper license plates and requested Lyoya's driver's license. They struggled and the officer wasn't able to subdue Lyoya with a Taser, which Lyoya was able to grab. Schurr repeatedly demanded he stop resisting and drop the Taser, then fired one bullet into his head. Schurr testified he was ‚Äúrunning on fumes‚Äù after the fight and in great fear because a Taser can cause ‚Äúexcruciating pain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believed that if I hadn't done it at that time, I wasn't going to go home,‚Äù Schurr said of shooting Lyoya. The prosecutor, however, argued that the Taser had already been deployed twice by Schurr and could only be used in a different mode if Lyoya had decided to turn it against the officer. It's not known why Lyoya was trying to flee. Records show his driver's license was revoked at the time and there was an arrest warrant for him in a domestic violence case, though Schurr didn't know it. An autopsy revealed his blood-alcohol level was three times above the legal limit for driving. Besides Schurr's account of that day, jurors heard from witnesses who were described as experts in the use of force. Some were Schurr's fellow officers at the Grand Rapids department who supported him. Defense experts said the decision to use deadly force was justified because the exhausted officer could have been seriously injured if Lyoya had used the Taser. Lyoya's family has said they came to the U.S. to escape prolonged civil unrest in eastern Congo. Lyoya ultimately joined a list of other Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S. only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement, including Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universities across the country are scrambling to comply with President Donald Trump's anti-diversity push in an effort to hold on to hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants that fund critical medical research in areas such as cancer and maternal health. The latest moves broaden the anti-DEI mandate that Trump signed just hours into his second term, declaring diversity, equity and inclusion efforts discriminatory. The administration is locked in a legal battle with Harvard University that on Monday saw officials cut off future funding, escalating a total freeze on $2.2 billion in federal grants directed to Harvard. Dozens of schools across the country have publicly ended DEI programs and quietly taken down or rerouted websites referencing diversity and equity. But those efforts haven't spared them from mass funding cuts. Leaders at Ohio State University, Vice President JD Vance's alma mater, acted early to end DEI programs and eliminate 16 staff positions in February, citing Trump's mandate and a state bill. But in March, the administration still canceled 10 grants to Ohio State, clawing back $2.4 million in planned spending on HPV and Covid-19 vaccine uptake and separate studies on substance use, suicide risk and PrEP access among different LGBTQ populations. Starting in February, the US National Institutes of Health terminated roughly 780 research grants that referenced equity, racial disparities, minority health, LGBTQ populations and Covid-19. The canceled grants spanned the country: Roughly 40% were to organizations in states Trump won in November, according to a KFF analysis. Those have included cuts to research seemingly squarely in line with the stated goals of the Trump administration and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., such as studies on autism diagnoses, chronic disease improvements and environmental exposures' intersection with health. Besides the immediate impact of frozen research and staff layoffs, scientists and public health experts worry about a chilling effect for health care studies overall. The NIH is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research, issuing roughly 60,000 grants a year to nearly 3,000 universities and hospitals. That accounts for more than 80% of the agency's current $48 billion annual budget, although the administration aims to slash that spending by a third next year. ‚ÄúPeople are frightened,‚Äù said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit group aimed at improving health care research. For instance, the US reports persistently high rates of maternal and infant deaths compared with other high-income countries. There are stark disparities within those figures: Black women are three times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than White women. Researchers and state medical boards attribute those statistics to a range of factors including racial bias, health care access, underlying health conditions and socioeconomic status. That makes it extraordinary difficult to strip equity, race and risks for certain populations from questions about maternal health care and other research, experts say. Whether it's new mothers' postpartum survival, HIV prevention in LGBTQ populations or higher risk of aggressive breast cancer in Black women, many studies necessitate a focus on the people most affected, those experts say. ‚ÄúThere's real issues here that could be better understood and responded to, and lives could be saved, but only if you study them ‚Äì and only if you understand what you're studying,‚Äù Zuckerman said. Beyond hundreds of grants citing words such as equity, disparities, gender, minority, LGBTQ populations or race, the NIH also canceled spending on Covid-19 outreach, vaccination and messaging. The mass culling of NIH grants has even stoked concern among Republican leaders who argue that the US could slide in medical innovation and world leadership with the combined funding cuts, mass layoffs and agency shakeups. ‚ÄúWe must not lose sight at what is truly at stake here,‚Äù Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said during a Senate Appropriations hearing last week. ‚ÄúIf clinical trials are halted, research is stopped and laboratories are closed, effective treatments and cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, type 1 diabetes, childhood cancers and Duchenne muscular dystrophy will be delayed or not discovered at all.‚Äù In 2023, the NIH launched a $168 million initiative across 10 universities to improve maternal health care. In March, the agency canceled funding to two of them. Along with Georgia's Emory University, Morehouse stood up a program focused on improving pregnancy and postpartum care for Black women. Morehouse School of Medicine President Valerie Montgomery Rice stood fast against anti-DEI efforts in February, telling local radio station WABE that ‚Äúdiversity, equity and inclusion, as it relates to health, is not a political term.‚Äù The medical school is still reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect research, spokesperson Jamille Bradfield told CNN in an email. ‚ÄúMore broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.‚Äù Six included related terms in the grant name; all noted disparities and disproportionate risks among Black, Hispanic or indigenous women in the abstracts, or short descriptions of their projects. It's almost like sticking our heads in the sand.‚Äù Related article More than a dozen states, DC sue Trump administration over ‚Äòdismantling' of federal health agencies The researcher asked that their name not be used because they are affiliated with one of the still-funded maternal health programs and are fearful that research could be cut next. ‚ÄúI feel so helpless in this moment,‚Äù the researcher said. ‚ÄúThere's no logical reason for the decisions being made. Columbia OB/GYN expert Dr. Uma Reddy led the $4.6 million project to improve postpartum care by providing doulas to new mothers with mental health and cardiac complications after pregnancy ‚Äì two of the top risks for maternal death in the country. Without NIH funding, there is little recourse, Reddy said. ‚ÄúYou naturally first think about industry partnership, but they're not interested,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is not a drug that can be marketed.‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause by having a healthy mother, you're going to have healthier children, healthier families, and you actually decrease costs of federally funded health care programs.‚Äù Chan School of Public Health poll published last month. Only solutions to chronic diseases and research into infectious diseases garnered more support in the survey of both Republicans and Democrats. The university ended its DEI programs that month with a Board of Visitors vote. ‚ÄúEvery aspect of DEI is to be ripped out, shredded and terminated,‚Äù one of the board members told The Daily Progress. Ohio State's 10 canceled grants include one focused on substance use and associated chronic illnesses across sexual minorities in urban and rural areas. ‚ÄúWe are grateful for the research support we receive from our federal partners as these investments literally save lives in‚ÄØOhio‚ÄØand our nation,‚Äù OSU spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. Johnson said that the university's review of DEI programming is ongoing, but that certain organizations such as the Frank W. Hale, Jr. Black Cultural Center‚ÄØwill remain open. Tulane also lost funding for research on Covid-19 treatment in cancer patients. The medical school has since quietly removed and rerouted diversity pages on its website. The president of Tulane University announced in a message to students and faculty on March 13 that it would transition its DEI program into a new ‚ÄúOffice of Academic Excellence and Opportunity‚Äù to comply with federal law. ‚ÄúAt stake here is the more than $320 million we receive annually in federal funding,‚Äù Tulane President Michael Fitts wrote in the message to students and faculty.</p>

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey gestures, during the Monetary Policy Report press conference in London, Thursday, May 8, 2025. LONDON (AP) ‚Äî The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration. The decision Thursday was widely expected, though there was an array of opinion on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, with two voting for a bigger half-point cut to 4%, and two voting to hold rates. Andrew Bailey said inflationary pressures have continued to ease, paving the way for the fourth quarter-point rate cut since August. The decision is the first since President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, is expected to be lifted later Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outline details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. At the very least, they are expected to lower the tariff burden. However, he said that as a ‚Äúvery open economy,‚Äù with global connections, the British economy would still be affected by tariffs applied to other economies. ‚ÄúThis will be good news all around, including the U.K. economy.‚Äù The rate cut comes despite expectations that inflation will rise further above the bank's 2% target over coming months, from the current 2.6% as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, and firms passing on tax rises to consumers. ‚ÄúWhile headline inflation is expected to rise in the near-term, we do not expect that to persist,‚Äù said Bailey, adding that it will be back around target in two years time. Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the U.S. economy before making any moves. ‚ÄúWe still think the Bank will cut rates at least twice more later this year, but much like the Fed's message yesterday, U.K. policy makers will want to see more data on how tariffs and domestic tax increases are being digested by the economy before moving decisively‚Äù said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.</p>

Former FBI investigator Bill Daly discusses reports that the Venezuelan government is allegedly working with Tren de Aragua to harm the United States on ‚ÄòThe Will Cain Show.' A suspected member of the notorious Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang was among five people arrested during a human smuggling bust in Texas, authorities said Wednesday. The three suspects accused of human smuggling have been "circumventing Border Patrol checkpoints" and using known human smuggling routes to bring up to 15 people per week into the U.S., Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told reporters. He said two other individuals present during their arrests were accused of drug possession. The three suspects charged with human smuggling were identified as 24-year-old Jose Francisco Barriento Vega of Mexico, 49-year-old Mary Lou Tula and 44-year-old Alexis Segundo Olivo Fernandez of Venezuela. Vega is in the U.S. without documentation, Salazar said, while Tula is believed to be a U.S. citizen. Jose Francisco Barriento Vega, 24, is a Mexican national who is in the U.S. without documentation, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said. Mary Lou Tula, 49, is believed to be a U.S. citizen. Two other men, identified as 25-year-old Brandon Suarez and 19-year-old Bryan Suarez, happened to be present at the scene of an arrest and were arrested for drug possession, the sheriff said. Alexis Segundo Olivo Fernandez, 44, is a Venezuelan national and suspected member of Tren de Aragua, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said. Salazar said a sixth individual, whom he said he was unable to publicly name at this point, is suspected of being a member of TdA. Salazar said the sheriff's Human Exploitation Unit has worked with Laredo Sector Border Patrol to investigate the human smuggling group since launching operations in April. The sheriff noted the group has associations with criminal organizations responsible for upwards of $1 million of seized cash. Those arrested were booked into Bexar County Jail. Salazar said more arrests are possible as the investigation remains ongoing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the pause being announced on April 9 with the promise of deals to come, Trump did not announce any finalized deals until Thursday. Trump posted on Truth Social that a ‚Äúfull and comprehensive‚Äù agreement had been made with the U.K. He also said deals with other countries were in ‚Äúserious stages of negotiations.‚Äù Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social early Thursday morning. He also had blanket 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. Of the global reactions to Trump's tariffs, the U.K. had a fairly tame response publicly, instead discussing optimism about a ‚Äúfavorable‚Äù deal and not imposing retaliatory tariffs. Officials did stress that no options were off the table, but Trump and British officials had regularly said that talks were ongoing. U.K. exports to the U.S. in 2024 amounted to roughly $261.8 billion, according to the U.K.'s Department for Business and Trade, with the top exported goods during that year being cars, pharmaceutical products, power generators, scientific instruments, and aircraft. Trump's first post-tariff trade deal is also with a country he has shown fondness toward. At a White House meeting earlier this year, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer relayed an invitation from King Charles III to Trump for an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù second state visit to the U.K. China was the only country exempted from the pause, with Trump slapping 145% tariffs on it because of its retaliatory response to his initial tariff rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend to discuss trade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is laser-focused on securing high-value critical minerals for the United States, whether through pushing to buy Greenland or demanding a share of Ukraine's resources. But there's another ‚Äî and possibly far more dangerous ‚Äî place where he now seeks them: the ocean depths. Thousands of feet underwater lie potentially lucrative treasure troves of copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, manganese and other minerals that are vital for computer chips, modern batteries and other products needed for the clean energy transition. There is currently no commercial deep-sea mining happening anywhere in the world, though companies have been pushing for years. They appear to have found a new champion in Trump. In April, he signed an executive order to kickstart a commercial deep-sea mining industry. The deep ocean is one of the planet's last wild frontiers and its least-known environment ‚Äî more than 99% of remains a mystery to humans. Scientists warn mining here could cause irreparable damage to species and ecosystems that have evolved over millions of years and host a rich tapestry of life. Deep-sea mining targets three very different types of ecosystems. Most interest is in polymetallic modules: small, potato-sized rocks scattered across parts of the deep ocean floor. These are like chimneys pushing out superheated, mineral-rich water from deep beneath the Earth, which solidifies into deposits rich in metals such as copper, zinc and sometimes gold and silver. Then there are seamounts, underwater mountains that rise thousands of feet above the seabed and have cobalt-rich crusts. These minerals are found in oceans across the planet, but the focus of many mining companies is on an expanse of Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which spans more than 3,000 miles and is around 12,000 to 18,000 feet deep. Companies are still developing mining vehicles, but one method would be to use large tractor-sized machines that drive across the sea floor plucking up nodules and transporting them via long pipes to a ship on the surface. Here they would be washed and separated, with sediment pumped back into the ocean. Plans include using remotely-operated vehicles to scrape up and pulverize mineral deposits before sending the mixture up to the surface. Whichever techniques are used, mining thousands of feet underwater, where temperatures are very low and the pressure is extreme, is likely to be immensely challenging. The inky ocean depths are often assumed to be barren, but this is a myth, said Adrian Glover, a deep-sea ocean scientist at the UK's Natural History Museum. They are ‚Äúactually surprisingly rich in biodiversity,‚Äù he told CNN. Hydrothermal vents, one of the most extreme habitats on Earth, teem with life. There are yeti crabs, nicknamed Hoff crabs for a resemblance to the hairy-chested actor David Hasselhoff; scaly-foot snails covered in iron armor; and colonies of giant tube worms that can grow more than 6 feet long. There are huge uncertainties given how little is known about the ocean depths, but scientists say impacts could be vast, including an irreversible loss of biodiversity. Research suggests sediment plumes kicked up by mining could harm marine life, as could the mud pumped back into the ocean from support ships. One study found sounds from a deep-sea mine could reverberate through the ocean for more than 300 miles, disturbing whales, dolphins and other creatures. Longer term, there are fears that damage to deep-sea landscapes could have ripple effects through the ocean and potentially affect fisheries. Mining could even affect the ‚Äúdark oxygen‚Äù scientists recently discovered is produced by nodules, which they say could help them unravel the origins of life. It's unclear how fast mined areas would recover. Deep-sea mining companies say many concerns are overblown and contradict their commissioned science. We're just saying the impact is a fraction compared to the known set of impacts that are happening today on land,‚Äù he told CNN. ‚ÄúStarting a whole new extractive industry that scientists have already said will cause irreversible biodiversity loss is not a good idea,‚Äù said Louisa Casson, global project leader for Greenpeace's campaign to stop deep-sea mining. While the appetite for many critical minerals is soaring, some experts say demand can be brought down by recycling, reusing and reducing consumption. Technology is also changing with efforts to develop batteries that eliminate the need for cobalt and nickel. Companies including BMW and Samsung have even backed calls for a pause on deep-sea mining. ‚ÄúDeep-sea mining is a high-risk, low-reward gamble with no credible economic case,‚Äù Democratic Oregon Rep. Maxine Dexter posted on X this week. Norway voted last year to open part of its Arctic seabed to deep-sea mining but has since paused the project. In international waters, the process is governed by the International Seabed Authority, which has been trying to develop a mining code since 2021 but has yet to formalize one. More than 30 countries, including Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom, have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its impacts. As negotiations rumble on, mining companies have grown impatient. Trump's executive order offers a way to bypass the international process and start extracting. A US deep-sea mining industry is essential to counter China's aggressive pursuit of ocean minerals, a White House spokesperson said, and domestic laws would ensure strong environmental protection standards. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which will be responsible for issuing licenses, told CNN there would be ‚Äúa multi-step process before any exploration activities or commercial recovery can occur.‚Äù How long that process will take may soon become clear. The International Seabed Authority sharply criticized Trump's order. Any unilateral action to mine international water ‚Äúsets a dangerous precedent that could destabilize the entire system of global ocean governance,‚Äù said Leticia Reis de Carvalho, the ISA's secretary general. ‚ÄúAuthorizing deep-sea mining outside international law is like lighting a match in a room full of dynamite ‚Äî it threatens ecosystems, global cooperation, and US credibility,‚Äù said Arlo Hemphill, project lead on Greenpeace USA's campaign to stop deep-sea mining. If and when companies will be able to get machines on the seafloor is far from clear.</p>

The practice is not only devastating entire marine ecosystems but coastal communities that depend on fish for their livelihoods. Industrial fishing vessels ‚Äî what Attenborough calls ‚Äúvast factories at sea‚Äù ‚Äî hoover up everything and leave little behind for locals. In the Pacific Ocean nations of Kiribati and Palau, and the Indonesian province of West Papua, coral reefs that have suffered mass bleaching events are alive once more, and areas where fishing has been banned, such as small marine reserves in the Mediterranean, have bounced back to life. Sala shares Attenborough's optimism that the ocean could be saved if we act now. There are three main threats, he says: global warming, plastic pollution and overfishing. The film's overriding message is not that all fishing is bad, but that priority areas must be fully protected with clear no-take zones. Less than 3% of the ocean is fully protected, according to the Marine Conservation Institute ‚Äî this needs to increase, says Attenborough. ‚ÄúSuccess is possible,‚Äù he adds, as he reminds viewers that action like this has happened on a global scale before. Whales were hunted to the brink of extinction, but a ban on commercial whaling in 1986 has seen many populations make a comeback. Sala believes that Attenborough's movie could help turn the tide: ‚Äú(The message that) we are draining life out of the ocean, but if we protect at least a third, we can bring it back to life: I have been saying it for years, scientists have been saying it for years, but now that he says it, people are going to listen.‚Äù Related article The tide is turning on shark nets at Sydney's famed beaches ‚ÄúWe have been talking to the brains of decision makers, now we have the images that will speak directly to their guts and their hearts.‚Äù The film is being released ahead of June's United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, France, in the hope that it might influence governments to take action. Member states have already agreed in principle to protect 30% of the world's oceans, but implementation has been slow. ‚ÄúThis could be the moment of change,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNearly every country on Earth has just agreed on paper to achieve this bare minimum and protect a third of the ocean. Together, we now face the challenge of making it happen.‚Äù</p>
