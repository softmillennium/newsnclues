Mewis, who is currently on the books at Women's Super League side West Ham United, revealed the exciting news in a joint Instagram post on Thursday. “Our little man is here, Jagger Mewis-Kerr,” they wrote. Naturally, the news was met with an overwhelming array of emotional responses from familiar faces from across the soccer landscape, including Mewis' sister and former USWNT star and current co-host of The Women's Game podcast, Sam. “Love u guys,” the 83-time international and FIFA Women's World Cup winner commented. Congrats, moms, Kristie & Sam K,” The Women's Game shared. !” while current international Casey Krueger wrote, “Congrats you guys! Mallory Swanson, another current USWNT star who also recently announced that she and her husband, MLB star Dansby, are expecting, commented, “So happy for yall!” Having been together since 2021, Mewis and Kerr got engaged in September 2023, with Kerr giving fans a glimpse into Mewis' proposal in an adorable Instagram post. Just three months later, Mewis made the move from NWSL side Gotham FC to London, where she joined Kerr, who had signed for Chelsea after leaving the Chicago Red Stars in 2020. As for Kerr, she too has struggled with her health of late, having missed the last 15 months for the Blues with a ruptured ACL. Now, with the WSL season almost at an end and with Chelsea having secured their sixth consecutive title, Kerr looks to be nearing a return to action. Whether or not this means the 31-year-old could make her 129th appearance for the Matildas in their upcoming friendlies against Argentina on May 30 and June 2 remains to be seen. As for Mewis, once she is ready to return, her progress will likely be watched closely by USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, who is in the process of expanding her roster ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

As many as 15 teams from across the Americas can qualify for this expanded tournament, a prospect which could allow Diageo to maximize the value of its sponsorship, with the three host nations of USA, Mexico, and Canada having already confirmed their berths, as have reigning World Cup champions Argentina.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to be an important one for both AB Inbev and Diageo, after the 2022 World Cup took place in Qatar, a dry country where alcohol is banned, this marks the tournament's return to a major alcohol market. The brand will be pushing its Budweiser Zero non-alcoholic product heavily during the FIFA World Cup as it still looks to target international fans in Qatar.” With this dilemma not in place for the upcoming 2026 edition, it is likely that both brands, especially Budweiser, will seek to make up for lost time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, AS reports that Real Madrid are astonished by Carvajal's progress in recovering from the devastating knee injury he suffered last year. In fact, what once seemed like a distant hope is now edging closer to reality: he is on track to be available for the Club World Cup. Though club staff at Valdebebas remain cautious, there is a sense of quiet optimism. He is expected to complete his comeback within the minimum recovery window – eight months and a few days – after originally being given a timeline of eight to ten months. Carvajal has been targeting the Club World Cup since December, calling it his “American Dream.” Post surgery, he began his recovery with crutches, the Real Madrid second captain has since been a regular presence in the dressing room as a leader, even while sidelined. From gym work, he moved to light jogging and then more intense sessions on the pitch. Now, he is back working with the ball and occasionally joins his teammates in light drills. Real Madrid staff confirm that Carvajal is sprinting, jumping, and performing explosive exercises with normality. The next and final stage is full training integration and contact drills which could come later this month, allowing him to return in time for the Club World Cup. Vazquez has been guaranteed a short-term extension of two weeks to ensure he can participate in the entire tournament, while talks are underway with Liverpool to secure Alexander-Arnold's early release.</p>

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Mallory Swanson, a forward on the United States women's national soccer team (USWNT), and her baseball star husband, Dansby Swanson, are going to be parents. In the pictures, Dansby and Mallory wore matching white outfits as they stood next to a series of floral bouquets. “Our greatest blessing,” Mallory wrote in the caption, alongside a white heart emoji. In the comments, Dansby added: “I love you,” alongside a red heart emoji. Congratulations to you both,” another fan wrote, while Chicago Cubs star Jameson Taillon added: “Congrats guys!!! Can't wait to meet my new best friend!” They announced their engagement in December 2021 and got married a year later. Last year, Mallory, who debuted for the USWNT team in 2016, had an amazing season. “You are such an inspiration to so many, but more to me than anyone can ever fathom,” he wrote in the caption of his post, shared in August. And that can never be taken from you. She also hasn't played for her club team in the National Women's Soccer League this season. The Stars released a statement on January 27 that she wouldn't be participating in training camp for “personal reasons.” In that same statement, Swanson thanked the club and its fans “for their understanding during this time.” He previously played for the Atlanta Braves from 2016 to 2022. In this season so far, Dansby has hit seven home runs and 20 RBI (runs batted in), with his team winning 22 games. In the National League Central, one of MLB's six major divisions, the Chicago Cubs are in first place. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most desired signings by Real Madrid this season is Trent Alexander-Arnold. Not in vain do the Madrid bosses wish to make him available to the next coach as soon as possible. This sports outlet indicates that Trent Alexander-Arnold would have agreed to be registered on Real Madrid's list for the Club World Cup. With that agreement advanced, the signing of the English right-back could become a reality between June 1 and 10. Trent Alexander-Arnold would be the first choice for Real Madrid, which still has other additions pending, especially if it wishes to rebuild its weakened defensive line for the tournament held in the United States. This way, the arrival of Trent Alexander-Arnold for the Club World Cup play-offs is avoided. In case the footballer and Real Madrid had not reached that agreement, his arrival as a free agent would not have allowed him to play the entire competition. That undesired future by the Madrid executives is getting closer to disappearing. From the noble area of Anfield Road, they have established three basic conditions to definitively seal that agreement. First, Real Madrid would have to pay a symbolic transfer to let Trent Alexander-Arnold go... considering that he would join the team before June 30, 2025, the date on which his contract with the Merseyside squad ends. At the same time, Liverpool's executives demand that their current player forgo the month's salary he has not yet received. With those three conditions already known by the club's sports management, Alexander-Arnold would be a Real Madrid player before the Club World Cup and would confirm the agreement mentioned by the newspaper As. It is not surprising, given the deep reflection that the first team is experiencing since its double defeat against Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tottenham head into the Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt looking to salvage something from a miserable campaign. It would be a rare highlight in a season that sees Spurs languishing in 16th place in the Premier League, where fans have seen their side lose 19 games this year. Their form has put huge pressure on Ange Postecoglou, and speaking exclusively to DAZN News, thanks to yaysweepstakes.com, Chris Waddle thinks even if his old club do lift the Europa League, it's time for the Australian to go. I'm not blaming Ange for everything," the Spurs legend said. "Look at the managers Tottenham Hotspur have had. Nuno Espirito Sanato might get Nottingham Forest in the Champions League. How can it be that these managers are not good enough yet? In my eyes, that is the problem. Tottenham have always been a massive football club. "The only way to judge the managers properly is if they start buying like Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, buying established players, players who are ready, and keeping their stars. "There's got to be a reason why these managers, whoever goes into Tottenham Hotspur, do not succeed. And it can't be tactics all the time. It's got to be that your team's not good enough. "Get somebody who's 27, 28, 29, who's at the top of his game, he's matured, he knows the game. But overall, I would not just blame Ange. I would blame the format of what the club is, and what they're trying to achieve and how they work." Sign up now for a free DAZN account to watch the Club World Cup, starting on Saturday, June 14.

StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez talks to Fox News Digital about an anti-Israel campaign taking place in lead up to FIFA World Cup. Celtic FC fans unfurled a banner that called on FIFA and UEFA, the confederation that Israel is a part of, to punish the country's national team over its response in Gaza to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks. There was no penalty against Celtic FC or its fans for the banner. Since then, CBC reported that the campaign has spread across other European countries, including Italy, Spain and Belgium, along with Brazil, Chile, Malaysia and Tunisia. Rez said FIFA has done nothing to combat the issue. "We've seen absolutely nothing, which is so alarming," she told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. "We've seen the head of FIFA say and do, again, absolutely nothing. So again, we want the task force that President Trump set up to step in ahead of time and be proactive and say, no, this isn't welcome in the United States. This isn't gonna fly here." Rez added that FIFA President Gianni Infantino should take a "strong stand" against the campaign. "I think it has to be eradicated immediately," she said. "Gianni Infantino needs to take a strong stand and say, ‘Bigotry and bias against the world's only Jewish country is not welcome in any type of organization I'm heading.' Americans aren't going to stand for it." Banners are seen as Osasuna fans display a banner stating "Show Israel the Red Card," on Feb. 15, 2025. Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA and UEFA for comment. As the executive director, Giuliani will be tasked with managing and overseeing daily operations. Trump also announced Tuesday that Carlos Cordeiro, a FIFA senior advisor, will serve as a senior advisor on the task force. A White House official told Fox News Digital on Thursday that task force does not support any kind of proposal to exclude Israel from the World Cup. President Donald Trump, right, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino talk in the Oval Office of the White House after signing an executive order for a task force related to the FIFA World Cup in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 2025. "We hope that Andrew Giuliani, as head of this task force, really steps in and works with Gianni Infantino to say, ‘This rhetoric is not welcome here, you need to make a statement. And we're not going to be welcoming antisemites, anti-Westerners, anti-American, pro-terror individuals, whether they're fans or players, into this country,'" Rez said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Vice President JD Vance has become the target of backlash for suggesting – albeit jokingly – that tourists who come to the United States for the FIFA World Cup will be deported if they overstay their visas. According to CNBC, Vance's offensive remarks were made during a World Cup task force meeting, which was also attended by US President Donald Trump. The quadrennial soccer tournament is a big tourist draw - in 2022, for example, more than 1 million people travelled to Qatar to watch the matches. United States authorities say that while they are gearing up to welcome tourists to the country, they want to ensure nobody overstays their welcome. It was during a World Cup task force meeting that JD Vance joked about deporting tourists and subsequently faced massive backlash. “We'll have visitors from close to 100 countries. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,” Vance said. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home, otherwise they'll have to talk to [Homeland Security] Secretary Noem.” Veep under fireFootage of his comments has gone viral with more than 6.4 million views in less than a day. Zero clue,” wrote one X user. Vance's joke landed like a deflated soccer ball. Nothing says ‘welcome' like a deportation threat at a World Cup presser,” X user Carolyn Barber opined. Many social media users said that given the current climate of fear in the US, and JD Vance's remarks, tourists would be wary of travelling to the country. We have a President that denies people due process, that our constitution stipulates everyone on our soil has,” an X user wrote.
