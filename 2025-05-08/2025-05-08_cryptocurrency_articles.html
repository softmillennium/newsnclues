                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON – Senate Democrats blocked a bipartisan bill to create a legal framework for cryptocurrency after concerns about President Donald Trump's connections to the industry threw negotiations over the bill into chaos. Senate Republican Leader John Thune also voted against it in a procedural move that will allow it to come up for another vote. The vote caps a week of frantic negotiations after a group of nine Democrats who had previously supported the bill abruptly announced on May 3 that they would no longer support the stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that the legislation didn't do enough to prevent money laundering and protect national security. The bill has been aggressively supported by crypto lobbyists and is expected to accelerate the currency's growth. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters after the vote that an updated bill text wasn't yet available after the days of negotiations. At the same time, Trump family businesses with connections to crypto are benefiting. Two cryptocurrency investments owned by Trump-affiliated entities have made at least $300 million in trading fees alone since January on sales of his meme coin and other digital currency. In late April, a company affiliated with Trump promoted the $TRUMP meme coin by offering an “intimate private dinner” with the president at his northern Virginia golf club, after which the coin's value grew as much as 80%. And another Trump family crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, announced on May 1 that one of its digital coins is being used by an Abu Dhabi government-backed investment firm for a $2 billion investment in cryptocurrency exchange Binance − a major outlay from a foreign government to the benefit of Trump's family. A White House spokeswoman said Trump's "assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest." These moves have prompted investigations and a committee hearing walkout from Congressional Democrats in recent days. "Donald Trump is selling cryptocurrency like snake oil in the Wild West, and he's put a for sale sign on the White House for his meme coin," Sen. Richard Blumenthal told USA TODAY. "People in America deserve to know how he is potentially under the influence of foreign governments and investors who are buying his crypto assets."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This limited-edition run of sparkling water is more for existing traders than crypto newcomers, but mainstream distribution is part of the plan. This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. There's now sparkling water that comes with an Abstract NFT and points attached. Rekt Brands — a crypto startup from the traders known on X as OSF (Ovie Faruq) and RektMando on social media — has launched a new drink. Next week, case buyers can collect their Abstract NFTs. While the launch sold out on Wednesday, with over 220,000 cans of sparkling water purchased, the Rekt team said extra DRANK points were being given out by mistake. A member of the Abstract team confirmed to me that they aren't involved in this project, but they said that future collabs between Rekt and Abstract are being explored. Rekt Brands' first drink, a lime-flavored sparkling water, was announced in November and similarly sold over 220,000 cans within 48 hours. Rekt Brands previously raised $1.5 million in seeding funding late last year. Their brand was created following the 2022 NFT collection OSF launched called Rektguy. Others have tried to bring crypto to the food and drink industry before, though the efforts thus far have primarily come from holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. In 2023, Snoop Dogg released ice cream inspired by his Bored Ape. There was also a short-lived Bored Ape-themed burger joint, Bored & Hungry, which I visited back in 2022 (food was good, but most of the people there had zero clue what the Apes were, and didn't care). In the case of Rekt Brands, its limited-edition runs of sparkling water that you only hear about on Crypto Twitter don't seem to be targeting the masses — but broader distribution may be coming soon. Rekt is planning to release new flavors and bring back older ones, too, in future drops. “Our goal is to have mainstream distribution and we have been actively working on it over the past few months. There will be a point where people can get their hands on Rekt in their local store,” OSF told me in a DM, adding: “Maybe for some that's sooner than they think.” Permissionless IV serves as the definitive gathering for crypto's technical founders, developers, and builders to come together and create the future.If you're ready to shape the future of crypto, Permissionless IV is where it happens. Blockworks and Cracked Labs are teaming up for the third installment of the Permissionless Hackathon, happening June 22–23, 2025 in Brooklyn, NY. While Arizona's governor could veto another crypto reserve bill, similar North Carolina and Texas laws are approaching the finish line However, they noted there's now an increased risk that unemployment and inflation will rise in the coming months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 67,000 crypto novices have pulled out their debit cards to bet on Trump's meme coin venture, a Post analysis found. Rebecca Davis bought President Donald Trump's meme coin while lying in bed one January morning in Little Rock, scrolling through photos of a glitzy Trump inauguration gala called the “Crypto Ball.” The host of a local conservative radio show, she knew nothing about cryptocurrency but believed in Trump's business savvy. He “kind of knows how to make money,” she said. Her $TRUMP coin's value climbed for a few days but has since plunged 85 percent from its peak. Though some coin holders, including Trump's allies, have profited handsomely on paper from the coin, she is not one of them; her $32 investment is now worth about $11. “Then when it tanked, I was like, ‘Whoa, what the hell? At least 67,000 new or small-time crypto investors like Davis have bet on Trump's meme coin, pouring $15 million into the volatile venture endorsed by Trump and benefiting his personal wealth, a Washington Post analysis found. One buyer who spent $10,000 has already lost, on paper, more than $8,000. Merkley called it “profoundly corrupt” that “people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls.” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump does not have a conflict of interest because his assets are held in a trust overseen by his sons. Asked if he was profiting off his cryptocurrency, Trump said in an NBC News interview Sunday, “I haven't even looked.” Years before launching his meme coin, Trump had called cryptocurrencies a “scam” whose “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement saying that meme coins “typically have limited or no use or functionality” and that, given their “speculative nature,” the coins “tend to experience significant market price volatility.” The Post analyzed data on the blockchain, a public and mostly anonymized log of crypto transactions, to identify a likely group of crypto neophytes: They used their debit cards to buy coins via a big “buy now” button on the Trump team's website, and did so only once. Unlike the more established network of crypto speculators and insiders, this group includes amateur investors who saw the coin as a way to show loyalty to Trump or secure an early spot in one of the Trump family business's new financial ventures. Crypto enthusiasts have a number of ways to grab up cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the $TRUMP meme coin. Roughly 80 percent of buyers have seen their investment value drop substantially, the analysis found. But they have benefited from the coin in other ways, including by imposing 1 percent fees on purchases made through their official crypto transaction system, known as a liquidity pool. Three Trump-affiliated wallets have received about $43 million in fees since the coin's debut, according to a Post analysis of data from Flipside. Those wallets have also made roughly $312 million in crypto sales. Trump's crypto team last month advertised that the 220 biggest coin holders would be invited to join the president for a “night to remember” this month at Trump's golf club outside Washington, and that buyers could even see their place in the rankings via an online leaderboard. Their wallets show they received some of their Trump meme coins from Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange that says it does not accept customers in the United States. A recent X post by Trump promoting the May 22 gala dinner has been viewed more than 30 million times. Trump also spoke at a separate dinner this week for “crypto & [artificial intelligence] innovators,” headlined by his crypto and AI czar David Sacks, that an invitation said cost $1.5 million per person to join. (MGX and Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment.) The $TRUMP team's meme coin dinner seems to have helped slow the coin's slide in price, though its value, at about $11, remains close to all-time lows. That has not stopped buyers such as Freight Technologies, a Houston-based logistics firm, from announcing last week that it would buy up to $20 million in $TRUMP coins. Javier Selgas, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that the company saw it as an “effective way to advocate” its preferred trade policy. The Post analyzed how novice meme coin buyers' holdings of $TRUMP fared since the launch of that coin in January 2025 through May 7 — in contrast with those whose engagement with the coin signaled a greater familiarity with cryptocurrency. It also excluded wallets that sold their $TRUMP more than once.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen $5.3 billion in inflows over the past three weeks, the investment bank said in emailed comments Thursday. Adjusting for hedge fund basis trades, net real flow is estimated at over $4 billion, the bank said. Next week's 13F filings may reveal further institutional adoption, Standard Chartered said. Abu Dhabi's sovereign fund already holds BlackRock's bitcoin ETF (IBIT), and both the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank have disclosed positions in MSTR. New Hampshire passed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill this week, the first U.S. state to do so, which signals growing policy alignment, the report added. Given these developments, a second-quarter bitcoin target of $120,000 may be too conservative, the bank said, citing its previous forecast. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $101,000 at publication time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick now believes Bitcoin could blow past his $120K forecast as investors keep pouring money into the crypto market. Standard Chartered's Head of Digital Assets, Geoffrey Kendrick, is rethinking his bullish bitcoin forecast, and not because he was too optimistic. “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low,” Kendrick said Thursday in an email to clients, walking back his earlier prediction that bitcoin would peak around $120,000 in Q2 2025. But with bitcoin now hovering near $100,000 and surging more than 3% on the day to $99,293.54, Kendrick admits the rally has moved faster than expected. “The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again,” Kendrick said. That kind of activity signals surging institutional interest — a trend that further strengthens bitcoin's new role as a macro asset in global portfolios. Kendrick highlighted several heavyweight examples to support his revised stance: Strategy ramping up bitcoin buys, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund holding BlackRock's spot Bitcoin IBIT, and the Swiss National Bank reportedly holding shares of MSTR, often seen as a leveraged proxy for bitcoin itself. Previously, bitcoin was often lumped in with high-risk U.S. tech stocks, mirroring their volatility. But with the current wave of institutional adoption, Kendrick believes bitcoin has taken on a new narrative—one that might carry it well beyond the $120,000 mark this summer, and toward his year-end forecast of $200,000. Now, with BTC nearing six figures, that milestone might just be a stepping stone.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading volumes have surged by nearly 46% during this period as Pectra introduces significant positive changes to the EVM. Pectra should also make the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) more scalable, faster, and cheaper. In addition, it makes ETH deflationary as a portion of transaction fees will now be burned. This should supposedly attract more robust validator pools to increase the network's efficiency. Moreover, the maximum number of blobs – data that can be included in a single Ethereum block – has been increased from 6 to 9. Higher blobs should expedite transactions for layer-two protocols like Arbitrum and will help them reduce transaction fees. Finally, it will now be possible to have the recipient of a transaction pay for gas fees. This is particularly positive as it solves a recurrent issue where wallets were unable to transfer assets unless they had enough ETH to cover these fees. Today's strong uptick is the second time that Ethereum has posted a big single-day gain in the past couple of weeks. On April 22, the token rose above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) and has stood above this key indicator since then. Although positive momentum was weakening heading to the deployment of Pectra. However, today's jump has pushed ETH above its point of control (POC), which sat at $1,850. In a previous article, we set forth a $3,000 target for Ethereum after the token broke above its consolidation and stepped out of oversold levels in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This translates into a 54.7% upside potential based on current levels. Momentum indicators are quite strong and favor a bullish scenario as well. There are two big fair value gaps (FVGs) that could serve as support if the price drops in the following hours. These fair value gaps typically act as magnets for the price as market participants look to fill outstanding buy orders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The aim is to incentivise tourists with cheaper alternatives to dodge currency exchange rates and limitations in the acceptability of international cards. Tourism generates a major chunk of revenue for Bhutan, and the country is now looking to make it more economical for visitors and travellers. Experience Bhutan with the world's first national crypto tourism payment system! Individuals planning a trip to Bhutan will now be able to make crypto payments for flight tickets, visa fees, hotel stays, monument visits, tour guides, and street-shopping. The bank has already onboarded over 100 merchants in Bhutan who have agreed to accept payments in the form of crypto tokens. Travellers looking to use crypto for payments must first sign up on the Binance app. While booking tickets and hotels will be similar to regular online bookings, for retail purchases they will have to scan integrated QR codes provided by merchants. It will provide instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for over a hundred tokens including Bitcoin and the USDC among others for the tourists. "This partnership creates new economic pathways for Bhutan's communities, especially small vendors and rural artisans who may never have had access to card terminals or payment infrastructure before," said an announcement post from Binance. In September 2024, Arkham Intelligence claimed that Bhutan was accumulating Bitcoin from the BTC mining operations run by Druk Holdings. In December last year, the country recognised crypto assets as a legitimate asset class within its Gelephu Mindfulness City, an economic hub located in southern Bhutan. No digital assets are currently recognised as a legal tender in Bhutan. For the latest videos on gadgets and tech, subscribe to our YouTube channel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Summarizing ACE as an “all chain engagement platform” and a “rewards-driven online virtual world hub” designed to retain users, Smart says the goal is to grant users rewards for doing things like connecting external accounts to the platform, engaging in activities in its online social world, and playing ACE-compliant games. “The platform was designed first and foremost to be a virtual town hall of engagement opportunities in which all technologies are seamlessly integrated and abstracted,” the site claims. “Just have fun with your friends and we'll take care of the rest.” The site's video link button is also literally a rickroll, so there's that. Smart's blog post about ACE effectively claims the platform is an answer to several problems with Web3 and blockchain gaming, all of which he says he predicted years before things started to collapse in the P2E and crypto gaming spheres. “I have always felt that the end result of doing a token would put my project right where we are today in Web3 whereby gaming tokens — all of them, no exceptions — were designed to line the pockets of those who benefited the most, while leaving an otherwise engaged community holding the proverbial empty bag and likely with nothing to show for their engagement or funding.” As for ACE itself, an offered explainer PDF appears to be aimed at investors, though it also points out that it's “a massively multiplayer online world” and “not a game.” And that probably isn't by mistake, as the close of Smart's blog appears to suggest this is his last swing at the games industry. “Those of us in Web3 gaming are well aware that things aren't working, but few seem to want to buck the status quo trend because the road less traveled isn't for the feint at heart; it's for pioneers and those who dare to defy,” Smart concludes. “And so, here I am, once again at the cusp of one of my greatest challenges, and what I believe to be my last hoorah, if you will.” World of Warcraft previews new rotational assistance UI tool, nixes some automating addons</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Standard Chartered analyst who predicted bitcoin hitting $120,000 by the second quarter now says his price call is "too low." "I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low," Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, said in a tongue-in-cheek comment shared with clients via email Thursday. Last month, Kendrick wrote a note saying that he expects bitcoin to reach an all-time high of around $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025 on the back of a "strategic asset reallocation away from US assets" and "accumulation by 'whales' (major holders)." "We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a fresh all-time high around USD 120,000 in Q2," Kendrick said at the time. "We see gains continuing through the summer, taking BTC-USD towards our year-end forecast of 200,000." On Thursday, Kendrick said his $120,000 bitcoin price call now "looks very achievable" and that this may even be too low a target. It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets." And flows are coming in many forms," he added. His comments come as bitcoin once again topped the $100,000 level. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading up by 4.5% at $$100,511.22, according to Coin Metrics. In recent years, analysts have picked up on a pattern that shows bitcoin trading in a similar way to risk assets such as U.S. technology stocks — the rationale being that increased inflows of more institutional capital into bitcoin makes it more prone to the same market risks equity markets face. Kendrick — who has long held a bullish position on the cryptocurrency — said that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen $5.3 billion of inflows in the past three weeks, suggesting more institutional money is piling in. He pointed to several examples of large investors allocating part of their portfolios to bitcoin, including software firm MicroStrategy ramping up bitcoin purchases, the Abu Dhbai sovereign wealth fund holding BlackRock's IBIT bitcoin ETF, and the Swiss National Bank buying shares of MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy is widely considered a proxy for bitcoin. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Pat O'Toole, now chief marketer at youth-enrichment company Unleashed Brands, explains how the CMO role continues to evolve. During Pat O'Toole's two-year stint as chief marketing officer of Burger King, the fast-food chain leaned into artifical intelligence-powered customization, gamified its loyalty program and looked to extend the shelf life of viral successes. All of those tactics could prove helpful as O'Toole embarks on a new journey as CMO of Unleashed Brands, a youth-enrichment company with a portfolio of brands that includes Urban Air Adventure Park, The Little Gym and Sylvan Learning. The executive, who spent nearly 15 years at PepsiCo, including a stint as CMO of Mountain Dew, brings experience in brand strategy, innovation and franchise marketing to Unleashed Brands, explained Founder and CEO Michael Browning, Jr. “Marketing is at the core of Unleashed Brands' growth and we have ambitious goals for 2025 that rely on leveraging data-driven insights and innovative strategies to move our brands forward,” Browning, Jr. said in a press release announcing the appointment. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. It's bringing a lot of consumer focus and consumer centricity to young, evolving brands, and some older, more established brands. You really learn and develop consumer centricity when you're in the companies that I've worked at, and so that's always going to be at the forefront. Parents come to Urban Air as well, but they have a very different experience than their kids. At Pepsi, we used to talk about Doritos as you have to win the shopper mom at Kroger, but you have to have your consumer, teens, in the case of Doritos, asking for that product. The hundreds of QSR occasions that a consumer has in a year are much different than the weekend-centric occasions that we have in a brand like Urban Air or the really deep decision making and the higher-involvement decision making that goes into signing up for a tutoring program at Sylvan. So if you have an amazing experience at Urban Air, but you're also looking for something else that's going to help build their confidence and their social skills, this company has Little Gym or Premiere Martial Arts. Look at some of the great houses of brands that have these trust marks — that's what we're looking to build here. [Unleashed has] added one to two brands every year over the past several years, and as you bring them in and integrate them, you get better at it each time, and you find the efficiencies that exist. How do we most efficiently get that work set up and then find creative best practices? We have a shared services model, and then the brand teams as well. How do you set up the teams from a marketing perspective to unlock creative best practices, to work with partners that they can carry across all brands? Some of the things that we're looking to build are the platforms that we need to invest in so consumers can more easily move between our brands. I've been a part of a lot of the things that have been in the hype cycle in marketing. How do you sort through all the data that we have? How do we learn as much as we can about those families across all of our brands, and how do we use tools like AI to really hone our insights and personalize connections? As families start to move across our brands, we can understand [them] better than most companies out there because of the types of relationships that we have. We have high household penetration brands like Urban Air, but then you also have high frequency brands like Little Gym. New moms have kids for the first time and they get their kids into Little Gym, and it's a great way for moms to connect with other moms as they're entering a new life phase. We're collecting insights on moms, on kids, on family dynamics, and AI is going to help us really not only understand and segment those families, but communicate with them and anticipate their needs. From me personally, you'll see fewer Million Dollar Whoppers or custom jingles, and you'll see a lot more using AI to help us understand and engage with our consumer base. I think it's evolving more than any of the other C-suite jobs out there. I always talk about the 70-20-10 [rule], the way we looked at things at PepsiCo: Seventy percent is going to be what we know is tried-and-true and works for this business. You can't just do that on a marketing island. Marketers [are used] to being accused of wasting money and jumping into pet projects, and you really have to lay out why we're doing this. It's really important that people don't see it and think, “There goes marketing, trying to do something cool to get an article written about us.” It's more about thoughtfully trying to think about how to stay ahead of where consumers are and give ourselves a competitive advantage. For every AI, there's an NFT, so you have to thoughtfully experiment in that space, but also not do it at the detriment of the business that you're trying to build.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This event also prompted questions about the truly decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, given its reliance on centralized electricity infrastructure. BeInCrypto spoke with representatives from CertiK, Brickken, Wanchain, and Money on Chain to learn what this means for public trust in crypto and what the sector needs to provide financial services around the clock, even when centralized distribution channels fail. A significant power disruption last week left millions in the dark across Spain and Portugal, with knock-on effects in parts of France and Morocco. According to research from the Baker Institute, Spain lost approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity in just five seconds, equivalent to 60% of its national electricity demand. “When‬‭ power‬‭ grids‬‭ fail,‬‭ the‬‭ entire‬‭ ecosystem‬‭ behind‬‭ these‬‭ systems‬‭ grinds‬‭ to‬‭ a‬ halt:‬‭ Mobile‬‭ phones‬‭ can't‬‭ connect,‬‭ ATMs‬‭ shut‬‭ down,‬‭ and‬‭ internet-based‬‭ wallets‬‭ become‬‭ inaccessible.‬‭ In‬‭ such‬‭ moments,‬‭ the‬‭ digital‬‭ economy‬‭ exposes‬‭ a‬‭ key‬‭ vulnerability—without‬‭ electricity, the convenience of tech-driven finance collapses,” Natalie Newson, Senior Blockchain Investigator at CertiK, told BeInCrypto. ‬During those hours, cash won back the throne of preferred payment. “This‬‭ is‬‭ why‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ physical‬‭ cash‬‭ remains‬‭ critical,‬‭ not‬‭ only‬‭ in‬‭ developing‬‭ countries‬‭ but‬‭ also‬‭ in‬‭ developed‬‭ nations— as‬‭ seen‬‭ during‬‭ recent‬‭ outages‬‭ in‬‭ Europe.‬‭ Digital‬‭ systems,‬‭ whether‬ centralized‬‭ or‬‭ decentralized,‬‭ are‬‭ ultimately‬‭ dependent‬‭ on‬‭ power‬‭ and‬‭ connectivity.‬‭ Cash‬‭ provides‬‭ a reliable fallback in scenarios where digital tools fail,” ‭Manuel Ferrari, Co-founder of Money On Chain,‬ told BeInCrypto. The episode also raised questions over crypto's usability during times of crisis. The demonstrated need for paper currency during infrastructure disruptions suggests that even though crypto is a modern financial innovation, it still falls short of its predecessors during challenging circumstances. Even with its core principle of decentralization, blockchain technology relies significantly on centralized infrastructure. “For‬‭ example,‬‭ most‬‭ blockchain‬‭ nodes‬‭ are‬‭ hosted‬‭ on‬‭ a‬‭ small‬‭ number‬‭ of‬‭ centralised‬‭ cloud‬‭ providers‬‭ like‬‭ AWS.‬‭ This‬‭ not‬‭ only‬‭ creates‬‭ single‬‭ points‬‭ of‬‭ failure,‬‭ but‬‭ also‬‭ exposes‬ blockchain‬‭ networks‬‭ to‬‭ external‬‭ control.‬‭ Fundamentally,‬‭ blockchain‬‭ runs‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ Internet.‬‭ Without‬‭ the‬‭ Internet,‬‭ blockchain‬‭ doesn't‬‭ work.‬‭ And‬‭ the‬‭ Internet‬‭ is‬‭ centrally‬‭ governed‬‭ by‬‭ ISPs‬‭ and‬‭ is‬‭ subject‬‭ to‬‭ geopolitical‬‭ pressures.‬‭ More‬‭ subtly,‬‭ many‬‭ blockchains‬‭ also‬‭ operate‬‭ with‬‭ only‬‭ one‬‭ or‬‭ two‬‭ client‬‭ implementations,‬‭ meaning‬‭ that‬‭ any‬‭ flaw‬‭ or‬‭ bug‬‭ in‬‭ that‬‭ client‬‭ software‬‭ can‬‭ impact‬‭ the‬‭ entire network,” Wanchain CEO Temujin Louie told BeInCrypto. “‬The‬‭ blockchain‬‭ may‬‭ be‬‭ decentralized,‬‭ but‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ not.‬‭ Most‬‭ users‬‭ depend‬‭ on‬‭ internet‬ service‬‭ providers,‬‭ centralized‬‭ exchanges,‬‭ and‬‭ mobile‬‭ devices—all‬‭ of‬‭ which‬‭ are‬‭ tied‬‭ to‬‭ national‬ power‬‭ grids‬‭ and‬‭ telecom‬‭ systems.‬‭ Without‬‭ these‬‭ utilities,‬‭ the‬‭ decentralized‬‭ promise‬‭ of‬‭ crypto‬‭ becomes practically irrelevant for the average user,” Newson added. Cryptocurrency might inadvertently weaken public trust in its capabilities by not functioning as a genuine alternative financial solution when needed most. Suppose cryptocurrency can't provide a functional financial alternative precisely when traditional systems falter due to events like power outages. “‬Public‬‭ trust‬‭ depends‬‭ on‬‭ perceived‬‭ reliability.‬‭ If‬‭ crypto‬‭ is‬‭ seen‬‭ as‬‭ something‬‭ that‬‭ fails‬‭ under‬‭ stress,‬‭ users‬‭ may‬‭ hesitate‬‭ to‬‭ rely‬‭ on‬‭ it.‬‭ This‬‭ is‬‭ especially‬‭ true‬‭ for‬‭ people‬‭ who‬‭ are‬‭ still‬‭ new‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ space,” Felipe D'Onofrio, Chief Technology Officer at Brickken‬, told BeInCrypto. Trust in payment methods grows from their ease of use, so if crypto wallets become inaccessible during emergencies, individuals might be reluctant to use them as their main way to pay. Still, experiencing these issues now can pave the way for future enhancements. Existing features within crypto technology already enable some offline uses, and expanding on these could provide a clear direction for development. While D'Onofrio pointed to other available tools, he clarified that they lack the widespread adoption and user-friendliness needed for broad use. “There‬‭ are‬‭ some‬‭ interesting‬‭ developments‬‭ out‬‭ there,‬‭ like‬‭ satellite‬‭ nodes,‬‭ mesh‬‭ networks,‬‭ or‬‭ ultra-low-power‬‭ wallets.‬‭ These‬‭ systems‬‭ are‬‭ working‬‭ toward‬‭ more‬‭ resilience,‬‭ but‬‭ they're‬‭ not‬‭ yet‬‭ widely‬‭ adopted.‬‭ Right‬‭ now,‬‭ most‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ crypto‬‭ ecosystem‬‭ still‬‭ relies‬‭ on‬‭ traditional‬‭ infrastructure.‬‭ The‬‭ blockchain‬‭ can‬‭ survive‬‭ offline,‬‭ but‬‭ the‬‭ tools‬‭ most‬‭ users‬‭ depend on are not built for that kind of environment yet,” he said. Similar considerations arose when discussing the potential of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) to lessen overall dependence on centralized electricity grids. These networks are increasingly facilitating network connectivity and community-based access to electricity. Some experts suggested this technology could help lessen the impact of outages affecting centralized distribution channels. At the same time, he pointed out that DePINs alone cannot provide a complete solution to massive issues like widespread power outages. From his perspective, D'Onofrio stated that DePINs could provide a more complete solution when combined with other tools that bolster local resilience to these threats. Despite their differences, crypto and traditional finance ultimately grapple with many of the same underlying problems when operating during infrastructure disruptions. With global economic systems increasingly depending on digital finance, experts emphasized policymakers' need to develop lasting solutions that ensure infrastructure resilience and emergency preparedness. Moving forward, the strength of the digital economy will be determined by its physical infrastructure, and prioritizing this could position crypto for long-term success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robinhood is about to shake up the finance world again. The idea is as bold as it is historic: turn stocks and ETFs into blockchain-based assets, and open access to more than 8K U.S.-listed securities for a brand-new audience overseas. Add in Robinhood's recent acquisition of Bitstamp, a leading European crypto exchange, and the plan looks even more serious. If Robinhood succeeds, the door will be wide open for a new wave of blockchain-powered platforms, assets, and tools. Robinhood is reportedly developing its own blockchain or a blockchain-based platform that would allow Europeans to trade tokenized U.S. securities like stocks and ETFs. That's not just innovation – it's disruption on a global scale. It also means faster settlements, 24/7 access, and greater transparency thanks to the blockchain infrastructure. The decision follows a wider trend in traditional finance, where firms like Franklin Templeton and Apollo have already launched tokenized investment vehicles. Even Coinbase has expressed strong interest in entering the space. Meanwhile, Robinhood's acquisition of Bitstamp – one of the oldest and most trusted crypto exchanges in Europe – signals a serious commitment to this expansion. And with all this in motion, a few promising new crypto projects are already catching fire. Currently priced around $0.025, $BEST is in an exclusive crypto presale that's already raised over $12M, and for good reason. It's the native token of Best Wallet – a next-generation app built to replace outdated interfaces like MetaMask. This isn't just a wallet – it's an all-in-one Web3 gateway with powerful features like staking, swaps, support for 60+ chains in the pipeline, and a tool called ‘Upcoming Tokens,' which offers direct, secure access inside the app. Holding $BEST unlocks real utility: reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, early access to token launches, and governance rights within the ecosystem. Security-wise, Best Wallet is no slouch – it's built using Fireblocks' MPC-CMP wallet tech, ensuring multi-party computation security that's miles ahead of traditional seed-phrase wallets. In a world where everything from art to stocks is being tokenized, $SUBBD aims to revolutionize how we interact with digital content – specifically subscriptions. Priced at around $0.055 and already raising over $300K in its presale, $SUBBD is building a next-gen platform where followers and not just creators get value. $SUBBD is the first AI-driven subscription platform that empowers users to generate content using AI avatars, realistic images, and short videos – all with the blessing of original creators. Buying SUBBD Token gives you staking options with up to 20% APY, unlocks premium content access, and supports instant crypto payments with low fees. In short, $SUBBD isn't just riding the wave of tokenized finance – it's also carving out a whole new category of AI-enhanced user utility. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is an ambitious project fusing two of the hottest trends in tech – artificial intelligence and blockchain. Built on the Ethereum network, Dawgz AI is developing a decentralized platform centered around AI-driven tools for trading, automation, and user engagement. Currently priced at $0.004, the token has already raised over $3.4M in its presale. Early buyers can stake their $DAGZ to earn passive rewards, and there's no vesting – presale participants receive full access to their tokens immediately. With meme contests, social challenges, and an ecosystem built to be fun and engaging, Dawgz AI is more than just a trading bot – it's aiming to be a hub for creative, tech-savvy users. The project has been audited by SolidProof, adding a layer of trust and transparency. In a tokenized world where Robinhood is putting stocks on-chain, Dawgz AI is carving out its space at the intersection of AI utility and meme coins momentum. Robinhood's blockchain push signals a new era for global finance. As tokenized assets gain ground, projects like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and Dawgz AI are positioning themselves at the forefront – ready to serve, scale, and soar with the next wave of crypto-powered innovation.

Meanwhile, Canadians continue to explore decentralised options too, with many opting to buy Bitcoin in Canada as both a speculative asset and hedge against traditional banking shifts. The Bank of Canada's “Contingency Planning for a Central Bank Digital Currency” framework was published as early as 2020, showing the institution's interest in being prepared even if immediate implementation wasn't necessary. This focus has earned praise from civil liberties groups and is shaping a CBDC model that avoids surveillance-heavy pitfalls seen elsewhere. While there's been no national rollout, the Bank of Canada has engaged in multiple pilot projects with fintech firms, universities, and blockchain startups. These technical collaborations are testing transaction speeds, offline functionality, and integration with existing payment systems. This quiet but steady pace helps the institution test hypotheses in real-world environments without overcommitting public resources or political capital. These projects explore cross-border payment efficiency using digital currencies issued by multiple central banks. Canada's involvement highlights its role as a collaborative player in shaping global standards for interoperable and secure CBDCs. With crypto adoption growing steadily in Canada, especially among younger demographics, the Bank of Canada is acutely aware that its CBDC must compete with established digital assets. The ability to buy Bitcoin in Canada from local platforms has helped normalise crypto as part of everyday financial conversation. This has indirectly pressured the central bank to ensure any digital dollar isn't just functional—but genuinely user-friendly. Canada's quiet leadership in CBDC development may not grab headlines, but its steady, research-led approach is winning global respect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The initiative marks a significant shift in the company's global strategy and a push to harness blockchain technology to streamline cross-border investing. As part of its European expansion, Robinhood recently acquired a brokerage license in Lithuania, allowing it to operate throughout the European Union. By using blockchain networks, Robinhood could significantly reduce friction in cross-border trading and attract a new wave of retail investors from markets traditionally underserved by U.S.-based financial products. The platform will reportedly explore deploying on established blockchain networks such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, or Solana—choices known for their scalability, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystems. These networks would provide the infrastructure for the tokenization of U.S. stocks, whereby shares are represented as digital tokens that can be traded in a decentralized environment. Tokenized assets promise several advantages over traditional financial instruments, including near-instant settlement, 24/7 market access, and improved transparency. For European investors, this could mean faster and more cost-effective access to high-demand U.S. equities such as those listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE. Industry analysts say that Robinhood's move comes amid a broader push by fintech companies to integrate blockchain technology into traditional finance. Details regarding a potential launch date, token standards, and whether fractionalized shares will be supported remain unclear. Several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, have recently launched or explored tokenized asset offerings, signaling increased institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure. If successful, Robinhood's platform could set a precedent for how retail brokerage firms approach global expansion and technological adoption. It may also pave the way for a broader transformation of how securities are issued, traded, and settled across jurisdictions.</p>
