                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Grand Slam champions Caroline Wozniacki and Emma Raducanu are on the entry list for Wimbledon qualifying, which begins on June 24 at the Community Sport Centre, Roehampton. Other notable names in the initial entry list include Olga Danilovic, fresh off a run to the Roland Garros fourth round, Zarina Diyas, who reached the Wimbledon last 16 in 2014 and 2015, and former Roland Garros semifinalist Tamara Zidansek. Meanwhile, 2022 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Amanda Anisimova has not made the cut directly but is the sixth alternate. The highest-ranked player entered is World No.87 Kamilla Rakhimova, and the last direct acceptance is World No.224 Tena Lukas. Wozniacki, the 2018 Australian Open champion, is currently ranked No.117, while 2021 US Open champion Raducanu is at No.205. Three players have used special rankings (for players returning from long-term injury or maternity leave) to enter Wimbledon qualifying. Mirjam Bjorklund (No.145), Diyas (No.157) and Oksana Selekhmeteva (No.190). Former No.31 Diyas returned from a two-year hiatus at two Japanese ITF W75 tournaments last month, reaching the second round of both. The Wimbledon main-draw entry list was based on the rankings as of May 20, 2024, and 14 players ranked between Rakhimova and Lukas are absent from the qualifying entry list due to gaining entry to the main draw two weeks previously via either real ranking or special ranking. Varvara Gracheva, Brenda Fruhvirtova, Harriet Dart, Martina Trevisan, Rebeka Masarova, Sara Errani, Nao Hibino, Jule Niemeier, Rebecca Sramkova, Julia Riera, Irina-Camelia Begu, Paula Badosa, Kateryna Baindl and Ajla Tomljanovic. Eight further players ranked between Rakhimova and Lukas have not entered Wimbledon qualifying. Alizé Cornet retired at Roland Garros, Belinda Bencic is on maternity leave, while Yanina Wickmayer, Storm Hunter, Lois Boisson and Alina Korneeva all missed Roland Garros with various injuries. Kaja Juvan and Naomi Osaka are on the Wimbledon main-draw entry list as the 31st and 36th alternates respectively but have not entered qualifying. Four-time major champion Osaka, who stretched No.1 seed Iga Swiatek to a three-set thriller in the second round of Roland Garros last week, is ranked No.134. Wild cards for Wimbledon have not yet been announced. Should they be awarded to any player entered into qualifying, that player will be withdrawn from the qualifying entry list. Raducanu is also the seventh alternate to the main draw using her special ranking of No.103. The next 15 alternates to the qualifying competition in case of any withdrawals are, in order, as follows: Vitalia Diatchenko (using a special ranking of No.227)4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With an impressive 20 Grand Slam titles and a natural elegance on the court, Roger Federer truly redefined what it means to excel in tennis. Federer's 2008 Wimbledon final against Rafael Nadal is often regarded as the greatest tennis match of all time. This gripping 4-hour-48-minute showdown concluded with Nadal toppling the five-time defending champion in a fifth set as daylight faded. Even in defeat, Federer's resilience and sportsmanship shone through, deepening the legendary Federer-Nadal rivalry. After facing three previous losses in the final, Roland Garros had been a tough nut to crack for Federer. But in 2009, he finally triumphed on the clay by overcoming Robin Söderling. This victory not only completed his Career Grand Slam but also tied him with Pete Sampras for 14 major titles at that time, solidifying his status as one of the greatest of all time. At 35 years old, he faced off against Rafael Nadal in a thrilling five-set battle to claim his 18th Grand Slam title. This marked his first major win in five years and signaled the start of an incredible late-career revival. In 2019, Roger Federer achieved a remarkable milestone by securing his 100th ATP singles title at the Dubai Tennis Championships.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coverage of a Grand Slam tournament today doesn't look all that different from 10, 20 or in some cases 30 years ago, despite huge technological advances. As many have done, another media network is vowing that it has found a better way. WBD and the French Tennis Federation (FFT) agreed a 10-year deal worth $650 million in June 2024, putting an end to a hodgepodge of coverage that had previously aired across NBC, the Tennis Channel, Tennis Channel+ (its streaming service) and Peacock. Its promise to tennis fans is something different. Interviews with coaches mid-match, some of whom will be mic'd up. And whip-around coverage reminiscent of the NFL's Red Zone, which spends game days hopscotching from one game to another when teams have scoring opportunities. In Paris, where tension and drama arise, TNT says, the cameras will go. Some of the voices using those innovations will be new. Venus Williams, the seven-time Grand Slam champion, will join Andre Agassi on TNT's roster, along with contemporary players and recent retirees, including Sloane Stephens, Chris Eubanks, Caroline Wozniacki and Sam Querrey. Max, formerly HBO, will stream every match, a full-circle moment since HBO made a name for itself in part with coverage of Wimbledon in the 1980s. And at the center of this bid to do what myriad networks have not quite managed is a former college tennis player: Craig Barry, the chief content officer for TNT. He played at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif. and came of age in the first golden era of professional tennis, when larger-than-life luminaries Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg, John McEnroe, Guillermo Vilas, Evert and Martina Navratilova dominated the sport. Like most tennis fans of a certain vintage, Barry appreciates the sport's traditions, including those connected with how it's presented. He also sees tennis as having lost a degree of cultural relevance, especially with younger sports fans. NBC, which didn't prioritize tennis coverage and didn't televise any of the other Grand Slams, struggled to grow the audience for the French Open in a meaningful way in recent years. That is substantially less than the average audience for Wimbledon coverage on ESPN. WBD also owns Eurosport, which televises the French Open in Europe. Barry hopes that they will see them differently. The coverage styled on the NFL Red Zone won't have separate announce teams on each match, but rather a group in an onsite studio watching the action and talking about it along with everyone else. “What interests me is a conversational approach to the game, where I feel like I'm sitting in a room talking tennis,” Barry said. “I understand there's a certain formality to the tradition of tennis and I'm not here to change that, but cutting people loose to have opinions and giving them a forum to have a conversation and look at different ways of calling matches is an important part of the evolution.” The Tennis Channel and ESPN have gone down this conversational route, but rarely with cuts to key moments of matches. Whether that model will work for a sport with pressure points that can occur every other game — the out-of-context presentation of which is a key problem for highlights — remains to be seen. What is certain is that having players who are still active, or who might play in the tournament in question before lending their expertise fresh off an exit, is revolutionary. Eubanks, who originally got into television as a backup for a tennis career that was sputtering, treasures that removed view — but from his own game, not the sport at large. He has kept up the work with ESPN and the Tennis Channel because he likes it, sees it as a future career path, and believes it has made him a better tennis player. He said it allowed him to understand his sport unemotionally, and to experience his own matches from that position of emotional detachment. He has since slipped back to just outside the top 100, but has solidified his second career, both on camera and as a post-match on-court interviewer. It's Williams, who has not played a competitive match for over a year but has also not formally announced the end of her career, who will be the star, alongside Agassi. But the biggest stars have the most to lose by saying the wrong thing, or by, in Barry's words, “cutting loose.” Venus, who has lived through the tennis evolution that came alongside her and Serena's domination of women's tennis, could be a contextualising bridge for the fans of now and those of her era. Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open champion, is in a similar position to Eubanks. 134, and she has started to make forays into television but isn't done playing yet. She is currently recovering from a foot injury, which will keep her from trying to play in Paris. But she figures to be a valuable asset in France, given her reservoir of clay-court success: she made the French Open final in 2018. The title involves a bit of self-mockery since he and co-hosts John Isner, Jack Sock and Steve Johnson never won a singles Grand Slam. He never played Sinner or Alcaraz, but is plenty familiar with everyone else. Wozniacki looked to be headed to a solid schedule of television work when she retired in 2020 and had two children. But then she came back four years later and started winning matches again. How that will all work remains to be seen, but Barry knows time is on his network's side.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live Fantasy Analysis of the 2025 NFL Draft A federal judge has ruled that the men's professional tennis tour cannot retaliate against players who join an ongoing lawsuit against it, nor against players who consider joining the lawsuit. After the filing of that lawsuit, the ATP Tour circulated a letter to be signed by its players. Garnett ruled that the circulation of that letter, and a specific instance in which an ATP board member pressured two players to sign it, amounted to “coercive, deceptive, or potentially abusive” behavior. 2 Alexander Zverev, of Germany, and Ben Shelton, the American world No. She also ordered the ATP to within seven days circulate and post a letter to players, making it clear that they cannot be punished or threatened with punishment for joining litigation. The PTPA's motion, however, had requested that all of the defendants in the lawsuit be prevented from communicating with their players in this regard. Garnett rejected the PTPA's move for a ban on all communication, stating that it would prevent the defendants from reasonably defending their position. The judge's letter, known as a corrective action, informs players that “ATP Tour Inc. is legally prohibited from retaliating in any way or threatening retaliation, directly or indirectly, against you for considering participating in or ultimately deciding to participate in this lawsuit.” The PTPA, co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, has spent much of the past year convincing players that they would not experience retaliation for being a named plaintiff on the lawsuit, or for supporting it. Twelve players elected to be named plaintiffs. Of the six ATP players, three have retired from tennis. None of the other three are ranked inside the top 90, though Nick Kyrgios has been ranked as high as world No. A number of top players declined to join the lawsuit, fearing retribution or a loss of potential prize money, playing opportunities and benefits. The lawsuit, which describes the governing bodies of tennis as a “cartel,” would overturn the structure of professional tennis if it was ruled to have merit, but the PTPA has indicated that it does not want the case to get to that stage. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

(Reuters) -Naomi Osaka and Ons Jabeur advanced to the Italian Open third round in Rome on Thursday after ninth seed Paula Badosa and twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova withdrew due to injury.

Japan's Osaka crushed Swiss lucky loser Viktorija Golubic 6-2 6-3 after 27-year-old Badosa cast more doubts over her fitness ahead of the French Open as the Spanish former world number two pulled out of another tournament due to a recurring back injury.

Kvitova was forced to withdraw due to a leg problem, so three-times Grand Slam finalist Jabeur advanced via walkover and will next face sixth seed Italian Jasmine Paolini or qualifier Lulu Sun.

Czech Kvitova, 35, secured her first victory since returning from maternity leave by defeating Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany tennis great Boris Becker has blamed his early Wimbledon victory at the age of 17 for some of his later problems. "For my health, for my life, it would have been better if I had won Wimbledon later, at 21 or 22, and not at 17 and 18," Becker said in an interview with Sports Illustrated magazine. "Because then I wouldn't have been the child prodigy that people still see me as." After the end of his career, Becker was unable to build on his sporting success and suffered financial and personal troubles. In 2022, for example, he was imprisoned in Britain for seven and a half months after violating insolvency requirements. Becker won the London grass court grand slam three times, the first coming in 1985 at the age of 17. "Wimbledon was always like Christmas for me. "If I have a home as a sportsman, then it's Wimbledon." He is now a respected tennis pundit and hopes it stays that way. "I hope to be treated with more respect for the rest of my life, that my life's work as the best (men's) German tennis player in history will be honoured more than before," added Becker.</p>

The Illinois native, who clinched her maiden Grand Slam title in Melbourne, has been basking in the glow of victory ever since. Despite her monumental win, Keys remains grounded, sharing, “I don't think my life has changed that much since winning the Australian Open. More people want to talk to me, and, obviously, I have a beautiful trophy in my house, but life is still kind of the same, and I'm still really happy to be out on the tennis court and hopefully win some more trophies.” Keys also revealed a charming anecdote about her marriage to coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whose Italian heritage sparked some playful banter about changing her last name for added support. “Bjorn was kind of joking that I should switch my last name this week to be Fratangelo,” Keys shared. But I've come to learn a little bit about where his family came from.” As Madison Keys continues to shine both on and off the court, the world eagerly awaits her next move in what promises to be a stellar career filled with triumphs and touching moments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Osaka, who is currently competing at the Rome Open, has always been open about what goes on in her life. In her recent press conference, when asked about receiving support from other mothers on the WTA Tour, Osaka responded with characteristic honesty and trademark humor. “Like uh I don't know how to answer your question because... probably,” said Naomi Osaka, answering a reporter's question if she had been added to any group chat by the WTA moms on the tour. “So, like there probably is a mom's group chat but I just don't talk a lot and I don't know if that's my answer to your question,” she added. The WTA now has several players who have in recent times become mothers, such as Caroline Wozniacki, Taylor Townsend, Elina Svitolina, and more recently, the likes of Belinda Bencic and Petra Kvitova. Osaka, thus, has a healthy amount of support that she can lean on when it comes to being a traveling mother on the WTA tour. Osaka also mentioned that after her Madrid Open loss, she was contemplating whether she wanted to compete more or go home because she was missing her child. Eventually, she decided to get more matches under her belt and traveled to France, where she ended up winning her first-ever clay title. “I was just more missing my daughter a lot, and I was thinking like I wonder if the time would have been spent better after Madrid going to see her really quickly as opposed to playing the tournament, which like luckily, I was able to snap out of that, but its kind of funny like during tennis sometimes you don't think about tennis at all”, said Osaka. As Osaka traverses through the challenges of being a professional tennis player while being a mom, it remains to be seen if she goes on to win more titles as a mother in the immediate future.</p>

Italian women's tennis lived a historic chapter during the 2010s with several players dominating the tour, including names such as Francesca Schiavone, Flavia Pennetta, Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci. The latter, who achieved a career Grand Slam in doubles, is also remembered for her defining and stunning win over Serena Williams at the 2015 US Open. She won the girls' doubles title at Roland Garros with Pennetta that year and reached her first WTA final in Bogota in 2007. But over time, her slice-heavy, all-court game began to find a foothold against elite opponents. She amassed ten WTA singles titles and started to become a dangerous opponent. But her real breakthrough came in the next match. She stunned Serena Williams, who was looking for the calendar Grand Slam (Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Vinci was 42 spots below Serena in the rankings, had never reached a Slam final, and was widely counted out. “It's like a dream,” she told ESPN courtside. “Sorry guys… today is my day.” The result is still considered one of the biggest upsets in tennis history. She lost in the final to childhood friend Pennetta, but her semifinal win was the moment that defined her career. “It was the best victory of my life,” Vinci later said. “The public can remember me with Serena.” Partnering with Sara Errani, she won 25 WTA doubles titles, including all four Grand Slams. They completed the Career Grand Slam in just three seasons. Only five women's doubles teams in history have completed a Career Grand Slam, and Errani and Vinci joined that elite company in 2014.
