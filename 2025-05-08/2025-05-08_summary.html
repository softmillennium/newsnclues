Polling consistently shows that most Americans want Medicaid funding to be increased or  remain the same.

A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shows that major cuts to Medicaid proposed by Republicans would remove millions of enrollees from the program.

Republicans have repeatedly claimed that the cuts they've proposed would only target supposedly wasteful spending and abuse of Medicaid, which is funded jointly by states and the federal government. But the new report undermines that notion, demonstrating that defunding Medicaid at the levels proposed by far right lawmakers would harm people dependent on the program.

Medicaid covers health care costs for more than 70 million people with limited incomes in the U.S. Republicans are considering cuts to Medicaid funding to the tune of $880 billion, and are planning to use the funds to cover the $5 trillion in tax cuts being pushed by President Donald Trump and Republicans.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and other Republican lawmakers have repeatedly claimed that the spending cuts would not harm people who are enrolled in Medicaid. 

“We have to root out fraud, waste and abuse,” Johnson said in a recent Fox News interview.

But the CBO analysis found that some of the cuts being proposed would result in around 5.5 million Medicaid recipients losing their benefits — roughly 1 in every 13 individuals who benefit from the program. Of that total, around half would be left without any option for health care coverage after losing access to Medicaid, the CBO report found.

Democratic lawmakers responded to the report by condemning Republicans for promoting disinformation regarding the proposed cuts. 

“Trump has repeatedly claimed Republicans are not cutting health care, but CBO's independent analysis confirms the proposals under consideration will result in catastrophic benefit cuts and people losing their health care,” Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-New Jersey), ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, echoed Pallone's views, stating:

This analysis from the non-partisan, independent CBO is straightforward: the Republican plan for health care means benefit cuts and terminated health insurance for millions of Americans who count on Medicaid. Republicans continue to use smoke and mirrors to try to trick Americans into thinking they aren't going to hurt anybody when they proceed with this reckless plan, but fighting reality is an uphill battle. The bottom line is that the Republican bill is going to cut health care for kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.

Moderate Republicans — particularly those from “purple” districts, who could face strong competition from Democrats in the 2026 midterms — have been reluctant to support a bill that includes enormous cuts to Medicaid.

“My neighbors, people my kids go to school with” depend on Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Arizona) recently said.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska), who represents much of Omaha, Nebraska, also said he couldn't sign on to the $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid that hardliners of his party are demanding. However, he did indicate that he would support as much as $500 billion in reductions to the program, along with more eligibility checks and work requirements.

Getting a bill passed will be difficult, as Republicans can only afford to lose four votes in the House of Representatives. Even if Republicans use the reconciliation process to avoid a filibuster in the Senate, they can only afford to lose four votes in that chamber as well.

Notably, Medicaid cuts of any size are largely opposed by the American public.

A KFF poll from earlier this month found that 76 percent of Americans oppose cuts to Medicaid. That's consistent with polling that was conducted in March, which found that a combined 82 percent of Americans said they wanted Medicaid spending to be increased or kept the same, while just 17 percent of respondents said they wanted it reduced.

Even among those who said they supported cuts to Medicaid, just half said they wanted “a lot” of cuts to the program, while an equal proportion said they only wanted small cuts.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Truthout is appealing for your support as Trump and his sycophants crack down on political speech. Nonprofits like Truthout could be caught in Trump's crosshairs as he attacks dissenting groups with bad faith lawsuits and targeted harassment of journalists.

As well, these attacks come at a time when independent journalism is most needed. The right-wing corporate takeover of media has left reliable outlets few and far between, with even fewer providing their work at no cost to the reader. Who will be there to hold the fascists to account, if not media like Truthout?

            Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost of the United States has been elected the 267th pope and has stepped onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica as the new leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.
    


            He's now known as Pope Leo XIV.
    


            Prevost, 69, from Chicago, Illinois, is the first ever pope from the United States.
    


            In his first words as pope, a visibly emotional Leo said to the crowd in St. Peter's Square: “Peace be with you all.”
    


            Addressing the crowd in St. Peter's Square, Leo paid tribute to the late pontiff Francis, urging the crowd to remember his predecessor's legacy before outlining his vision for the Catholic Church.
    


            “We have to seek together to be a missionary church. A church that builds bridges and dialogue,” he said. Speaking in Italian to thousands of Catholic faithful, Leo called on people to “show our charity” to others “and be in dialog with love.”
    


            Leo was chosen just two days after a group of 133 Cardinals gathered in conclave to select a new pontiff.
    


            That timeline matches the previous two gatherings, suggesting that Prevost quickly impressed his peers during the secretive process.
    


            Francis and Benedict XVI were both revealed in the evening of the conclave's second day, while John Paul II, the longest-reigning pope of modern times, was selected on the third day in 1978.
    


            A leader with global experience, Prevost spent much of his career as a missionary in South America and most recently led a powerful Vatican office for bishop appointments. He is expected to build on Francis' reforms.
    


            Prevost worked for a decade in Trujillo, Peru, and was later appointed bishop of Chiclayo, another Peruvian city, where he served from 2014 to 2023. In 2015, he also received Peruvian citizenship.
    


            The new pontiff is a member of the Augustinian religious order – which he also led for more than a decade as their prior general, which has given him leadership experience of leading an order spread across the world.
    


            Considered a highly capable and accomplished leader, Prevost most recently led the powerful Vatican office for new bishop appointments, the Dicastery for Bishops, assessing candidates and making recommendations to the late pope. He also served as the president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.
    


            While it is often said cardinal electors would always shy away from choosing a pope from the US, due to America's outsized global political influence, Prevost's long experience in Peru may have mitigated those fears among the electors.
    


            “He's somebody that, even though he's from the West, would be very attentive to the needs of a global church,” said Elise Allen, CNN's Vatican analyst. “You're talking about somebody who spent over half of his ecclesial career abroad as a missionary in Peru.”
    


            Allen added that he is seen as an apt leader in Vatican circles because “he's able to accomplish things without necessarily being authoritarian about the way he did things.”
    


            “Prevost is somebody who is seen as an exceptional leader. From very young, he was appointed to leadership roles,” Allen said. “He's seen as somebody who is calm and balanced, who is even-handed, and who is very clear on what he thinks needs to be done… but he's not overly forceful in trying to make that happen.”
    


            Prevost earned his bachelor's in mathematics from Villanova University in Pennsylvania and went on receive his diploma in theology from the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago.
    


            He was later sent to Rome to study canon law at the Pontifical Saint Thomas Aquinas University and was ordained as a priest in June 1982. Later in his career, he taught canon law in the seminary in Trujillo, Peru.
    


            In an interview with Vatican News shortly after he became the leader of the Dicastery for Bishops, Prevost said: “I still consider myself a missionary. My vocation, like that of every Christian, is to be a missionary, to proclaim the Gospel wherever one is.”
    


            The coming days are for celebration; Leo's name will be uttered in homilies and masses across the Catholic world, and will spark particularly joyous scenes in his home country. Adding to festivities, and to the new pope's diary commitments, is the fact that 2025 is a jubilee year for the church – a special celebration announced by Pope John Paul II 25 years ago, which sees a busy schedule of Vatican-organized events.
    


            But leading the largest Christian denomination through an unpredictable era will require difficult and consequential decisions. The new pope inherits a church whose image and ambitions were transformed by its predecessor; Francis pulled the priorities of the church away from social issues such as abortion, homosexuality, gender roles and contraception, advocating instead for the world's poor, displaced and needy, and instilling a mission anchored in altruism.
    


            Whether or not to continue that trajectory will be a defining choice for the new pontiff. Francis' rejection of opulence and his softer tone on social issues was praised by some Western leaders, but there remains a faction in the church advocating for a stricter line on questions of sex, gender, marriage and migration.
    


            Asked about the contributions of three women who were made members of the Dicastery for Bishops, Prevost told Vatican News: “I think their appointment is more than just a gesture on the part of the Pope to say that there are now women here, too. There is a real, genuine, and meaningful participation that they offer at our meetings when we discuss the dossiers of candidates.”
    


            He must also choose carefully when to intervene on the world stage. Francis became increasingly political in the final years of his papacy, making the case for the rights of migrants, urging a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, and suggesting – to the ire of Kyiv – that Ukraine should wave “the white flag” and make concessions to end Russia's war in the country.
    


            These ongoing conflicts, and the rise of populism and authoritarianism around the world, set a complicated context in which the new pope – himself an important figure in global diplomacy – will operate.
    


            And he must deal with crises from within, too. Francis' failure to bring a close to the years-long scandal of child sexual abuse in the church will also reverberate through his successor's papacy. Though he spoke defensively about his record on the matter, and took some important steps to tackle systemic issues involving abuse, the previous pope was accused by survivors' groups of failing to hold accountable bishops and cardinals accused of covering up abuse.
    


            Previously addressing the responsibility of combating clerical abuse, Prevost told Vatican News: “There are places where good work has already been done for years and the rules are being put into practice. At the same time, I believe that there is still much to learn.”
    


            Last year, Francis' commission for child protection said in its first report that parts of the church are still failing to ensure that abuse is properly reported, and raised concerns about a “lack of transparency” in how the Vatican handled cases.

Measure passes nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican voting in favor

Republicans in the House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation to codify Donald Trump's policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.

The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor.

Trump had announced in his inaugural speech that the US government would change how it refers to the body of water, which stretches from Florida to Texas and along the coast of Mexico. The bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it's unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name.

Speaking on the House floor before the vote, Greene leveled unfounded allegations against Democrats and cast changing the name as a patriotic obligation.

“The American people rose up in a historic election in November of 2024 and they told Washington DC they have had enough of the Democrat embrace and love affair of the cartels in Mexico. But Democrats today are fighting to keep the Gulf of America named the Gulf of Mexico because the cartels are their business partners,” said Greene.

“You would think this would be the easiest vote that the United States House of Representatives could take, because, after all, everybody in here swore an oath to defend our constitution and to defend our laws and our land. Oh, but no, the Democrats can't do it because we had four years of Democrat control where our borders were wide open and the American people are fed up with it.”

Democrats countered that the legislation was a waste of time.

“The truth is, this bill won't fix a single problem. It does absolutely nothing to help the Gulf coast. It won't create a single job. It's not going to fix our climate crisis. It's just dumb,” said Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House natural resources committee.

Trump and his allies have pushed companies to use the new name for the gulf in the months since he took office. In February, it barred Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office, Air Force One and White House events in retaliation for the wire agency refusing to use the new term in its authoritative stylebook. A federal judge ordered the administration to restore the AP's access in April.

Trump has kept up his interest in changing the names of bodies of water globally. This week, it was revealed that the president will announce plans to change how the Persian Gulf is referred to during a forthcoming visit to Saudi Arabia.

Records obtained by the Guardian indicate shooters missed the target on Mikal Mahdi, which lawyers say caused prolonged suffering

A South Carolina firing squad botched the execution of Mikal Mahdi last month, with shooters missing the target area on the man's heart, causing him to suffer a prolonged death, according to autopsy records and his attorneys.

Mahdi, 42, was shot dead by corrections employees last month in the second firing squad execution this year in South Carolina. The state has aggressively revived capital punishment over the last seven months and brought back the controversial firearm method that has rarely been used in the modern death penalty era.

Autopsy documents and a photo reviewed by the Guardian, along with analysis commissioned by Mahdi's lawyers, suggest the execution did not occur according to protocol, and that Mahdi endured pain beyond the “10-to-15 second” window of consciousness that was expected.

Mahdi's lawyers submitted the records to the South Carolina supreme court on Thursday. The South Carolina department of corrections (SCDC) and the state's attorney general have been contacted for comment.

Mahdi was sentenced to death in 2006, and the execution was carried out on 11 April. On the evening of his killing, Mahdi was brought into the state's execution chamber, strapped to a chair and had a red bullseye target placed over his heart. Witnesses were positioned behind bulletproof glass, and three prison employees on the firing squad stood roughly 15ft (4.6 metres) away.

Officials placed a hood over Mahdi's head before the staff fired, according to an Associated Press reporter, who was a witness. As shots were fired, Mahdi cried out and his arms flexed, and after roughly 45 seconds, he groaned twice, the AP said. His breaths continued for around 80 seconds, then a doctor examined him for a minute. He was declared dead roughly four minutes after the shots.

South Carolina regulations call for the shooters to fire bullets “in the heart … using ammunition calculated to do maximum damage to – and thereby immediately stop – the heart”.

But the autopsy report commissioned by the SCDC indicates there were only two gunshot wounds, not three, and that the bullets hit his pancreas, liver and lower lung, and largely missed his heart.

Dr Bradley Marcus, the pathologist who performed the autopsy for the state, described two roughly half-inch gunshot wounds on Mahdi's chest, but suggested three shots might have been fired, writing: “It is believed that gunshot wound labeled (A) represents two gunshot wound pathways.”

But Dr Jonathan Arden, a forensic pathologist retained by Mahdi's lawyers, wrote in a report submitted to the court that it would be “extraordinarily uncommon” for multiple bullets to enter through one wound. Arden also interviewed Marcus for his report and said the state's pathologist was “surprised to find only two wounds” and took a photograph to send to the SCDC, which clearly showed two wounds. Arden said Marcus also acknowledged the odds were “remote” that two shots made a single wound.

Arden said the wounds were on the lowest area of Mahdi's chest, near the abdomen, and that the bullets had a “downward” trajectory that mostly missed the heart.

In the firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon, in March, the bullets “obliterated both ventricles of the heart”, but in Mahdi's body, there were only four perforations of the right ventricle, Arden wrote.

Arden said Marcus, too, “expected the entrance wounds to be higher” and “did not expect to find such severe damage to the liver”, according to Arden's summary of their call.

“If the procedure is done correctly, the heart will be disrupted, immediately eliminating all circulation,” wrote Arden, who previously testified in litigation challenging firing squads. Because “the shooters missed the intended target area”, Mahdi continued to have circulation, allowing him to remain conscious for up to a minute, said Arden, noting the AP's report of his groaning after 45 seconds.

Mahdi suffered a “more prolonged death process than was expected had the execution been conducted successfully according to the protocol” and experienced “excruciating conscious pain and suffering for about 30 to 60 seconds”, Arden concluded.

“Among the questions that remain: did one member of the execution team miss Mr Mahdi entirely? Did they not fire at all? How did the two who did shoot Mr Mahdi miss his heart?,” Mahdi's attorneys wrote to the court. “Did they flinch or miss because of inadequate training? Or was the target on Mr Mahdi's chest misplaced? The current record provides no answers.”

Arden's report noted the autopsy did not involve X-rays or an examination of Mahdi's clothes to assess the target's placement.

When the state supreme court issued a ruling authorizing firing squads last year, it assessed whether the method was considered “cruel” based on the “risk of unnecessary and excessive conscious pain”. The court, citing Arden's testimony in the litigation, concluded it was not cruel because the pain, even if excruciating, would only last 10 to 15 seconds “unless there is a massive botch of the execution in which each member of the firing squad simply misses the inmate's heart”.

Mahdi's lawyers said “a massive botch is exactly what happened”: “Mr Mahdi elected the firing squad, and this court sanctioned it, based on the assumption that SCDC could be entrusted to carry out its straightforward steps: locating the heart; placing a target over it; and hitting that target. That confidence was clearly misplaced.”

“I don't think any reasonable, objective observer can look at what happened and think we can keep setting execution dates,” David Weiss, Madhi's lawyer who sat as a witness, said in an interview. “I heard Mikal's cries of pain and agony, and I don't want that to happen to somebody else.”

South Carolina had ceased executions for 13 years as it struggled to obtain lethal injection supplies, but resumed last year, directing people on death row to choose either firing squad, electric chair or lethal injection.

Weiss is a federal public defender and part of the capital habeas unit for the fourth circuit, which has represented four of the five people executed in rapid succession by South Carolina. The lawyers have said that two of the executions by injections of pentobarbital, a sedative, took more than 20 minutes to cause death, in one case appearing to lead to a condition akin to suffocation and drowning. Mahdi chose what he considered the “lesser of three evils”, the attorneys said.

“Lethal injections were adopted because they were supposed to be more humane with a lower risk of error, but as more information became available, we realized it was actually quite tortuous,” said Weiss. “And the intent of the firing squad was that in some ways it would be simpler, quicker, more straightforward, harder to make mistakes. But they couldn't get that right either.”

A human rights report last year chronicled 73 botched lethal injection executions in the last 50 years, which have disproportionately affected Black people on death row. Alabama began using an untested nitrogen gas method last year, claiming it was “perhaps the most humane” option, but in its first case, witnesses reported that the condemned man's body began violently shaking, and it took roughly 22 minutes to kill him.

There have only been three other firing squad executions in the last 50 years, though Idaho recently adopted legislation making shootings the main method of killing.

            In an interview with Vatican News shortly after he became the leader of the Dicastery for Bishops, Prevost said: “I still consider myself a missionary. My vocation, like that of every Christian, is to be a missionary, to proclaim the Gospel wherever one is.”
    


            Asked about the contributions of three women who were made members of the Dicastery for Bishops, Prevost told Vatican News: “I think their appointment is more than just a gesture on the part of the Pope to say that there are now women here, too. There is a real, genuine, and meaningful participation that they offer at our meetings when we discuss the dossiers of candidates.”
    


            He also addressed the responsibility of combating clerical abuse, saying: “There are places where good work has already been done for years and the rules are being put into practice. At the same time, I believe that there is still much to learn.”

            Questions arise after Zelensky claims Ukraine "not responsible" for security of Moscow's cherished military spectacle
          

Questions arise after Zelensky claims Ukraine "not responsible" for security of Moscow's cherished military spectacle

Over the past days, Moscow's grand avenues, like every year in early May, were taken over by the growling of 80-year-old tanks and the smell of gasoline burned by military vehicles. 

To the delight of many locals, soldiers marched in multiple rehearsals for the May 9 Victory Day Parade in the week leading up to the actual event.

But as Moscow prepares for its fourth parade since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the atmosphere this year is different.

At the turn of the month, Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine "cannot be held responsible" for whatever happens during Russian President Vladimir Putin's military spectacle, opening the door to speculations that Ukraine might actually be considering striking military targets inside Russia during the event.

The Victory Day parade is not an event like any other. Held on major anniversaries since the 1960s, and annually since 1995, it has come to become Russia's grandest show of national pride, an event intended to highlight both the country's supposed glorious past as well as its continued military strength.

This post-Soviet imperial nostalgia reached its climax under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, who has shown special devotion to publicly celebrating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.

This year, the Victory Day parade was intended to be even more attractive than previous editions, with invitations sent out to several dozen foreign leaders, whose presence is supposed to highlight Russia's international standing.

Aside from the usual bunch, that is, presidents of Central Asian countries and Alexander Lukashenko, this year's parade will host China's Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Lula da Silva and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, among others. 

This guest list stands in clear contrast with last year's parade, which hosted only foreign leaders from Belarus, Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba, Laos and Guinea-Bissau, and even more clearly with that in 2022, when no foreigners showed up at all.

Somewhat in reaction, Ukraine's Zelensky made his comments on "not being responsible" for the security of the parade, with high-level officials repeating this claim in the following days.

In the days leading up to the parade, Ukraine showed that it has the technical capability to strike Russia's capital.

Over the past days, Moscow's airports were closed several times due to ongoing Ukrainian drone attacks, paralyzing air traffic just as Russians were traveling for holidays during the days leading up to Victory Day.

According to specialists tracking Ukrainian military activity in Russia, while most attacks on Moscow are intercepted by air defense, a small proportion of drones do manage to reach the city.

"In March, while 90% of Ukrainian attacks on Russia were focused on the border regions of Belgorod and Kursk, we still noted 14 strikes on the Moscow region and four strikes on Moscow itself," said Nichita Gurcov, senior analyst at ACLED, an international organization tracking military conflict and political violence worldwide.

According to Gurcov, however, this does not mean that Ukrainian drones will necessarily reach Moscow on May 9.


"This really is about the language of force that Russia constantly uses (in this war), and Ukraine understands that it needs to reciprocate with the same language."
    

One of the main issues will be the fact that Russian authorities are planning to turn off mobile internet in the capital during the event, in anticipation of Ukrainian military activity.

"Most Ukrainian drones are GPS-guided (and will be affected by this cut), with only a small patch of experimental drones using AI to reach their destination," Gurcov told the Kyiv Independent.

"In general, Ukrainian forces attempt to send as many drones as possible to circumvent Russian air defenses. The fewer drones that are available, the lower the chances that at least one will hit a target. Still, it's hard to tell what will happen on May 9 in Moscow."

In an attempt to secure the cherished military spectacle from any potential attacks, Putin had declared a unilateral ceasefire for the time of the parade. Ukraine didn't agree to a 3-day-long ceasefire and had said it continues to petition for a month-long one.

Zelensky called Putin's call a "theatrical performance" designed to ease Russia's international isolation and create a favorable atmosphere for the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

With Ukraine theoretically having the capability to strike Moscow, the question of intent looms over the event.

"This really is about the language of force that Russia constantly uses (in this war), and Ukraine understands that it needs to reciprocate with the same language," said Maria Piechowska, an analyst who covers Ukraine at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM).


"Ukraine's speculations additionally serve as a reminder that Russia is still at war today and has not defeated Ukraine."
    

"Ukraine just doesn't want to be walked over, in a positive sense, and the question of narrative is important in understanding this. Authorities were asked directly about the possibility of an attack, and they simply had nothing to gain from saying that they would not target the parade, especially given that Russia continues to target civilians in Ukraine."

The comments on the May 9 parade also show that Ukraine feels it is in a "strong position vis-a-vis Russia this week," argued Dr. Marnie Howlett, who is a lecturer in Russian and East European politics at the University of Oxford, in conversation with the Kyiv Independent.

"Ukraine's speculations additionally serve as a reminder that Russia is still at war today and has not defeated Ukraine."

The question of narrative also serves internal political purposes, Piechowska argued in turn, with an attack on the Victory Day parade serving as a kind of "dream" that many in Ukraine imagine, and which could build up internal morale.

As a result, even if Ukraine does not strike the parade, speaking about it publicly emboldens Ukrainian public opinion, especially after a series of deadly Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities over the past weeks, in which dozens of civilians were killed.

Threats to attack the Victory Day parade were also likely directed at foreign leaders who planned to visit Moscow on May 9, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent argued.

"I don't think the actual fear of being targeted in a strike led to some of them changing their minds about coming to Moscow, however, their unwillingness to be connected to this topic of war… I think this could have played a role in their decisions, even if I wouldn't overestimate this either," Piechowska said.

The fact that Russia is a country at war and that traveling there carries "significant risks" is simply a "reality of the war" between Russia and Ukraine, Howlett said in turn.

"While the statements by Ukraine about not guaranteeing the safety of foreign leaders in Moscow may dissuade some from traveling to Russia, they are also a reflection of the ongoing war and the risks it poses."

These comments come as Ukraine continues to send drones to strike Moscow, with these attacks having produced at least one concrete result — on May 7, the plane carrying Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to Moscow was initially not able to reach the Russian capital due to Ukrainian activity.

While Vucic's plane needed to make a halt in Baku, the Serbian president was later able to continue his flight to Moscow.

"Still, I don't know for sure what will happen on May 9," Gurcov concluded.

Several human rights groups have documented deplorable conditions in Libya's immigrant prisons.

A federal judge has placed a hold on the U.S. government's plans to deport a number of immigrants to Libya, following allegations from immigrants, their families and their lawyers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials told them they would soon be sent to that country.

The injunction placed by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy states that the Trump administration's actions would “clearly violate” a previous order he made, violating immigrants' right to challenge their expulsion to countries other than their homelands.

Murphy also ordered that the U.S. government — which hasn't formally acknowledged whether or not it is planning to deport people to Libya — hand over any details relating to claims that they are planning such a move, if such details exist.

The immigrants in question are reportedly from the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, among other countries, according to a report from NBC News. In the legal motion seeking the injunction, lawyers claimed that their clients are being targeted for deportation “without any reasonable fear screening, let alone a fifteen-day window to file a motion to reopen with the immigration court to contest any negative reasonable fear determination.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said that she “can't confirm” previous reports that immigrants living in the U.S. could soon be deported to Libya. But State Department Secretary Marco Rubio confirmed last month that the Trump administration is “actively searching for other countries to take people,” beyond the White House's current agreement with El Salvador.

Libyan government officials have denied the existence of an agreement with the U.S. to receive and detain immigrants in their prisons. But they have also acknowledged that “some parallel parties that are not subject to legitimacy” could be involved in receiving and imprisoning immigrants.

Immigrants who have been abducted by ICE told their families and their lawyers that they were being threatened with deportation to Libya, which has a history of human rights abuses, particularly against immigrants. Those individuals said that immigration officials tried to force them to sign documents agreeing to be deported to the country; if they refused to do so, they were cuffed and placed in what was essentially solitary confinement. 

Human rights groups have repeatedly shined a light on the deplorable conditions of Libya's immigrant prisons.

In 2021, Amnesty International described those sites as “horrific” and a “hellscape,” finding evidence of “sexual violence, against men, women and children.” The Global Detention Project also stated that immigrants in those detention centers were subjected to “physical mistreatment and tortured” and forced into slavery.

The United Nations Human Rights Council's Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya issued a report in 2023 concluding that the country likely committed “crimes against humanity” against “Libyans and migrants throughout Libya,” documenting examples of “arbitrary detention, murder, torture, rape, enslavement, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing and enforced disappearance.” And even the U.S. State Department's own assessments on Libya describe conditions in its detention centers as “harsh and life-threatening.”

“I have been in those migrant prisons and it's no place for migrants. It's just a horrific place to dump any vulnerable person,” said Frederic Wehrey, a Libya expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Exclusive: Prosecutors impanel federal grand jury in Virginia to hear evidence after Trump official's referral against Letitia James

Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into New York's attorney general, Letitia James, after the Trump administration alleged last month in a referral that she may have falsified paperwork for properties she owns in Virginia and New York, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investigation marks a swift and notable escalation against James, a major political enemy of Donald Trump, who was ordered to pay more than $450m in penalties as a result of a lawsuit brought by James's office that accused him of inflating his net worth to secure financial benefits.

In what appears to be the early stages of the FBI criminal investigation, prosecutors have impaneled a federal grand jury to hear evidence in the eastern district of Virginia after the head of the federal housing agency, William Pulte, last month made the referral to the justice department, the people said.

The investigation appears to be multipronged, the people said, with involvement from the FBI in New York in addition to Virginia. The investigation appears to have gathered pace only in recent weeks with news of the grand jury filtering through Trump's orbit in the last few days of April.

The criminal referral rehashed claims touted online by Trump allies that James may have committed fraud by attesting in paperwork in 2023 that she would make a house in Norfolk, Virginia, which she was helping a relative to buy, as her principal residence while she was New York's attorney general.

Whether the allegations are substantial enough to result in criminal charges remains unclear. But its existence, which has not been previously reported, regardless raises the legal stakes for James in what appears to be the first criminal inquiry into one of Trump's foremost political adversaries.

James has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated retribution. In a letter to the justice department last month, James's lawyer argued the residency claim was a mistake and that she had told the mortgage broker the house would not be her main residence.

“Director Pulte cherry-picked an August 17, 2023 power of attorney that mistakenly stated the property to be Ms James' principal residence,” James's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote. “The broker understood this, and that Ms James was not a Virginia resident.”

Spokespeople for the justice department and the federal housing finance agency declined to comment.

In a statement, Lowell criticized the investigations as baseless, adding: “This appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.”

Still, the allegations have gained traction in recent weeks among Trump's allies, who appear to see an opportunity to try to invalidate Trump's $450m civil fraud trial verdict by challenging James's eligibility to be the attorney general, and to advance the possibility of criminal charges.

The power of attorney was signed by James in August 2023, weeks before the start of the civil fraud trial. New York state law requires public officeholders to be a resident of the state and Trump's allies have argued when the case went to trial in October 2024, James should have been ineligible to be the attorney general.

Trump's allies have also accused James of possibly obtaining improper financial benefits by attesting she would live in the Virginia house, therefore unlocking a lower interest rate for the mortgage because rates are lower for houses occupied by their owners.

Real estate lawyers in Virginia suggested the paperwork was not likely to be an issue unless James had misrepresented her intentions with the house to a lender or insurer. James said in a separate loan application that she did not intend to live in Virginia.

The criminal referral also accused James of buying a house in Brooklyn in 2001 that she characterized as a five-unit property with a loan that was only available for homes with four units, in order to receive better interest rates.

The referral referenced a January 2001 certificate of occupancy that said the house had five units. In the letter back to the justice department, Lowell said the house had four floors, had been used by James as four units, and numerous other New York City records listed the building as four units.

Some countries have reportedly expected a better trade deal if they adopted the services of the billionaire's company.

Trump administration officials have reportedly been pressuring countries facing U.S. tariffs to approve satellite internet services offered by Elon Musk's Starlink to help grease trade negotiations, further underscoring the conflicts of interest stemming from the mega-billionaire's proximity to the White House.

The Washington Post reported Wednesday that it obtained “a series of internal government messages” that “reveal how U.S. embassies and the State Department have pushed nations to clear hurdles for U.S. satellite companies, often mentioning Starlink by name.”

“The documents do not show that the Trump team has explicitly demanded favors for Starlink in exchange for lower tariffs,” the newspaper added. “But they do indicate that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has increasingly instructed officials to push for regulatory approvals for Musk's satellite firm at a moment when the White House is calling for wide-ranging talks on trade.”

The Post points specifically to ongoing bilateral trade negotiations between the U.S. and India, where “government officials have sped through approvals of Starlink with the understanding that doing so could help them cement trade deals with the administration.”

The Times of India reported Wednesday that Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk's SpaceX, “has been issued a Letter of Intent by the Indian government for satcom services.”

The corruption is staggering. So brazen.

Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the U.S.-based consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said in response to the Post's reporting that “the glaring conflict of interest inherent in this pressure to preference a Musk-owned company is disgusting.”

“The bottom line here is that tools of trade and government should be utilized for the benefit of the American public, not abused for personal tech bro profiteering,” Gilbert added.

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the revelations “a huge new scandal.”

“Trump and Musk are using tariffs as leverage to get other countries to buy from Musk's companies. Working families pay $4,000+ more a year so Musk gets new deals,” Casar wrote on social media. “They get richer. Everyone else gets screwed.”

Last month, U.S. President Donald Trumppartially paused the more aggressive tariffs he sought to impose on countries around the world while leaving in place 10% across-the-board import duties, which are already raising costs for American families.

The Post reported Wednesday that “at least two countries have explicitly discussed or moved toward adopting Musk's Starlink as a means of avoiding Trump's tariffs and negotiating a better trade deal with the United States.”

Cambodia, which is facing a potential 49% tariff rate, appears to be one of those countries. The Post obtained a U.S. embassy cable indicating that Cambodian officials have signaled a “desire to help balance our trade relationship by promoting the market entry of leading U.S. companies such as Boeing and Starlink.”

“Another cable from April 17 reported that Starlink was pushing for a license to operate in Djibouti,” the newspaper reported. “Embassy staffers wrote they would help Starlink as much as they could: ‘Post will continue to follow up with Starlink in identifying government officials and facilitating discussions.'”

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said the internal cables show “gross corruption.” Congressional Democrats are already probing the White House's use of Starlink services.

“Surprise, surprise: another Trump move that directly benefits Elon Musk — the guy who spent $260 million to elect Donald Trump and has been given the keys to the federal government,” said Van Hollen. “They are rigging the government for themselves.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Microsoft co-founder accuses Trump ally of ‘killing the world's poorest children' by slashing US aid funding

Bill Gates announced plans on Thursday to shutter the Gates Foundation in 2045 and also strongly criticized Elon Musk for slashing funding to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), accusing the Tesla CEO of “killing the world's poorest children” in new interviews.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Thursday, Gates condemned the sudden funding cuts to USAID by Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), saying the cuts had led to life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses, and could result in the resurgence of diseases such as measles, HIV and polio.

“The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates said.

Since Donald Trump took office in January, he and Musk began cutting funding and scaling back operations at USAID, the US government's foremost international aid agency, once considered the world's largest single provider of humanitarian aid. Staffers with Musk's Doge initiative have worked to hollow out and dismantle the agency and have terminated more than 5,600 USAID workers.

Gates, 69, told the Financial Times that Musk had cancelled grants to a hospital in Gaza province, Mozambique, which he said was working to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies, based on the mistaken belief that the US was supplying condoms to Hamas in Gaza in the Middle East.

“I'd love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” Gates said.

In a separate interview with the New York Times also published on Thursday, Gates said that Musk put USAID “in the wood chipper, because he didn't go to a party that weekend”.

The Times asked Gates about Musk's commitment to The Giving Pledge – a philanthropic commitment launched by Gates, along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett. The pledge, which Musk signed in 2012, encourages wealthy people to contribute a majority of their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetimes or in their wills.

Gates told the Times that an “unusual aspect” of the pledge is that “you can wait until you die and still fulfill it.”

“So who knows?” Gates said, Musk “could go on to be a great philanthropist”.

“In the meantime, the world's richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world's poorest children” Gates continued.

Gates also told the Times that given the various cuts imposed by the Trump administration, he expected childhood mortality to go up by a million additional deaths a year.

Gates's remarks come as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder announced on Thursday in a blogpost that he plans to distribute “virtually all” of his wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years “to the cause of saving and improving lives around the world” before shuttering his foundation on 31 December 2045.

“Over the next twenty years, the Gates Foundation will aim to save and improve as many lives as possible,” Gates wrote.

“By accelerating our giving, my hope is we can put the world on a path to ending preventable deaths of moms and babies and lifting millions of people out of poverty. I believe we can leave the next generation better off and better prepared to fight the next set of challenges.

“It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people. But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty. There are just too many opportunities to lift people up for us not to take them.”

Gates estimates that between now and 2045, the foundation will spend more than $200bn on these efforts.

MOSCOW, May 8. /TASS/. Russia and China condemn the use of commercial satellite systems to interfere in the affairs of other countries and in armed conflicts, reads a joint statement on global strategic stability.

"The parties condemn the use of commercial space systems to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states and armed conflicts involving third countries," says the statement adopted after the meeting of the two countries' leaders, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in Moscow.

Moscow and Beijing have jointly condemned any attempts by individual nations to utilize outer space for military confrontation. They reaffirm their stance against security policies and activities aimed at achieving military dominance or transforming outer space into a battlefield.

The two countries call for the urgent initiation of negotiations on a multilateral, legally binding treaty based on the Russian-Chinese draft. This treaty would prohibit the placement of weapons in outer space and prevent the threat or use of force against space objects. Such a treaty is essential to establishing clear, reliable guarantees that prevent an arms race in space, prohibit weaponization, and maintain space as a domain for peaceful exploration.

Furthermore, Russia and China advocate for the internationalization of this initiative and a political commitment among nations not to be the first to deploy weapons in space. They believe that such measures will bolster global peace, promote equal and indivisible security, and enhance the predictability and sustainability of peaceful space activities. The statement underscores the importance of collective efforts to preserve outer space for the benefit of all humanity.

Scientists worry they can no longer protect the public from toxic algal blooms that can kill animals and sicken people. 

This story was originally published by ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.

As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”

But times have changed.

This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump's administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.

Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it's late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.

In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team's ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA's hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.

“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.

Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year's monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab's boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.

That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.

If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.

The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab's union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn't provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal' initiatives.”

An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA's research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.

Vance's office didn't respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn't respond to messages.

Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.

In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo's water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.

“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don't drink the water' advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.

Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.

Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.

“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.

NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn't respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.

The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.

A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab's former director, had been difficult to fill.

A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.

A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab's website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.

And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn't allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.

At the same time, expected funds for the lab's cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.

In March, Cleveland's water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.

In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio's drinking water regulatory agency.

“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”

The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”

Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA's real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”

Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.

The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.

As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it's also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of The Lorax. The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn't so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”

But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.

“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.

Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”

A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab's, described the lab's work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.

Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump's second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”

NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry's mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”

“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”

When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025's recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.

One month later, the Great Lakes lab's probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.

In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.

“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to “defend ourselves alone” against Yemen's Houthi rebels after US President Donald Trump struck a deal with the Iran-backed group.
    


            The US deal, announced just hours after the Israeli military carried out major strikes against Yemen's international airport and other facilities in response to a Houthi attack on Israel's main airport, was a surprise to Israel, which was not informed in advance about the truce, an Israeli official told CNN earlier.
    


            According to Trump, the US would halt an ongoing military campaign against the Houthis in exchange for the group stopping its attacks on US interests in the region.
    


            The Houthis acknowledged the agreement but made it clear their attacks on Israel would continue. Senior Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said after the announcement that the agreement was “a victory that separates US support for the temporary entity (Israel) and a failure for Netanyahu.”

            On Wednesday, Netanyahu said, “Israel will defend itself by itself.” In the past, Israel has carried out joint strikes with the US against the Houthis, but two consecutive days of Israeli attacks on Yemen earlier this week were done alone. “If others join us—our American friends—all the better. If they don't, we will still defend ourselves on our own,” he said in a video posted on social media.
    


            Trump referred to the deal as capitulation from the Houthis on Tuesday but on Wednesday he said they had a “good outcome with the Houthis,” adding they had a “great capacity to withstand punishment” from repeated US strikes.
    


            “You could say there's a lot of bravery there,” Trump said at a swearing-in of his ambassador to China at the White House. “It was amazing what they took.”
    


            He added that the US would “honor their (Houthis') commitment” not to attack US warships or commercial vessels in the region.
    


            The US-Houthi truce sidelined the Israeli government, according to former US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.
    


            He noted that Netanyahu was left in the dark when the US began talks with Hamas in March and only found out about US nuclear talks with Iran when Trump made the announcement seated next to the prime minister in the Oval Office last month. The US-Houthi ceasefire is one more instance where Israel's concerns were a tertiary consideration for the White House, if at all, he said.
    


            Whether Houthi ballistic missile launches against Israel continue remains to be seen, but Ross told CNN that Israel does not appear to have been a major factor in the White House's thought process.

            “The Trump Administration thinks about America's interests,” said Ross.
    


            There has been no public criticism of the White House decision from Israeli officials. Netanyahu, who once openly criticized the Biden administration's requests and policies, is one of Trump's most vocal international supporters. Other members of the government have reserved their judgement as well, instead focusing on Israel's resolve against the Houthis.
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Thursday that “Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat and any enemy. This has been true in the face of many past challenges, and it will remain true in the future.”
    


            Trump designated the Houthi group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in the final days of his first term as president. President Joe Biden revoked that designation early in his presidency in 2021, and Trump designated it again in January.

Slovak Prime Minister Rober Fico has accused the government of fellow EU member-state Estonia of trying to thwart his visit to Moscow for the Victory Day parade on May 9. The event marks the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union.

Estonia closed its airspace to Fico's plane on Wednesday. The Baltic state's foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, claimed that “Russia is a country that launched and continues a war in Europe” and “participation in propaganda events organized by them should be ruled out” for EU representatives.

“Estonia informed us that it will not allow us to fly over its territory despite the fact that Slovakia has a year-round permit to use Estonian airspace for our government wing,” Fico said in a video-message on Facebook later in the day.

He described the actions by the Estonian government as “a deliberate attempt to thwart my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.”

The airspace closure is “extremely disruptive,” Fico said, adding that it could prevent him from taking part in the celebratory events in Moscow scheduled for Thursday evening.

According to the prime minister, the government in Bratislava is looking for an “alternative route” for him to be able to arrive in the Russian capital before the wreath-laying ceremony and the parade on Friday.

The vice speaker of the Russian parliament's upper chamber, Konstantin Kosachev, told Argumenty I Fakty newspaper on Thursday that the closure of the Estonian airspace for Fico was a “hostile” move by Tallinn aimed against Russia and its partners.

According to Kosachev, the Baltic nations have not come to terms with the results of the Second World War, and for them, “May 9 is not a day of victory, but a day of defeat.”

Earlier, Latvia and Lithuania denied their airspace to the plane of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who was also among the world leaders heading to the Victory Day parade. Vucic was forced to fly through Bulgaria, Türkiye, Azerbaijan and Georgia in order to make it to Moscow on Wednesday.

A dip in consumer confidence and broader uncertainty in the economy helped drive down first-quarter profits at Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR-T, its chief executive said.

“Through the first few months of 2025, we've been navigating a highly dynamic macro backdrop, one that's evolving differently across each of our key markets,” Josh Kobza told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Kobza said the company, which owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs, anticipated a softer first quarter and “believe that some of the macro noise may have driven further softness.”

The company seemed less worried about the impact of the Canada-U.S. tariff war on its cost structure.

Chief financial officer Sami Siddiqui said the vast majority of the costs of goods sold are localized. For the portion of its supply chain that isn't, the company is working with suppliers and franchisees to localize it.

“Based on what we know today, if our efforts pan out, we will see a (costs of goods sold) impact of around 100 basis points or less,” he told analysts.

The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, reported net income attributable to common shareholders of US$159-million or 49 cents US per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31.

The result was down from a profit of US$230-million or 72 cents US per diluted share in the same quarter last year.

On an adjusted basis, RBI said it earned 75 cents US per diluted share, up from an adjusted profit of 73 cents US per diluted share a year earlier.

Revenue for the company totalled US$2.11-billion for the quarter, up from US$1.74-billion.

Comparable sales at Tim Hortons dipped 0.1 per cent in the quarter, the company reported.

Kobza said comparable sales for Tims would've been 1.2 per cent when adjusted for last year's leap day.

Comparable sales fell 1.3 per cent at Burger King and four per cent at Popeyes.

While consumer sentiment has taken a hit, Kobza said the company noticed improved spending trends in April.

“We've seen that come back in the second quarter to date so far. We've seen a bit of an improvement in consumer confidence,” he said.

The launch of its new scrambled eggs boxes in partnership with Ryan Reynolds at Tim Hortons is “doing great,” Kobza said.

The coffee chain launched the new breakfast offerings earlier this week. The boxes developed by the Vancouver-born star of “Deadpool” come in bacon or sausage varieties and include two scrambled eggs, hash browns and chipotle sauce.

“We're feeling really good about the Tims business. It's been doing wonderful,” Kobza said.

Despite a slower start to the year, Kobza said the company is making solid progress on its business strategy.

“While our results were masked this quarter by the tougher comparison, the leap day impact and macro pressures, it is clear the underlying plan is working,” he said.

“We're confident we'll deliver at least eight per cent organic adjusted operating income growth in 2025.”

Russia is attempting an "unprecedented" interference campaign in Poland's presidential election, Digital Affairs Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on May 6, Reuters reported. 

Poland will hold presidential elections on May 18, with a potential runoff on June 1, as the country faces key debates over social policy, migration, and national security that could shape its political trajectory.

Speaking at a defense conference, Gawkowski said Russia is spreading disinformation and launching hybrid attacks on Polish critical infrastructure to paralyze normal state functions.

He said the attacks target water utilities, combined heat and power plants, power supply facilities, and public administration. The Russian cyber threat level in Poland has more than doubled compared to 2024.

"Today in Poland, during every minute of my speech, a dozen such incidents targeting critical infrastructure were recorded," Gawkowski said. 

Poland has emerged as one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, supplying military, humanitarian, and economic assistance. 

Moscow has also interfered in Romania's 2024 presidential election through cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and funding for far-right candidate Calin Georgescu.

The Polish election features candidates across the political spectrum, including Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and Poland 2050 leader Szymon Holownia. 

Some candidates have expressed views or associations perceived as pro-Russian. 

Far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen, while not explicitly pro-Russian, has ties to nationalist circles skeptical of Poland's pro-Western stance. Karol Nawrocki, backed by the ruling Law and Justice party, has faced criticism for statements perceived as sympathetic to Russia.

            Commanding a prime view of the River Danube, Hotel Gellért has long been a beacon of architectural splendor and pride in Budapest.
    


            Since its grand debut in 1918, this Art Nouveau landmark has hosted royals, artists and dignitaries, carving out a lasting place in the story of a city that rose to become one of Europe's most impressive capitals before enforced decline under decades of communism.
    


            The Gellért bore witness to all this turbulent history, but the years clearly took their toll. After decades of continuous operation, the Gellért closed in 2019, its opulence faded, and interiors worn.
    


            And for the past few years, although the beautiful — if also somewhat faded — spa next to the hotel has continued to draw in visitors as one of Budapest's top thermal bath houses, the Hotel Gellért has been shuttered. Its once-bustling lobby left cluttered with old  furniture, viewable only through dusty windows.
    


            Now, more than a century after it first opened, the iconic hotel is undergoing a full renaissance. Set to reopen in 2027 under the prestigious Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, the new Gellért promises to fuse its rich past with modern luxury.
    


            Designed by Hungarian architects Ármin Hegedűs, Artúr Sebestyén and Izidor Sterk, the hotel broke new ground when it opened with features far ahead of its time: in-room telephones, piped thermal water and even carbonated taps.
    


            Guests could pay in their native currency and enjoy the first airport transfer service in Hungary — small details that established big benchmarks in early 20th-century hospitality.
    


            The hotel's thermal baths were a huge draw, attracting clientele from near and far.
    


            By the 1930s, the hotel had become the heartbeat of Budapest's high society. Over the years, figures like the Maharaja of Kapurthala — one of India's last dynastic royal rulers — New York Mayor Jimmy Walker and Shah Reza Pahlavi of Iran passed through its storied halls.
    


            Former President Richard Nixon was a guest of the hotel, and Hollywood greats such as Jane Fonda sought privacy within its walls. Violinist Yehudi Menuhin found inspiration in its calm. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton famously stayed at the Gellért while filming in Budapest. Burton is said to have presented her with the famous Krupp diamond in the hotel.

            The Gellért's allure has even been echoed in cinema, with elements of Wes Anderson's “The Grand Budapest Hotel” seemingly modeled after its whimsical charm. Anderson's fictional hotel also shared a similar fate to the Gellért, with the glamor of its pre-war years fading in later life — in this case a grim 1970s Soviet-style functionality.
    


            Thankfully, the real-life hotel is on the brink of a renaissance. Recognizing its cultural significance, Hungarian private equity investors BDPST Group acquired the property in 2022, launching an ambitious restoration in October 2024. Guided by strict heritage preservation principles, the team behind the revival seeks to restore the hotel's place in the city.
    


            “We often think of historic buildings as part of our lives — but with the Gellért, I see it differently. I believe we are the ones who briefly become part of its life,” says Zoltán Kecskeméthy, managing director of BDPST Real Estate Development.
    


            For Kecskeméthy, the Gellért represents a national treasure — witness to wars, revolutions, and generations of Hungarian life. “It's not just a hotel,” he continues. “It's a symbol.”
    


            “We strive to make international guests feel they are walking into a story much bigger than themselves — and for locals to once again feel that this building is theirs. If we do our job well, we'll pass it on with even more meaning than we found it.”
    


            The restored hotel will offer 134 rooms, including 34 suites, crafted to honor tradition while meeting modern standards. Signature spaces such as the lobby, the Danube Room and the Gobelin Room are being meticulously restored using archival photographs and original blueprints.
    


            British design studio Alexander Waterworth Interiors is in charge of the interiors, while Hungarian firm Archikon Architects oversees the architectural work.

Budapest: The beautiful city with the darkest of pasts



            Recent demolition inside the Gobelin Hall has revealed hidden original features long obscured. Beneath layers of green adhesive paint, faded red decorative motifs have resurfaced. A coffered ceiling — once covered by a second Communist-era suspended ceiling — has been carefully uncovered, revealing the craftsmanship of the past. These discoveries are guiding the restoration team as they work to return the space to its 1918 splendor.
    


            While the hotel's bones are historic, the team renovating the hotel recognizes its soul is forward-looking.
    


            “We believe that innovation is part of the Gellért's DNA,” Kecskeméthy explains. “In its prime, the hotel was a pioneer in several aspects: certain guests arrived by hydroplane from Vienna. Every room had a telephone — a rarity at the time. Thermal water was piped directly into some rooms. Selected bathrooms even had carbonated water — these features made headlines internationally in an instant. And the spa featured a wave pool, decades ahead of its time.”
    


            That spirit continues today, with new additions such as a rooftop sky bar — a contemporary flourish in keeping with the hotel's original daring design. “We wish to channel the spirit of progress that made the Gellért exceptional to begin with,” he adds. “Respecting its history and traditions, we want it to be that again — in a 21st-century way.”
    


            The transformation reaches beyond brick and mortar. As Gábor Zsigmond, director-general of the Hungarian National Museum, notes, “The Gellért has always been a symbol of Budapest — a prominent venue for social and cultural life, luxury, healing and even gastronomy.”
    


            From interwar gala evenings to milestone diplomatic gatherings, the hotel has been a stage for Hungarian history. Architecturally, it remains one of the most distinctive examples of Hungarian Art Nouveau, layered with Oriental and modern flourishes that make it unlike any other in the city.
    


            “In the past, it was best known for its social events, luxury and illustrious visitors,” Zsigmond adds. “In the future, as part of the Mandarin Oriental chain, it is expected to continue emphasizing its historical and cultural heritage, complemented by modern luxury services, making it attractive to new generations as well.”

            The revival respects the idiosyncrasies of the past. While the historic Gellért Baths, adjacent to the hotel, will remain under city management, a new on-site spa will offer Mandarin Oriental's signature wellness experiences. The culinary offerings will blend past and present, with restaurants designed to delight both locals and international guests.
    


            Kecskeméthy is especially passionate about restoring the hotel's local relevance.
    


            “We want our restaurants to be places locals love, just how they were in the past. This hotel was once at the heart of Budapest's social life. We wish that feeling back.”
    


            The partnership with Mandarin Oriental is seen as key.
    


            “They don't impose a standard style. Instead, they cooperate, in order to create something unique,” says Kecskeméthy. “They care about the culture, the partners, and the place — and that's especially important when developing a spa concept in a hotel like this.”
    


            Every decision, from treatments to design, is made with longevity in mind. The renovation team is evaluating “the treatments, experiences, and design” that will feel both timeless when the hotel re-opens but also innovative in the years to come.
    


            As the Gellért prepares for its next chapter, those behind its revival are proud to re-imagine a cornerstone of Budapest's past for the future, ready to welcome the world once more with grace, grandeur and a touch of daring.

The 133 cardinal electors, including four from Poland, began deliberations behind closed doors on Wednesday afternoon to choose a successor to Pope Francis, who died last month.

The first vote on Wednesday evening also ended inconclusively, as black smoke rose from the chapel at around 9 p.m., disappointing the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square.

Thousands of faithful once again looked skyward on Thursday, awaiting the traditional smoke signal.

Black smoke means no candidate has secured the required two-thirds majority to become the next leader of the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.

Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals voiced hope that a new pontiff could be elected on Thursday or Friday to demonstrate unity following the often-divisive, 12-year papacy of Francis, according to a report by the Reuters news agency.

Voting will resume later on Thursday, with two additional rounds scheduled in the afternoon.

The conclave will continue until one cardinal secures at least 89 votes, Polish state news agency PAP reported.

Polish cardinal Konrad Krajewski, a close ally and charity envoy of Pope Francis, has been mentioned by some media outlets as a potential candidate.

Francis, who was elected in 2013 following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, died on April 21 at the age of 88.

He was the first pontiff from the Americas and the first Jesuit pope.

In making his new film Caught by the Tides, Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke used two decades of material to reflect on the political, economic and technological transformations in China over that period.X STREAM PICTURES

Jia Zhangke has earned his reputation as the most important Chinese filmmaker of this century by unblinkingly chronicling the sweeping changes in his country's society. He's depicted its economic upheavals, rapid urbanization and increased globalization – always through the bumpy psychological journeys of characters played by his muse (and wife), Zhao Tao.

In Caught by the Tides, which opens in select Canadian cinemas on May 9, Jia continues this exploration in a fascinating fashion: presenting edited footage he shot over the previous 20 years to create a three-party film about displaced lovers. As it leaps from 2001 to 2008 to 2023, the film allows us to witness not only the country, but Zhao herself, mature onscreen.

But unlike Richard Linklater's Boyhood, which similarly progresses through time but is otherwise relatively conventional, Jia has made a complex concoction that engages with the possibilities offered by digital cinema, blending documentary footage and outtakes from his previous features (mainly Unknown Pleasures, Still Life and Ash is Purest White). The film concludes with scenes shot during the COVID pandemic, complete with up-to-date smartphones, an elderly TikTok influencer and a scene-stealing robot. Whereas before Jia was capturing history, one could say with Caught by the Tides, he is writing it. 

Speaking at last year's Cannes, he modestly disavowed any role other than filmmaker. “I cannot really say that I'm a historian myself. I'm merely a director. But there are many ways to record and to capture, to retain histories; I'm using film as a medium to play my role in doing this.”

He said that using two decades of material allowed him to reflect on the political, economic and technological transformations over that period. “Society is going through an information overload. How can you understand what's going on now without having a long span of time, using an historical perspective to examine where we were and where we are now? Without that, we won't be able to see very clearly the challenges we are dealing with currently.”

Jia also described the organic way that the film took shape. “Starting in 2001 at the infant stage of DV [digital video] filmmaking, while I was shooting, I spontaneously used my camera to capture the spaces that I found very attractive, almost like documentary footage. At the time in China, it was a new era, a new millennium, and we were very excited for what's to come.”

But while shooting this documentary footage, he would sometimes include the actors he was working with on a feature film at the time. “I shot them wandering around or interacting in the cities that I was shooting at the time. And I had a working title: A Man with a Digital Camera. It's paying homage to Dziga Vertov, A Man with a Camera, but I didn't really have a plan.”

Not only does COVID appear in the film, it was the impetus for the project itself. Jia's productions were all on pause so he began looking at his old footage. “I realized that the camera captured things we thought we'd forgotten, but they're the things which made us what we are today.”

And then he began to wonder if it could be turned into a film. The result is a sweeping work with more music than dialogue, and a marvel of editing that leans heavily toward abstraction. “There's so much already embedded in the sounds and images that I thought it would become a distraction to create dialogue in a way that would make something too figurative, too concrete, too simple. It was very intentional to keep it more abstract and lead the audience to observe and somehow interpret the details however they want to.”

On the macro level, Jia's new film again revisits familiar political milestones – China's WTO entry, the Beijing Olympics bid, the Three Gorges Dam project – but, as always, looks at these moments through the lives of individuals swept up in the tides of history: Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) and Bin (Li Zhubin), who flit about on the margins of the northern coal mining city of Datong, in Jia's own Shanxi province, until Bin decides to try his luck elsewhere.

“Since this film has transformed itself from A Man with a Digital Camera to Caught by the Tides, I really wanted to start with something more macro,” he explains. “The tides that I'm trying to portray are firstly the stories of the generations born in the late seventies or early eighties, who experienced this idea of reforming people's desire for freedom, and having a better life going forward. I wanted to start with this collective portrait of a country and then go to the microlevel of how these two characters experience their journeys emotionally, romantically, against the backdrops of societal transformation.”

Zhao's astonishing performance ties the film together – often without any spoken lines. In the 2023 section, face obscured by an N95 mask, her eyes do all the talking. 

And for all the negative impacts of rapid social change – such as the displacement of a million people for the Three Gorges Dam project – Jia locates the positive in Qiaoqiao's personal development. “Besides her physical transformation, you also see her character's awakening of her female consciousness. In the beginning, she is young, naive, really thinking that her definition of personhood has to rely on her romantic relationship, so much so that she leaves Datong to look for Bin.”

Eventually, though, Jia says she learns to rely on herself. “By the end you see her as an independent, strong female trying to live her own truth, and that is the part of the new ‘Western' concept being introduced to China. That's the kind of growth I want to showcase and feature.”

Ultimately though, befitting a film that remixes his oeuvre, Caught by the Tides is as much about the man behind the digital camera. Jia sees that, too. 

“The footage also captures the emotions that I had throughout these different years of making and capturing these different images and materials. It really documents my own perspective, my own subjectivity.”

			Republican firebrand urges US president to ignore establishment GOP in an exclusive interview

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican firebrand and Trump insider, has a warning for her party and for her president: Forget why Americans elected you last year at your peril.

“It wasn't voting for more foreign wars like many neocons love to pursue here in Washington,” she told The Telegraph. “This was the American people really standing up and voting for President Trump's agenda, which is Maga, Make America Great Again, America First, and the adoption of the Make America Healthy Again plan.”

Ms Greene, one of the most high-profile Republican members of Congress, is on manoeuvres. Moderate Republicans are already aghast at the prospect of her running for the Senate or for governor in her home state of Georgia next year.

And during the past week she has used social media to fire a series of warning shots to the Trump administration that the party has lost touch with its base by wading further into wars in Ukraine or Yemen, and threatening military action in Iran.

In an exclusive interview in her huge congressional office on Capitol Hill, she unpacked exactly what she meant and described how Mr Trump needed to ignore the establishment Republicans, Wall Street billionaires and war hawks that were trying to get in his ear. With midterms looming next year, the party risks losing its grip on Congress.

“The American people are sick of it. We are fed up with it,' she said, reeling off examples from history such as the invasion of Iraq and its elusive weapons of mass destruction, and Afghanistan, where the justification changed over time from hunting Osama bin Laden to vague ideas about building democracy. “We've seen too many foreign wars.”

She has an uncanny feel for the base. Ms Greene was a familiar sight at Mr Trump's election rallies: clambering up on to the press riser to appear on the new constellation of Right-wing TV channels, or being name-checked by the candidate or being invited on stage.

“So I know exactly what made people stand in line for hours and days,” she said. “I know what made them scream and cheer. I know what made them cry, and I know how important that election was.

“Congress is not getting it done.”

The priority for the thousands of people packing airport lots or sports arenas was not attacking Yemen's Houthi movement, and keeping international shipping free from their attention, Ms Greene implores.

“I haven't seen a Houthi or a Hootie or, however you say it, I don't know what one looks like,” she said. “They aren't at Walmart, they're not in the Waffle House. They aren't robbing anybody that I've ever met.”

Nor were rally attendees demanding that Washington came to the defence of Ukraine's borders.

“Everybody was like, we don't want to pay for this,” she said. “We can't even find Ukraine on a map. This isn't affecting our lives. We've got bigger problems.

“At the time, our border was under an invasion every single day, and there was no country in the world coming to America's defence.”

Last week, Mr Trump secured a deal with Ukraine to set up an “economic partnership agreement,” giving Washington access to Kyiv's mineral resources.

Washington will gain access to Kyiv's mineral resources in return for setting up an investment fund.

The Trump administration sold the deal as a win for America after three years of pouring money and arms into Ukraine. But skeptics like Ms Greene say it amounts to an “empty promise” that will cost more American money.

“I come from the business world, there's a job cost you have to take into account. And there's going to be a job cost of going in and mining those rare earth minerals, and that's going to require a military presence,” she said. “Is this worth parking ourself in a country that we don't belong in, putting our troops in danger of some future escalation, between Ukraine and Russia for what we have, rare earth minerals here in our country, locked up on federal lands?”

Moreover, the leaked language of the deal, she added, talked about promoting “the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”.

“You know who that should be promised to? The American people,” she said. “Our safety should be guaranteed by our government with our tax dollars.”

Ms Greene, once a pariah in her party for promoting conspiracy theories, is now one of the most powerful of the president's supporters in the House of Representatives. She was credited this week with sinking a bipartisan bill that would have punished boycotts of Israel's government.

And she is in prime position to win her party's nomination for Senate or governor in Georgia's 2026 elections, possibilities she playfully embraced in the interview.

In short, hers is a voice worth listening to.

Last week Ms Greene published a lengthy post on X, in which she suggested the administration was losing its base.

“I represent the base and when I'm frustrated and upset over the direction of things, you better be clear, the base is not happy,” she wrote.

I represent the base and when I'm frustrated and upset over the direction of things, you better be clear, the base is not happy. I campaigned for no more foreign wars.And now we are supposedly on the verge of going to war with Iran.I don't think we should be bombing foreign…

Ms Greene's social media commentary has been reported as a schism with the president, a man twice propelled to power through his affinity with a type of voter who felt left behind by the country's political elite.

But as she laid out her analysis she insisted that Mr Trump was not her target. “There's no daylight between myself and the president,” she said.

Her real target is the same old establishment Republicans that stymied Mr Trump's first term, who clog up his phone trying to wangle invitations to the Oval Office or Mar-a-Lago.

“They're trying to push their agenda or try to sway his,” she said, describing how they thought they could wait out the president, and get back to business as usual in three-and-a-half years.

Mr Trump, she said, still knew what his supporters wanted and pointed to the downfall of his hawkish national security adviser last week.

“Mike Waltz got fired for a reason,” she said.

A strong showing in next year's midterms means sticking to the America First message of the 2024 election.

“If you're asking these people to go out and do it again and you don't deliver the agenda that he laid out on the campaign trail, how can Republicans ask for their votes?”

MOSCOW, May 5. /TASS/. The European countries invited to visit Kiev on May 9 almost completely coincide with the Hitler coalition, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement available to TASS.

The statement said that the hypocrisy of Europeans is aggravated by the plans of the leaders of some EU countries to accept "Zelensky's invitation to arrive in Kiev in order to take part in events to be held as an 'alternative' to the celebrations on May 9 in Moscow, as well as by the warnings of the head of European diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, to the member states and EU candidate countries in the case of their representatives' arrival to the celebrations in the Russian Federation, as the leaders of Slovakia and Serbia have already announced.

"The key role of Zelensky's regime at the 'gathering' as the bearer of 'the torch of freedom' against the background of the demonstrative honoring of the Ukrainian punishers of Hitler's Nachtigall Battalion and the SS Division Galicia, which participated in criminal actions on the territory of Slovakia, Serbia and Poland, may turn out to be a significant blow to the image of the European states, standing for 'European values.'"

"The list of the European countries invited to Kiev almost completely corresponds to the composition of Hitler's coalition, which fought against the USSR in the ranks of the Nazi Wehrmacht and SS divisions," the statement read.

It emphasized that the reaction to the gathering of commentators, dubbed as "a PR stunt by Brussels scoundrels," "the Day of the Losers" or "the Day of Nazi Descendants", was no coincidence.

The SVR stressed that Europe, despite realizing the threats to its own reputation, continues to adhere to revisionist approaches to the 80th anniversary of the Victory over Nazi Germany and indulge the adventurous initiatives of the neo-Nazi Kiev regime.

"This is how the decision of the German authorities not to allow the ambassadors of Russia and Belarus to participate in the commemorative events across the country should be interpreted," the statement read.

The SVR said that "the siege of Leningrad in 1941-1944, which, according to various data, led to the deaths from 600,000 to 1.5 million civilians from starvation and which was recognized by the Russian justice as an act of genocide, is the most obvious example of the atrocities committed by the ‘Eurofascist machine' in the past war. In addition to regular German and Finnish units, the "Blue Division" of Spanish volunteers, the Norwegian SS Legion, the "Nederland" Volunteer Legion and the Latvian SS Volunteer Legion, which was particularly cruel, took part in it. Its subdivisions were atrocious in the Pskov region, in Belarus and in Poland, where in February 1945 in the town of Podhaje, following the example of the Ukrainian Nazis in the Belarusian Khatyn, they, together with the Germans, burned alive the captured Polish soldiers of the 1st Tadeusz Ko·ciuszko Infantry Division."

They also noted that in November 1941, the Flemish SS Legion was deployed to the vicinity of Leningrad. "Another Belgian 28th Volunteer Grenadier Division "Wallonien" fought near Dnepropetrovsk. In the Velikiye Luki region, the Danish Waffen-SS Free Corps "Danmark" began its path defaming the reputation of Denmark. It was later incorporated into the German SS Panzer Division "Totenkopf". The Estonian SS Volunteer Legion formed the core of the 20th Estonian SS Division, which was established in October 1942 and committed atrocities in the Polotsk-Nevel-Idritsa-Sebezh region. It is worth noting that a total of some 60,000 of Kaja Kallas's compatriots served in the ranks of Hitler's Wehrmacht and SS troops. Croatian volunteer units fought on the Dnieper and near Mariupol, and the 13th SS Mountain Division "Handschar" (1st Croatian) was notorious for exterminating Serbs and Jews, as well as partisan detachments in the Balkans. The 21st SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Skanderbeg" (1st Albanian) became notorious for the same ‘feats' in the region," the statement said.

The SVR drew attention to the fact that Romania was one of the main allies of Nazi Germany, the number of Romanian troops on the Eastern Front counted almost 700,000 people by August 1942, more than 200,000 of them died at Stalingrad, Odessa, Sevastopol and in the Donbass. "Another important partner of the Nazis was Italy, whose more than 94,000 soldiers met their grim end in the area of Nikolayev, Poltava, Dnepropetrovsk, on the Don and at Stalingrad," the statement read.

Besides, the SVR noted that by agreement between Hitler and the French collaborationist government headed by Philippe Petain a legion of French volunteers was formed, which lost 75% of its personnel in the battles near Moscow in the winter of 1941. During the war, 23,136 Frenchmen were captured by the Soviets.

"Against this background, E. Macron's calls for a new ‘crusade campaign' against Russia sound rather hypocritical. And the recent scandal with the French ambassador to the Netherlands, with whom the leader of the House of Representatives of this country has discussed the possible partition of Belgium with Flanders ‘going' to Amsterdam and Wallonia - to Paris, completely spoils the reputation of the French president who accuses Moscow of the annexation of Ukrainian lands," the statement read.

"In the context of these shameful facts, the attention is being focused on the attempts of European liberal politicians to use deception and "hysteria" to present the Ukrainian conflict as an "existential struggle between good and evil", and the measures taken by Russia to ensure its national security - as preparations for an attack on NATO member states," the statement concluded.

FBI Director Kash Patel said during a May 7 Congressional hearing that the bureau needs more funding than the amount included in a budget proposal put forward by President Donald Trump, which would slash over half a billion dollars from the agency's budget.

During the House Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing, Patel was asked by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) about the $545 million in spending cuts to the FBI in Trump's “skinny budget” proposal for fiscal year 2026. Patel surprised DeLauro and other Democrats on the panel by expressing disagreement with the budget cuts put forward by the White House.

“The skinny budget is a proposal, and I'm working through the appropriations process to explain why we need more than what has been proposed,” Patel told DeLauro.

Current funding for the FBI sits at around $10.7 billion. Under Trump's proposal, that amount would dip to $10.2 billion.

Patel said he's working on increasing the budget beyond its current funding levels.

“So what do you need?” DeLauro asked. “You need $11.2 billion?

“Approximately,” Patel replied.

Patel's proposal would be nearly $1 billion dollars beyond the amount proposed by Trump.

The White House proposal “reflects the President's priority of reducing violent crime in American cities and protecting national security by getting FBI agents into the field by cutting FBI D.C. overhead and preserving existing law enforcement officers,” a statement accompanying the section on the FBI cuts said.

The statement said that the budget reflects “a new focus on counterintelligence and counterterrorism, while reducing non-law enforcement missions that do not align with the President's priorities.”

Some of these “non-law enforcement missions,” the White House said, included diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and redundant agencies that already effectively exist elsewhere.

During her questions to Patel, DeLauro said that spending cuts at the levels proposed would necessitate cuts, and asked Patel which positions would be cut as a result of the White House budget.

“At this time, we have not looked at who to cut. We are focusing our energies on how not to have them cut, by coming in here and highlighting to you that we can't do the mission on those 2011 budget levels,” Patel replied.

In a follow-up, Patel noted that the FBI had submitted an $11.1 billion budget request, in part in an effort to stave off any mass terminations.

“That's the proposed budget, not by the FBI. The proposed budget that I put forward is to cover us for $11.1 billion, which would not have us cut any positions,” he said.

DeLauro was thrown by the response as top federal officials usually align with the White House's plans at such hearings.

Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md.) also expressed surprise at Patel's handling of the hearing.

“Mr. Patel, I'll tell you. I didn't support your nomination or your confirmation, but I appreciate what you're saying here today, especially since you offered to work with us in trying to address a lot of these concerns,” Ivey said.

“I think I appreciate what you said about the budget issue because if you're saying you think you need more than the skinny budget's giving, I strongly agree,” he added.

In response to lawmakers, Patel indicated that increasing the agency's budget would be necessary to keep it running at full capacity on its law enforcement objectives.

Ultimately, Congress will determine the spending levels in the 2026 budget in coordination with the White House. The issue won't be due until Sept. 30, the day a continuing resolution currently keeping the government funded will expire.

In the interim, Patel will likely continue to make the case to the White House for increasing the agency's budget, though the outcome of the issue is uncertain.

Prior to his elevation to the directorship of the agency, Patel was a critic of the bureau's leadership in recent years.

Like Trump, Patel alleged weaponization within the agency against Republicans and conservatives.

Patel has also long emphasized that he believed the FBI could be redeemed through reforms and a commitment to focusing on serious crime.

Prior to the hearing, Patel announced in a press conference alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi that the government had arrested 205 suspected child sex predators in a five-day nationwide sweep.

“If you harm our children, you will be given no sanctuary,” Patel said at the press conference.

“There is no place we will not come to hunt you down. There is no place we will not look for you, and there is no cage we will not put you in, should you do harm to our children.”

NEW YORK, May 8. /TASS/. The ballistic missiles launched by North Korea on Thursday posed no immediate threat to the United States and its allied, the US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) said.

"We are aware of the DPRK's multiple ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely with the Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners," it said in a statement. "The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts. While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation."

The Yonhap news agency said earlier in the day, citing South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, that North Korea had launched several presumably short-range ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan from an area near the city of Wonsan in the southeast of the country.

The previous ballistic missile launch was conducted by North Korea on March 10 when South Korea and the United States began the Freedom Shield drills. Pyongyang then launched several missiles toward the Yellow Sea.

U.S. Army leaders fielded questions from lawmakers on May 7 over their latest plan to prepare the fighting force and streamline their processes for adopting new technology and weapons systems for future conflicts.

While the Army pursues innovation and readiness, lawmakers are wary of backing costly new programs that don't fit the force's needs or eliminating legacy programs.

Members of the House Appropriations Committee posed their questions and concerns about the initiative at a Wednesday oversight hearing.

The Army is seeking new warfighting capabilities, including a long-range missile program, new drone and counter-drone technologies, and a new and more easily upgraded version of the Abrams tank. They're also working to advance the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program, which is meant to succeed the Black Hawk helicopter.

The Army also wants to add artificial intelligence to its command and control systems.

Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) pressed the military leaders to consider canceled programs like the RAH-66 Comanche stealth attack helicopter and the troubled M10 Booker light tank program.

“These are the kinds of things that we have to avoid because we're in a resource-constrained environment,” Womack said.

“We're not proud of the outcome of the Booker, but what we are trying to do is not fall prey to sunk cost fallacy, where, because we have invested all of these dollars into this machine that turned out to be inadequate, we're going to keep purchasing it,” the Army Secretary said. “Instead, what we want to do is be completely transparent.”

House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa De Lauro (D-Conn.) questioned the Army's plans for its Black Hawk helicopters. She referred to the Black Hawk, which entered service in 1979, as “The Army's vertical lift platform par excellence” and noted that her state is a key manufacturing base for the program.

George said the Army will retire some older Black Hawk versions and consider new systems to fill the helicopter's many current mission roles.

De Lauro called their comments about the Black Hawk “very troubling.”

At another point in the hearing, Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) questioned whether a plan to downsize the Army's armored vehicle units and adopt more high-mobility formations would leave soldiers reliant on vehicles with less protective armor.

Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, former World Championship Wrestling president Eric Bischoff and Real American Freestyle COO Israel 'Izzy' Martinez join 'Fox & Friends' to announce the launch of their new freestyle wresting league.

Real American Freestyle announced the additions of a handful of superstar champion wrestlers to its roster on Thursday with the first event only months away.

David Carr, Kyle Dake, Trent Hidlay, Kyle Snyder and Aaron Brooks will participate in the unscripted wrestling series. The five men enter the league via SuckerPunch Entertainment, a sports management agency that specializes in combat sports.

"David, Kyle, Aaron, Trent, and Kyle represent the best of the best, and that's who we're targeting for Real American Freestyle," pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, the commissioner of Real American Freestyle, said in a news release. "Our goal is to give these athletes an opportunity to continue their careers, create a platform for greatness, and inspire a legacy that lasts

Carr was a two-time national champion at Iowa State as well as an under-20 world champion. Dake won a bronze medal at the Tokyo and Paris Olympics as well as a four-time national champion at Cornell.

Brooks was a four-time national champion at Penn State and won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics. Hidlay was a four-time All-American but was never able to win the national championship at N.C. State. He won the ACC title four times.

Snyder is known as "Captain America." The former Ohio State star was the youngest-ever athlete to win a world, NCAA and Olympic championship in the same year. He was also the first Olympic gold medalist to return to college. He served on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during President Donald Trump's first term.

Ben Askren, Kennedy Blades, Zahid Valencia were announced as the first wrestlers to join Real American Freestyle upon its launch.

Hogan and Eric Bischoff explained to Fox News Digital last month they are trying to make freestyle wrestling mainstream.

"It's a completely underserved sport, meaning there's no professional league that allows these amateurs to evolve like they would in any other sports and it's such an underserved market, and I know, having spent a little bit of time in amateur wrestling as a kid, these are unique athletes," Bischoff said.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addresses airport safety concerns and discusses his plan to improve an 'antiquated' travel infrastructure on 'The Story.'

President Donald Trump touted his administration's efforts to rebuild and modernize U.S. air traffic control, as the Department of Transportation rolled out its three-year plan to build a brand-new, "state-of-the-art" system to address critical safety needs, while blasting former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for having "no clue." 

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday unveiled the proposal, which would replace the current, antiquated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system and "enhance safety in the sky, reduce delays and unlock the future of air travel." 

AMERICANS DESERVE TO HAVE A 'STATE-OF-THE-ART' AIR TRAVEL SYSTEM: SEAN DUFFY

"Under President Trump, America is building again," Duffy said Thursday, upon rolling out the new proposal for a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a brand new, state-of-the-art air traffic control system." 

"Decades of neglect have left us with an outdated system that is showing its age," Duffy said, noting that building the new system "is an economic and national security necessity, and the time to fix it is now."

Under the new air traffic control system proposal, the FAA would replace infrastructure, including radar, software, hardware and telecommunications networks, to manage modern travel.

Officials say the current system was built "for the past," but the new proposal is to build a system "for the future." 

The plan would ensure facilities are equipped with better technologies to reduce outages, improve efficiency and reinforce safety. 

"We're going to be buying a brand-new, state of the art system that will cover the entire world," Trump said earlier Thursday. 

The plan consists of four infrastructure components: communications, surveillance, automation and facilities, according to the Transportation Department.

Officials plan, by 2028, to replace current telecommunications systems with new fiber, wireless and satellite technologies at more than 4,600 sites, 25,000 new radios and 475 new voice switches. By 2027, 618 radars will also be replaced.  

The plan also would address runway safety by increasing the number of airports with Surface Awareness Initiative to 200. Officials expect this to be complete by 2027.

The Transportation Department also proposed building six new air traffic control centers for the first time since the 1960s. It also proposes replacing 15 towers and 15 co-located TRACONs, or Terminal Radar Approach Controls, which are facilities that manage air traffic in the airspace surrounding busy airports. 

Officials also proposed the installation of new modern hardware and software for all air traffic facilities, which would create a common platform system throughout all towers, TRACONs and centers. 

The proposal also includes the deployment of additional technologies to the Caribbean and Alaska to provide accurate, real-time surveillance and weather information for air traffic control and pilots to ensure "safe and efficient flights for these critical locations." 

Officials stressed the need for a new air traffic control system, saying the FAA is grappling with a "rapidly growing, complex and demanding aviation sector," as commercial air travel returns to pre-COVID levels. Officials also pointed to novel challenges, including drones and advanced air mobility. 

Officials said the FAA's current systems "are showing their age," which leads to "delays and inefficiencies." 

The Department of Transportation stressed that the current National Airspace System is "safe," but stressed that maintaining safety is necessary. 

The proposal is based on a three-year framework to reinvest in the National Airspace System, and called for an "emergency supplemental funding increase."

"Modernization of the NAS can no longer take 10+ years to complete; it must be done now," the proposal states. "We need an immediate infusion of funding to address critical infrastructure needs." 

Duffy, on Thursday, said the project would take three to four years. 

"I need help, I can't do it by myself. And it's going to take the help of the Congress to make that happen," Duffy said. "We need all of the money up front." 

Duffy said requesting the money in "small tranches" over the course of several years would extend the project. 

"Politics change, leadership changes, presidents change, interest changes, and it never gets built," Duffy said. "So I'm going to ask the Congress for upfront appropriations to give us all the money. I'll come before the Congress every, every quarter and give them an update of how far we've built, how much money we've spent." 

Duffy added that if the Department of Transportation is not given the money, it would take "10 to 15 years to build this." 

"And by the time we get done with it, what we're going to build is already going to be old technology," Duffy said. "So we want to build this in three to four years, and we can do it with the help of Congress." 

A report issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in March shows that the Trump administration inherited an outdated FAA system from the Biden administration with "severe shortcomings" that resulted in dangerous travel conditions across the country.

After Trump's return to the White House, the GAO advised the administration that it had made nine recommendations to the FAA under the Biden administration that remain open, and that "urgent attention" is needed to remedy the safety issues left by Biden.

GAO said that under the Biden administration the FAA "did not prioritize or establish near-term plans to modernize unsustainable and critical systems."

The GAO's 2025 report said the 2023 national airspace prompted an operational risk assessment, which found that of the 138 air traffic control systems, "51 (37%) were deemed unsustainable by FAA and 54 (39%) were potentially unsustainable."

Trump, on Thursday, blasted the current "ancient infrastructure," saying that "it's buckling under the weight of more than a billion flying passengers a year and supporting hundreds of billions of dollars."  

"Pete Buttigieg, who was the secretary of transportation, had no clue what the problem was," Trump said. "He had no clue. Zero. Zero." 

Trump said Buttigieg "wants to run for president." 

"I don't think he's going to do too well," Trump said. "The federal government now pays $250 million annually just to keep up the old equipment and keep it running."

Meanwhile, Duffy on Thursday said the administration has assembled an "unprecedented coalition of support" from labor to industry, stressing that support is "indicative of just how important it is to this administration to get done what no one else could."  

Duffy added: "The American people are counting on us, and we won't let them down."

The rollout of the proposal comes just days after the FAA issued a ground delay for Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey due to staffing shortages, weather and construction.

"Our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce," an FAA statement said. "As Secretary Duffy has said, we must get the best safety technology in the hands of controllers as soon as possible."

It also comes after air traffic controller audio was made public from when radar and radio communications with planes were briefly lost at Newark Liberty International Airport on April 28. 

The April 28 outage lasted roughly 90 seconds. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association confirmed the incident to Fox News Digital, writing that the FAA's operation in Philadelphia had "temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them."

The Vatican announced the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in the history of the Catholic Church, shortly after white smoke began pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on Thursday.

Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti announced Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost's election as pope to the thousands of faithful who descended on St. Peter's Square after the 133 voting cardinals deliberated in the Sistine Chapel for roughly 24 hours.

Prevost, a 69-year-old Augustinian, appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica wearing the traditional red cape of the papacy — a cape that Pope Francis had chosen not to wear after his election in 2013.

His first words as pope were "Peace be with you," which he said in Italian, and delivered a message to the faithful building bridges, peace and dialogue "without fear." Prevost then switched to Spanish to recall his years as a missionary and later archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. He did not deliver any words in English.

Francis brought Prevost to the Vatican in 2023 to serve as the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world, one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church. As a result, Prevost had a prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals have.

Prevost was born on Sept. 14, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois. He is also a citizen of Peru, where he lived for years as a missionary and later as an archbishop.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Villanova University in 1977 before taking his solemn vows and studying theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in 1982.

VATICAN CITY — Jesus Christ has a new vicar, Rome has a new bishop, and the Universal Church has a new supreme pontiff. Cardinal Robert Prevost became the first-ever American pope, and he will be known as Pope Leo XIV.

White smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel chimney around 6:06 p.m. local time on Thursday, the signal that the 133 cardinals locked off to the outside world had come to a two-thirds majority agreement on either the fourth or fifth ballot. The cardinals had been in lockdown for one day and 24 minutes.

More than an hour later, the protodeacon of the College of Cardinals appeared before the masses gathered in St. Peter's Square to make an announcement: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus papam!” — in English, “I announce to you a great joy: We have a pope!”

An emotional Prevost, 69, emerged to greet the cheering crowd shortly after 7:24 p.m. Prevost, who was born in Chicago and is a graduate of Villanova University, is an Augustinian who spent years as a missionary and then archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. His first words as pope were, “Peace be with you,” before offering a message of peace and dialogue “without fear.” He wore the traditional red cape of the papacy, something Pope Francis had declined to wear in 2013.

It had been rumored that he emerged as an alternative pick from a voting bloc that had hoped to install Cardinal Luis Tagle from the Philippines. Tagle and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis, had been seen as early favorites for the position. But the election of a pope born in the United States had long been thought taboo, if not impossible, given the country's enormous geopolitical power.

President Donald Trump quickly posted his congratulations on Truth Social. 

“Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”

It ushers in a new era of the Catholic Church after the nearly 12-year reign of Francis.

If one wishes to consider what societal and cultural changes the new pope will need to confront, they need only look at the tens of thousands of people from all over the world gathered in St. Peter's Square during the conclave.

During the 2005 papal election, MySpace was the pinnacle of social media communications, vastly overshadowed by legacy media and traditional reporting on the event. By 2013, Facebook was peaking in relevance, and suddenly, it was common for Catholics and non-Catholics alike to remark on the conclave from the comfort of their homes.

WHAT COULD COME NEXT FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

This week, drones have been spotted occasionally flying around Vatican City. Tourists pulled out their phones and livestreamed their reactions from the square as the smoke appeared from the Sistine Chapel.

THE LEGACY OF POPE FRANCIS, 1936-2025

Well-edited “fancam” montages of users' favorite cardinals appeared on X, Instagram, and TikTok. Memes were made. Users bonded over their shared boredom, watching the chimney for smoke signals. Much of this online conclave fanaticism was coming from people who do not even believe in the Catholic faith.

In a world suffering from polarization and social isolation, the pomp and ritual of the conclave snatched the attention of communities around the world.

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — India fired attack drones into Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least two civilians, the Pakistani military said. India, meanwhile, accused its neighbor of attempting its own attack, as tensions soared between the nuclear-armed rivals.

India acknowledged that it targeted Pakistan's air defense system, and Islamabad said it shot down several of the drones. India said it “neutralized” Pakistan's attempts to hit military targets. It was not possible to verify all of the claims.

The exchanges came a day after Indian missiles struck several locations in Pakistan, killing 31 civilians, according to Pakistani officials. New Delhi said it was retaliating after gunmen killed more than two dozen people, mostly Hindu tourists, in India-controlled Kashmir last month. India accused Pakistan of being behind the assault. Islamabad denies that.




Both sides have also traded heavy fire across their frontier in disputed Kashmir, and Pakistan claimed it killed scores of Indian soldiers. There was no confirmation from India.

Late Thursday in Indian-controlled Kashmir, residents of the city of Jammu reported hearing explosions and sirens. 









Shesh Paul Vaid, the region's former director-general of police, said there was a complete blackout in Jammu following loud blasts. Vaid told The Associated Press that the Jammu Airport likely was under attack and that some of the 50 loud explosions he heard likely were because “our defense system is at work.”

Indian officials did not immediately comment. Jammu is close to the Line of Control, the de factor border that divides the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. 

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has vowed to avenge the deaths in India's missile strikes, raising fears that the two countries could be headed toward another all-out conflict. Leaders from both nations face mounting public pressure to show strength and seek revenge, and the heated rhetoric and competing claims could be a response to that pressure.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Thursday to the Pakistani prime minister and India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, urging both sides to de-escalate the situation, the U.S. State Department said. 

The relationship between countries has been shaped by conflict and mutual suspicion, most notably in their dispute over Kashmir. They have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region, which is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.

With tensions high, India evacuated thousands of people from villages near the highly militarized frontier in the region. Tens of thousands of people slept in shelters overnight, officials and residents said Thursday.

AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the latest tensions between India and Pakistan.

About 2,000 villagers also fled their homes in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

Mohammad Iftikhar boarded a vehicle with his family on Thursday as heavy rain lashed the region. “I am helplessly leaving my home for the safety of my children and wife,” he said.



India fired several Israeli-made Harop drones at Pakistan overnight and into Thursday afternoon, according to Pakistani army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, who said 29 were shot down. Two civilian were killed and another wounded when debris from a downed drone fell in Sindh province.

One drone damaged a military site near the city of Lahore and wounded four soldiers, and another fell in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital, according to Sharif. “The armed forces are neutralizing them as we speak,” he told state-run Pakistan Television.

In Lahore, local police official Mohammad Rizwan said a drone was downed near Walton Airport, an airfield in a residential area about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the border with India that also contains military installations.

India's Defense Ministry said its armed forces “targeted air defense radars and systems” in several places in Pakistan, including Lahore.



New Delhi, meanwhile, accused Pakistan of attempting “to engage a number of military targets” with missiles and drones along the Line of Control that divides Kashmir and elsewhere along their border. “The debris of these attacks in now being recovered from a number of locations,” it said.

At a news briefing, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday rejected India's claim that Islamabad carried out any attack in Indian Punjab. “These accusations are an attempt to incite anti-Pakistan sentiment among the Punjabi Sikh population in India,” he said.

Seated alongside Dar, the military spokesperson, Sharif said Pakistan shot down 29 Indian drones after they violated its airspace.

Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told parliament that so far Pakistan has not responded to India's missiles attacks, but there will be one. Later Thursday, Indian authorities ordered a night-time blackout in Punjab's Gurdaspur district, which borders with Pakistan.

The Harop drone, produced by Israel's IAI, is one of several in India's inventory, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance report.

According to IAI, the Harop combines the capabilities of a drone and a missile and can operate at long ranges.

The two sides have also exchanged heavy fire over the past day. 

Tarar said that the country's armed forces have killed 40 to 50 Indian soldiers in the exchanges along the Line of Control. India has not commented on that claim. Earlier, the army said one Indian soldier was killed by shelling Wednesday.

Tarar denied Indian accusations that Pakistan had fired missiles toward the Indian city of Amritsar, saying in fact an Indian drone fell in the city. Neither claim could be confirmed.

India's Foreign Ministry has said that 16 civilians were killed Wednesday during exchanges of fire across the de facto border. 

Pakistani officials said six people have been killed near highly militarized frontier in exchanges of fire over the past day.

Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri denied that New Delhi has targeted civilians and a key dam, as Pakistan has alleged. He, in turn, accused Pakistani forces of targeting civilians, including at a Sikh Temple in Kashmir, where he said three Sikhs were killed.

Flights remained suspended at over two dozen airports across northern and western regions in India, according to travel advisories by multiple airlines. Pakistan resumed flights nationwide after a suspension at four airports, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.

President Donald Trump announced a new framework Thursday for a bilateral trade deal with the United Kingdom, his first trade deal since launching an overarching tariff agenda last month.

White House officials previously told the Washington Examiner that the administration was close to agreeing to deals with a number of trading partners. The U.K. agreement, which will maintain a flat 10% tariff on the country, has yet to be finalized, with specific commitments being negotiated over the next several weeks. 

“They're relatively similar economies. The groundwork was always going to be a little bit easier than, say, China or something like that,” one White House aide said ahead of Thursday's announcement.

According to the president and British officials, Trump personally negotiated the deal with the U.K. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump was the “closer,” and Peter Mandelson, the British Ambassador to the U.S., credited Trump's “11th-hour intervention” with a phone call “demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected.”Trump also used the announcement to bat down critics who doubted his “Liberation Day” tariff regime and whether his 90-day pause on global tariffs would be enough time to cement new trade deals.“Everybody wants to make a deal with the United States,” Trump said. “So we're doing that … We're going to make fair deals. I'm just honored that this was the first one.”

Trump first announced the deal Thursday morning on Truth Social but was joined by members of his Cabinet and, by phone, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office just before lunch to speak on the agreement. The president opened by noting that the deal was being announced on May 8, the anniversary of the Allied Powers' World War II Victory over Nazi Germany.

“So there could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement. And it's beautiful weather out,” he remarked.

Trump told reporters that, while the exact details of the deal won't be finalized for several weeks, it will provide “millions of dollars of increased market access for American exports,” including agricultural products such as beef, ethanol, and industrial products.

Trump also claimed that the U.K. would drop some of its targeted trade barriers on American products and that the deal would include a “first of its kind” economic security agreement.

“We have a big economic security blanket, and that's very important, and we feel very, very comfortable with that, because it's been a great ally, truly one of our great allies,” Trump explained. “A lot of people say our greatest ally. I don't want to insult people by saying that, but I can say it's certainly one of our greatest right at the top, and they're the first one we're talking about.”

Starmer added that Thursday's announcement is a “real tribute” to the bond between the U.S. and the U.K.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick estimated that concessions from the U.K. would provide $5 billion in market opportunities for American exporters and claimed that the 10% tariff the president will maintain on the country will produce $6 billion in revenue.

“What we've shown is that it is time to change the way we do trade. People said we couldn't do a global tariff. We did a global tariff. They said no one would want to deal with us,” added U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer. “And here we are with the deal, with the [world's] sixth-largest economy. We've agreed to have fair and reciprocal trade, and we've done it in record time.”

Following his remarks, Trump did take issue with a reporter's question about the president's “conclusive” framing, given that there is “much more work still to do.”

“This is a very conclusive deal, but we think we can grow it even from that. But this is a maxed-out deal, not like you said it. You said it really incorrectly,” Trump retorted. “It's a very big deal right now, but I think it's going to grow, just of its own volition.” 

While the exact content of the deal is unknown, American Enterprise Institute foreign policy senior fellow Dalibor Rohac says real, serious, and comprehensive free trade agreements take years to negotiate.

“What the U.S.-U.K. agreement will likely involve [is] cuts to the absurd, arbitrary tariff rates imposed on April 2, in exchange for some minor British concessions, which may or may not be trade related,” Rohac told the Washington Examiner. “Basically a retreat from [the] protectionist policy baseline of the past month or so.”

Rohac described the deal as “a welcome development but not a groundbreaking one given that the administration is continuing to wage a senseless trade war against the rest of the world.” 

“It is good if the president is looking for a politically palatable off-ramp — but no one should be under the illusion that this is about actual trade liberalization or strengthening of the trans-Atlantic trade and economic links,” he said.

To that end, the European Union released a blueprint this week for how it plans to respond to Trump's tariffs as a bloc.

In a statement before the announcement, Trump said it was an “honor” to sign this first trade deal of his second term with the U.K.

“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Thursday's developments an “important step towards fair and reciprocal trade with our partners around the world.”

“Looking forward to many great deals [the Trump] administration will deliver for the American people,” he wrote in a statement on X.

Still, reports indicated that this first deal will have a limited scope and include commitments to future exchange of goods between the countries. U.K. officials told CNN that, despite the principal agreement, Trump will maintain the same 10% flat tariff he levied on all trade partners in April.

For the foreseeable future, the U.K. will also remain subject to the sectoral tariffs the president has raised in recent months, including a 25% rate for steel, aluminum, and automobiles. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he would roll out his long-teased tariffs on pharmaceutical products “over the next two weeks.” 

The Trump administration will look to face down that challenge this weekend. Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are traveling to Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend for meetings with European leaders and the first direct talks with trade emissaries from Beijing since Trump launched his tariff agenda.

When the president paused the reciprocal tariff rollout for 90 days in April, he raised the effective tariff rate on China to 145%. On Wednesday, Trump said he had no plans to lower that rate to foster productive negotiations, as Beijing requested.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump agreed on Thursday to cut tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal but played down the possibility of other nations getting similarly favorable terms on his import taxes, which are roiling the global economy.

Under the framework agreement, the United Kingdom is to buy more American beef and ethanol and streamline its customs process for goods from the United States. But Trump's baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place, and the Republican president suggested that even higher import taxes would be charged on other countries trying to reach deals with the U.S.

“That's a low number,” Trump said of the U.K.'s 10% tariff rate, adding that other countries would face higher tariff rates in their deals because the U.S. runs trade deficits with them and “in many cases they didn't treat us right.”

The announcement provided a political victory for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump's claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms. But it also could temper the expectations of the European Union and others negotiating with the U.S. in hopes of mutually slashing tariffs to zero.

The U.S. president talked up the framework to reporters in the Oval Office, although the fine print remains in flux despite his prior statements that a full agreement had been signed

“In the coming weeks, we'll have it all very conclusive,” Trump said.

The president said that the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., and streamline the processing of U.S. goods through customs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the baseline 10% tariffs would stay in place and that an unspecified British company would be announcing the purchase of $10 billion in aircraft from Boeing. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the outlines of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.

U.K. officials said that Trump's auto tariffs would go from 27.5% to 10% on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminum would go from 25% to zero. Starmer said Britain would preserve its health and safety standards on food products.

The U.K. government also said it would also reduce tariffs on 2,500 U.S. products such as olive oil, wine and sports equipment, bringing down the average tariff rate 1.8%.






Starmer, speaking over the phone to Trump while reporters listened in, stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries as the anniversary of the World War II victory in Europe was being commemorated.

“To be able to announce this great deal, on the same day 80 years forward, almost at the same hour,” Startmer said, “I think is incredibly important and makes this truly historic.”

Starmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and promoted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. He told the workers that “this is just the start,” saying “we are hammering out further details to reduce barriers to trade with the United States and across the world.”

While celebrating the planned deal, Trump talked up the U.S. economy's future despite worrisome signs of a possible slowdown and increase in inflation that could hurt most Americans' financial well-being and lead to layoffs.

The president said the public should buy into the stock market because the U.S. was about to go up like a “rocket ship,” even as he dismissed reports of fewer container ships docking in the U.S. and companies warning of price increases if the tariffs remain.

Trump said that fewer container ships arriving from China meant “we lose less money” from the trade deficit, even though the goods in those ships are used by U.S. manufacturers and sold by retailers in ways that can support jobs while holding down prices.

Asked about companies saying they would need to raise prices because of the tariffs, Trump said, “I think they're saying that just to try and negotiate deals with me.” Trump suggested that he might put 100% tariffs on Mattel toys if they don't relocate their factories to the United States. 

Trump has maintained that there is “virtually” no inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure has increased at 2.3% annually, slightly higher than the central bank's 2% target.

The U.S. president on Thursday said that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should cut the Fed's benchmark interest rates that are designed to manage inflation, saying that Powell was holding the Fed's rates at current levels instead of slashing them because “he's not in love with me.” Powell warned at a Wednesday news conference that the tariffs were creating uncertainty and the Fed could afford to wait until more data shows the impacts on the economy.

The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., making it a bit easier to find common ground at a time when Trump has staked his tariffs on eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the U.S.

No new deals have been reached with America's largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, sparking a confrontation between the world's two biggest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks.

The U.S. and the U.K. have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the U.S. as an incentive for Brexit. 

Negotiations started in 2020, during Trump's first term. But the talks made little progress under President Joe Biden, a Democrat and a critic of Brexit. Negotiations resumed after Trump returned to office in January and intensified in recent weeks.

The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.

Still, the U.S. is far more important for the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods. 

A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to strike. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade agreement after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the EU imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.

A bright spot in American family life.

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

We often hear about the isolation of contemporary American family life — the parents forced to go it alone, the kids stuck inside, the disappearing village. But there's another trend pushing American childhood in a more communal direction: Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kids' lives.

For starters, there's a demographic shift at play. As birth rates fall, the average number of grandchildren per grandparent has fallen as well. Susan Miller, a 67-year-old grandma in the Washington, DC, area, told me that while her mom had 13 granddaughters, she has four grandchildren. Having fewer grandkids “gives you more time with them,” she said.

Longer life expectancy also means kids actually get more years with their grandparents than they used to, even though people are having kids later in life, according to Ashton Verdery, a sociologist at Penn State University. These trends are “likely leading to deeper relationships between grandchildren and grandparents,” Verdery said.

Miller and her husband spend the summers in Minnesota with their grandkids, cooking, crafting, roughhousing, and putting on plays and puppet shows. Her 11-year-old granddaughter has “my husband really wrapped around her finger,” she said.

“He'll dress up,” Miller said. “He'll pretend to be a ballerina.”

Beyond participating in impromptu ballet performances, grandparents provide a host of benefits for kids. Across cultures, spending more time with grandmothers and grandfathers is linked to better educational and mental health outcomes, Verdery said. They can also offer kids a fresh perspective and sometimes come at child care with a more relaxed outlook than their stressed-out adult children, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University who has studied grandparents raising grandchildren.

But grandparents are also increasingly stepping in to plug holes in America's crumbling child care system, a role they're not always excited about filling. Experts say policymakers should embrace reforms that allow grandmothers and grandfathers to spend time with their grandkids because they want to — not because their families have no other choice. 

Close relationships between grandparents and grandchildren are far from new. “Intergenerational caregiving by grandparents, especially grandmothers, reaches back to the dawn of our species,” Tobi Adejumo, a doctoral candidate at the University of Colorado Denver who has studied grandparent care, told me. Multigenerational households have long been common in many communities, with Asian American, Black, and Latino families all more likely than white ones to have grandparents and grandkids under one roof. 

Still, the idea that grandparents used to provide a lot of child care isn't necessarily accurate, as Faith Hill reports at The Atlantic. In the early US, people often became grandparents while still raising their own young kids, limiting how much time they could spend with grandkids. 

But today, smaller families and later childbirth mean grandparents are less likely to still be actively parenting. While the falling birth rate may be bad news for older adults who want lots of grandkids to spoil (or for those who end up not having grandchildren at all), it also means grandmothers and grandfathers have more quality time to spend with each child. While white grandfathers born in 1880 had an average of nine grandchildren, grandpas born in 1960 have fewer than six. The drop for Black men has been even steeper, from around 11 to around six. 

The way grandparents and grandchildren relate to each other is also shifting. Older adults are more active than they once were, making them more able to play with their grandkids, said Donna Butts, executive director of Generations United, a nonprofit that works to connect children and older people. 

They're also richer — prior to the 1960s, older age groups had the highest rates of poverty, but now they have the highest rates of wealth, Verdery said. So not only can grandparents buy their grandkids presents, but they can also take them on outings and travel to visit them more easily. 

Meanwhile, skyrocketing child care costs and parents' increasingly demanding jobs have led to an increased need for help from grandma and grandpa, said Jennifer Utrata, a sociologist at the University of Puget Sound who studies grandparenting. More grandparents are responding to this need by providing child care on a regular basis, sometimes stepping in for multiple days per week, a phenomenon some call “intensive grandparenting.” 

While grandparent care has historically been more common in communities of color and immigrant communities, it's now on the rise among white, middle-class families, Utrata said. One 2023 poll found that more than 40 percent of working parents relied on their children's grandmother for child care, Hill reports.

Miller, the DC grandma, often cares for her grandchildren in the summer and on visits, including staying with them while their parents took a two-week trip. Her granddaughter becomes “like a child, almost” rather than a grandchild when her parents are away, Miller said. “She's comfortable with us.”

In addition to taking some pressure off parents, grandparents can have a big impact on kids' worldview, experts say. They can serve as role models but may also be less focused on work than parents in the middle of their careers, and more able to make kids the center of attention, Kelley said.

Spending time with grandparents can also transform a child's view of aging. People who have close relationships with grandparents will often say they “don't look at older people as icky” but rather as “vibrant,” Butts said.

Of course, grandparents can also offer high-quality, trusted care at a time when that's hard to come by. But regular caregiving can also be hard on grandparents, even if they're in good health. The demands of intensive grandparenting fall disproportionately on grandmothers, who can struggle to balance their own needs with those of their grandkids, Utrata said. 

Some grandparents retire early to help with grandchildren, which can be a financial strain, especially in low-income families, Adejumo said. Many grandparents pay for necessities like food and diapers while watching their grandkids, adding to the financial stress.

Vice President JD Vance has suggested that grandparents could “help out a little bit more” as a way of addressing the high cost of day care. But “we should not be foisting our child care challenges on an older generation,” Utrata said. Grandparents want to help out, but they want it to be a choice, not “the only way that their daughters are going to be able to work for pay.”

Affordable, accessible child care would help grandparents be involved in their grandkids' lives without pressure or exhaustion, Utrata said. Paid parental leave would also help since many grandparents are called in to be with babies when their parents have to return to work, Adejumo said.

In California and other states, grandparents can receive subsidies for taking care of grandchildren, but they are often too low to cover the real cost of care, Adejumo said. One sentiment she's heard a lot from grandparents: “I would really appreciate a living wage.” 

There's a growing recognition in American society that making sure parents are healthy and financially stable also benefits kids. Now, experts say, it's time to extend that understanding to grandparents, too. 

The Trump administration's tariffs are indeed hitting baby goods, with stroller manufacturer UPPABaby announcing price hikes. Trump, meanwhile, says all costs are down, except for “the thing you carry the babies around in.” He also says tariffs might mean American kids have “two dolls instead of 30.”

Federal grants for STEM education and mental health support in schools have been terminated, which advocates say compromises education and services for kids.

However, after a legal challenge and widespread criticism, the administration is no longer planning to eliminate all funding for Head Start in its proposed budget.

The trial of a Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old Black man ends in a mistrial, after the jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after a Michigan jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in the second-degree murder trial of a police officer who shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, in the back of the head following a traffic stop in 2022.

The result came at the start of the fourth day of deliberations and was a partial victory for Christopher Schurr, who still could face another trial. The killing of Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant and father of two, sparked weeks of protest in Grand Rapids, especially after the city's police chief released video of the confrontation. 

“It hurts my family, my wife. We are bleeding. We are in pain,” Lyoya's father, Peter Lyoya, said of the outcome, speaking through an interpreter. “We'll continue to fight until we get true justice for Patrick.”

Defense attorney Matthew Borgula said he talked to jurors and learned that most wanted to acquit Schurr.

“We cannot declare victory because there really is no winning here. A man died, and that is a very serious thing,” Borgula told reporters.

The mistrial occurred a day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted in the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop. His death was the first post-George Floyd case that revealed the limits of an unprecedented reckoning over police reform and racial injustice in Black America.




Schurr shot Lyoya while on top of the 26-year-old, who was facedown on the ground. Schurr told jurors he feared for his life after losing control of his Taser during an intense struggle across front yards in a residential neighborhood.

Videos were an important part of the trial and were repeatedly shown to the jury, including critical images recorded by a man who was with Lyoya. The struggle with the Taser, which fires electrically charged probes, was central to Schurr's defense. 

The 34-year-old stared straight ahead as the mistrial was declared. One spectator sitting near the Lyoya family loudly objected to the result as he left the courtroom. Few members of the general public were present compared to earlier in the trial.

Judge Christina Mims had urged the jurors to keep working after they said Tuesday that they were struggling to reach a consensus. Besides murder, they also could consider a lesser charge of manslaughter.

Lyoya's family wants a second trial. Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker said he would need more time to decide, adding that he won't “bow to public pressure” from supporters or critics.

“We thought we put a good case forward. Obviously the jury thought differently,” Becker said.

The shooting happened on April 4, 2022, when Schurr, who was patrolling alone, stopped a Nissan Altima for improper license plates and requested Lyoya's driver's license.

Body camera and dash camera footage showed Lyoya running and the officer tackling him. They struggled and the officer wasn't able to subdue Lyoya with a Taser, which Lyoya was able to grab. Schurr repeatedly demanded he stop resisting and drop the Taser, then fired one bullet into his head.

Schurr testified he was “running on fumes” after the fight and in great fear because a Taser can cause “excruciating pain.”

“I believed that if I hadn't done it at that time, I wasn't going to go home,” Schurr said of shooting Lyoya.

The prosecutor, however, argued that the Taser had already been deployed twice by Schurr and could only be used in a different mode if Lyoya had decided to turn it against the officer.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Becker said the jury was divided over the threat of the Taser and whether to focus on the exact moment of the shooting or the entirety of the encounter.

It's not known why Lyoya was trying to flee. Records show his driver's license was revoked at the time and there was an arrest warrant for him in a domestic violence case, though Schurr didn't know it. An autopsy revealed his blood-alcohol level was three times above the legal limit for driving.

Besides Schurr's account of that day, jurors heard from witnesses who were described as experts in the use of force. Some were Schurr's fellow officers at the Grand Rapids department who supported him.

Defense experts said the decision to use deadly force was justified because the exhausted officer could have been seriously injured if Lyoya had used the Taser. The prosecutor's experts, however, said Schurr had other choices, including simply letting the driver run.

Schurr, a Grand Rapids officer for seven years, was fired shortly after he was charged.

Lyoya's family has said they came to the U.S. to escape prolonged civil unrest in eastern Congo. Lyoya ultimately joined a list of other Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S. only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement, including Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima.

Follow:


            Universities across the country are scrambling to comply with President Donald Trump's anti-diversity push in an effort to hold on to hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants that fund critical medical research in areas such as cancer and maternal health.
    


            Last month, the Trump administration threatened to cancel medical research funds and to pull the accreditation for universities that have diversity and inclusion programs and that boycott Israeli companies.
    


            The latest moves broaden the anti-DEI mandate that Trump signed just hours into his second term, declaring diversity, equity and inclusion efforts discriminatory.
    


            The administration is locked in a legal battle with Harvard University that on Monday saw officials cut off future funding, escalating a total freeze on $2.2 billion in federal grants directed to Harvard.  The university has sued to unlock those funds, a fight that will likely be expensive, and take months to resolve.
    


            Most universities, particularly public and smaller institutions, lack the resources to take up the fight the way Harvard has. Dozens of schools across the country have publicly ended DEI programs and quietly taken down or rerouted websites referencing diversity and equity. Some have more openly acquiesced to the administration's demands, banning the use of certain words and phrases such as “equality,” “gender” and “White supremacy,” and laying off dozens of university staff.
    


            But those efforts haven't spared them from mass funding cuts.
    


            At Columbia University, some $250 million in health research grants remain in limbo even after the university made significant policy changes in late March to placate the administration. Leaders at Ohio State University, Vice President JD Vance's alma mater, acted early to end DEI programs and eliminate 16 staff positions in February, citing Trump's mandate and a state bill.
    


            But in March, the administration still canceled 10 grants to Ohio State, clawing back $2.4 million in planned spending on HPV and Covid-19 vaccine uptake and separate studies on substance use, suicide risk and PrEP access among different LGBTQ populations.
    


            Starting in February, the US National Institutes of Health terminated roughly 780 research grants that referenced equity, racial disparities, minority health, LGBTQ populations and Covid-19. The canceled grants spanned the country: Roughly 40% were to organizations in states Trump won in November, according to a KFF analysis.
    


            Those have included cuts to research seemingly squarely in line with the stated goals of the Trump administration and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., such as studies on autism diagnoses, chronic disease improvements and environmental exposures' intersection with health.
    


            Besides the immediate impact of frozen research and staff layoffs, scientists and public health experts worry about a chilling effect for health care studies overall. The NIH is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research, issuing roughly 60,000 grants a year to nearly 3,000 universities and hospitals. That accounts for more than 80% of the agency's current $48 billion annual budget, although the administration aims to slash that spending by a third next year.
    


            “People are frightened,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit group aimed at improving health care research. “One of the things that I've said to people is, you know, ‘how much can you do what you've been doing but just call it something else?'”
    


            That can be a tricky prospect for research on health care issues that disproportionately affect certain populations.
    


            For instance, the US reports persistently high rates of maternal and infant deaths compared with other high-income countries. There are stark disparities within those figures: Black women are three times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than White women.
    


            Researchers and state medical boards attribute those statistics to a range of factors including racial bias, health care access, underlying health conditions and socioeconomic status.
    


            That makes it extraordinary difficult to strip equity, race and risks for certain populations from questions about maternal health care and other research, experts say. Whether it's new mothers' postpartum survival, HIV prevention in LGBTQ populations or higher risk of aggressive breast cancer in Black women, many studies necessitate a focus on the people most affected, those experts say. The NIH cut research in all those areas.
    


            “There's real issues here that could be better understood and responded to, and lives could be saved, but only if you study them – and only if you understand what you're studying,” Zuckerman said.
    


            Beyond hundreds of grants citing words such as equity, disparities, gender, minority, LGBTQ populations or race, the NIH also canceled spending on Covid-19 outreach, vaccination and messaging.
    


            “HHS grants will only go to the most qualified applicants and will not adhere to ideological requirements or discriminatory quotas,” an HHS spokesperson said in response to questions about the canceled grants.
    


            The mass culling of NIH grants has even stoked concern among Republican leaders who argue that the US could slide in medical innovation and world leadership with the combined funding cuts, mass layoffs and agency shakeups.
    


            “We must not lose sight at what is truly at stake here,” Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said during a Senate Appropriations hearing last week. “If clinical trials are halted, research is stopped and laboratories are closed, effective treatments and cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, type 1 diabetes, childhood cancers and Duchenne muscular dystrophy will be delayed or not discovered at all.”
    


            In 2023, the NIH launched a $168 million initiative across 10 universities to improve maternal health care.
    


            In March, the agency canceled funding to two of them.
    


            Columbia University, one of the 10 maternal health centers in the mass NIH project, was one of the first schools ensnared in grant freezes and a public battle with the Trump administration.
    


            But the broad grant cancellations also caught the Morehouse School of Medicine, part of a historically Black university in Atlanta, Georgia, a state with some of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.
    


            Along with Georgia's Emory University, Morehouse stood up a program focused on improving pregnancy and postpartum care for Black women. There was $1.6 million remaining in the $2.9 million grant when the NIH cut funding. Morehouse School of Medicine President Valerie Montgomery Rice stood fast against anti-DEI efforts in February, telling local radio station WABE that “diversity, equity and inclusion, as it relates to health, is not a political term.”
    


            The medical school is still reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect research, spokesperson Jamille Bradfield told CNN in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”
    


            Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, a Democrat, told CNN in a statement that “This attack on Morehouse School of Medicine and maternal and postpartum health care for Black women is unacceptable and a disgrace” and saying that the administration must immediately restore funding.
    


            The canceled Morehouse and Columbia grants were far from the only ones in the 10-institute maternal health project that cited equity, disparity, race or cultural identity. Six included related terms in the grant name; all noted disparities and disproportionate risks among Black, Hispanic or indigenous women in the abstracts, or short descriptions of their projects.
    


            “The reason that we knew that we were having disparities in our maternal outcomes is because we started disaggregating the data. We started looking at the outcomes for Black women and White women and Hispanic women,” said one OB/GYN researcher focused on maternal mortality. “If we're not measuring it, we won't do anything to improve, because we won't know. It's almost like sticking our heads in the sand.”

            The researcher asked that their name not be used because they are affiliated with one of the still-funded maternal health programs and are fearful that research could be cut next. Although many of the remaining universities in the program have publicly ended their DEI programs, none feel safe, the person said.
    


            “I feel so helpless in this moment,” the researcher said. “There's no logical reason for the decisions being made. And that is scary. How do you fight that? What do you do?”
    


            Columbia OB/GYN expert Dr. Uma Reddy led the $4.6 million project to improve postpartum care by providing doulas to new mothers with mental health and cardiac complications after pregnancy – two of the top risks for maternal death in the country.
    


            “We got input from patients, from doulas, from communities,” Reddy told CNN. “We had just launched it at the first hospital and had recruited 21 participants when we were told that we had to stop everything.”
    


            Although the stalemate between the Trump administration and Columbia ended with university concessions in April, the maternal health grant has not been reinstated. Without NIH funding, there is little recourse, Reddy said.
    


            “You naturally first think about industry partnership, but they're not interested,” she said. “This is not a drug that can be marketed.”
    


            It's left Reddy and others in the maternal health care space confused and disheartened about the administration's goals.
    


            “This whole thing about making America healthy again, focusing on children – this actually does that,” Reddy said. “Because by having a healthy mother, you're going to have healthier children, healthier families, and you actually decrease costs of federally funded health care programs.”
    


            Americans overwhelmingly support programs to reduce maternal and infant mortality, according to a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll published last month. Only solutions to chronic diseases and research into infectious diseases garnered more support in the survey of both Republicans and Democrats.
    


            Dozens of the cancellations seemingly clash with Kennedy's vision for a healthier America with fewer chronic illnesses, researchers said. Those include at least two research projects aimed at autism, two focused on diabetes and others on cancer research in rural and underserved areas, and disparities in long-term chronic disease outcomes. In most cases, the grants explicitly mentioned a minority population, equity or disparities in care.
    


            Many of those researchers were years, and thousands to millions of dollars, into their projects: Some were ending soon anyway, and had just a fraction of their grants left to spend.
    


            For instance, in March, the administration cut the remaining funding for a $12 million University of Virginia study targeted at better diagnostic tools for women and nonbinary people diagnosed with autism later in life. There was roughly $218,000 left in the grant.
    


            The university ended its DEI programs that month with a Board of Visitors vote. “Every aspect of DEI is to be ripped out, shredded and terminated,” one of the board members told The Daily Progress.
    


            Ohio State's 10 canceled grants include one focused on substance use and associated chronic illnesses across sexual minorities in urban and rural areas. Of the nearly $173,000 grant, just $538.11 was left to be disbursed, according to federal data. The grant was cancelled on March 21; it was scheduled to end 10 days later.
    


            “We are grateful for the research support we receive from our federal partners as these investments literally save lives in Ohio and our nation,” OSU spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. “But we are closely monitoring and managing federal notifications that have impacted a number of our faculty and laboratories.”
    


            Johnson said that the university's review of DEI programming is ongoing, but that certain organizations such as the Frank W. Hale, Jr. Black Cultural Center will remain open.
    


            At the Tulane School of Medicine, the $16 million grant for the maternal health center was untouched in March funding cuts. However, the administration did axe the remaining funding, roughly $279,000, for a $4.2 million grant to study lupus progression in Black Americans. Tulane also lost funding for research on Covid-19 treatment in cancer patients.
    


            The medical school has since quietly removed and rerouted diversity pages on its website. The psychiatry department's page on equity, diversity and inclusion now says that the content is unavailable: “Some content is currently under review to ensure compliance with the latest federal guidelines and executive orders.”
    


            The president of Tulane University announced in a message to students and faculty on March 13 that it would transition its DEI program into a new “Office of Academic Excellence and Opportunity” to comply with federal law. Diversity pages now reroute to that site.
    


            “At stake here is the more than $320 million we receive annually in federal funding,” Tulane President Michael Fitts wrote in the message to students and faculty. Federal guidance and “drastic funding cuts” added fresh urgency to the change, he added.

LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.

The decision Thursday was widely expected, though there was an array of opinion on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, with two voting for a bigger half-point cut to 4%, and two voting to hold rates.

Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said inflationary pressures have continued to ease, paving the way for the fourth quarter-point rate cut since August.

“The past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be,” he said. “That's why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts.”

The decision is the first since President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the U.S.-China trade war persists.

Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, is expected to be lifted later Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outline details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. At the very least, they are expected to lower the tariff burden.

Bailey welcomed the prospect of a deal but said he didn't know the exact details.




However, he said that as a “very open economy,” with global connections, the British economy would still be affected by tariffs applied to other economies.

“I say that because I hope the UK agreement, if it is the case this afternoon, will be the first of many,” he said. “This will be good news all around, including the U.K. economy.”

The rate cut comes despite expectations that inflation will rise further above the bank's 2% target over coming months, from the current 2.6% as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, and firms passing on tax rises to consumers.

“While headline inflation is expected to rise in the near-term, we do not expect that to persist,” said Bailey, adding that it will be back around target in two years time.

Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the U.S. economy before making any moves.

Most economists think the Bank of England will continue to lower borrowing rates over the coming months, though admitted that the three-way split in the voting may complicate its messaging. 

“We still think the Bank will cut rates at least twice more later this year, but much like the Fed's message yesterday, U.K. policy makers will want to see more data on how tariffs and domestic tax increases are being digested by the economy before moving decisively” said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.

Former FBI investigator Bill Daly discusses reports that the Venezuelan government is allegedly working with Tren de Aragua to harm the United States on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

A suspected member of the notorious Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang was among five people arrested during a human smuggling bust in Texas, authorities said Wednesday.

The three suspects accused of human smuggling have been "circumventing Border Patrol checkpoints" and using known human smuggling routes to bring up to 15 people per week into the U.S., Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told reporters. He said two other individuals present during their arrests were accused of drug possession. 

The three suspects charged with human smuggling were identified as 24-year-old Jose Francisco Barriento Vega of Mexico, 49-year-old Mary Lou Tula and 44-year-old Alexis Segundo Olivo Fernandez of Venezuela. 

Vega is in the U.S. without documentation, Salazar said, while Tula is believed to be a U.S. citizen.

Fernandez is suspected of belonging to TdA, Salazar said, noting that certain tattoos and his ties to alleged human smuggling led to the suspicions.

Two other men, identified as 25-year-old Brandon Suarez and 19-year-old Bryan Suarez, happened to be present at the scene of an arrest and were arrested for drug possession, the sheriff said. Both men are U.S. citizens.

Salazar said a sixth individual, whom he said he was unable to publicly name at this point, is suspected of being a member of TdA. The individual was not arrested at the time of the briefing, though Salazar said he believed border authorities were "taking possession" of the suspect.

President Donald Trump said his first trade deal since implementing his sweeping tariff policies would be with the United Kingdom.

At the beginning of April, the president announced wide-ranging 10% tariffs and higher “Liberation Day” tariffs for dozens of countries, but he later placed a 90-day pause on the higher tariffs while negotiating new trade deals with the countries. Despite the pause being announced on April 9 with the promise of deals to come, Trump did not announce any finalized deals until Thursday.

Trump posted on Truth Social that a “full and comprehensive” agreement had been made with the U.K. He also said deals with other countries were in “serious stages of negotiations.”

“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come. Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!” Trump posted on Truth Social early Thursday morning.

The official announcement with the details of the deal is expected when Trump speaks at 10 a.m. Under Trump's original sweeping tariff plan, the U.K. was not subject to the higher rates and was instead tariffed the universal 10% rate on all its imports into the U.S. He also had blanket 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S.

Of the global reactions to Trump's tariffs, the U.K. had a fairly tame response publicly, instead discussing optimism about a “favorable” deal and not imposing retaliatory tariffs. Officials did stress that no options were off the table, but Trump and British officials had regularly said that talks were ongoing.

U.K. exports to the U.S. in 2024 amounted to roughly $261.8 billion, according to the U.K.'s Department for Business and Trade, with the top exported goods during that year being cars, pharmaceutical products, power generators, scientific instruments, and aircraft. Steel and aluminum are popular imports from the U.K. into the U.S. that were affected by tariffs.

The U.K. imported roughly $157.8 billion of products from the U.S. in 2024, with top products including crude oil, power generators, refined oil, pharmaceutical products, and aircraft. The U.S. was also the U.K.'s largest trading partner, representing 17.7% of U.K. trade in 2024.

Trump's first post-tariff trade deal is also with a country he has shown fondness toward. The president had a state visit to the U.K. in 2019, when he met with the then-monarch of the country, Queen Elizabeth II, with whom he joked he had “too much fun.”

At a White House meeting earlier this year, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer relayed an invitation from King Charles III to Trump for an “unprecedented” second state visit to the U.K.

“The answer is yes. On behalf of our wonderful first lady, Melania, and myself, the answer is yes, and we look forward to being there, and honoring the king, and honoring, really, your country,” Trump said in February when meeting with Starmer.

TRUMP SAYS HE WON'T DROP 145% CHINA TARIFFS TO ADVANCE NEGOTIATIONS, AS REQUESTED BY BEIJING

The pause is set to end on July 8, but during the pause, the blanket 10% tariff rates are still in effect. China was the only country exempted from the pause, with Trump slapping 145% tariffs on it because of its retaliatory response to his initial tariff rates.

On Wednesday, the president said he would not lower the high tariff rate for China to advance trade negotiations with the country. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend to discuss trade.

TRUMP: ‘THERE'S A LOT OF BRAVERY THERE': Relishing what he believes is a victory over the Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump lavished praise yesterday on the group that just two months ago his administration designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“You know, we hit them very hard. They had a great capacity to withstand punishment,” Trump said, referring to the more than 50 consecutive days of bombing carried out by U.S. forces. “They took tremendous punishment. And, you know, you could say there's a lot of bravery there, that it was amazing what they took.”

Trump said Tuesday that the Houthis had “capitulated,” announcing “they don't want to fight anymore.” However, since then, neither the White House, the State Department, nor the U.S. Central Command has released any formal statement outlining the precise terms of the agreement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's only public comment to date was to repost Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi's statement that, “In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.”

“The objective from Day One: ‘ensuring freedom of navigation,'” Hegsteth said. “PEACE THRU STRENGTH in action.” 

Trump insists he's got a deal. “We had a very good outcome with the Houthis, and we honor their word. I mean, they made a commitment,” he said yesterday. “We'll see what happens. But I think, you know, I believe that, hopefully, that's over with, and they'll leave the ships alone … they gave us their word that they wouldn't be shooting ships anymore, and we honor that.”

HOUTHI LEADER: THE U.S. ‘BACKED DOWN': Meanwhile in an interview with Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV, Mohammed Abdulsalam, the chief Houthi negotiator, rejected the capitulation characterization and insisted it was the U.S. that “backed down,” according to a report by the BBC.

“What changed is the American position, but our position remains firm,” said Abdulsalam, adding Houthis' support for the Palestinian people in Gaza “will not change” and calling Trump's remarks “a reflection of Washington's frustration after failing to protect Israeli ships and contain the fallout of its involvement.”

“The agreement does not include Israel in any way, shape or form,” Abdulsalam told Reuters in a separate interview, in which he portrayed the ceasefire as a response to the U.S. standing offer to end the bombing if the Houthis stopped threatening shipping in the region.

“As long as they announced the cessation (of U.S. strikes) and they are actually committed to that, our position was self-defence, so we will stop,” he said.

SHIPPERS STILL WARY: The comments — and the lack of specificity over whether, for example, Israeli ships will be targeted — has muddied the waters enough that international shipping companies are not rushing to resume their old trade routes.

“The top five container-shipping companies said they were assessing the deal announced Tuesday by President Trump but had no immediate plans to return to the area where the Houthis began targeting merchant ships in late 2023,” the Wall Street Journal reports this morning. 

With the Houthis still waging war against Israel, the Red Sea shipping lanes will remain risky, a Pentagon official conceded to the newspaper. “It will take some time before the southern Red Sea is safe, and we are working on it,” the official said. “It will also depend on how the Houthis behave.”

HAPPENING TODAY: President Trump was ALL CAPS posting last night on his Truth Social platform, touting what he called a “MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!”

The big reveal, set for 10 a.m., Trump confirmed this morning is a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first of what Trump hopes will be dozens of new deals signed with countries under pressure from punitive U.S. tariffs.

“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,” Trump wrote on Truth Social this morning. “Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!”

“A team of senior British trade negotiators landed in Washington on Wednesday as talks over a deal between the two countries gathered pace,” the Guardian newspaper reported, quoting one source as saying both sides are seeking “a quick deal” and with the U.K. hoping to get an agreement signed before a planned U.K.-EU summit on May 19.

HAPPY WW2 VICTORY DAY: As promised, President Trump, who doesn't think the U.S. gets enough credit for winning World War II, signed a proclamation declaring today, May 8, “Victory Day for World War II.”

“We won two World Wars, but we never took credit for it — Everyone else does!” Trump posted on Truth Social Monday night. “All over the World, the Allies are celebrating the Victory we had in World War II. The only Country that doesn't celebrate is the United States of America, and the Victory was only accomplished because of us.”

“We won the war, and we won it with the help of others. But everybody was celebrating but the United States of America,” Trump said yesterday at the swearing-in ceremony for David Perdue, the new U.S. ambassador to China. “All Americans should take pride in what these incredible patriots have achieved, so I just want to say Happy Victory Day to all.”

But, just because we're celebrating, don't think you're getting another federal holiday. “We're not going to have days off because we don't have enough days in the year. We have too many celebrations already,” Trump said.

While World War II officially ended at 11:01 p.m. on May 8, 1945, in Europe (because of the time difference, it was already May 9 in Moscow), for the U.S., the end of the war didn't come until after the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945, and the official signing of surrender documents on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on September 2, 1945.

CLOUDS OVER PUTIN'S PARADE: Both Russia and Ukraine celebrate May 9 as Victory Day over Nazi Germany, and this year Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to engineer a three day pause in attacks to accommodate his massive parade through Red Square, at which he is hosting world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But Ukraine, which said it could not honor a ceasefire, has accused Russia of already violating the ceasefire that technically took effect midnight yesterday (5 p.m. EDT), with attacks overnight but none so far this morning.

“Air raid sirens across Ukraine have sounded almost the entire day. Overnight, there was yet another Russian attack with missiles and drones,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last night. “And it is entirely fair that the Russian sky – the sky of the aggressor – is not calm either today. Our proposal for a halt to the strikes, for a ceasefire of at least 30 days, still stands – we are not withdrawing this proposal.”

Ukraine sent a wave of drones to attack Russian military targets late Tuesday and early Wednesday, which caused Russia to close more than a half-dozen airports in and around Moscow, causing travel chaos, including from some invited guests attending tomorrow's parade.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanintold the Moscow Times that Russian air defenses destroyed eight drones on Tuesday evening and nine early Wednesday morning, marking the third consecutive day of attacks targeting the capital.

VANCE: RUSSIA IS ‘ASKING FOR TOO MUCH': Speaking at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington, Vice President J.D. Vance sounded surprisingly sympathetic to Ukraine and seemed to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the failure to achieve a ceasefire in the more than three-year-old war in Ukraine.

“I'm not yet a pessimist on this,” Vance said. “The Ukrainians have said they would agree to a ceasefire — a 30-day ceasefire. We appreciate that…What the Russians have said is, ‘A 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interest.'”

“So, we've tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the, ‘What would the long-term settlement look like?'” Vance continued. “And there's a big gulf, predictably, between where the Russians and the Ukrainians are, and we think the next step in the negotiation is to try to close that gulf.”

“I wouldn't say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution,” Vance said. “What I would say is, right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they're asking for too much.”

Later, Trump was asked about Vance's comments, which he hadn't heard. Told by reporter Vance has said it earlier in the day, Trump said. “Well, it's possible that he's right. He may know some things that — because I've been dealing with this and some other things. But we are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made. I'm not happy about it. I'm not happy about it.”

“What the president has said is that he will walk away if he thinks he's not making progress,” Vance said. “The step that we would like to make right now is we would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the Social Security Administration undergoes massive changes and staffing cuts ushered in by the Trump administration, an increasing share of older Americans — particularly Democrats — aren't confident the benefit will be available to them, a poll shows.

The share of older Americans who are “not very” or “not at all” confident has risen somewhat since 2023, according to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in April. In the poll, about 3 in 10 U.S. adults age 60 or older are “not very” or “not at all” confident that Social Security benefits will be there for them when they need it, up from about 2 in 10 in an AP-NORC poll conducted in 2023.

That shift looks very different depending on older Americans' political party, though. There has been a substantial decrease in confidence among older Democrats. About half of Democrats age 60 or older are “not very” or “not at all confident” that Social Security will be there for them when they need it, a sizable swing from 2023, when only about 1 in 10 said they were “not very” or “not at all” confident.

Older Republicans, on the other hand, have become more confident that Social Security will be there for them. In contrast with older Democrats, about 6 in 10 Republicans age 60 or older are “extremely” or “very” confident that Social Security will be there when they need it, up from only about one-quarter who thought this in 2023.

The findings point to a partisan divide in the ongoing debate over the benefits program, which serves millions of people. When the 2023 poll was conducted, a Democratic president, Joe Biden, was in the White House, which may have contributed to older Democrats' confidence in the program. Now, large changes including mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs and office closures are being ushered in by Republican President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire adviser Elon Musk. A planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services was eventually walked back. 

Musk, who recently said he is preparing to wind down his role with the Trump administration, garnered widespread condemnation when, in March, he said on a podcast interview with Joe Rogan that the Social Security program is a “Ponzi scheme.”

Those comments have caused some voters to feel less confident in the future of the program. 

Dennis Riera, a 65-year-old Republican in Huntington Beach, California, says Musk's comments have made him feel very worried.

“It's really a shame that something that so many people have relied on for so many generations is being looked at as a Ponzi scheme,” Riera said. He has not yet retired from his job as a security official in the entertainment sector and doesn't know when he will be able to.

“What is their purpose in trying to undermine this institution?” he said.

But Linda Seck, a 78-year-old Republican and retired nurse from Saline Township in Michigan, says she's very confident about the future of Social Security.

“When I was in college, financial planners were telling us not to depend on Social Security, but here we are more than 50 years later and it's still going,” she said. 

Voters in recent weeks have flooded town halls to express their displeasure with the cuts, and both political parties expect Social Security to emerge as a key issue in next year's midterm elections. The upheaval has made Social Security a major focus of Democrats, including Biden, who said Trump has “taken a hatchet” to the program. 

Timothy Black, a 52-year-old Democrat who lives in San Diego, receives Social Security Disability Insurance payments to manage his chronic illness. He said his concern is not only for the retirement portion of Social Security but also for the agency's disability benefits arm.

“If anything happens to Social Security it would really impact me,” he said, listing the bills and expenses he has to pay to survive. “If SSDI doesn't keep up with the cost of living, my medical expenses are only going to grow and I could end up homeless.”

The Social Security Administration has for decades moved closer toward its go-broke date, when it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035, according to the 2024 Social Security and Medicare trustees report. 

Social Security would then only be able to pay 83% of benefits. A common misconception is that Social Security would be completely unable to pay benefits once it reaches its go-broke date. 

Roughly 72.5 million people, including retirees and children, receive Social Security benefits.

Older Americans are generally more confident that Social Security will be available to them than younger adults are, according to the poll. About half of U.S. adults under age 30 are “not very” or “not at all” confident that Social Security will be there for them, which is unchanged from 2023.

That skepticism transcends party loyalty. Younger Republicans aren't sure, on the whole, whether Social Security will be around to benefit them. Only about 2 in 10 Republicans under age 60 are “extremely” or “very” confident that Social Security will be available to them when they need it.

But younger people's confidence in Social Security was low when Biden was president, too. Steven Peters, a 42-year-old independent from White House, Tennessee, says for years he's heard warnings about the program's precarious finances. 

“I'm not confident at all that its going to be available,” he said. “I can't say its related to the current administration, though.”

The Senate confirmed a new SSA leader, Wall Street veteran Frank Bisignano, on Tuesday on a 53 to 47 vote. Bisignano was sworn in on Wednesday.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

Acting Columbia University President Claire Shipman said in a Wednesday video that anti-Israel protesters who took over the library violated university policies and will face disciplinary proceedings.

The acting president of Columbia University strongly denounced the occupation of the campus library on Wednesday after more than 100 anti-Israel agitators stormed it, resulting in dozens arrested and two university officers injured.

Claire Shipman issued a statement to the campus community on Wednesday night addressing the hours-long incident at Butler Library, which she described as "utterly unacceptable."

A mob of protesters showed up at the library Wednesday afternoon, as students were studying for finals, reportedly to rally support for detained Mahmoud Khalil, the accused ringleader of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia. They also continued to demand the university divest from Israel.

Two groups caused "substantial chaos" and damaged the campus building while occupying one of the library's main reading rooms and breaching the building's front door, Shipman said, adding that the disruption left the university with "no choice" but to call the NYPD for assistance.

"These actions not only represented a violation of University policies, but they also posed a serious risk to our students and campus safety," Shipman said, in part.

Columbia's acting president said she went to the library "as the events were unfolding" and was disappointed with what she saw, including one Columbia public safety officer being wheeled out on a gurney and another being treated for injuries.

Shipman also said the reading room at the library was "defaced and damaged in disturbing ways and with disturbing slogans."

"Violence and vandalism, hijacking a library—none of that has any place on our campus. These aren't Columbia's values," she said.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAYS OFF AROUND 180 STAFF AFTER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES GRANTS

Shipman, who took over in March following the resignation of the former president and the stepping down of the subsequent interim president, said this behavior will not be tolerated at Columbia.

"Let me be clear: Columbia unequivocally rejects antisemitism and all other forms of harassment and discrimination. And we certainly reject a group of students—and we don't yet know whether there were outsiders involved—closing down a library in the middle of the week before finals and forcing 900 students out of their study spaces, many leaving belongings behind," she said.

She also praised the response from professors, campus police and NYPD officers, describing their attempts to defuse the situation as "orderly, professional, and extremely limited, with a focus on the students who refused to leave the reading room."

Columbia is in the middle of its designated "study days" ahead of final examinations beginning on Friday, according to its academic calendar, and Shipman said she is "heartbroken and incensed" that this caused "unnecessary stress and danger" for those studying in the library.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY JANITORS SUE ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ACCUSED OF HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE IN CAMPUS BUILDING

"I have seen how much our community wants to take back our narrative, to do what they came to Columbia to do—learn, thrive, and grow—not take over a library," she said. "Moreover, I am deeply disturbed at the idea that, at a moment when our international community feels particularly vulnerable, a small group of students would choose to make our institution a target."

Shipman said the "clear line between legitimate protest and actions that endanger others and disrupt" the university's operations was crossed on Wednesday and she is confident "disciplinary proceedings will reflect the severity of the actions."

The protest prompted a response from NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who said the city stands with Jewish New Yorkers, which includes the Jewish student population at Columbia.

"To those protesting on campus who do not attend Columbia: exit the campus immediately or you will be arrested," Adams said. We will not tolerate hate or violence in any form in our city."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News that the agency was monitoring arrests made at the protest and said all suspects were to be fingerprinted to determine if any are noncitizens.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated that sentiment late Wednesday night, writing on X, "We are reviewing the visa status of the trespassers and vandals who took over Columbia University's library. Pro-Hamas thugs are no longer welcome in our great nation."

            President Donald Trump is laser-focused on securing high-value critical minerals for the United States, whether through pushing to buy Greenland or demanding a share of Ukraine's resources. But there's another — and possibly far more dangerous — place where he now seeks them: the ocean depths.
    


            Thousands of feet underwater lie potentially lucrative treasure troves of copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, manganese and other minerals that are vital for computer chips, modern batteries and other products needed for the clean energy transition.
    


            There is currently no commercial deep-sea mining happening anywhere in the world, though companies have been pushing for years. They appear to have found a new champion in Trump. In April, he signed an executive order to kickstart a commercial deep-sea mining industry.
    


            It's hugely controversial.
    


            The deep ocean is one of the planet's last wild frontiers and its least-known environment — more than 99% of remains a mystery to humans. Scientists warn mining here could cause irreparable damage to species and ecosystems that have evolved over millions of years and host a rich tapestry of life.
    


            Deep-sea mining targets three very different types of ecosystems.
    


            Most interest is in polymetallic modules: small, potato-sized rocks scattered across parts of the deep ocean floor. These form over millions of years around a piece of matter, such as a shark's tooth or shell fragment, and contain metals including copper, nickel, cobalt and traces of rare earths.
    


            Hydrothermal vents are another focus. These are like chimneys pushing out superheated, mineral-rich water from deep beneath the Earth, which solidifies into deposits rich in metals such as copper, zinc and sometimes gold and silver.
    


            Then there are seamounts, underwater mountains that rise thousands of feet above the seabed and have cobalt-rich crusts.
    


            These minerals are found in oceans across the planet, but the focus of many mining companies is on an expanse of Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which spans more than 3,000 miles and is around 12,000 to 18,000 feet deep.
    


            The International Seabed Authority, a UN-backed regulator, has issued 30 exploration licenses to companies, the majority of those in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.
    


            Companies are still developing mining vehicles, but one method would be to use large tractor-sized machines that drive across the sea floor plucking up nodules and transporting them via long pipes to a ship on the surface. Here they would be washed and separated, with sediment pumped back into the ocean.
    


            Hydrothermal vents and seamounts are likely to be more tricky to mine. Plans include using remotely-operated vehicles to scrape up and pulverize mineral deposits before sending the mixture up to the surface.
    


            Whichever techniques are used, mining thousands of feet underwater, where temperatures are very low and the pressure is extreme, is likely to be immensely challenging.
    


            The inky ocean depths are often assumed to be barren, but this is a myth, said Adrian Glover, a deep-sea ocean scientist at the UK's Natural History Museum. They are “actually surprisingly rich in biodiversity,” he told CNN.
    


            Hydrothermal vents, one of the most extreme habitats on Earth, teem with life. There are yeti crabs, nicknamed Hoff crabs for a resemblance to the hairy-chested actor David Hasselhoff; scaly-foot snails covered in iron armor; and colonies of giant tube worms that can grow more than 6 feet long.
    


            Nodules provide a habitat to species including sponges, soft corals and sea anemones and the muddy abyssal plains are home to sea cucumbers, starfish, anemones, crustaceans, worms and sponges.
    


            Scientists still have a lot to learn. Around 90% of species in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone alone are unknown to science, according to a 2023 study.
    


            There are huge uncertainties given how little is known about the ocean depths, but scientists say impacts could be vast, including an irreversible loss of biodiversity.
    


            Research suggests sediment plumes kicked up by mining could harm marine life, as could the mud pumped back into the ocean from support ships.
    


            Light and noise are other concerns. One study found sounds from a deep-sea mine could reverberate through the ocean for more than 300 miles, disturbing whales, dolphins and other creatures.
    


            Longer term, there are fears that damage to deep-sea landscapes could have ripple effects through the ocean and potentially affect fisheries.
    


            Mining could even affect the “dark oxygen” scientists recently discovered is produced by nodules, which they say could help them unravel the origins of life.
    


            It's unclear how fast mined areas would recover.
    


            A group of scientists recently studied a strip of seabed southeast of Hawaii where a small scale experiment to mine nodules took place 44 years ago. There were still deep tread marks in the ocean floor, left by the machines. “It looks like the tracks could have been made yesterday,” said Glover, who was part of the project.
    


            The area showed clear long-term changes from mining, although there were “some of the first signs of biological recovery,” the researchers said.
    


            Deep-sea mining companies say many concerns are overblown and contradict their commissioned science. “The notion that we don't know enough about this environment is blatantly wrong,” said Gerard Barron, the CEO of The Metals Company, a high-profile Canadian deep-sea mining company.
    


            “We're not saying there's zero impact. We're just saying the impact is a fraction compared to the known set of impacts that are happening today on land,” he told CNN.
    


            Land-based mining is beset with environmental and human rights problems, including child labor and rainforest destruction.
    


            Some research, however, suggests ocean mining will not stop or reduce land-based mining, but rather open a new frontier.
    


            “Starting a whole new extractive industry that scientists have already said will cause irreversible biodiversity loss is not a good idea,” said Louisa Casson, global project leader for Greenpeace's campaign to stop deep-sea mining.
    


            While the appetite for many critical minerals is soaring, some experts say demand can be brought down by recycling, reusing and reducing consumption.
    


            Technology is also changing with efforts to develop batteries that eliminate the need for cobalt and nickel.
    


            Companies including BMW and Samsung have even backed calls for a pause on deep-sea mining.
    


            Some have questioned the economic case for the industry given the challenges of operating machinery in such extreme environments and the swings of mineral markets. “Deep-sea mining is a high-risk, low-reward gamble with no credible economic case,” Democratic Oregon Rep. Maxine Dexter posted on X this week.
    


            A spokesperson for The Metals Company said ocean mining technology was developed and tested in the 1970s “by industrial titans” and has been “honed for lightest impact.” The economics “beat most land-based mines,” the spokesperson told CNN.
    


            This is the million-dollar question.
    


            Any country can mine its own water. Norway voted last year to open part of its Arctic seabed to deep-sea mining but has since paused the project.
    


            In international waters, the process is governed by the International Seabed Authority, which has been trying to develop a mining code since 2021 but has yet to formalize one. More than 30 countries, including Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom, have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its impacts.
    


            As negotiations rumble on, mining companies have grown impatient. Trump's executive order offers a way to bypass the international process and start extracting.
    


            A US deep-sea mining industry is essential to counter China's aggressive pursuit of ocean minerals, a White House spokesperson said, and domestic laws would ensure strong environmental protection standards. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which will be responsible for issuing licenses, told CNN there would be “a multi-step process before any exploration activities or commercial recovery can occur.”
    


            How long that process will take may soon become clear. The Metals Company submitted an application to NOAA at the end of April to mine in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.
    


            The International Seabed Authority sharply criticized Trump's order. Any unilateral action to mine international water “sets a dangerous precedent that could destabilize the entire system of global ocean governance,” said Leticia Reis de Carvalho, the ISA's secretary general.
    


            Environmental groups have also been heavily critical.
    


            “Authorizing deep-sea mining outside international law is like lighting a match in a room full of dynamite — it threatens ecosystems, global cooperation, and US credibility,” said Arlo Hemphill, project lead on Greenpeace USA's campaign to stop deep-sea mining.
    


            The year is shaping up to be crucial for determining the future of deep-sea mining. If and when companies will be able to get machines on the seafloor is far from clear. “Every government that has tried to start deep-sea mining has failed,” said Greenpeace's Casson.
    


            “In the end, it's a political decision as to whether the risk is worth taking,” Glover said.

    Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            Crashing waves, glistening sea spray, a calm expanse of deep blue. These are the images that open “Ocean with David Attenborough,” the veteran broadcaster's latest film. After decades of sharing stories of life on our planet, he tells viewers that: “The most important place on Earth is not on land but at sea.”
    


            The film — released in cinemas today and available to stream globally on Disney+ and Hulu in June — coincides with Attenborough's 99th birthday, and describes how the ocean has changed during his lifetime.
    


            “Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man,” he says in a press release. “In this film, we share those wonderful discoveries, uncover why our ocean is in such poor health, and, perhaps most importantly, show how it can be restored to health.”
    


            The feature-length documentary takes viewers on a journey to coral reefs, kelp forests and towering seamounts, showcasing the wonders of the underwater world and the vital role the ocean plays in defending Earth against climate catastrophe as its largest carbon sink.
    


            But the ocean also faces terrible threats. The film was shot as the planet experienced an extreme marine heatwave and shows the effects of the resulting mass coral bleaching: expansive graveyards of bright white coral, devoid of sea life.
    


            Extraordinary footage shot off the coast of Britain and in the Mediterranean Sea shows the scale of destruction from industrial fishing. Bottom trawlers are filmed towing nets with a heavy chain along the seafloor, indiscriminately catching creatures in their path and churning up dense clouds of carbon-rich sediment.
    


            “The trails of destruction can be seen from space,” Attenborough narrates, adding that not only does the process release vast amounts of carbon dioxide, the majority of the catch is discarded, since the fishers are usually only targeting one species. “It is hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,” he says.

            The practice is not only devastating entire marine ecosystems but coastal communities that depend on fish for their livelihoods. Industrial fishing vessels — what Attenborough calls “vast factories at sea” — hoover up everything and leave little behind for locals. It is a form of “modern day colonialism,” he says, and has even reached the depths of Antarctica.
    


            Yet, despite all this, Attenborough has hope. He points to the ocean's amazing ability to recover when it is given space to do so. In the Pacific Ocean nations of Kiribati and Palau, and the Indonesian province of West Papua, coral reefs that have suffered mass bleaching events are alive once more, and areas where fishing has been banned, such as small marine reserves in the Mediterranean, have bounced back to life. The film highlights Papahānaumokuākea, the world's largest no-fishing zone, off the coast of Hawaii, where native fishers are reporting bountiful fish stocks, as populations recover and spill over into neighboring waters, and where seabird populations like the albatross have thrived as a result of the restrictions.
    


            Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic's Pristine Seas program and scientific advisor to the film, has seen the ocean's remarkable recovery firsthand, diving in the Southern Line Islands, where half of the corals died after marine heat waves a decade ago. “After four years, they had fully recovered, because the fish were there and the fish helped to clean the reef so the corals could come back,” he tells CNN.
    


            Sala shares Attenborough's optimism that the ocean could be saved if we act now. There are three main threats, he says: global warming, plastic pollution and overfishing. The latter is the easiest to fix: “If we stopped fishing in one place today, less fish will die; the system will start to recover the day after.”
    


            The film's overriding message is not that all fishing is bad, but that priority areas must be fully protected with clear no-take zones. Less than 3% of the ocean is fully protected, according to the Marine Conservation Institute — this needs to increase, says Attenborough.
    


            “Success is possible,” he adds, as he reminds viewers that action like this has happened on a global scale before. Whales were hunted to the brink of extinction, but a ban on commercial whaling in 1986 has seen many populations make a comeback.
    


            Sala believes that Attenborough's movie could help turn the tide: “(The message that) we are draining life out of the ocean, but if we protect at least a third, we can bring it back to life: I have been saying it for years, scientists have been saying it for years, but now that he says it, people are going to listen.”

            What's more, the shocking images from the film illustrate the damage industrial fishing can do to the ocean. “This has been out of sight, out of mind for too long,” says Sala. “We have been talking to the brains of decision makers, now we have the images that will speak directly to their guts and their hearts.”
    


            The film is being released ahead of June's United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, France, in the hope that it might influence governments to take action. Member states have already agreed in principle to protect 30% of the world's oceans, but implementation has been slow. In “Ocean” Attenborough calls for more urgency.
    


            “This could be the moment of change,” he says. “Nearly every country on Earth has just agreed on paper to achieve this bare minimum and protect a third of the ocean. Together, we now face the challenge of making it happen.”

Historic St. Mary's City, a Maryland-based museum and archaeological organization, is opening up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic Church called the Brick Chapel on April 12. Henry Miller, Ph.D., shared the details.

A cache of gold items and other pieces of treasure came to light recently – and officials are still perplexed by the trove's origin.

In a statement shared with Fox News Digital, the Museum of East Bohemia in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic, said that a "depot of gold coins, jewelry and tobacco boxes" had been found.

Weighing a hefty 15 pounds, the cache was found by two hikers who handed the treasure over to the museum in February.

"[T]wo finders discovered two boxes in an artificially created stone wall on the edge of a now non-existent field overgrown with forest during a tourist walk on the southwestern slope of Zvičina Hill," the museum said in a press release translated from Czech to English.

Pictures show the stunning finds consisting of various gold rings, bars and coins, though the gold tarnished with age.

In total, 598 coins were found. The container holding the gold items was "divided into 11 columns and wrapped in black fabric," according to the museum. 

"In a metal box found about a meter away, objects made of yellow metal were stored — 16 tobacco boxes, 10 bracelets, a bag made of fine wire mesh, a comb, a chain with a key, and a powder box," the museum also said. 

"This find is notable for the unusually large weight of precious metal."

In a statement, Museum of East Bohemia archaeologist Miroslav Novák called the discovery a "unique find."

"Storing valuable objects in the ground as treasures, known as depots, has been common practice since prehistoric times," the expert said. 

Novák added, "Initially, religious motives were more common, but later it was property stored during uncertain times with the intention of retrieving it later. This find is notable for the unusually large weight of precious metal."

Nearly 600 gold coins were found in the cache dating back as early as 1808. (Muzeum východních Čech v Hradci Králové)

What makes the discovery so unusual is how relatively young it is. 

The earliest coins date to 1808. Museum of East Bohemia coin specialist Vojtěch Brádle said that the treasure had been buried "for just over 100 years."

"Based on the dates stamped on them, the coins range from 1808 to 1915," the numismatist said. "However, the year 1915 is not decisive for determining when the depot was placed there."

He noted that the coins must have been placed after World War I, based on certain marks.

The other finds consisted of "16 tobacco boxes, 10 bracelets, a bag made of fine wire mesh [and] a comb," plus a chain with a key and a powder box. (Muzeum východních Čech v Hradci Králové)

"These marks were stamped on coins in the territory of former Yugoslavia during the 1920s and 1930s," Brádle noted.

"Within the context of domestic finds, this collection is very specific, as most of it consists of coins of French origin, and besides Austrian-Hungarian coins, it also includes Belgian and Ottoman coins."

He added, "Conversely, German and Czechoslovak coins are entirely absent."

The treasure trove presents "possibilities for studying historical archival documents," according to Czech officials. (Muzeum východních Čech v Hradci Králové)

The museum concluded its announcement by noting the opportunities that the relatively recent treasure trove presents.

"[It] presents much broader, albeit more complex, possibilities for studying historical archival documents," the statement read.

The North Carolina State Board of Elections ousted Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell after clinching a GOP majority for the first time in about 10 years. 

Brinson Bell, who had served in the position since 2019, was replaced by Sam Hayes, the top lawyer for GOP state House Speaker Destin Hall. 

“While I would have liked to have continued to serve the county boards of elections and the voters of North Carolina in this capacity, the state board has made a different decision,” Brinson Bell said after Wednesday's meeting, where the new GOP-majority board met for the first time. The election board denied her the opportunity to speak at the end of the meeting following the 3-2 vote along party lines ousting her.

Brinson Bell was credited by many for her efforts managing the 2024 elections after Hurricane Helene hit the state; however, she has been in the poor graces of Republicans since the 2020 election when she extended the deadline to receive postmarked ballots. Siobhan O'Duffy, a Democratic election board member, said Brinson Bell's ousting “is a shabby way to treat a nationally admired executive election director.” 

Brinson Bell's ousting comes following the passage of a December 2024 law that stripped the governor's powers in appointing election board members, granting the power instead to the state auditor. 

Gov. Josh Stein (D-NC) opposed the law, but the North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld it, and soon after, Republican state auditor Dave Boliek appointed three Republican board members to give them a majority.

JEFFERSON GRIFFIN CONCEDES NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT RACE AFTER MONTHS OF LEGAL CHALLENGES

The chairman of the new elections board, Republican Francis De Luca, said his focus will be to “build and maintain the public's confidence in elections. We want to follow the law, and make it easy to vote and hard to cheat.”

Meanwhile, Republican Jefferson Griffin conceded on Wednesday the North Carolina Supreme Court race after mounting a monthslong legal challenge. Incumbent Justice Alison Riggs beat Griffin by only 734 votes. 

Hayes, the new executive director of elections, will begin his two year term on May 15.

‘The Big Weekend Show' panelists discuss nationwide 'Tesla Takedown' protests against DOGE head Elon Musk.

A group of blue states joined forces Wednesday to sue the Trump administration after it halted a program that federally funded electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The District of Columbia joined 16 states — including California, Colorado and Washington — in a suit over the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s efforts to halt Congress' $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to expand electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure.

President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 mandated that federal agencies pause disbursement of all funds appropriated under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, including NEVI program funding. 

The Federal Highway Administration notified states in February that it was revoking previous state plan approvals and withholding or withdrawing NEVI program funds.

The lawsuit claims the FHWA is acting unlawfully, devastating the ability of states to build the charging infrastructure needed to make EVs accessible to more consumers, combat climate change and pollution and support the states' green economies. 

It asks the court to declare Trump's directives unlawful, vacate the actions and permanently stop the administration from withholding the funds.

In addition to the $300 million and $71 million in funding California and Washington stand to lose, respectively, the blue states previously adopted zero-emission vehicle standards that require a percentage of vehicles sold in the states to release zero emissions.

Washington's laws further require all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles sold in the state to be zero emissions by 2035. 

California's State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan anticipated that California would need hundreds of thousands of additional EV charging ports to support passenger cars and trucks and "incrementally more" charging ports for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses to meet climate goals, according to a news release from the state.

"When America retreats, China wins," California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in the release. "President Trump's illegal action withholding funds for electric vehicle infrastructure is yet another Trump gift to China — ceding American innovation and killing thousands of jobs. Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon — and the nation — by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding." 

The lawsuit comes as Democratic politicians, late-night hosts and political commentators have been touting Tesla's plummeting stock and acts of vandalism against its vehicles, dealerships and charging stations.

The criminal acts have been linked by the FBI to nationwide protests against Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

NEW YORK (AP) — Federal officials on Wednesday released images of a doomed New York City sightseeing helicopter as it broke apart in midair last month, killing six people.

The series of still photographs taken from surveillance camera video shows the fuselage, containing the engine and rotors, separating from the helicopter's tail. The rotor blades and the transmission then detach from the cabin that's carrying the passengers and the pilot. 

The images were included in the preliminary report about the flight released by the National Transportation Safety Board. 

“Several witnesses described hearing several loud ‘bangs' emanating from the helicopter before it broke up and descended into the river,” the report says. 

Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine helicopter pilot, said the sequence of images shows the helicopter yawing severely and the tail boom failing, suggesting it was most likely struck by the aircraft's main rotor blades during flight.

“It's clear that some mechanical issue precipitated the breakup,” he said. 

The initial report, which runs about six pages, does not address the initial cause of the breakup. That, Green said, will likely be determined by a forensic examination of the wreckage itself, including the rotor blades, the engine and transmission.

“A tail strike could be caused by a pilot not handling a loss of power emergency and allowing the rotor rpm to decay, which makes the rotors flap up and down more and that can cause a strike,” he said.




The aircraft, a Bell 206L-4 built in 2004, also appeared to be fairly old and well used, according to Green. 

At the time of the crash, the helicopter had operated about 50 hours since its last inspection on Feb. 27, according to the NTSB report. The helicopter's airframe accrued nearly 13,000 total hours of operation, and the engine accrued more than 23,000 hours.

Federal Aviation Administration records also show the aircraft had a maintenance issue last September involving its transmission assembly.

“The NTSB will be looking at the overhaul and maintenance records to make sure everything is up to date,” Green said. 

The NTSB said previously that the aircraft, operated by tour company New York Helicopter, was not equipped with any video or data recording devices.

But on Wednesday, it said photos taken beforehand show that the pilot, Seankese Johnson, was wearing computer-augmented sunglasses, which would have had video and audio recording capability. The glasses have not been recovered.

Johnson, a 36-year-old former Navy SEAL, received his commercial pilot's license in 2023 and had logged 790 hours of flight time, the NTSB report said.

But he didn't appear to be particularly experienced flying a Bell 206L-4, observed Al Yurman, a retired NTSB investigator. The agency said in its report Johnson had fewer than 50 hours of flight in that type of aircraft. 

“It's quite sophisticated for that type of work,” Yurman said. “I would prefer to have someone more experienced, but we'll know more when the full report comes out.”

The report said Johnson worked a “10 days on/10 days off schedule” and the April 10 flight was his first day back after 10 days off. The flight was also the eighth that day for the pilot and the helicopter.

The aircraft was on a typical tour, departing from the downtown heliport by Wall Street around 3 p.m. and flying north along the Manhattan skyline before heading south toward the Statue of Liberty.

Less than 18 minutes into the flight, witnesses saw the tail and main rotor break away and smoke pouring from the spinning helicopter.

In recent years New York Helicopter, the tour company, went through bankruptcy and faced ongoing lawsuits over alleged debts. 

The company has said it is cooperating with authorities in the investigation. No one answered the phone at its office or responded to an email seeking comment on Wednesday.

The crash was among a recent string of aircraft disasters and close calls that left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S. It also revived concerns about the popular and costly aerial tours over New York City.

Five commercial sightseeing helicopters have gone down in the rivers around Manhattan since 2005 as a result of mechanical failure, pilot error or collision, killing 20 people.

The April 10 crash killed a prominent family from Barcelona, Spain: Agustín Escobar, 49; Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39; and their children Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10. 

Officials have said Escobar, global CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, was in the New York area on business. 

Montal, who worked for Siemens Energy and was the granddaughter of a former president of the famous Barcelona FC soccer club, flew in with their children to meet him.

Senate Democrats blocked stablecoin legislation backed by the digital assets industry amid a furor over President Donald Trump's extensive and growing portfolio of crypto ventures.

Backers of the bill failed to muster enough support to bring it up for consideration with only 48 senators voting in favor Thursday, short of the 60 votes needed.

President Donald Trump congratulated Robert Francis Prevost after his election as pope Thursday, making him the first American-born pontiff in the history of the Roman Catholic Church.

Prevost, 69, of Chicago, will be known as Pope Leo XIV.

"It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country," the president wrote.

"I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!"

Leo has not always had positive words for the U.S. president and his administration, however.

A verified X account linked to the new pope shared an article in February criticizing Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, over his interpretation of Jesus' teachings.

"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others," read the headline of the article shared by Prevost's account.

Vance in an X post Thursday afternoon congratulated the new pope, writing, "I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church."

In April, the account re-posted another tweet criticizing Trump over his administration's mass-deportation efforts.

"Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?" the tweet read, quoting Bishop Evelio Menjivar in an article for the Catholic Standard titled, "This Ordeal is the Passion."

Prevost was chosen on the second day of a papal conclave in Vatican City. The cardinals' selection of the successor to Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88, was revealed by white smoke billowing from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.

Days after returning from Francis' funeral in Rome, Trump joked to reporters that he'd "like to be pope."

Trump later posted an AI-generated image of himself dressed as the pope, drawing criticism.

Former President Joe Biden wrote on X later Thursday, "Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success."

Former President Barack Obama, who has lived and worked in Chicago, wrote on X, "Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV."

"This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith," Obama wrote.

Apple Inc.'s silicon design group is working on new chips that will serve as the brains for future devices, including its first smart glasses, more powerful Macs and artificial intelligence servers. 

The company has made progress on the chip that it's developing for smart glasses, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The move indicates that Apple is ramping up work on such a device, which would compete with the popular Ray-Ban spectacles offered by Meta Platforms Inc.

Billionaire Bill Gates announced on Thursday that he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years.

In a blog post, the Microsoft co-founder wrote that he was motivated by the many challenges facing the world, such as children's health and climate change, as well as the late Andrew Carnegie's admonishment of wealth hoarding.

"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them," Gates wrote. "There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people."

Gates is currently the world's fifth richest person with a $168 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $200 billion commitment assumes his charitable foundation's endowment will grow through investments.

The Gates Foundation, founded by Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in 2000, has already given away more than $100 billion. After Bill Gates has given away "virtually all" of his wealth, the foundation will close at the end of 2045, he said.

Gates is one of few billionaires to publicly step up their charitable giving as nonprofits and universities reel from federal funding cuts. Despite his increase in giving, he said philanthropists cannot cover the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by the U.S. and other wealthy countries.

"The United States, United Kingdom, France, and other countries around the world are cutting their aid budgets by tens of billions of dollars. And no philanthropic organization—even one the size of the Gates Foundation—can make up the gulf in funding that's emerging right now," he wrote. "It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people."

In an interview with the Financial Times, Gates criticized Elon Musk for his role in cutting U.S. foreign aid. In February, Musk's so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. The federal agency disbursed $42.5 billion in 2023, according to government data, that provided lifesaving assistance, including health care, clean water and food across the globe.

"The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one," Gates told the Financial Times.

In early March, the agency estimated that the cuts would have dire consequences, including 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition going untreated and up to 166,000 additional deaths from malaria.

Gates, his then-wife and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 as a commitment for the world's richest people to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetime or wills. French Gates has since stepped down from the Gates Foundation but has her own philanthropic organization.

Musk has signed the Giving Pledge. Gates told the New York Times that he doesn't know whether Musk will follow through.

"The Giving Pledge — an unusual aspect of it that you can wait until you die and still fulfill it. So who knows? He could go on to be a great philanthropist," he said before pointing to Musk's involvement in the foreign aid cuts.

Musk has given away less than 1% of his wealth, according to Forbes. The publication estimates his out-the-door giving — gifts that have been paid, not just pledged or parked in a foundation — at $620 million over his lifetime through 2023.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stocks closed broadly higher Thursday, despite the U.K.'s FTSE 100 erasing gains as the U.K. and U.S. confirmed a trade agreement and the Bank of England cut interest rates.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.4% higher, trimming earlier gains, with Germany's DAX up 1%. The risk-sensitive technology sector rose 1.64% amid optimism in U.S. markets over trade talk progress.

However, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 bucked the trend to tumble 0.32% after snapping its record winning streak on Wednesday. Sterling was slightly higher against the euro and U.S. dollar. See CNBC's full coverage of the U.K.-U.S. deal here.

As the U.K. announced a strengthening of its trading relationship with Washington, the EU said it was preparing to launch a WTO complaint against the United States over the Trump administration's tariffs regime.

The bloc also said it was launching a public consultation on a list of U.S. imports worth 95 billion euros ($107.5 billion) that could be subject to new import duties as a part of EU retaliatory measures.

In London, the Bank of England on Thursday cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 4.25%. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a 5 to 4 majority to reduce rates by 25 basis points. Two of its members voted to cut rates by 50 basis points, while another two wanted to hold rates steady.

It came after Sweden's Riksbank held its key interest rate steady, citing uncertainty in the global economy as a direct result of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.

Also in focus was the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision — the U.S. central bank on Wednesday held steady on rates as it highlighted rising inflation and unemployment risks.

The Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a range of between 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since December. The decision was largely expected.

Despite a decline in the U.K.'s FTSE 100, British firms including engine-maker Rolls Royce and aerospace firm Melrose both closed higher on news of a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement. Shares of the companies closed 3.7% and 5.2% higher, respectively.

"The contents of the deal remain very limited in their totality and we await the full detail before we can say if there is a winner from this negotiation," Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter, said in emailed comments.

"However, for the U.K. this deal appears to be ultimately favourable for some of its largest exports, specifically cars, auto parts and aerospace engines to name some of the key areas."

— Jenni Reid

President Donald Trump unveiled the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, though specifics about the deal were not immediately clear, and nothing was signed during the Oval Office event.

"The final details are being written up," Trump said. "In the coming weeks we'll have it all very conclusive."

He said that the deal includes "billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports," and that the UK will "reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products."

While the event was ongoing, Trump's Truth Social account posted a screenshot indicating U.S. tariffs on the UK will stay at 10%.

— Kevin Breuninger 

A former adviser to a British Prime Minister has said the U.K.-U.S. trade deal expected later today is likely to be "far short of anything comprehensive."

In a post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday: "The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come."

Andrew Hood, international trade lead at London based law firm Fieldfisher and former general counsel to Prime Minister David Cameron, said there were "some" differences between how the U.S. and the U.K. were portraying the trade deal expected to be announced.

"The President described it as full and comprehensive, but it looks more likely to be focussed on reducing tariffs in certain key sectors, notably for cars. It may include steel and other specific sectors but it is a long way off the full Free Trade Agreement the UK and US have been negotiating for almost exactly 5 years," Hood said. "It appears likely to help address the trade friction created by the President's recent announcements, but will be far short of anything comprehensive."

In addition to launching a WTO complaint against the U.S. on Thursday, the European Commission also said it would open a public consultation on a list of goods that could become subject to EU countermeasures against U.S. tariffs.

The goods — which include certain types of livestock, wine, chocolate and machinery, among other things — are worth 95 billion euros ($107.5 billion), according to the European Commission.

— Chloe Taylor

The European Union announced on Thursday that it was launching a WTO dispute against the U.S. in relation to the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, as well as new levies on cars and car parts imported into America.

"It is the unequivocal view of the EU that these tariffs blatantly violate fundamental WTO rules," the EU said in a statement. "The EU's objective is thus to reaffirm that internationally agreed rules matter, and these cannot be unilaterally disregarded by any WTO member, including the US."

The bloc also said Thursday that it was launching a public consultation on its retaliatory tariffs on American imports, the rollout of which has been paused until the summer.

Shares of Swiss recruitment giant Adecco gained 9.8% by 12:39 p.m. in London, putting the company's stock at the top of the regional Stoxx 600 index.

It came after Adecco said its first quarter revenues fell by 3% year-on-year to 5.57 billion euros ($6.29 billion). Analysts had expected the company's quarterly revenues to come in at 5.54 billion euros, according to LSEG.

The British pound rallied after the Bank of England cut interest rates, as markets were expecting, on Thursday.

By 12:29 p.m. London time, sterling was around 0.2% higher against the U.S. dollar, while gaining 0.3% against the euro.



Investors are also awaiting an announcement on a potential trade deal between the U.K. and the U.S. later today.

Yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — moved higher across the board on Thursday afternoon, after the Bank of England trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points.

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, with prices falling and yields rising when investors are less willing to lend to the government issuing the debt.

Gilts with short-term maturity periods saw the biggest selloff, with yields on both 2- and 5-year gilts rising by around 7 basis points at 12:17 p.m. in London.

U.K. 10-year government bonds saw yields tick higher by 5 basis points, while 20- and 30-year gilt yields added around 2 basis points.

— Chloe Taylor

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office told CNBC an announcement on Britain's trading relationship with the U.S. was imminent.

"The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security," the spokesperson said. "Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today."

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier said his administration had finalized a "comprehensive" deal with the U.K. A press conference on the matter is due to take place in the Oval Office at 10:00 a.m. ET (3 p.m. London time).

— Chloe Taylor

The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, bringing it down to 4.25%.

It said the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a 5 to 4 majority to enact the reduction. Two of its members wanted to cut rates by 50 basis points, the central bank said, while another two wanted to hold rates steady.

Here's what the decision could mean for your money.

Shares of German sportswear brand Puma popped 7% as the company said it would not take the lead on price increases in the U.S. in response to tariffs.

"We don't want to be the leader in terms of the pricing change in U.S. markets," chief financial officer Markus Neubrand told journalists on a press call after the company's earnings release.

"There are other players in our industry where the U.S. is far more relevant. As the third biggest brand globally we shouldn't be the pricing leaders," he added.

Shares were up 8% by 11:05 a.m. London time.

The retailer maintained its full-year guidance earlier on Thursday and said it is not quantifying the potential implications of tariffs at this stage.

Shares of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall gained 1.7% by 10:35 a.m. in London, after the defense giant posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings.

The company said Thursday that its sales grew 46% year-on-year in the three months to March to hit 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion), with its defense segment seeing a 73% jump in sales. Order backlog reached a new all-time high in the first quarter, with the firm touting "several major orders."

Analysts had been expecting revenues to hit just over 2 billion euros in the first quarter, according to LSEG data.

Rheinmetall confirmed its 2025 full-year guidance of 25% to 30% sales growth, noting that it saw "further upside potential" as regional governments ramp up defense spending.

"This outlook does not yet take into account the improvement in market potential that is expected to arise in the markets that are particularly relevant for Rheinmetall in Europe, Germany and Ukraine as a result of the geopolitical developments in recent weeks," the company said in a news release. "Rheinmetall will therefore make any necessary guidance adjustments as the respective requirements of defence customers become more specific over the course of the year."

Danish shipping giant Maersk on Thursday posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but warned that the current level of U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes.

The company, widely regarded as a barometer of global trade, reported preliminary underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.71 billion for the first three months of the year.

That's up 70% from $1.59 billion over the same period a year earlier and above the $2.57 billion expected by analysts in an LSEG poll.

Sweden's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 2.25% in a decision announced on Thursday morning.

Policymakers said that although inflation was slightly elevated at 2.3%, they expect prices to stabilize. However, they noted that increased uncertainty overseas meant the outlook for the Swedish economy was weaker than they had forecast in March.

"Uncertainty in the global economy has increased significantly since the change of US president, not least as a result of the new US trade policy," the Riksbank said in a press release.

Officials added that new tariffs were expected to dampen demand in Europe, putting downward pressure on inflation — but they said trade developments remained "very hard to assess."

"Overall, it is still too early to determine the extent and duration of the effects on economic activity," the statement said. "The Executive Board assesses that monetary policy is currently well-balanced and that it is wise to await further information to obtain a clearer picture of the outlook for economic activity and inflation."

Spanish lender Banco Sabadell's first-quarter profit surged above expectations to reach 489 million euros ($552 million), figures released on Thursday morning showed.

It represents a 58.6% jump from the same period a year earlier.

Analysts had been forecasting 405.9 million euros in quarterly net profit.

Sabadell is currently the target of a 12 billion euro hostile takeover bid from rival lender BBVA, with the deal currently the subject of a public consultation after Spain's competition watchdog approved the acquisition last week.

German sportswear brand Puma on Thursday retained its full-year guidance, saying it is not calculating the potential impact of tariffs at this stage.

The retailer, which relies heavily on manufacturing Asia, nevertheless said it has moved to reduce its U.S. imports from China. It warned in March that it expected to take a hit from President Donald Trump's tariff regime.

"Due to the highly uncertain implications from the U.S. tariffs, we are not quantifying the potential implications at this stage," chief financial officer Markus Neubrand said in a statement.

"We already reduced U.S. imports from China and we will continue to remain agile and ready to manage the increased market volatility and swiftly respond to changing external conditions," he added.

Neubrand added in an earnings call that the company is "constantly reviewing price adjustments" and is considering "cost optimization" for products in the United States. That comes after Rival sportswear giant Adidas warned last week that the levies would lead to price hikes for all of its U.S. products.

The company said it continues to forecast 2025 sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range, and operating profit excluding one-time costs of 520 million euros to 600 million euros.

Puma on Thursday reported a slightly better-than-feared 52% year-on-year decline in first-quarter operating profits excluding one-time costs to 76 million euros. That was less than the 58% decline to 66 million euros anticipated by analysts in an LSEG poll, but well below last year's 159 million euros.

Sales were flat at 2.07 billion euros versus expectations of 2.04 billion euros, led by weaker demand in the U.S. and China.

The U.S. had been a key growth driver for Puma over recent quarters amid soft sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific, most notably China. However, sales in the Americas declined 2.7% in the first quarter, led by softness in the U.S.

The world's largest brewer AB InBev on Thursday flagged a "strong start" to the year, with first-quarter profits at the top end of its outlook as sales volumes dipped less than anticipated.

The drinks maker posted a 7.9% rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) over the three-month period. That was well ahead of analyst expectations for 3.1% growth, according to Reuters.

AB InBev, whose brands include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, also reported a better-than-feared 2.2% decline in first-quarter beer sales. That's lower than the expected 2.6% decline.

First-quarter revenues totaled $13.63 billion, slightly above the $13.78 forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.

"The consistent execution of our strategy by our teams and partners drove a solid start to the year and reinforces our confidence in delivering on our outlook for 2025," CEO Michel Doukeris said in a statement.

The company in February forecast 2025 EBITDA growth in line with its medium-term outlook of between 4% and 8%.

— Karen Gilchrist

Germany's Siemens Energy on Thursday posted a better-than-expected 20.7% annual jump in quarterly revenue, citing increased demand thanks to "favorable market trends" that ultimately led to one of the company's best quarters.

Total revenue for the firm's fiscal second quarter came in at 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion), above the 9.3 billion euros expected by analysts, according to LSEG data. Net income reached 501 million euros — up from 108 million euros in the same period last year.

The company upgraded its full-year guidance on the back of the results, saying it now expects to achieve revenue growth in the range of 13% to 15% in 2025, with a net income of up to 1 billion euros.

However, Siemens Energy also warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime — and retaliatory measures from other countries — is expected to have a direct impact on its bottom line.

"Siemens Energy is closely monitoring developments and continuously analysing their potential impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations," the company said in its earnings release. "For the second half of the fiscal year 2025, a limited direct impact on Siemens Energy's Profit of up to a high double-digit million € amount, after mitigation measures, is currently expected."

Britain is reportedly set to sign a trade deal with the U.S., making it the first country to do so after the world's largest economy announced stiff "reciprocal" tariffs against friends and foes alike in April.

The New York Times reported the development after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday night stateside that there will be a briefing about a trade deal next day, without revealing any details.

CNBC did not receive a response from the White House and the British Embassy in Washington seeking comments on the news.

A government spokesperson from the U.K.'s Department for Business and Trade said in response to CNBC's queries that "The US is an indispensable ally and talks on an economic deal between the U.S. and the UK are ongoing."

U.S. equity positioning may not be all that upbeat despite recent trade developments and quarterly results, according to Citi.

"De-escalating trade tensions and a better-than-expected earnings season have led to a period of stability for investor positioning. However, the uplift from bullish flows has been considerably restrained," Chris Montagu, the firm's global head of quantitative research, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Montagu found that positioning momentum levels are actually close to neutral for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.

"Limited bullish flows were overshadowed by increasing short positioning, leading to a decline in positioning levels for the S&P," he continued. "Nasdaq positioning edged higher, but neither index reflected a strong shift towards bullish positioning over the past week."

Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged rising headwinds to the central bank's dual mandate on Wednesday.  

"My gut tells me that uncertainty about the economy is extremely elevated. The downside risks have increased," Powell told reporters. 

However, he added, "The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen, but they haven't materialized yet. … And that tells me more than my intuition," reiterating the Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will pull his controversial nomination of Ed Martin to be the top federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia.

Trump's move came as Martin, who had drawn criticism for his advocacy of Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants, faced the strong likelihood of the Senate not confirming him.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, on Tuesday said he would not support Martin's nomination, dealing what appeared to be a final blow to his chance of winning confirmation.

Tillis cited Martin's support for Capitol riot defendants.

"He's a terrific person, and he wasn't getting the support," Trump said at the White House as he said he was abandoning Martin's nomination.

"I have to be straight. I was disappointed," the president said. 

"A lot of people were disappointed, but that's the way it works. Sometimes that's the way it works. And he wasn't rejected, but we felt it would be very it would be hard."

Trump also said, "We have somebody else that will be announcing over the next two days who's gonna be great."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Coinbase agreed to acquire Dubai-based Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, for $2.9 billion, the largest deal in the crypto industry to date.

The company said Thursday that the cost comprises $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase class A common stock. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

Shares of Coinbase rose nearly 6%.

The acquisition positions Coinbase as an international leader in crypto derivatives by open interest and options volume, Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product, said in a blog post – which could allow it take on big players like Binance. Coinbase operates the largest marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the U.S., but has a smaller share of the global crypto market, where activity largely takes place on Binance.

Deribit facilitated more than $1 trillion in trading volume last year and has about $30 billion of current open interest on the platform.

"We're excited to join forces with Coinbase to power a new era in global crypto derivatives," Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said in a statement. "As the leading crypto options platform, we've built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options – all under one trusted brand. Together with Coinbase, we're set to shape the future of the global crypto derivatives market."

Tusar also noted that Deribit has a "consistent track record" of generating positive adjusted EBITDA the company believes will grow as a combined entity.  

"One of the things we liked most about this deal is that it's not just a game changer for our international expansion plans — it immediately diversifies our revenue and enhances profitability," Tusar told CNBC.

The deal comes at a time when the crypto industry is riding regulatory tailwinds from the first ever pro-crypto White House. Support of the industry has fueled crypto M&A activity in recent weeks. In March, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to acquire NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, and last month Ripple agreed to buy prime broker Hidden Road.

By structuring the deal as a cash-and-stock transaction, Coinbase still should have bandwidth to make other acquisitions if there is an opportunity. As of Dec. 31, Coinbase had $8.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.

Bill Gates sharply criticized Elon Musk in an interview with The New York Times published on Thursday, calling out the Tesla cofounder's role in cutting foreign aid as part of his Department of Government Efficiency initiative.

The Microsoft cofounder said that cuts made to foreign aid, particular programs administered by the now-shuttered US Agency for International Development, were "stunning."

"He's the one who cut the USAID budget. He put it in the wood chipper, because he didn't go to a party that weekend," Gates told the Times of Musk. "The world's richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world's poorest children."

Gates also referred to an instance early in President Donald Trump's term in which administration officials said that the US had been sending condoms to Gaza via foreign aid. In reality, the US had been providing contraceptives to a province in the African country of Mozambique.

"They cut the money to Gaza Province in Mozambique. That is really for drugs, so mothers don't give their babies HIV," Gates said. "But the people doing the cutting are so geographically illiterate, they think it's Gaza and condoms. Will they go meet those babies who got HIV because that money was cut? Probably not."

Gates made the remarks as he discussed his plans to give away the remainder of his wealth over the next 20 years before closing his foundation in 2045.

The Gates Foundation has invested heavily in public health initiatives around the world, often focusing on childhood diseases.

This isn't the first time Gates has been critical of Musk — or vice versa.

Gates has argued that Musk has destabilized the politics of foreign countries through his support for right-wing causes in the United Kingdom and Germany. He's also said that while he believes Tesla is having a positive environmental impact, he wishes Musk were more outspoken about the climate crisis.

Musk, in turn, has said that Gates has a "limited" understanding of artificial intelligence.

Musk, DOGE, Tesla, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

WHEN: Today, Thursday, May 8, 2025

WHERE: CNBC's "Squawk on the Street"

Following is the unofficial transcript of breaking news from CNBC's David Faber on "Squawk on the Street" (M-F, 9AM-11AM ET) today, Thursday, May 8. Video will be available on CNBC.com.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.

DAVID FABER: What Warner Brothers is moving towards, though, is a split, and it's become relatively clear to me from the many conversations that I've had that we could get some sort of an announcement in the not too distant future that they are planning to try to split the company. What would that split look like? Well, most likely, or almost definitely, it's the linear cable networks and then you have the studio coupled with Max. How you would go about doing that, remember internally and we reported on this previously, they've already done all of the reapportioning necessary. And I would note as well, in their earnings report, for the first time, they break out every segment in its own financials. That is usually a tell, right? Streaming has its own page, studios and linear, global linear segments, network segment as well. So when will that come, how will it come, of course, continues to be a question, guys, I think you know you maybe you want to raise equity for the Max brand, Max and the studio in some way, through a public offering of some kind, and or spin the rest to shareholders, and then linear cable networks. How you actually apportion debt, of course, continues to be a key question, concern, gating issue as well. There are at about 3.8 times leverage right now, obviously down significantly from where they were when they announced that deal years ago to buy Warner from AT&T. But don't forget Mike, when they put out that proxy, they were looking for for EBITDA numbers that are so far above where they are given the continued and incessant decline in linear cable so we'll see what we get in terms of a potential announcement from the split, what they actually look, what that actually looks like in terms of structure and how they want to go about trying to accomplish it. And then it will take quite some time to actually happen.

Comcast's spinoff of most of NBCUniversal's cable portfolio has a new name – Versant. This week, I had a chance to speak to the new company's Chief Executive Officer, Mark Lazarus. "Laz," as he's known colloquially, replaced Dick Ebersol as chairman of NBC Sports in 2011. Before that, he was president of Turner Sports. More recently, he's been chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group, overseeing the company's TV and streaming platforms.

Now Laz will have a chance at running a publicly traded company that consists of cable networks including USA, CNBC, Golf Channel and MSNBC, among others. The company plans to begin trading separately from Comcast before the end of the year.

Versant will have its own sports strategy, including bidding on live sports to add to its current portfolio. Lazarus told me in an exclusive interview he's already held talks with both the National Women's Soccer League and Major League Baseball about potentially acquiring live game rights. The NWSL has a package of games it's currently shopping and could add a fifth media partner to its existing roster of CBS, ESPN, Amazon Prime Video and Scripps Sports (ION).

For baseball, it's unlikely Versant has the financial firepower to compete for the Sunday Night package recently vacated for next season by ESPN, but MLB controls the rights to many games through its out-of-market streaming service, MLB.TV, and its pay-TV add-on service Extra Innings. MLB hived off some of these games to Roku for $10 million per year last year. MLB also has national deals with Apple TV+, Turner Sports and Fox. Local deals are primarily spread out among regional sports networks, although Amazon owns the exclusive rights to some New York Yankees games. 

"We're looking for sports deals that drive distribution, diversify ad sales and have a value," said Lazarus.

Getting a small package of games for USA Network could help boost Versant's future distribution conversations with pay-TV providers. For MLB, carving out a chunk of games for USA Network can help improve the league's reach. Lazarus said he'll examine all sorts of live rights as they come available, provided they can boost distribution revenue as pay-TV carriage renewals arise. 

"We have a pretty good sports portfolio," Lazarus said. "We're not going to be in the NFL business. We're not going to be in the Big Ten business, because that stuff's all spoken for. But we'll be with the next-level stuff."

USA already airs English Premier League games in the U.S. in addition to NASCAR, certain golf events (including two majors – the U.S. Open and the British Open) and WWE's "Smackdown."

USA will also get WNBA games as part of NBCUniversal's new deal with the NBA, beginning next season. Lazarus shared with me that the WNBA commitment is actually greater than the initial agreement with the league. USA Network will have Wednesday night doubleheaders beginning next season. 

The Olympics will continue to air on all of the cable networks that have long been part of NBCUniversal's broader deal – including CNBC (hello curling!). Golf Channel already airs many live tournaments, including The Ryder Cup, and "golf will be an important vertical for us, and we'll continue to invest in the golf industry," Lazarus said.

Sixty-five percent of Versant's programming is live, either through news or sports, Lazarus told me. Versant will be cut loose from NBCUniversal and will have to showcase the value of its content on its own, no longer able to link itself to NBC's broadcast network, which owns the rights to the NBA, the NFL's "Sunday Night Football" and many other leagues. 

But that won't happen overnight: Versant will have about a two-year grace period, as nearly every major TV distribution deal is locked down until 2027, with the bulk coming up for renewal in 2028.

With annual revenue of roughly $7 billion, Versant won't be able to compete for the top sports rights against behemoths like Disney, Netflix and Amazon. But the company's sports strategy is very important to the future of the company, given its importance with distributors. Lazarus recently announced three significant sports executive hires: Matt Hong as President of Sports, Jeff Behnke as Executive Producer and Senior Vice President of Sports Production, and Roy Cho as President of Distribution and Partnerships. 

One sport Lazarus said he won't be bidding on is F1. Those rights are currently in market, but Lazarus told me he doesn't think the racing league will move the needle on distribution deals, noting ratings are about one-third of NASCAR's. 

One more detail Lazarus shared with me is post spinoff, Versant will have a negotiated promotional deal with NBCUniversal where programming is marketed between the two companies' networks and digital properties. There will be no money exchanged in the deal, but the marketing value will be equal. This goes beyond sports, but given there are far more eyeballs on NBC than on the cable networks, this works to Versant's advantage.

Tech Reviews:

Whoop MG.

Review: The Whoop 5.0 and MG — short for medical grade — are meant to appeal to a broad user base beyond just athletes.

Whoop Inc., the maker of increasingly popular, screen-less fitness bands, debuted updated hardware on Thursday with more compact designs, improved battery life and blood pressure tracking in the highest-end model.

With the new devices — the Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG, short for medical grade — the company is looking to gather a wider audience and add to an array of gadgets pitched as smartwatch alternatives. Both products also include improvements to sleep tracking, a suite of women's health features, Vo2 max measurement and the ability to estimate a wearer's physiological age, while the medical-focused model includes heart health monitoring, a tentpole of other wrist-worn devices.

President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom.

The deal is the first by the United States with a country whose imports were subject to new tariffs imposed by Trump in early April.

The U.S. has a trade goods surplus with the U.K.

Many specifics about the deal were not immediately clear, and nothing was signed during the Oval Office event.

"The final details are being written up," Trump said. "In the coming weeks we'll have it all very conclusive."

He said that the deal includes "billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports," and that the U.K. will "reduce or eliminate numerous nontariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products."

A fact sheet from the White House said that the trade deal will:

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who joined Trump remotely, said, "We've built an incredible platform for the future."

But some experts downplayed the impact of the deal, saying the path taken that the U.S. took with the U.K. cannot easily be repeated with other nations where America has a large trade deficit.

"It's a very small win, and it's limited in scope," said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, on CNBC's "The Exchange" later Thursday.

While the Oval Office event was ongoing, Trump's Truth Social account posted a screenshot indicating U.S. tariffs on the U.K. will stay at 10%.

Asked if that baseline tariff is a template for future trade deals, Trump said, "That's a low number."

"They made a good deal," Trump said of the U.K. "Some will be much higher because they have massive trade surpluses."

The chart also shows that U.K. duties on U.S. goods will shrink from 5.1% to 1.8%. It was unclear Thursday how those figures were tabulated.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the Oval Office that she will travel to the U.K. next week to continue talks over U.S. beef exports.

Trump earlier said on Truth Social that the agreement is "a full and comprehensive one," adding, "Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!"

But 10 Downing Street suggested that negotiations with the U.S. were ongoing.

"Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today," a spokesperson for Starmer said in a statement overnight, after The New York Times first reported on the U.S.-U.K. announcement.

The statement added that Starmer "will always act in Britain's national interest," and called the U.S. "an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security."

Trump imposed a 10% blanket tariff on the U.K. in early April, as part of a rollout of what he claimed were "reciprocal" import duties on nearly every country on earth.

The U.K. is also affected by separate U.S. tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum and foreign-made cars.

Trump quickly backed off the reciprocal plan amid a market rout and mounting criticism. He announced a 90-day "pause" that set an across-the-board 10% tariff rate for all affected nations except China.

Trump claimed he decided on that pause after dozens of countries reached out to negotiate new trade relationships with the U.S.

Private investment firms of the ultra-rich, rattled by President Donald Trump's tariffs, continued to scale back deal-making in April.

Last month, single-family offices made 40 direct investments, down 31% month to month, according to data provided exclusively to CNBC by Fintrx, a private wealth intelligence platform. April's tally also represents a 47% year-over-year decline.

However, artificial intelligence-related startups are still garnering attention from family offices, accounting for half of last month's direct deals. In early April, quantitative AI firm SandboxAQ finalized its Series E round of $450 million after upsizing the fundraise twice due to investor demand, CEO Jack Hidary told CNBC.

SandboxAQ raised some $300 million last December from investors including a host of billionaires and their family offices, such as venture capitalist Jim Breyer, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Two Sigma co-founder David Siegel. The round was extended this spring, raising an additional $150 million from Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio's family office and a cohort including Google and Nvidia, an existing partner of SandboxAQ.

The Palo Alto, California-based firm, which spun off from Alphabet in 2022, is chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and counts his family office, Hillspire, as a backer.

"These are very value-added family offices because they know the world of tech well. They know the world of finance well," Hidary said. "These are experienced executives and entrepreneurs who lend a hand in advising us and are active in doing so."

SandboxAQ uses AI and quantum technology to make large-scale predictions and statistical analysis that it markets to a variety of industries, like companies doing drug discovery, cybersecurity, navigation or financial modeling. Its technology analyzes large numerical datasets to make predictive AI models.

Hidary, a serial tech entrepreneur, said professionally managed family offices and large institutions have developed a greater appetite in the past six or seven years for deep-tech startups that cater to businesses.

"They used to see deep tech as something they didn't touch. It's not their purview. They didn't make their money, you know, doing that," he said. "But now it turns out they understand that actually it's lower risk to invest in deep moat companies."

"What they realize, after years of investing in consumer-oriented tech — tech that helps you manage your pet's food or something like that — it sounds great. It builds up a lot of users quickly, but it's easily commoditized," he said.

Family offices are often quicker to make investment decisions than traditional institutional investors, but some want to have deep technical knowledge before they hand over funds, Hidary said.

For instance, Breyer met with Hidary four or five times to discuss relevant chapters of two books authored by Hidary. As for Dalio, his investment followed years of discussions with Hidary that initially started in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, about the impact of AI on the economy.

In initial conversations with investors, Hidary says he assesses whether they have the patience for a long horizon.

"You don't want a family office that's here to just flip a burger, right? And that would not be a good fit for us," he said. "We're looking to build a global company in the top echelon of tech companies. And I think people are attracted to that ambition. They're attracted to that focus, but it's not for every family office."

A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against high-profile celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry.

The ruling narrows the scope of a sprawling multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform.

In an order filed Wednesday, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange.

The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's catastrophic collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds and triggered investigations worldwide. The plaintiffs accused the stars of being paid millions of dollars to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, a violation of federal and state advertising laws.

The judge dismissed nearly all of the claims against the "Celebrity Defendants," which include Shohei Ohtani, Larry David, the Golden State Warriors, Udonis Haslem, David Ortiz and Naomi Osaka.

The court also cleared the "YouTuber Defendants," including influencers who allegedly marketed FTX through social media, of most claims.

Moore wrote that the plaintiffs "fail to adequately plead causation" and "fail to plausibly allege Defendants' knowledge of FTX's fraud." He added that while the celebrities may have been "uninformed, negligent, or even reckless," the plaintiffs did not show they "had any knowledge of FTX's fraud" or "had the requisite intent to deceive or defraud investors."

The judge also cleared defendants of related civil conspiracy claims, writing that "defendants cannot be found liable for civil conspiracy for merely receiving payments and other monetary benefits in exchange for their promotional content."

The decision significantly reduces the celebrities' legal exposure, though two claims against them remain active: Violations of state securities laws in Florida and Oklahoma, which prohibit the sale of unregistered securities.

Plaintiffs may still amend their complaint and try again, the judge wrote, but will need to present stronger evidence directly linking the stars to FTX's alleged wrongdoing.

The ruling comes after a protracted legal battle in which plaintiffs alleged that the celebrities and influencers were liable for promoting unregistered securities and engaging in deceptive practices.

Brady and his ex-wife, Bündchen, were among the most prominent faces of FTX, appearing in a high-profile commercial for the exchange in 2022. Curry and the Golden State Warriors also had an endorsement deal with FTX, while David starred in a widely viewed Super Bowl commercial for the platform.

Late last month, NBA star Shaquille O'Neal settled with a group of FTX investors who accused him of enabling the failed exchange's fraud as a celebrity promoter.

While plaintiffs had sought $21 billion in total damages from O'Neal and other promoters, the terms of his settlement were not disclosed.

The European Union's executive arm on Thursday said it would launch a dispute with the World Trade Organization over the U.S.' "reciprocal" tariff policy and duties on cars and car parts.

The European Commission further said it had launched a public consultation on countermeasures targeting U.S. imports worth 95 billion euros ($107.4 billion), to be implemented if a trade deal is not reached with Washington.

The list features hundreds of agricultural and industrial items, along with bourbon, tequila and other spirits — a sore point between the trading partners, with U.S. President Donald Trump in March threatening to put a 200% tariff on EU alcohol imports. No specific retaliatory tariff rate was announced.

The EU is currently seeking to negotiate a deal to avoid Trump's 20% reciprocal tariffs on all U.S. imports from the bloc. Trump has also slapped a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, hitting many European automakers, along with a 25% rate on steel and aluminum.

Numerous aircraft and vehicle components are also included in the EU list released Thursday, which would impact U.S firms such as plane maker Boeing.

"It is the unequivocal view of the EU that these [U.S.] tariffs blatantly violate fundamental WTO rules," the European Commission said in a statement.

"The EU's objective is thus to reaffirm that internationally agreed rules matter, and these cannot be unilaterally disregarded by any WTO member, including the US."

The dispute will take the form of formally lodging a request for consultations.

In a Thursday statement, EC President Ursula von der Leyen said: "The EU remains fully committed to finding negotiated outcomes with the US. We believe there are good deals to be made for the benefit of consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic."

John Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp., told an analyst call on May 6: "Any measures that would seriously threaten deliveries of Boeing airliners to Europe, for example, on top of China would be a serious challenge even if that's the airline's responsibility." The company purchases Boeing aircraft and leases them to airlines around the world.

"If tariffs were to remain long term, it could ultimately serve as an incentive for U.S. aerospace manufacturers to look outside the U.S. to start additional production lines for product delivery outside the U.S.," Plueger added.

The EU has paused an initial set of retaliatory measures agreed by member states in April — a response to the metals duties — to enable negotiations. The countermeasures, if implemented, will target around 21 billion euros worth of U.S. goods ranging from agricultural products to clothing, chiefly with a tariff rate of 25%.

The U.K. on Thursday became the first country to strike a trade arrangement with the U.S. amid the current tariff turbulence, though full details are yet to be announced.

Speaking during the announcement of the U.K. agreement, Trump said, "We intend to make a deal with Europe."

He reiterated his past claim that the EU treats the U.S. "unfairly" on trade — based on the country's trade deficit in goods with the 27-nation bloc — adding: "They very much want to make a deal. We'll be dealing with them. We are dealing with them currently."

The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday in a move likely to bring relief to borrowers, businesses and hard-pressed consumers across the country.

The central bank reduced its key interest rate from 4.5% to 4.25% at its latest monetary policy meeting amid a backdrop of lackluster economic growth and uncertainty around President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. 

The cut had been widely expected, especially after a slowdown in price rises, with inflation cooling to 2.6% in the twelve months to March (from 2.8% the previous month).

Five of the BOE's nine policymakers voted for the cut, with two members wanting a larger 50 basis-point reduction, and two wanting to keep rates on hold.

The BOE said Thursday that uncertainty surrounding global trade policies had intensified since the imposition of U.S. tariffs and subsequent retaliatory measures. The "prospects for global growth have weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation are likely to be smaller," it added.

Many British households and firms will be thankful for the rate cut as it will make borrowing money a little less expensive. Savers, who reap the benefits of higher rates of interest on their savings accounts, stand to lose out.

"Just as the response to rate hikes was textbook — slower growth, soft housing market activity and higher saving, the response to rate cuts should also be textbook," Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt told CNBC Thursday.

"Business and consumers hold significant cash balances while debt-to-income ratios are at multi-decade lows. By easing the brakes on an economy full of pent-up potential, expect a positive response in investment, spending and housing activity," he said.

Here's a quick look at the winners and losers from the Bank of England's latest rate cut:

A 25-basis-point reduction in the Bank of England's base rate will be a boon for anyone looking to buy a new home and get a cheaper "fixed-rate" mortgage deal from a bank or lender, or for those re-mortgaging and looking for new deals after their fixed-rate term expires.

Residential mortgages with a fixed rate make up the bulk (85%) of existing mortgages, according to data from UK Finance released Thursday. Of the total number of fixed-rate deals, UK Finance analysis shows that around 1.6 million will end in total in 2025, meaning the latest drop in the Bank of England's key rate will be good news for those looking to find a new offer.

Of course, households that already have a fixed monthly mortgage won't feel the benefit of an interest rate cut. As of Thursday, the average 2-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.66% while the average 5-year fixed rate was 4.61%, according to data from Rightmove.

A cut is good news for the 591,000 homeowners in the U.K. on a "tracker" mortgage rate, however, that rises or falls with the Bank of England's base rate. A 25-basis-point cut translates to a £29 reduction in monthly payments for the average customer on a tracker, UK Finance states.

A 25 basis point cut "brings some relief, particularly for those on tracker and variable-rate products, who should see an immediate reduction in monthly repayments," U.K. mortgage expert Nicholas Mendes from John Charcol in London said in emailed comments.

"While fixed rates have already priced in much of this decision, the cut will support sentiment in the housing market at a time when affordability has been stretched and buyer activity has slowed. It also gives lenders a bit more breathing room to remain competitive, which could help stimulate demand, especially among first-time buyers" he added.

Lower interest rates will also be welcomed by consumers looking to borrow money for other things, with a potential reduction in interest on credit cards and personal loans, although this is dependent on your personal circumstances including credit history.

British firms and consumers will also get some respite from the central bank's decision, as lower interest rates can also translate into cheaper borrowing and cheaper repayments on business loans, freeing up cash for investment and growth.

Businesses will hope that lower rates will boost consumer confidence and spending, too. This will be a particular bonus for the U.K.'s 5.5 million small and medium-sized enterprises recently hit with a rise in the national minimum wage and higher National Insurance contributions, announced in the Labour government's budget.

At the same time, however, any wider economic downturn on the back of U.S.-led trade tariffs and export costs and a predicted bump in inflation as energy price rises spike (albeit temporarily) could dent consumer confidence and business sentiment.

"The U.K. economy's cyclical pulse has been strengthening a little in the last few months. Household incomes have continued to grow faster than inflation and that has been showing up in consumption," Will Hobbs from Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management noted Thursday, although he added that "the uncertainty created by the U.S. tariffs will certainly have some dampening effect."

It means many Brits could be reluctant to splurge the cash, mindful of the still-elevated cost of living after the price of basic goods and energy spiked following the war in Ukraine.

While the pace of price rises has slowed in recent months, the Bank of England warned in March of a short-term spike in inflation this year, mainly due to rising energy costs.

That led the central bank to warn that any interest rate cuts would be "gradual and careful" as it looks to bring the rate of inflation down to its target of 2%. The pace of rate cuts could be subject to change, however, if U.S. trade tariffs dampen global demand and hit U.K. growth more than expected.

"Back in February, the medium-term economic and inflation outlook as well as the balance of risks argued for the BOE to keep the pace at one per quarter for 2025," Peel Hunt's Kallum Pickering noted Thursday. "A lot has changed since then — and if there was ever an opportunity to shift the policy narrative, this would be it."  

"A likely diversion of cheap Chinese goods into Europe, plus lower energy prices due to softer global demand, and lower import prices from a rising sterling will all help to keep a lid on UK prices," Pickering noted.

"Moreover, an additional fear factor coming from increased uncertainty will likely dampen wage and price setting. In our view, we believe that markets and the broader economy would respond positively to the BOE cutting rates this week and signaling a succession of rate cuts to come."

In this article

Restaurant Brands International on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts' expectations as same-store sales of Popeyes, Burger King and Tim Hortons declined.

But the restaurant company is seeing sales turn around already.

"As we come into [the second quarter], that momentum has improved meaningfully, so we're seeing some better absolute results as we get into the second quarter that give us confidence in how we're going to navigate the rest of the year," CEO Josh Kobza told CNBC.

Shares of the company rose more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what Restaurant Brands reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Restaurant Brands reported first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $159 million, or 49 cents per share, down from $230 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding transaction costs related to its acquisition of Burger King China and other items, the company earned 75 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 21% to $2.11 billion, fueled by higher revenue from Popeyes and Firehouse Subs.

Restaurant Brands posted overall same-store sales growth of 0.1%. Excluding last year's leap day, its same-store sales would have risen about 1%, according to Kobza.

"We anticipated that Q1 would be our softest quarter of the year, and believe that some of the macro noise may have driven further softness," Kobza told analysts on the company's conference call.

The company's three largest brands saw same-store sales decline during the quarter and missed Wall Street's expectations. Other fast-food companies have reported a rough start to the year as weather and a more cautious consumer weighed on demand for their burgers and nuggets.

Tim Hortons, which accounts for more than 40% of Restaurant Brands' total quarterly revenue, reported that its same-store sales fell 0.1%, missing StreetAccount estimates of same-store sales growth of 1.4%. A year earlier, the Canadian coffee chain reported same-store sales growth of 6.9%.

Tim Hortons has "picked up a lot of speed" in the second quarter, Kobza said. On Monday, the chain launched a new breakfast meal in collaboration with actor — and Canadian — Ryan Reynolds.

Burger King's same-store sales shrank 1.3%, steeper than estimates of a 0.9% decline. The chain's U.S. business, which has been in turnaround mode for more than two years, saw same-store sales fall 1.1%.

Still, Burger King is outperforming its peers. Rival McDonald's saw its U.S. same-store sales shrink 3.6% in the first quarter. McDonald's executives said middle-income consumers weren't visiting fast-food restaurants as often, but Kobza told CNBC that Restaurant Brands saw consistent trends across income cohorts.

Popeyes saw its same-store sales slide 4%, the biggest drop of the quarter. Wall Street was anticipating same-store sales declines of just 1.8% for the fried chicken chain. Last year, Popeyes aired its first-ever Super Bowl commercial, helping to lift its quarterly same-store sales growth to 5.7%; the chain didn't return to advertising in the big game this year.

Demand was stronger outside of the U.S. and Canada. Restaurant Brands' international segment saw same-store sales growth of 2.6%.

The company reiterated its forecast for 2025, anticipating that it will spend between $400 million and $450 million on consolidated capital expenditures, tenant inducements and other incentives. Restaurant Brands also said that it still expects to reach its long-term algorithm, which projects 3% same-store sales growth and 8% organic adjusted operating income growth on average between 2024 and 2028.

Matthew LaBrot might seem to be an unlikely face of the Tesla resistance. He drives a Cybertruck and a Model Y and powers his home with the company's solar energy system. He trained Tesla employees how to sell the electric cars across North America. If you've watched one of the automaker's customer support videos, you might have seen him.

He called it his dream job.

But over the past two years, LaBrot, a self-described Democrat, became increasingly disenchanted with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. His feelings began to turn after Musk's purchase of Twitter, and they soured further over Musk's work for President Donald Trump. On April 24, LaBrot set up a website protesting Musk's leadership at Tesla. The next day, he took his Cybertruck to a Tesla Takedown protest in California. Less than 24 hours later, he was fired.

"I wasn't planning on working anywhere else," LaBrot told Business Insider. "I was very happy with my position, and I could have continued to work in that role my whole life."

While hundreds of protests outside Tesla facilities have sprung up across the country, Tesla employees have largely refrained from speaking publicly on the issue. LaBrot wants to change that.

LaBrot, 35, joined Tesla in 2019 after stints at Best Buy and Starbucks and in real estate. He rose quickly at the carmaker, eventually stepping into a program management role for sales and delivery training in North America.

He was initially drawn to the company because he believed in the mission of sustainable energy. He had always been impressed by Tesla's products and the people working there, he said. It also afforded him tremendous opportunities: He moved up the corporate ladder, and the company's stellar stock performance helped him purchase his first house in 2022.

He first began to question Musk's leadership after the billionaire took over Twitter, later rebranded as X, in 2022.

"Unfortunately, at that time, I chose the route of just stick my head in the sand," he said.

He said he found it harder to ignore when Musk began donating to Trump's campaign. Musk spent at least $277 million in political contributions supporting Trump and other Republican candidates ahead of the presidential election. He also held $1 million giveaways for voters who signed his super PAC's petition. Musk formally endorsed Trump on July 13.

LaBrot was especially offended by a salute Musk made during Trump's inauguration celebration in January, which LaBrot and other critics believed was a Nazi salute.

"When your CEO makes one of those decisions, it pulls the company along with it," LaBrot said.

After the salute, Musk suggested in a post on X that Democrats were behind the criticism. He later said in an interview with Joe Rogan that he's "not a Nazi."

In October of last year, Musk said he didn't think his political activities would affect Tesla, saying sales were at an all-time high. "I think people really care about the quality of the product as opposed to whether they agree or disagree with the CEO's views," he said. "The CEO of any given company is going to have political views. At the end of the day, what matters is if Tesla makes a great product, and people like buying great products."

LaBrot said his on-the-ground experience didn't support Musk's prediction.

"By election time, we really started to realize that these customers we'd expected to see weren't coming," LaBrot said. The end of the year is typically when Tesla sales are highest, he added, also saying the company had been hoping to overcome lackluster summer delivery numbers in the fourth quarter.

As foot traffic began to drop, LaBrot said, Tesla's sales training team was told it was more important than ever to win over each customer who came through the doors. Tesla began pushing more sales promotions and incentives, which was unusual, LaBrot said. Sales staff normally had to work through a backlog of customers; if one decided not to purchase, there was someone ready to take their place. Now, salespeople were fighting to close on every reservation.

LaBrot said he was used to handling the typical EV hurdles: range anxiety, misinformation, user error. But a CEO who had alienated left-leaning voters was a whole different challenge.

"We didn't have to do a ton of overcoming objections because those customers just stopped coming," LaBrot said.

Earlier this year, LaBrot said, Tesla's sales team hit another level of panic as EVs began piling up in sales lots. Even Tesla's refreshed Model Y wasn't selling as they'd hoped, he said. Tesla released the vehicle in January and already has a surplus of inventory, LaBrot said. It released a cheaper version of the refreshed Model Y on Tuesday.

In April, Tesla reported that its first-quarter delivery numbers dropped 13% from the same period the previous year. In California, a key market for the company, Tesla registrations fell more than 15% during that quarter.

Analysts say there are multiple factors at play when it comes to Tesla's sales, including customer alienation over Musk's political views, the company's aging vehicle lineup, increased competition from companies overseas, and the overall US electric vehicle market.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

By early 2025, LaBrot was growing increasingly frustrated with Tesla. He was unhappy with the company's lack of internal communication about how Musk's political views might be affecting sales numbers, as well as scant guidance around how sales workers should handle protests and vandalism.

"They're talking about struggling sales and how do we increase the close rate, without talking about this humongous elephant in the room," he said.

As the months went on, LaBrot said, he began to voice more of his concerns to his coworkers and in a meeting with other corporate sales staff. The tipping point came April 22, when Musk announced that he would be spending less time with the White House DOGE office and turning his attention back to Tesla.

Two days later, LaBrot posted his website, which he kept anonymous. It contained an open letter calling for Tesla to find a new CEO.

"When it went live, I felt so relieved, like a weight had been lifted," LaBrot said. "This statement I've been trying to put into words, been expressing in company meetings — finally publishing it was a really good feeling."

While the open letter was written as if it came from multiple Tesla employees, LaBrot said that he was the only author — but that some coworkers had expressed similar sentiments to his.

In conversations with more than a dozen current and former employees, many told BI they had concerns about Musk's leadership and political focus. Others largely shrugged off Musk's behavior. One longtime engineer said that while Musk might be the face of the company, his role was far removed from the day-to-day of the average Tesla employee.

On April 25, LaBrot spray-painted his Cybertruck with information about his website and the slogan "Pro Clean Energy Pro Sustainability Pro EV Pro Tesla Anti Elon" and displayed it outside a Tesla facility. He said it felt like a logical next step and a good way to draw attention to the letter.

The next day, he said, he received a call from Tesla's human resources department. He said he was told his employment was terminated for using company resources to build a website that did not align with the company's perspective. LaBrot denied that he used Tesla resources to build the site.

Since his firing, LaBrot has continued to attend Tesla protests and says he has received support from some former Tesla employees. He said that leaving Tesla had been a bitter pill to swallow but that he understood the risks when he launched the website.

Musk's politics aside, LaBrot says he remains a cheerleader for the brand.

"I still firmly believe in the company," he said, "and what we're working towards."

WASHINGTON – Senate Democrats blocked a bipartisan bill to create a legal framework for cryptocurrency after concerns about President Donald Trump's connections to the industry threw negotiations over the bill into chaos.

The chamber voted 48-49 on May 8, averting a final vote on the legislation. Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri, voted with all present Democrats against it. Hawley told reporters after the vote that he wanted "big tech prohibitions" in the legislation, while Paul raised concerns that regulations could hurt the industry.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune also voted against it in a procedural move that will allow it to come up for another vote.

The vote caps a week of frantic negotiations after a group of nine Democrats who had previously supported the bill abruptly announced on May 3 that they would no longer support the stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that the legislation didn't do enough to prevent money laundering and protect national security.

At least seven Democrats would be needed to pass the legislation in the Senate, where lawmakers need at least 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. The bill has been aggressively supported by crypto lobbyists and is expected to accelerate the currency's growth.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters after the vote that an updated bill text wasn't yet available after the days of negotiations. "How do you vote for a bill if you haven't seen the text?"

The change came after the Trump administration moved to support the crypto industry's growth in the United States, including creating a "strategic bitcoin reserve" and digital asset stockpile, and pulling back from a Biden-era crackdown on the industry.

At the same time, Trump family businesses with connections to crypto are benefiting.

Two cryptocurrency investments owned by Trump-affiliated entities have made at least $300 million in trading fees alone since January on sales of his meme coin and other digital currency.

In late April, a company affiliated with Trump promoted the $TRUMP meme coin by offering an “intimate private dinner” with the president at his northern Virginia golf club, after which the coin's value grew as much as 80%.

And another Trump family crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, announced on May 1 that one of its digital coins is being used by an Abu Dhabi government-backed investment firm for a $2 billion investment in cryptocurrency exchange Binance − a major outlay from a foreign government to the benefit of Trump's family.

A White House spokeswoman said Trump's "assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."

These moves have prompted investigations and a committee hearing walkout from Congressional Democrats in recent days.

"Donald Trump is selling cryptocurrency like snake oil in the Wild West, and he's put a for sale sign on the White House for his meme coin," Sen. Richard Blumenthal told USA TODAY. "People in America deserve to know how he is potentially under the influence of foreign governments and investors who are buying his crypto assets."

This limited-edition run of sparkling water is more for existing traders than crypto newcomers, but mainstream distribution is part of the plan.

There's now sparkling water that comes with an Abstract NFT and points attached.

Rekt Brands — a crypto startup from the traders known on X as OSF (Ovie Faruq) and RektMando on social media — has launched a new drink. It's a sparkling water dubbed Abstract Apple.

Like its name suggests, Abstract Apple offers rewards for the Ethereum L2 chain Abstract. Each case of 24 cans grants the buyer Abstract XP and 25,000 DRANK points (Rekt's rewards points), plus an Abstract NFT. Next week, case buyers can collect their Abstract NFTs. 

Each case costs $69.69 (plus shipping and applicable tax, of course), and can be bought using crypto or fiat currencies.

Buyers could purchase up to 250 cases per order, but could place multiple orders. 

That's a LOT of cans.

From Abstract team member Raj on X.

While the launch sold out on Wednesday, with over 220,000 cans of sparkling water purchased, the Rekt team said extra DRANK points were being given out by mistake.

“Devs are on it, will get it fixed,” the brand said in a post.

A member of the Abstract team confirmed to me that they aren't involved in this project, but they said that future collabs between Rekt and Abstract are being explored.

Rekt Brands' first drink, a lime-flavored sparkling water, was announced in November and similarly sold over 220,000 cans within 48 hours.

Rekt Brands previously raised $1.5 million in seeding funding late last year. Their brand was created following the 2022 NFT collection OSF launched called Rektguy.

Others have tried to bring crypto to the food and drink industry before, though the efforts thus far have primarily come from holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. There's Ape Water, for instance, which is canned water with a Bored Ape emblazoned across it. In 2023, Snoop Dogg released ice cream inspired by his Bored Ape.

There was also a short-lived Bored Ape-themed burger joint, Bored & Hungry, which I visited back in 2022 (food was good, but most of the people there had zero clue what the Apes were, and didn't care).

In the case of Rekt Brands, its limited-edition runs of sparkling water that you only hear about on Crypto Twitter don't seem to be targeting the masses — but broader distribution may be coming soon.

Rekt is planning to release new flavors and bring back older ones, too, in future drops. It may also expand beyond just sparkling water.

“Our goal is to have mainstream distribution and we have been actively working on it over the past few months. There will be a point where people can get their hands on Rekt in their local store,” OSF told me in a DM, adding: “Maybe for some that's sooner than they think.”

Nearly 67,000 crypto novices have pulled out their debit cards to bet on Trump's meme coin venture, a Post analysis found. So far it's been a monumental bust.

Rebecca Davis bought President Donald Trump's meme coin while lying in bed one January morning in Little Rock, scrolling through photos of a glitzy Trump inauguration gala called the “Crypto Ball.” The host of a local conservative radio show, she knew nothing about cryptocurrency but believed in Trump's business savvy. He “kind of knows how to make money,” she said.

Her $TRUMP coin's value climbed for a few days but has since plunged 85 percent from its peak. Though some coin holders, including Trump's allies, have profited handsomely on paper from the coin, she is not one of them; her $32 investment is now worth about $11.

“There was definitely a lot of influential people that had posted online about it that got me hyped up,” she said. “Then when it tanked, I was like, ‘Whoa, what the hell?'”

At least 67,000 new or small-time crypto investors like Davis have bet on Trump's meme coin, pouring $15 million into the volatile venture endorsed by Trump and benefiting his personal wealth, a Washington Post analysis found.

But virtually all of them bought near the coin's peak, just before the inauguration, and 80 percent of them have seen the value of their holdings nosedive, The Post's analysis shows. One buyer who spent $10,000 has already lost, on paper, more than $8,000.

The losses point to the risks for Trump supporters and crypto speculators eager to bet on the loosely regulated venture of the self-described “first crypto president.” But they also draw a stark contrast with the president's team, which has made millions in trading fees from transactions for the meme coin, even when its value goes down.

The meme coin has drawn strong criticism from congressional Democrats such as Sen. Jeff Merkley (Oregon), who this week unveiled legislation that would ban top government officials from benefiting from meme coins and other crypto assets. Merkley called it “profoundly corrupt” that “people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls.”

“This is an opportunity for the most blatant graft,” Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California) told CBS News this week, “ … and it's all out in the open.”

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump does not have a conflict of interest because his assets are held in a trust overseen by his sons. Asked if he was profiting off his cryptocurrency, Trump said in an NBC News interview Sunday, “I haven't even looked.”

Years before launching his meme coin, Trump had called cryptocurrencies a “scam” whose “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement saying that meme coins “typically have limited or no use or functionality” and that, given their “speculative nature,” the coins “tend to experience significant market price volatility.”

The Post analyzed data on the blockchain, a public and mostly anonymized log of crypto transactions, to identify a likely group of crypto neophytes: They used their debit cards to buy coins via a big “buy now” button on the Trump team's website, and did so only once.

Unlike the more established network of crypto speculators and insiders, this group includes amateur investors who saw the coin as a way to show loyalty to Trump or secure an early spot in one of the Trump family business's new financial ventures.

Crypto enthusiasts have a number of ways to grab up cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the $TRUMP meme coin. But The Post's analysis looked specifically at the more than 67,000 buyers who had acquired $TRUMP coins through MoonPay, the service linked directly from the Trump team's official site, gettrumpmemes.com, which allows for direct payments via a debit card.

Of the debit-card crypto buyers analyzed by The Post, the typical buyer spent $100 and has lost $62 — at least on paper, given that about half have yet to sell. Roughly 80 percent of buyers have seen their investment value drop substantially, the analysis found. Only about 3 percent of buyers have a gain, while the rest are about even.

Almost all of the winners bought their coins on the project's launch day, Jan. 18, two days before the inauguration, when trading began at about 18 cents. But most people bought in the days after, when the price spiked to as high as $75 before its months-long slump.

At least nine debit-card buyers spent about $10,000 or more and still hold the meme coins, having racked up unrealized losses of $6,000 or more.

Those kinds of steep losses can be found throughout the meme coin's holder base, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The firm told The Post that 58 investors have so far made more than $10 million each in profits from the coin, for a total of roughly $1.1 billion — but that 764,000 other investors, most of whom had small holdings, have lost money on the coin.

An affiliate of Trump's family business, the Trump Organization, runs the meme coin venture alongside a separate Delaware-registered company called Fight Fight Fight, named for Trump's rallying cry after an assassination attempt against him last year in Pennsylvania.

Those two entities own 80 percent of the coins, and the drop in value has affected their stake as well. But they have benefited from the coin in other ways, including by imposing 1 percent fees on purchases made through their official crypto transaction system, known as a liquidity pool.

Three Trump-affiliated wallets have received about $43 million in fees since the coin's debut, according to a Post analysis of data from Flipside. Those wallets have also made roughly $312 million in crypto sales.

Trump's crypto team last month advertised that the 220 biggest coin holders would be invited to join the president for a “night to remember” this month at Trump's golf club outside Washington, and that buyers could even see their place in the rankings via an online leaderboard. A Post analysis found that the top buyers have acquired roughly $225 million of $TRUMP coins since the offer of presidential access was announced.

The leaderboard's top spenders are anonymous, save for a short username and a crypto wallet address. But 88 of the top 220 buyers — those who would be invited to the dinner if the contest had ended Monday — probably are not Americans, The Post's analysis suggests. Their wallets show they received some of their Trump meme coins from Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange that says it does not accept customers in the United States.

A recent X post by Trump promoting the May 22 gala dinner has been viewed more than 30 million times. Trump also spoke at a separate dinner this week for “crypto & [artificial intelligence] innovators,” headlined by his crypto and AI czar David Sacks, that an invitation said cost $1.5 million per person to join.

The meme coin is separate from another Trump-brand venture, World Liberty Financial, which offers a crypto token named WLFI that calls itself “inspired by Donald J. Trump.” A World Liberty co-founder, Zach Witkoff, said last week that a venture fund backed by the Emirati government called MGX would conduct a $2 billion transaction using the firm's coins, delivering the Trump venture publicity and a hefty cut of the proceeds. (MGX and Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment.)

The $TRUMP team's meme coin dinner seems to have helped slow the coin's slide in price, though its value, at about $11, remains close to all-time lows.

That has not stopped buyers such as Freight Technologies, a Houston-based logistics firm, from announcing last week that it would buy up to $20 million in $TRUMP coins. Javier Selgas, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that the company saw it as an “effective way to advocate” its preferred trade policy.

The Post analyzed how novice meme coin buyers' holdings of $TRUMP fared since the launch of that coin in January 2025 through May 7 — in contrast with those whose engagement with the coin signaled a greater familiarity with cryptocurrency. The Post's analysis focused on wallets that bought $TRUMP only once, using the vendor's recommended method: the MoonPay payment processor and Moonshot meme coin app. The Post's analysis thus excluded anyone who bought $TRUMP with another cryptocurrency or with funds from sources such as Coinbase or Robinhood. It also excluded wallets that sold their $TRUMP more than once. The 67,000 novice $TRUMP buyers spent about $15 million total.

Reimagining Resort Ecosystems Through Tokenization and DeFi

WNC is on a mission to redefine the global resort and hospitality experience by integrating blockchain technology with real-world applications. Targeting the travel and tourism industries, WNC introduces a token-based infrastructure that enhances resort accessibility, streamlines payments, and potentially rewards user engagement through NFTs and smart contracts.

At the heart of WNC's innovation lies the fusion of digital asset management, decentralized finance (DeFi), and real estate tokenization. By using BEP-20-based smart contracts deployed on BNB Smart Chain, WNC empowers users to transact seamlessly, access exclusive resort benefits, and participate in an ecosystem that merges the physical and digital worlds.

The WNC ecosystem supports a proprietary payment system usable within partner resorts.

Enhancing Global Tourism with Real Estate Tokenization

WNC aims to drive economic revitalization in regions like Incheon and Yeongjongdo, leveraging real estate-backed digital assets to democratize access to resort ownership and benefits. By converting resort assets into tokenized shares on-chain, WNC aims to allow for fractional ownership, real-time profit distribution, and increased transparency for investors and users.

The platform also includes automated dispute resolution systems, smart contract-enforced bookings, and user protection frameworks, contributing to a secure and scalable digital experience.

Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to hit a new record high, with investment flows now the dominant market driver, according to Standard Chartered (STAN).

U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen $5.3 billion in inflows over the past three weeks, the investment bank said in emailed comments Thursday.

Adjusting for hedge fund basis trades, net real flow is estimated at over $4 billion, the bank said. The basis trade is a strategy that exploits the difference between the spot price of bitcoin and the price of the cryptocurrency in the futures market.

Strategy (MSTR) has increased its holdings to 555,450 BTC, or 2.6% of total future supply, which is locked at 21 million BTC. The company's plan to raise $84 billion to buy more of the world's largest cryptocurrency could bring its stash to over 6%, wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.

Next week's 13F filings may reveal further institutional adoption, Standard Chartered said. Abu Dhabi's sovereign fund already holds BlackRock's bitcoin ETF (IBIT), and both the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank have disclosed positions in MSTR.

New Hampshire passed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill this week, the first U.S. state to do so, which signals growing policy alignment, the report added.

Given these developments, a second-quarter bitcoin target of $120,000 may be too conservative, the bank said, citing its previous forecast.

The bank has a year-end bitcoin price target of $200,000.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $101,000 at publication time.

Bitcoin has finally retaken $100,000, but it's altcoins driving the crypto markets forward on Thursday.

Some smaller cryptocurrencies have clocked double-digit gains as bullish momentum builds.

Ethereum has gained 11% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing and has broken through $2,000 for the first time since March.

This marks a rare occasion where ETH is outperforming BTC, with the world's largest cryptocurrency, which has risen by a more modest 2.7%.

Both Dogecoin and Cardano have risen by more than 8%, with Sui rallying 13.8% and Bitcoin Cash trading 14.3% higher.

The top performer among the 100 biggest coins by market cap is Pudgy Penguins—up 27% since this time yesterday.

Thursday's gains have led to feverish speculation on X that "alt season" is coming, where altcoins outperform BTC.

But such talk might be a little premature—especially considering that Bitcoin's dominance, referring to its total share of the crypto market, remains stubbornly high at 64%.

Altcoins Likely to Outperform in 2025:

1. Potential ETF approvals2. Sustainable attention drivers3. Revenue-generating projects

The era of everything pumping is over. It's a selective altseason—most altcoins won't make it.

— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 25, 2025



Earlier this year, CryptoQuant analyst Ki Young Ju had warned that "the era of everything pumping is over," and "most altcoins won't make it."

He argued altcoins that are currently the subject of ETF filings—think XRP, Solana, Cardano and Litecoin—were most likely to outperform in 2025, along with "sustainable attention drivers" and "revenue-generating projects."

Santiment research recently revealed that mentions of "altcoins" and "altseason" on social media are growing on social media, and that could amount to a "red flag."

"History has actually shown that the most opportune entries into any sort of altcoin cycle are when the crowd is showing complete disinterest in altcoins," Brian Quinlivan wrote.

He went on to warn that "the transition from rational investing to speculative frenzy can be both swift and punishing," meaning traders should proceed with caution.

With Donald Trump's White House causing the markets to whipsaw as uncertainty over tariffs continues, it's difficult to compare this current crypto rally to past cycles. There's a sea of green today, but no guarantees of the same tomorrow.

Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick now believes Bitcoin could blow past his $120K forecast as investors keep pouring money into the crypto market.

Standard Chartered's Head of Digital Assets, Geoffrey Kendrick, is rethinking his bullish bitcoin forecast, and not because he was too optimistic.

“I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low,” Kendrick said Thursday in an email to clients, walking back his earlier prediction that bitcoin would peak around $120,000 in Q2 2025.

Just last month, Kendrick projected a new all-time high for bitcoin by mid-year, driven by “a strategic asset reallocation away from US assets” and accumulation by “whales” referring to major holders with large positions. 

But with bitcoin now hovering near $100,000 and surging more than 3% on the day to $99,293.54, Kendrick admits the rally has moved faster than expected.

“The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again,” Kendrick said. “It was correlation to risk assets … It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets. It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms.”

Among those flows: $5.3 billion in inflows to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs over the last three weeks, according to Kendrick. That kind of activity signals surging institutional interest — a trend that further strengthens bitcoin's new role as a macro asset in global portfolios.

Kendrick highlighted several heavyweight examples to support his revised stance: Strategy ramping up bitcoin buys, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund holding BlackRock's spot Bitcoin IBIT, and the Swiss National Bank reportedly holding shares of MSTR, often seen as a leveraged proxy for bitcoin itself.

Previously, bitcoin was often lumped in with high-risk U.S. tech stocks, mirroring their volatility. But with the current wave of institutional adoption, Kendrick believes bitcoin has taken on a new narrative—one that might carry it well beyond the $120,000 mark this summer, and toward his year-end forecast of $200,000.

“We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a fresh all-time high around USD 120,000 in Q2,” Kendrick had said earlier. Now, with BTC nearing six figures, that milestone might just be a stepping stone.

Trading volumes have surged by nearly 46% during this period as Pectra introduces significant positive changes to the EVM.

Pectra should also make the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) more scalable, faster, and cheaper. In addition, it makes ETH deflationary as a portion of transaction fees will now be burned.

Other critical changes made to the blockchain include the possibility of collecting validator rewards on up to 2048 staked tokens. This should supposedly attract more robust validator pools to increase the network's efficiency.

Moreover, the maximum number of blobs – data that can be included in a single Ethereum block – has been increased from 6 to 9. Higher blobs should expedite transactions for layer-two protocols like Arbitrum and will help them reduce transaction fees.

Finally, it will now be possible to have the recipient of a transaction pay for gas fees. This is particularly positive as it solves a recurrent issue where wallets were unable to transfer assets unless they had enough ETH to cover these fees.

Today's strong uptick is the second time that Ethereum has posted a big single-day gain in the past couple of weeks. On April 22, the token rose above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) and has stood above this key indicator since then.

Although positive momentum was weakening heading to the deployment of Pectra. However, today's jump has pushed ETH above its point of control (POC), which sat at $1,850. If the price closes above this level, bulls would now be in full control of the price action.

In a previous article, we set forth a $3,000 target for Ethereum after the token broke above its consolidation and stepped out of oversold levels in the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The past three times this has happened, the price has bounced strongly to the $3,000 – $4,000 level. These two recent bullish breakouts have now confirmed this bullish outlook.

The next target for ETH would be the 200-day EMA, which currently sits at $3,056. This translates into a 54.7% upside potential based on current levels.

Momentum indicators are quite strong and favor a bullish scenario as well. The RSI is now nearing overbought levels. Coming out of a strong downtrend, this is a big buy signal as it confirms that the trend reversal is strong enough to trigger the beginning of a bullish cycle.

In the hourly chart, the structure is quite bullish as well and there's significant room for a pullback so late buyers can still enter the rally. There are two big fair value gaps (FVGs) that could serve as support if the price drops in the following hours.

These fair value gaps typically act as magnets for the price as market participants look to fill outstanding buy orders. If order volumes are strong enough at these levels, these areas tend to trigger strong upward movements.

The RSI has already entered overbought levels while the MACD's histogram shows that positive momentum has been decelerating. This increases the odds of a strong drop in the following hours. However, traders should look for entries for a long position as the market's trend is as bullish as it gets.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Traders looking for tokens that may see accelerated gains as bitcoin (BTC) rallies might want to focus on ether (ETH) and the ratio between bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin.

Both have broken prolonged downtrends alongside bullish bottom formations in leading meme tokens DOGE and SHIB.

Ether's price has surged more than 8% today, piercing the trendline (see the left-hand chart) that represents the downtrend from December highs above $4,100. In other words, demand has finally managed to overpower the supply zone defined by the trendline, confirming a bullish shift in the market trend.

The three-line break chart (on the right) shows a similar breakout. The line break chartfocuses on price movements and changes in trend while ignoring time, helping traders filter out erratic price movements and noise. As a result, signals on the line break chart are considered more reliable and durable signals.

The breakout shifts focus to resistance between $2,300 and $2,400, the support zone from October and November.

The ratio between U.S. dollar prices for bitcoin cash and bitcoin has risen 11% this week, topping a trendline characterizing the brutal year-long bear market.

The bullish development suggests BCH outperformance relative to bitcoin in the coming days.

The market caps for DOGE and SHIB were up 7% and 5% at the time of writing, with their respective daily charts showcasing a "rounding bottom" pattern.

A rounding bottom happens after a significant downtrend, as in DOGE and SHIB's cases. and signals a shift to a bullish market. It shows a change from lower highs to higher lows, indicating that buying interest is starting to increase.

WASHINGTON – Congressional Democrats are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump's personal connections to the cryptocurrency industry, and that's throwing a wrench in bipartisan efforts to regulate the digital currency.

Two of the cryptocurrency investments owned by Trump-affiliated entities have made at least $300 million in trading fees alone on sales of his meme coin and other digital currency since January.

In late April, a company affiliated with Trump promoted the $TRUMP meme coin by offering an “intimate private dinner” with the president at his northern Virginia golf club, after which the coin's value grew as much as 80%.

And another Trump family crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, announced on May 1 that one of its digital coins is being used by an Abu Dhabi government-backed investment firm for a $2 billion investment in cryptocurrency exchange Binance − a major outlay from a foreign government to the benefit of Trump's family.

At the same time, the administration is moving to support the crypto industry's growth in the United States, including creating a "strategic bitcoin reserve" and digital asset stockpile, and pulling back from a Biden-era crackdown on the industry.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, too, had planned to advance legislation this week to create a regulatory framework for stablecoin, a type of crypto linked to the value of another asset like the dollar, in order to remain stable. The bill has been aggressively supported by crypto lobbyists and is expected to accelerate the currency's growth.

But nine Democrats who had previously supported the bill abruptly announced on May 3 that they would no longer support the stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that the legislation doesn't do enough to prevent money laundering and protect national security.

At least seven Democrats would be needed to pass the legislation in the Senate, where lawmakers need at least 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, repeatedly told reporters only that "Democrats and Republicans are talking to each other about the bill," while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said the Senate will proceed with a vote regardless.

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, walked out of a House committee hearing on cryptocurrency on May 6 "because of the corruption of the president of the United States and his ownership of crypto and his oversight of all the agencies."

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, called for an Office of Government Ethics investigation into the president's crypto connections, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, launched his own investigation into Trump's profits.

Blumenthal demanded information about the business structures and potential conflicts of interest of World Liberty Financial and Fight Fight Fight (the Trump-linked business that owns the $TRUMP memecoin) in letters on May 6, which were viewed by USA TODAY.

"Donald Trump is selling cryptocurrency like snake oil in the Wild West, and he's put a for sale sign on the White House for his meme coin," Blumenthal said. "People in America deserve to know how he is potentially under the influence of foreign governments and investors who are buying his crypto assets."

Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and Schumer plan to introduce a bill on May 7 that would ban the president, vice president, members of Congress and their families from creating crypto assets. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who is also a co-sponsor of the GENIUS Act.

"This is not a situation where somebody is passing a few thousand dollars under the table as a bribe. This is a situation where – on the table, in full view of the public – the president is selling access to his office," Merkley told USA TODAY. "If we're going to have any credibility in working for the people, we have to end this vastly corrupt enterprise the president's engaged in."

While Democrats remain the minority in both the House and Senate, the filibuster gives Democrats some leverage over legislation's fate in the upper chamber.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement that Trump is "dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world."

"His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest," she said.

It's not just Democrats who have raised concerns about the crypto legislation in the Senate. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, and Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said this week that they're not sure if they can support the GENIUS Act.

Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, the primary sponsor of the legislation, said he is negotiating with Democrats to get their support for the bill. After months of work, he said, "we're very close to having everything concluded and I expect it to be concluded by the end of the week."

Bhutan will soon allow the use of cryptocurrencies in the tourism sector. The country has announced the launch of a crypto payment system that lets users make crypto payments using Binance Pay. The aim is to incentivise tourists with cheaper alternatives to dodge currency exchange rates and limitations in the acceptability of international cards. Tourism generates a major chunk of revenue for Bhutan, and the country is now looking to make it more economical for visitors and travellers.

Individuals planning a trip to Bhutan will now be able to make crypto payments for flight tickets, visa fees, hotel stays, monument visits, tour guides, and street-shopping.

Along with Binance, DK Bank — Bhutan's first fully digital bank — is also part of the programme. The bank has already onboarded over 100 merchants in Bhutan who have agreed to accept payments in the form of crypto tokens.

Travellers looking to use crypto for payments must first sign up on the Binance app. While booking tickets and hotels will be similar to regular online bookings, for retail purchases they will have to scan integrated QR codes provided by merchants.

DK Bank will act as a fully licensed local bank, managing crypto settlements on the ground. It will provide instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for over a hundred tokens including Bitcoin and the USDC among others for the tourists.

"This partnership creates new economic pathways for Bhutan's communities, especially small vendors and rural artisans who may never have had access to card terminals or payment infrastructure before," said an announcement post from Binance.

In September 2024, Arkham Intelligence claimed that Bhutan was accumulating Bitcoin from the BTC mining operations run by Druk Holdings. This entity is the investment arm of the Kingdom of Bhutan.

In December last year, the country recognised crypto assets as a legitimate asset class within its Gelephu Mindfulness City, an economic hub located in southern Bhutan. No digital assets are currently recognised as a legal tender in Bhutan.

Self-described internet warlord Derek Smart posted a blog earlier this spring. No, it's not about Line of Defense; the last word about that game was last year. No, it's not about Alganon either; word on that has also been silent as of last year even as Smart promised a relaunch this year. What this blog is about, then, is his personal blockchain project, the ACE Platform.

Summarizing ACE as an “all chain engagement platform” and a “rewards-driven online virtual world hub” designed to retain users, Smart says the goal is to grant users rewards for doing things like connecting external accounts to the platform, engaging in activities in its online social world, and playing ACE-compliant games. “The platform was designed first and foremost to be a virtual town hall of engagement opportunities in which all technologies are seamlessly integrated and abstracted,” the site claims. “Just have fun with your friends and we'll take care of the rest.”

The site's video link button is also literally a rickroll, so there's that.


Smart's blog post about ACE effectively claims the platform is an answer to several problems with Web3 and blockchain gaming, all of which he says he predicted years before things started to collapse in the P2E and crypto gaming spheres. Even so, he's apparently very deeply committed to blockchain tech overall and celebrates a partnership that doesn't require minting a new token.

“I have always felt that the end result of doing a token would put my project right where we are today in Web3 whereby gaming tokens — all of them, no exceptions — were designed to line the pockets of those who benefited the most, while leaving an otherwise engaged community holding the proverbial empty bag and likely with nothing to show for their engagement or funding.”

As for ACE itself, an offered explainer PDF appears to be aimed at investors, though it also points out that it's “a massively multiplayer online world” and “not a game.” And that probably isn't by mistake, as the close of Smart's blog appears to suggest this is his last swing at the games industry.

“Those of us in Web3 gaming are well aware that things aren't working, but few seem to want to buck the status quo trend because the road less traveled isn't for the feint at heart; it's for pioneers and those who dare to defy,” Smart concludes. “And so, here I am, once again at the cusp of one of my greatest challenges, and what I believe to be my last hoorah, if you will.”

In this article

A Standard Chartered analyst who predicted bitcoin hitting $120,000 by the second quarter now says his price call is "too low."

"I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low," Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, said in a tongue-in-cheek comment shared with clients via email Thursday.

Last month, Kendrick wrote a note saying that he expects bitcoin to reach an all-time high of around $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025 on the back of a "strategic asset reallocation away from US assets" and "accumulation by 'whales' (major holders)."

"We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a fresh all-time high around USD 120,000 in Q2," Kendrick said at the time. "We see gains continuing through the summer, taking BTC-USD towards our year-end forecast of 200,000."

On Thursday, Kendrick said his $120,000 bitcoin price call now "looks very achievable" and that this may even be too low a target.

"The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again," the Standard Chartered analyst said. "It was correlation to risk assets ... It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets."

"It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms," he added.

His comments come as bitcoin once again topped the $100,000 level. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading up by 4.5% at $$100,511.22, according to Coin Metrics.

In recent years, analysts have picked up on a pattern that shows bitcoin trading in a similar way to risk assets such as U.S. technology stocks — the rationale being that increased inflows of more institutional capital into bitcoin makes it more prone to the same market risks equity markets face.

Kendrick — who has long held a bullish position on the cryptocurrency — said that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen $5.3 billion of inflows in the past three weeks, suggesting more institutional money is piling in.

He pointed to several examples of large investors allocating part of their portfolios to bitcoin, including software firm MicroStrategy ramping up bitcoin purchases, the Abu Dhbai sovereign wealth fund holding BlackRock's IBIT bitcoin ETF, and the Swiss National Bank buying shares of MicroStrategy.

MicroStrategy is widely considered a proxy for bitcoin.

 Blockchain project Space and Time, backed by Microsoft, has launched its permissionless mainnet for ZK-proven data infrastructure. 

Space and Time, a blockchain project supported by Microsoft, has launched its public, permissionless mainnet to bring zero-knowledge (ZK)-proven data infrastructure to crypto applications.

Built by MakeInfinite Labs, Space and Time offers a decentralized, verifiable database for smart contracts to query historical, crosschain and offchain data, according to a news release shared with Cointelegraph.

The platform indexes data from major networks like Ethereum and makes it accessible through a decentralized network of validators. Developers can query this data using Space and Time's Proof of SQL — a sub-second ZK coprocessor that delivers cryptographic proofs with every query.

“Prior to Space and Time, onchain applications had no way to query basic user data from a database of blockchain activity without introducing security risks and tampering,” said Scott Dykstra, co-founder at Space and Time.

He added that developers can now build onchain apps with built-in security, using cryptographic proofs to connect cloud databases to smart contracts.

Dykstra said prominent financial institutions, major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google BigQuery, and some of the biggest projects in crypto, including Chainlink, Sui and ZKsync, have either integrated or are building with tools or data services in the Space and Time ecosystem.

He also told Cointelegraph that SXT, the native utility token for Space and Time, is planned for release on May 8.

“Space and Time mainnet is permissionless, and we encourage the community to join the network as validators and delegated stakers,” Dykstra said.

He added that the testnet had more than 30 validators worldwide, including in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America.

MakeInfinite Labs (previously Space and Time Labs), the original contributors to Space and Time, held a strategic round led by Microsoft in 2022. They also supported the follow-on Series A round in 2024.

MakeInfinite Labs has also contributed to other projects within the crypto space, including Blitzar and the Chainlink DeFi Yield Index.

Pat O'Toole, now chief marketer at youth-enrichment company Unleashed Brands, explains how the CMO role continues to evolve.

During Pat O'Toole's two-year stint as chief marketing officer of Burger King, the fast-food chain leaned into artifical intelligence-powered customization, gamified its loyalty program and looked to extend the shelf life of viral successes. 

All of those tactics could prove helpful as O'Toole embarks on a new journey as CMO of Unleashed Brands, a youth-enrichment company with a portfolio of brands that includes Urban Air Adventure Park, The Little Gym and Sylvan Learning. 

The executive, who spent nearly 15 years at PepsiCo, including a stint as CMO of Mountain Dew, brings experience in brand strategy, innovation and franchise marketing to Unleashed Brands, explained Founder and CEO Michael Browning, Jr.

“Marketing is at the core of Unleashed Brands' growth and we have ambitious goals for 2025 that rely on leveraging data-driven insights and innovative strategies to move our brands forward,” Browning, Jr. said in a press release announcing the appointment.

Marketing Dive caught up with O'Toole about how his new role compares to his previous ones, how he's approaching AI and how CMOs must navigate risks as the position continues to evolve.

The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

PAT O'TOOLE: It is and it isn't. It's bringing a lot of consumer focus and consumer centricity to young, evolving brands, and some older, more established brands. You really learn and develop consumer centricity when you're in the companies that I've worked at, and so that's always going to be at the forefront. 

What's interesting about this [role] is, you've got your users of the brand, the kids, and then you also have decision makers, or co-users of the brand in some cases. Parents come to Urban Air as well, but they have a very different experience than their kids. What are the different drivers there? 

At Pepsi, we used to talk about Doritos as you have to win the shopper mom at Kroger, but you have to have your consumer, teens, in the case of Doritos, asking for that product. There are definitely similarities there, but the decision-making process is very different. The hundreds of QSR occasions that a consumer has in a year are much different than the weekend-centric occasions that we have in a brand like Urban Air or the really deep decision making and the higher-involvement decision making that goes into signing up for a tutoring program at Sylvan. 

The fun part about this job is finding the intersection of how the brands hang together, and how we build strength in one brand and translate that strength across our brands. So if you have an amazing experience at Urban Air, but you're also looking for something else that's going to help build their confidence and their social skills, this company has Little Gym or Premiere Martial Arts. Look at some of the great houses of brands that have these trust marks — that's what we're looking to build here. 

[Unleashed has] added one to two brands every year over the past several years, and as you bring them in and integrate them, you get better at it each time, and you find the efficiencies that exist. Some are right there in front of you, and some are a little bit more difficult to find. 

We start from a creative standpoint with our agency roster and our in-house creative team. How do we most efficiently get that work set up and then find creative best practices? We have a shared services model, and then the brand teams as well. How do you set up the teams from a marketing perspective to unlock creative best practices, to work with partners that they can carry across all brands? As we get more scale with media partners, media buying efficiency is a big unlock that we can have. How do we reach consumers at scale?

Some of the things that we're looking to build are the platforms that we need to invest in so consumers can more easily move between our brands. We look at best practices. We love what Marriott is doing with Bonvoy. Whether or not it's loyalty or just one destination that you go to for all of the brands, we think that's going to be an important thing to build as we not only try to bring all of our brands forward to interested consumers, but also as we bring new brands into the portfolio, to be able to quickly plug them in to our systems.

I've been a part of a lot of the things that have been in the hype cycle in marketing. I might have done some stuff in the metaverse or some consumer facing NFT program. As I look at this, it's different. 

How do you sort through all the data that we have? Just at Urban Air alone, we have 20 million visitors a year, and that probably equates to about 10 million families. How do we learn as much as we can about those families across all of our brands, and how do we use tools like AI to really hone our insights and personalize connections? As families start to move across our brands, we can understand [them] better than most companies out there because of the types of relationships that we have. 

We have high household penetration brands like Urban Air, but then you also have high frequency brands like Little Gym. New moms have kids for the first time and they get their kids into Little Gym, and it's a great way for moms to connect with other moms as they're entering a new life phase. We're collecting insights on moms, on kids, on family dynamics, and AI is going to help us really not only understand and segment those families, but communicate with them and anticipate their needs.

From me personally, you'll see fewer Million Dollar Whoppers or custom jingles, and you'll see a lot more using AI to help us understand and engage with our consumer base.

The marketing function is changing, largely because of advances in technology in the media landscape. I think it's evolving more than any of the other C-suite jobs out there. With the rate in which it's changing, it's our job to stay on top of what's happening in the marketplace and really be smart about how we understand it.

What's changing is you have to be a technologist, and you have to always be looking to learn and understand how to adapt and integrate technology into what you're doing, and then how do you thoughtfully bring it into your organization and align your other stakeholders, both in the C-suite and across the organization. What matters to our business? What's going to impact it? How do we thoughtfully experiment? How do you really embrace your CFOs, your CEOs? 

I always talk about the 70-20-10 [rule], the way we looked at things at PepsiCo: Seventy percent is going to be what we know is tried-and-true and works for this business. Twenty percent is what we call validated, new things that we're probably on the cutting edge of. Maybe it's an AI now, or TikTok or even influencers. It's becoming part of our mix, and will probably become part of that 70% that we know works. And then there's that 10% where you invest resources, whether it's time or people, into that next thing that's in the vanguard and the frontier. 

You can't just do that on a marketing island. It is a different frontier, and I think the CMO has an important job building consensus and being the advocate for some of the change that's happening in the consumer landscape.

Marketers [are used] to being accused of wasting money and jumping into pet projects, and you really have to lay out why we're doing this. There was a reason behind my ventures into NFTs and my ventures into the metaverse. It's really important that people don't see it and think, “There goes marketing, trying to do something cool to get an article written about us.” It's more about thoughtfully trying to think about how to stay ahead of where consumers are and give ourselves a competitive advantage. For every AI, there's an NFT, so you have to thoughtfully experiment in that space, but also not do it at the detriment of the business that you're trying to build.

The widespread power outages that recently plunged Portugal and Spain into darkness shed light on the enduring value of cash during critical situations. This event also prompted questions about the truly decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, given its reliance on centralized electricity infrastructure.

BeInCrypto spoke with representatives from CertiK, Brickken, Wanchain, and Money on Chain to learn what this means for public trust in crypto and what the sector needs to provide financial services around the clock, even when centralized distribution channels fail.

A significant power disruption last week left millions in the dark across Spain and Portugal, with knock-on effects in parts of France and Morocco.

According to research from the Baker Institute, Spain lost approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity in just five seconds, equivalent to 60% of its national electricity demand. The outages lasted for about 18 hours. 

Without internet and electricity, daily financial instruments like home banking services, digital wallets, and ATMs became obsolete.

“When‬‭ power‬‭ grids‬‭ fail,‬‭ the‬‭ entire‬‭ ecosystem‬‭ behind‬‭ these‬‭ systems‬‭ grinds‬‭ to‬‭ a‬ halt:‬‭ Mobile‬‭ phones‬‭ can't‬‭ connect,‬‭ ATMs‬‭ shut‬‭ down,‬‭ and‬‭ internet-based‬‭ wallets‬‭ become‬‭ inaccessible.‬‭ In‬‭ such‬‭ moments,‬‭ the‬‭ digital‬‭ economy‬‭ exposes‬‭ a‬‭ key‬‭ vulnerability—without‬‭ electricity, the convenience of tech-driven finance collapses,” Natalie Newson, Senior Blockchain Investigator at CertiK, told BeInCrypto. 

‬During those hours, cash won back the throne of preferred payment. 

“This‬‭ is‬‭ why‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ physical‬‭ cash‬‭ remains‬‭ critical,‬‭ not‬‭ only‬‭ in‬‭ developing‬‭ countries‬‭ but‬‭ also‬‭ in‬‭ developed‬‭ nations— as‬‭ seen‬‭ during‬‭ recent‬‭ outages‬‭ in‬‭ Europe.‬‭ Digital‬‭ systems,‬‭ whether‬ centralized‬‭ or‬‭ decentralized,‬‭ are‬‭ ultimately‬‭ dependent‬‭ on‬‭ power‬‭ and‬‭ connectivity.‬‭ Cash‬‭ provides‬‭ a reliable fallback in scenarios where digital tools fail,” ‭Manuel Ferrari, Co-founder of Money On Chain,‬ told BeInCrypto.

The episode also raised questions over crypto's usability during times of crisis.

The demonstrated need for paper currency during infrastructure disruptions suggests that even though crypto is a modern financial innovation, it still falls short of its predecessors during challenging circumstances.

Even with its core principle of decentralization, blockchain technology relies significantly on centralized infrastructure.

“For‬‭ example,‬‭ most‬‭ blockchain‬‭ nodes‬‭ are‬‭ hosted‬‭ on‬‭ a‬‭ small‬‭ number‬‭ of‬‭ centralised‬‭ cloud‬‭ providers‬‭ like‬‭ AWS.‬‭ This‬‭ not‬‭ only‬‭ creates‬‭ single‬‭ points‬‭ of‬‭ failure,‬‭ but‬‭ also‬‭ exposes‬ blockchain‬‭ networks‬‭ to‬‭ external‬‭ control.‬‭ Fundamentally,‬‭ blockchain‬‭ runs‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ Internet.‬‭ Without‬‭ the‬‭ Internet,‬‭ blockchain‬‭ doesn't‬‭ work.‬‭ And‬‭ the‬‭ Internet‬‭ is‬‭ centrally‬‭ governed‬‭ by‬‭ ISPs‬‭ and‬‭ is‬‭ subject‬‭ to‬‭ geopolitical‬‭ pressures.‬‭ More‬‭ subtly,‬‭ many‬‭ blockchains‬‭ also‬‭ operate‬‭ with‬‭ only‬‭ one‬‭ or‬‭ two‬‭ client‬‭ implementations,‬‭ meaning‬‭ that‬‭ any‬‭ flaw‬‭ or‬‭ bug‬‭ in‬‭ that‬‭ client‬‭ software‬‭ can‬‭ impact‬‭ the‬‭ entire network,” Wanchain CEO Temujin Louie told BeInCrypto. 

The same limitations apply to the applications that manage crypto assets and process transactions.

“‬The‬‭ blockchain‬‭ may‬‭ be‬‭ decentralized,‬‭ but‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ not.‬‭ Most‬‭ users‬‭ depend‬‭ on‬‭ internet‬ service‬‭ providers,‬‭ centralized‬‭ exchanges,‬‭ and‬‭ mobile‬‭ devices—all‬‭ of‬‭ which‬‭ are‬‭ tied‬‭ to‬‭ national‬ power‬‭ grids‬‭ and‬‭ telecom‬‭ systems.‬‭ Without‬‭ these‬‭ utilities,‬‭ the‬‭ decentralized‬‭ promise‬‭ of‬‭ crypto‬‭ becomes practically irrelevant for the average user,” Newson added.

Cryptocurrency might inadvertently weaken public trust in its capabilities by not functioning as a genuine alternative financial solution when needed most.

Suppose cryptocurrency can't provide a functional financial alternative precisely when traditional systems falter due to events like power outages. In that case, it risks losing public faith in its ability to be a viable and superior financial system in the long run.

“‬Public‬‭ trust‬‭ depends‬‭ on‬‭ perceived‬‭ reliability.‬‭ If‬‭ crypto‬‭ is‬‭ seen‬‭ as‬‭ something‬‭ that‬‭ fails‬‭ under‬‭ stress,‬‭ users‬‭ may‬‭ hesitate‬‭ to‬‭ rely‬‭ on‬‭ it.‬‭ This‬‭ is‬‭ especially‬‭ true‬‭ for‬‭ people‬‭ who‬‭ are‬‭ still‬‭ new‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ space,” Felipe D'Onofrio, Chief Technology Officer at Brickken‬, told BeInCrypto.

Trust in payment methods grows from their ease of use, so if crypto wallets become inaccessible during emergencies, individuals might be reluctant to use them as their main way to pay.

Still, experiencing these issues now can pave the way for future enhancements.

“These‬‭ events‬‭ can‬‭ also‬‭ highlight‬‭ weaknesses‬‭ that‬‭ lead‬‭ to‬‭ better‬‭ solutions.‬‭ Just‬‭ like‬‭ the‬‭ early‬‭ internet‬‭ had‬‭ to‬‭ overcome‬‭ outages,‬‭ crypto‬‭ is‬‭ still‬‭ evolving to meet the demands of the real world,” D'Onofrio added.

Existing features within crypto technology already enable some offline uses, and expanding on these could provide a clear direction for development.

Certain existing cryptocurrency systems have already incorporated a few design features that mitigate their reliance on a stable power grid.

‬”Some‬‭ hardware‬‭ wallets‬‭ with‬‭ long‬‭ battery‬‭ life‬‭ and‬‭ offline‬‭ capabilities‬‭ offer‬‭ a‬‭ glimpse‬‭ of‬ resilience,‬‭ especially‬‭ in‬‭ peer-to-peer‬‭ transfers,” Newson said. 

While D'Onofrio pointed to other available tools, he clarified that they lack the widespread adoption and user-friendliness needed for broad use.

“There‬‭ are‬‭ some‬‭ interesting‬‭ developments‬‭ out‬‭ there,‬‭ like‬‭ satellite‬‭ nodes,‬‭ mesh‬‭ networks,‬‭ or‬‭ ultra-low-power‬‭ wallets.‬‭ These‬‭ systems‬‭ are‬‭ working‬‭ toward‬‭ more‬‭ resilience,‬‭ but‬‭ they're‬‭ not‬‭ yet‬‭ widely‬‭ adopted.‬‭ Right‬‭ now,‬‭ most‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ crypto‬‭ ecosystem‬‭ still‬‭ relies‬‭ on‬‭ traditional‬‭ infrastructure.‬‭ The‬‭ blockchain‬‭ can‬‭ survive‬‭ offline,‬‭ but‬‭ the‬‭ tools‬‭ most‬‭ users‬‭ depend on are not built for that kind of environment yet,” he said. 

Similar considerations arose when discussing the potential of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) to lessen overall dependence on centralized electricity grids.

DePINs have gained significant traction in the crypto sector over the last year due to their potential to decentralize various services using blockchain and token rewards to manage, own, and operate infrastructure. Today, the DePIN industry boasts a market capitalization of over $19 billion and more than $1 billion in trading volumes.

These networks are increasingly facilitating network connectivity and community-based access to electricity. Some experts suggested this technology could help lessen the impact of outages affecting centralized distribution channels.

“DePINs,‬‭ in‬‭ theory,‬‭ might‬‭ enhance‬‭ grid‬‭ resilience,‬‭ potentially‬‭ reducing‬‭ the‬‭ likelihood‬‭ of‬‭ countrywide‬‭ power‬‭ outages.‬‭ They‬‭ introduce‬‭ a‬‭ level‬‭ of‬‭ flexibility‬‭ and‬‭ programability‬‭ that‬‭ could‬‭ theoretically‬‭ facilitate‬‭ demand-response‬‭ programs‬‭ or‬‭ incentivise‬‭ people‬‭ to‬‭ adjust‬‭ their‬‭ energy‬‭ usage‬‭ during‬‭ peak‬‭ times,” Louie pointed out.

At the same time, he pointed out that DePINs alone cannot provide a complete solution to massive issues like widespread power outages.

“However,‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ far‬‭ too‬‭ early‬‭ to‬‭ think‬‭ of‬‭ DePINs‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ comprehensive‬‭ solution‬‭ that‬‭ can‬‭ singlehandedly‬‭ solve‬‭ a‬‭ country's‬‭ power‬‭ stability‬‭ issues.‬‭ Rather,‬‭ focus‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ targeted‬‭ integration‬‭ of‬‭ DePINs‬‭ into‬‭ existing‬‭ grid‬‭ infrastructure‬‭ to‬‭ help‬‭ alleviate‬‭ stress‬‭ on the grid and demonstrate the worth of DePINs in a real-world setting,” Louie added.

From his perspective, D'Onofrio stated that DePINs could provide a more complete solution when combined with other tools that bolster local resilience to these threats.

“We're‬‭ likely‬‭ to‬‭ see‬‭ more‬‭ integration‬‭ with‬‭ decentralized‬‭ infrastructure,‬‭ like‬‭ community-run‬‭ mesh‬‭ networks‬‭ or‬‭ solar-powered‬‭ nodes.‬‭ If‬‭ combined‬‭ with‬‭ tools‬‭ like‬‭ delayed-broadcast‬‭ wallets‬‭ or‬‭ peer-to-peer‬‭ communication‬‭ protocols,‬‭ these‬‭ systems‬‭ could‬‭ keep‬‭ crypto‬‭ activity‬‭ going‬‭ even‬‭ when‬‭ traditional‬‭ services‬‭ are‬‭ down.‬‭ It's‬‭ about‬‭ building‬‭ more‬‭ localized‬‭ resilience into the global system,” he said.‭

Despite their differences, crypto and traditional finance ultimately grapple with many of the same underlying problems when operating during infrastructure disruptions.

Last week's power outages in the Iberian Peninsula underscored the enduring importance of cash as a financial lifeline in times of crisis. With global economic systems increasingly depending on digital finance, experts emphasized policymakers' need to develop lasting solutions that ensure infrastructure resilience and emergency preparedness.

“‬Policymakers‬‭ must‬‭ treat‬‭ infrastructure‬‭ resilience‬‭ as‬‭ the‬‭ bedrock‬‭ of‬‭ digital‬‭ finance.‬‭ That‬‭ includes‬‭ diversifying‬‭ energy‬‭ sources,‬‭ supporting‬‭ local‬‭ microgrids,‬‭ incentivizing‬‭ offline‬‭ crypto‬‭ solutions,‬‭ and‬‭ ensuring‬‭ regulatory‬‭ frameworks‬‭ accommodate‬‭ these‬‭ technologies.‬‭ In‬‭ a‬‭ crisis,‬‭ access‬‭ matters‬‭ more‬‭ than‬‭ innovation—preparing‬‭ now‬‭ ensures‬‭ digital‬‭ systems‬‭ stay‬‭ functional‬‭ when‬‭ they're‬‭ needed most,” Newson concluded.

Moving forward, the strength of the digital economy will be determined by its physical infrastructure, and prioritizing this could position crypto for long-term success.

Robinhood is about to shake up the finance world again. The trading app is planning to build its own blockchain platform to enable European investors to trade tokenized U.S. securities.

The idea is as bold as it is historic: turn stocks and ETFs into blockchain-based assets, and open access to more than 8K U.S.-listed securities for a brand-new audience overseas.

Add in Robinhood's recent acquisition of Bitstamp, a leading European crypto exchange, and the plan looks even more serious.

If Robinhood succeeds, the door will be wide open for a new wave of blockchain-powered platforms, assets, and tools. And that could be huge news for some of the best altcoins in the market.

Robinhood is reportedly developing its own blockchain or a blockchain-based platform that would allow Europeans to trade tokenized U.S. securities like stocks and ETFs.

That's not just innovation – it's disruption on a global scale.

It also means faster settlements, 24/7 access, and greater transparency thanks to the blockchain infrastructure.

According to reports, Robinhood may use an existing network like Arbitrum, Solana, or Ethereum to power the new platform, while working alongside an experienced digital asset partner to get it done.



The decision follows a wider trend in traditional finance, where firms like Franklin Templeton and Apollo have already launched tokenized investment vehicles. Even Coinbase has expressed strong interest in entering the space.

Meanwhile, Robinhood's acquisition of Bitstamp – one of the oldest and most trusted crypto exchanges in Europe – signals a serious commitment to this expansion. This isn't a moonshot. It's a full-on mission.

And with all this in motion, a few promising new crypto projects are already catching fire.

The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn't just fuel for a crypto wallet – it's the cornerstone of a growing Web3 ecosystem designed to serve the next wave of digital finance users.

Currently priced around $0.025, $BEST is in an exclusive crypto presale that's already raised over $12M, and for good reason.

It's the native token of Best Wallet – a next-generation app built to replace outdated interfaces like MetaMask.

This isn't just a wallet – it's an all-in-one Web3 gateway with powerful features like staking, swaps, support for 60+ chains in the pipeline, and a tool called ‘Upcoming Tokens,' which offers direct, secure access inside the app.



Holding $BEST unlocks real utility: reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, early access to token launches, and governance rights within the ecosystem.

Security-wise, Best Wallet is no slouch – it's built using Fireblocks' MPC-CMP wallet tech, ensuring multi-party computation security that's miles ahead of traditional seed-phrase wallets.

As for where $BEST could be headed? Forecasts put the token's 2025 price as high as $0.072. If Robinhood's blockchain opens the floodgates for tokenized stocks, $BEST might be holding the keys.

The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the fuel behind a bold new platform that's merging AI, content creation, and decentralized finance.

In a world where everything from art to stocks is being tokenized, $SUBBD aims to revolutionize how we interact with digital content – specifically subscriptions.

Priced at around $0.055 and already raising over $300K in its presale, $SUBBD is building a next-gen platform where followers and not just creators get value.



$SUBBD is the first AI-driven subscription platform that empowers users to generate content using AI avatars, realistic images, and short videos – all with the blessing of original creators.

But it's not just cool tech. Buying SUBBD Token gives you staking options with up to 20% APY, unlocks premium content access, and supports instant crypto payments with low fees.

In short, $SUBBD isn't just riding the wave of tokenized finance – it's also carving out a whole new category of AI-enhanced user utility.

If Robinhood is laying the tracks for tokenized U.S. securities, $SUBBD is building the high-speed content train that rides alongside.

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is an ambitious project fusing two of the hottest trends in tech – artificial intelligence and blockchain.

Built on the Ethereum network, Dawgz AI is developing a decentralized platform centered around AI-driven tools for trading, automation, and user engagement.



At its core is the proprietary Blackbox AI trading engine, designed to analyze market data and autonomously execute trades around the clock. The goal? To optimize strategies and deliver consistent returns to users.

Currently priced at $0.004, the token has already raised over $3.4M in its presale. Early buyers can stake their $DAGZ to earn passive rewards, and there's no vesting – presale participants receive full access to their tokens immediately.

With meme contests, social challenges, and an ecosystem built to be fun and engaging, Dawgz AI is more than just a trading bot – it's aiming to be a hub for creative, tech-savvy users.

The project has been audited by SolidProof, adding a layer of trust and transparency.

In a tokenized world where Robinhood is putting stocks on-chain, Dawgz AI is carving out its space at the intersection of AI utility and meme coins momentum.

Robinhood's blockchain push signals a new era for global finance.

As tokenized assets gain ground, projects like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and Dawgz AI are positioning themselves at the forefront – ready to serve, scale, and soar with the next wave of crypto-powered innovation.

Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and NEAR are breaking long-term resistance, signaling the start of a major breakout cycle.

With Bitcoin nearing $100K, analysts predict altcoins could rally 100–250%, marking the beginning of a potential altcoin season.

As Bitcoin inches closer to the $100K mark, attention is now shifting to the altcoin market. Analysts are observing signs of a major altcoin breakout cycle, led by strong moves in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Kaspa (KAS), and Fantom (FTM) — all showing signs of breaking long-term resistance trends.

The $100K level has been a key psychological barrier for months. Now that Bitcoin is soon moving past it, market sentiment is improving fast. As Bitcoin dominance starts to drop, capital is rotating into altcoins, which are showing early signs of breakout formations.

 Altcoins are forming reliable breakout patterns like the cup and handle and inverse head and shoulders on higher timeframes. This shows that recent consolidations were accumulation zones and that larger upside may be ahead.

Top altcoins such as ETH, DOGE, SOL, NEAR, KAS, Cardano (ADA), and Sonic (S) are all showing significant breakout signals. For example:

The message is clear: this could be the beginning of a full-fledged altcoin season. If Bitcoin holds above key levels and market sentiment stays bullish, altcoins may rally 100–250% from current levels — with some possibly retracing 60% of previous bear market losses.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

Bitcoin's price surged due to a major U.S.-UK trade deal announcement, easing trade tensions and boosting investor confidence.

Yes, significant ETF inflows and institutional interest are contributing to Bitcoin's price surge. 

As per Coinpedia's BTC price prediction, the Bitcoin price could peak at $168k this year if the bullish sentiment sustains.

While global headlines have focused on China's digital yuan and the European Central Bank's cautious CBDC steps, Canada has been quietly building one of the world's most thoughtful and forward-looking digital currency strategies. The Bank of Canada is laying the foundation for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that balances innovation with privacy, accessibility, and resilience. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to explore decentralised options too, with many opting to buy Bitcoin in Canada as both a speculative asset and hedge against traditional banking shifts.

What makes Canada's approach different isn't its speed—but precision. Through research partnerships, public consultations, and small-scale technical pilots, the country is methodically preparing for a future where a digital loonie could complement—not replace—physical cash.

Canada was one of the first G7 nations to explore the idea of a CBDC back in the 2010s, long before it became a global trend. The Bank of Canada's “Contingency Planning for a Central Bank Digital Currency” framework was published as early as 2020, showing the institution's interest in being prepared even if immediate implementation wasn't necessary. This proactive stance has allowed the country to stay flexible, responding to international developments without rushing into politically or technologically risky territory.

One of the standout features of Canada's CBDC research is its strong focus on privacy and financial inclusion. The central bank has repeatedly emphasised that any digital currency must support offline transactions, protect user anonymity to a degree similar to cash, and remain accessible to those without smartphones or stable internet access. This focus has earned praise from civil liberties groups and is shaping a CBDC model that avoids surveillance-heavy pitfalls seen elsewhere.

While there's been no national rollout, the Bank of Canada has engaged in multiple pilot projects with fintech firms, universities, and blockchain startups. These technical collaborations are testing transaction speeds, offline functionality, and integration with existing payment systems. This quiet but steady pace helps the institution test hypotheses in real-world environments without overcommitting public resources or political capital.

Canada's participation in the Bank for International Settlements' CBDC working groups—particularly Project Jasper and Project Dunbar—shows its commitment to international alignment. These projects explore cross-border payment efficiency using digital currencies issued by multiple central banks. Canada's involvement highlights its role as a collaborative player in shaping global standards for interoperable and secure CBDCs.

With crypto adoption growing steadily in Canada, especially among younger demographics, the Bank of Canada is acutely aware that its CBDC must compete with established digital assets. The ability to buy Bitcoin in Canada from local platforms has helped normalise crypto as part of everyday financial conversation. This has indirectly pressured the central bank to ensure any digital dollar isn't just functional—but genuinely user-friendly. Canada's quiet leadership in CBDC development may not grab headlines, but its steady, research-led approach is winning global respect.

Robinhood is reportedly developing a blockchain-based platform designed to enable European investors to trade tokenized U.S. securities, according to sources familiar with the matter. The initiative marks a significant shift in the company's global strategy and a push to harness blockchain technology to streamline cross-border investing.

As part of its European expansion, Robinhood recently acquired a brokerage license in Lithuania, allowing it to operate throughout the European Union. This regulatory approval is expected to be foundational for the upcoming platform, which would allow users across the region to gain exposure to U.S. equities in a fully digital and potentially more efficient format.

The move is seen as an attempt to leverage new technologies to democratize financial access across borders. By using blockchain networks, Robinhood could significantly reduce friction in cross-border trading and attract a new wave of retail investors from markets traditionally underserved by U.S.-based financial products.

The platform will reportedly explore deploying on established blockchain networks such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, or Solana—choices known for their scalability, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystems. These networks would provide the infrastructure for the tokenization of U.S. stocks, whereby shares are represented as digital tokens that can be traded in a decentralized environment.

Tokenized assets promise several advantages over traditional financial instruments, including near-instant settlement, 24/7 market access, and improved transparency. For European investors, this could mean faster and more cost-effective access to high-demand U.S. equities such as those listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE.

Industry analysts say that Robinhood's move comes amid a broader push by fintech companies to integrate blockchain technology into traditional finance. The convergence of these two worlds—often referred to as “TradFi” and “DeFi”—is seen as a potential catalyst for innovation in capital markets.

While Robinhood has not formally announced the blockchain platform, reports suggest that the project is already in early development stages. Details regarding a potential launch date, token standards, and whether fractionalized shares will be supported remain unclear.

Still, the strategic timing of this initiative reflects growing momentum in the tokenization space. Several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, have recently launched or explored tokenized asset offerings, signaling increased institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure.

If successful, Robinhood's platform could set a precedent for how retail brokerage firms approach global expansion and technological adoption. It may also pave the way for a broader transformation of how securities are issued, traded, and settled across jurisdictions.

The University Concert Hall will resonate with the sound of young voices and instruments on Wednesday, May 14, as the Irish Chamber Orchestra's ICO Schools programme presents its eagerly anticipated annual Gala Show, Mix Tape, at 11am. 

This dynamic, joy-filled performance will feature over 410 children from Le Chéile N.S. and St. Mary's N.S., Limerick, showcasing the power of music to transform, unite and inspire.

ICO Schools—formerly known as Sing Out With Strings—has been a pioneering force in music education since its launch in 2008. The programme provides over 100 hours of free, high-quality music tuition each week, fully embedded into the school curriculum. Every participating child receives an instrument to take home, along with consistent mentorship from ICO musicians, fostering confidence, discipline, and artistic expression.

Now in its 17th year, ICO Schools has reached more than 3,000 children, many of whom have gone on to perform their original compositions at leading venues such as The Hunt Museum, Limerick City Gallery, and University Concert Hall itself.

This year's Gala, aptly titled Mix Tape, promises a colourful blend of student-composed pieces and beloved classics. The event will open with a medley of well-known tunes performed by the full school ensemble, followed by spirited sets from the Schools Orchestra.

Younger pupils (Junior Infants to 2nd Class) will delight audiences with playful renditions of Down By the Bay and Three Little Birds, while older students (3rd to 6th Class) will perform Count Me In by Bruno Mars alongside their own original songs, exploring themes of hope, unity, and imagination.

The children will be joined on stage by some of Limerick's finest musicians, including Cian Boylan (keyboard), Dave Keary (electric guitar), and John Daly (drums), bringing a professional polish to an already exciting programme. Key ICO players Kenneth Rice (violin) and Malachy Robinson (electric bass) have worked closely with the students throughout the year, offering inspiration, guidance, and collaborative support.

As a flagship community initiative of the Irish Chamber Orchestra, ICO Schools embodies the orchestra's commitment to access, inclusion, and the transformative power of music. Beyond teaching musical skills, the programme instils a sense of pride, belonging, and resilience in children growing up in the heart of Limerick.

Admission to this uplifting morning concert is free of charge, and the public is warmly invited to attend. Tickets will be available from the University Concert Hall foyer on the day of the performance.

The altcoin market is getting more complex to navigate, with fragmented narratives, limited liquidity, and massive token unlocks creating hefty headwinds. As K33 Research outlined in the latest report on the future of altcoins, "a broad-based altcoin season is unlikely", especially with institutional investors focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) due to the Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). However, despite the fast-changing dynamics and headwinds, select altcoins such as EOS, Kaito, and Stacks (STX) are advancing their bullish narratives, with some rallying in double digits.

Unlike other cycles, the current one is an uphill battle, especially for altcoin-focused investors. The Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, supported by steady ETF inflows and institutional adoption, while altcoins lag. 

"Altcoins should demonstrate real product-market fit, revenue, or user growth to attract capital," the K33 Research report said. Within the broader altcoin season, isolated meme coin plays have had a chance to break out. Still, "pure narrative plays without fundamentals are fading," the report added.

Therefore, investors must align with the right narratives, supported by strong fundamentals, to be the ultimate winners. 

EOS is set for its planned rebrand on May 14, which will unlock the ecosystem as a web3 banking powerhouse. The blockchain company had to start this rebrand process. Essentially, the functions and features we've added over the last three and a half years have all been in a particular direction of Web3 banking," Vaulta Foundation CEO, Yves La Rose, said during the Digital Asset Summit 2025.

Meanwhile, EOS is gaining bullish momentum, trading at $0.81 at the time of writing on Thursday, ahead of the swap to the network's new token A. The uptrend appears steady above a major confluence support around $0.67 formed by the 50-day, the 100-day, and the 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). 

A break toward the $1.00 hurdle, last tested in December, is on the cards as long as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, currently at 67.88, sustains the upward trend into the overbought territory.

Traders must prepare for all outcomes, including resistance shown in red on the chart above at around $0.90 and a potential drop to the confluence support at $0.67. As the RSI indicator rises into the overbought, it increases the probability of a reversal, often due to bullish exhaustion. 

Kaito's price bullish momentum from the April low of $0.66 to May highs of $1.56 comes amid growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven narratives. Additionally, the team continues to work on new features and use cases to compete in the fast-moving AI sector. 

Kaito recently introduced staking, allowing users to align with the network's future while earning rewards. Moreover, the staking feature is highly flexible as staked Kaito can be assigned to other projects within the ecosystem.

"This gives sKAITO holders an avenue to fee share from both the network more generally and/or from specific projects of their choice," Kaito highlighted in an X post.

Kaito's price exchanges at $1.41 at the time of writing, down over 2% on the day. Traders could adjust their portfolios considering the slightly overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 70.

KAITO/USDT daily chart 

The seller congestion at $1.50 could delay the breakout targeting $2.00, a supply zone previously tested in March. If the RSI indicator slides deeper into the neutral region, profit-taking will likely intensify, creating headwinds. 

Stacks' price is on the move, increasing over 3% on the day to exchange hands at $0.92. The uptrend stems from several factors, including a breakout above the 50-day EMA at $0.75 followed by the 100-day EMA at $0.88, and stability in the broader cryptocurrency market.

Momentum indicators like the RSI reveal that bulls have the upper hand and are likely to push STX above the $1.00 resistance in upcoming sessions.

STX/USDT daily chart

However, it is worth mentioning that the RSI is nearly overbought at 69, which means that the risk of a trend reversal is significantly higher. Hence, there is a need to prepare for a potential correction. In case of a trend correction, key levels are the 100-day EMA at $0.88 and the 50-day EMA at $0.75.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

 Bitcoin's price wobbled after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but bounced back and reclaimed $98,000 shortly after. 

Bitcoin has reclaimed $98,000 for the first time in almost three months after the US Federal Reserve said it would keep interest rates the same for another month.

The Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.

Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.

He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due to concerns over Trump's trade policy.

However, Powell said that “despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.” In the days leading up to the announcement, data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicated that the futures market expected minimal odds of a rate cut.

Powell said the unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is “at or near maximum employment.” The market expects the Fed to drop the Fed funds rate to 3.6% by the end of 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $97,000 to $95,866 after Powell's speech, but it shot up to tap $98,000 for the first time since Feb. 21 just hours later. 

Bitcoin momentum has been building, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returning to “Greed” territory, and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting inflows of almost $4.41 billion since March 26.

On March 9, network economist Timothy Peterson warned that if the Fed holds off on rate cuts in 2025, it may cause a broader market downturn, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $70,000.

Peterson's forecast came after Powell said in March that “we do not need to be in a hurry and are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity.”

Leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve warned of macroeconomic dangers from President Donald Trump's tariff moves.

What Happened: Bitcoin encountered tough resistance in the mid-$97,000s throughout the day before breaking the barrier overnight and recovering $98,000 for the first time since Feb. 21.

Bitcoin's market dominance rose to a yearly high of 64.4%, signaling continued capital rotation from other assets to the apex cryptocurrency.

Ethereum recovered after falling to an intraday low of $1,788.69 in a turbulent trading session that saw volume soar up to 220%.

Over $184 million was liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours, with bearish bets accounting for the majority.

Bitcoin's Open Interest dropped marginally by 0.78% in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, over 63% of the Bitcoin derivatives traders on Binance bet against the leading cryptocurrency.

The "Greed" sentiment prevailed in the market, according to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index.

Top Gainers (24-Hours)

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3 trillion, following a 0.20% contraction in the last 24 hours.

Stocks staged a pullback on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 284.97 points, or 0.70%, to end at 41,113.97. The S&P 500 gained 0.43% to close at 5,631.28, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite spiked 0.27%, ending at 17,738.16.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged concerns that Trump's tariff measures could lead to higher inflation, weaker growth, and a rise in unemployment. This came after the central bank's widely predicted decision to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%.

Additionally, shares of Nvidia Corp. NVDA climbed late in the day on reports that the Trump administration plans to scrap Biden-era AI chip curbs.

Analyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital stated that the altseason, which occurs when altcoins outperform Bitcoin in price gains, would begin once Bitcoin dominance hits the 71% ceiling, about 6% away from current value.

Cryptocurrency expert and trader Michaël van de Poppe expressed optimism in Ethereum's short-term prospects, stating that the cryptocurrency was holding above a “crucial” level.

"I think we'll be about to witness a big breakout to $2,100 in the coming 1-2 weeks," the analyst said.

The project allegedly consists of tokenizing US securities to streamline trading for retail investors in Europe.

Robinhood is reportedly working on blockchain infrastructure that will enable European retail investors to trade US securities, Bloomberg News reported on May 7.

According to the report, the brokerage platform is exploring a partnership with a digital asset firm to support the initiative and is considering Arbitrum and Solana as potential blockchain layers.

People with direct knowledge of the project said that discussions remain ongoing and that no final decision has been made regarding the technology partner or launch timeline. 

A spokesperson for Robinhood declined to comment on the matter. Representatives from Offchain Labs, the developer of Arbitrum, and the Solana Foundation also did not respond to inquiries.

The plan would expand Robinhood's European offerings beyond crypto trading, representing the full scope of its services in the European Union. 

In April, Robinhood obtained a brokerage license in Lithuania, authorizing it to offer stock trading and investment services across the bloc. 

The company also signed an agreement to acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp, a deal still pending finalization. The acquisition would give Robinhood access to Bitstamp's MiFID-licensed multilateral trading facility, opening the door to crypto-linked derivatives in the region.

The infrastructure under development would tokenize US equities, allowing them to be represented on a public blockchain and traded by European users. 

While the approach is still in formation, such a system would offer the potential benefits of near-instant settlement, cost reductions, and transparency across a trade's lifecycle.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has previously expressed support for tokenized securities. In February, Tenev stated in a letter to investors that he believes that tokenized private company stocks resonate best with US investors.

By building a blockchain-based framework for cross-border securities trading, Robinhood would be positioning itself to compete in a segment that merges traditional equities with digital asset infrastructure. 

The choice between Arbitrum and Solana would influence network characteristics such as throughput, fees, smart contract capabilities, and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

NASA Spent Billions to Bring Rocks Back from Mars. Trump Wants to Leave Them There

After billions of dollars in spending and decades of planning, NASA may be forced to abandon precious samples of air, rock and soil on the Martian surface. Experts are furious

For more than four years, NASA's Perseverance Mars rover has been on the prowl within Jezero Crater, a site on the Red Planet that eons ago harbored a sprawling river delta, a large, deep lake and—just maybe—ancient Martian life. Since its touchdown in February 2021, the car-sized, nuclear-powered robot has traveled far and wide across this otherworldly terrain, dutifully gathering samples of rock and soil. Protected in hermetically sealed metal tubes, these specimens are meant for future retrieval and delivery back to Earth, where close-up inspection in state-of-the-art labs might at last provide the first compelling evidence of life beyond Earth.

This cooperative program between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) is known as Mars Sample Return (MSR) and has been generations in the making. It's the culmination of decades of planning by planetary scientists and many billions of dollars in government spending—the crowning achievement of Mars-focused interplanetary exploration efforts that began more than a half-century ago and still endure today.

Unless, that is, the Trump administration gets its way: on May 2 the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) dropped a budgetary bombshell, proposing to cut NASA's top-line funding by a quarter, slash the space agency's science budget by nearly half and entirely eliminate MSR. The cancellation is justified, the OMB document claims, because MSR is “grossly overbudget” and its goals of sample return will instead “be achieved by human missions to Mars.”

The news apparently came as a surprise to high-ranking officials. Addressing a meeting of NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) just two days before the announcement, the space agency's Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, director for the MSR program, offered an upbeat status report. MSR “will be the first round-trip mission to another planet,” she said, “and will be the first time that we actually launch from another planet.”

In her remarks, Douglas-Bradshaw did acknowledge the program's growing pains. Over the years, multiple independent reviews of the MSR project have flagged its swelling price tag and slipping schedule. One recent review estimated that it would cost about $11 billion and return samples to Earth in 2040—a price too high and a time frame too slow to be acceptable, Douglas-Bradshaw said.

Last year, triggered by those figures, yet another review envisioned a streamlined version of MSR that could deliver samples as early as 2035 for a cost of some $8 billion. This replan called for NASA to simultaneously study two options for bringing Perseverance's precious tubes back to Earth. Both were meant to rein in costs and accelerate the schedule through a combination of private-sector innovation and leveraging preexisting “heritage” hardware. The space agency anticipated selecting between the two options and finalizing MSR's replan before the end of 2026, Douglas-Bradshaw told the gathered MEPAG scientists.

MSR's proposed cancellation would overturn decades of arduous planning and deliberate investments while also diminishing U.S. space leadership on the global stage, says MEPAG chair Victoria Hamilton, a space scientist at the Southwest Research Institute. The project, she notes, was ranked as the highest priority of U.S. planetary science in two consecutive Decadal Surveys—authoritative communal reports that historically give Congress and federal agencies recommendations for future activities. And without MSR other nations could seize the opportunity to pull off sample-return missions of their own before the U.S. and its allies could recover.

Of the $1.8 trillion budgeted for federal discretionary spending in fiscal year 2024, $7.8 billion went to NASA's science efforts—less than half a percent of the total. Yet “with that investment, NASA's robotic exploration programs are the greatest in the world and spark the imagination of America's future scientists and engineers,” Hamilton says. “It's crucially important that NASA maintain U.S. leadership in deep space by pursuing the ambitious goals outlined in our Decadal Surveys, lest we cede leadership to other nations, such as China.”

And while it's true that crewed missions to Mars have long been NASA's polestar, endorsed by both Trump administrations as well as that of former president Joe Biden, many experts lambast the notion that U.S. astronauts could return Perseverance's samples anytime soon.

“Let's get real. My reaction to the ‘astronauts will do sample return' is: When?! It's nonsense on several levels,” says Stanford University planetary scientist Scott Hubbard, who served as NASA's inaugural Mars program director (or “Mars Czar”). “I know of no credible ‘humans to Mars' scenario that is earlier than 2039 or 2040.”

Meanwhile, Hubbard says, China has announced plans for a more basic Mars sampling endeavor around 2030 that would likely entail a lander simply snatching nearby material from some easily accessible spot on the surface. That would be in stark contrast to MSR's more methodical approach, which is designed to deliver many samples sourced from a wide range of terrain and carefully curated to be of maximal scientific value—that is, material thought most likely to harbor evidence of past or even present Mars life. “Even if it is only a ‘grab' sample, [China] can rightly claim [it] beat NASA and the U.S.,” Hubbard says.

The true value of MSR is in the high quality of its samples, says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates for space science and exploration. “Random rocks will almost certainly not answer the big questions that MSR is designed to answer, such as the age of the Martian surface, the possible presence of biosignatures and the nature of Mars' ancient atmosphere. That's the weakness in China's ‘grab-and-go' approach.”

Furthermore, he says, the Trump administration's claims that the MSR mission is unaffordable—yet also somehow readily replaced by crewed exploration—are dubious at best. Any remotely realistic plan for a crewed Mars mission would be far more expensive than MSR, for one thing. For another, the very act of landing humans on Mars could undermine the deep astrobiological questions that justify the sampling effort in the first place. Most experts argue that astronauts would inevitably import some Earthly microbes to the Martian surface, potentially compromising the integrity of supposedly pristine samples as well as that of the planet itself.

None of which means that humans should be forever forbidden from Mars or that astronauts could play no role whatsoever in sample return, Dreier hastens to add. “There are a number of novel approaches for MSR that should still be considered, including a tighter coupling with future human exploration of Mars. It is premature to cancel it as this stage and certainly premature to do so before a confirmed NASA administrator helms the agency and is able to make a fuller assessment of the project,” he concludes.

Indeed, President Trump's nominee for running NASA, entrepreneur and two-time private space traveler Jared Isaacman, has yet to officially weigh in on this new MSR development. At his most recent Congressional appearance on April 9— before the OMB's bombshell sent shockwaves through all of U.S. space science—he offered sunny testimony about NASA's bright future.

On April 30, the Senate committee that oversees NASA and other federal science agencies gave Isaacman its nod to advance to a formal confirmation vote in the full chamber. That confirmation could be days, weeks or months in the making, however—and it's uncertain whether Isaacman has sufficient political capital to oppose or even question any of the Trump administration's budget-snipping edicts.

Amanda Hendrix, director and chief executive officer of the Planetary Science Institute, worries that such potential gaps in political leadership could prove ruinous well beyond the “mystifying and infuriating” possible cancellation of MSR.

“It's as if [the Trump administration] want the U.S. to cede leadership in space exploration and science,” she says. “These proposed cuts are so bad that we cannot wait for Congress to go through the normal appropriations process. Congress needs to push back hard now.”

To understand how shocking the prospect of MSR's downfall really is, consider that even some of the endeavor's historic opponents are now speaking up in its defense—albeit with caveats. Robert Zubrin, an aerospace engineer and founder of the Mars Society, has long been a fierce critic of MSR; he has argued that NASA's Mars exploration program would be better served by a more numerous and diverse mix of small- and medium-sized missions. Even so, he can't bring himself to support the proposed cancellation.

“While you can raise objections to the MSR mission, that money should be rescheduled to run a Mars exploration program with more rovers, more robotic helicopters, orbiters and life-detection experiments,” Zubrin says. “Instead [the Trump administration] just cancels the MSR and basically shuts down the Mars exploration program. And that's wrong.”

As uncertainty and confusion cloud the outlook for MSR and federally funded science as a whole, longstanding international partners of the U.S. see little choice but to project an outward sense of calm. Look, for instance, to the statement issued on May 5 by ESA's director general Josef Aschbacher that carefully emphasizes the importance of U.S.-European cooperation in space activities.

Via ESA, Europe's main contribution to MSR is an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) that would snare and stow a surface-launched sample-return capsule in Mars orbit, then ferry it back toward our planet. In October 2020 ESA signed a €491-million contract with Airbus to design and build ERO; the spacecraft is now in the closing phases of its development, which includes integration and testing of its various components in preparation for launch. If MSR is mothballed, ERO could become a nearly half-billion-euro boondoggle for ESA, which has an annual budget that's only a small fraction of NASA's.

Aschbacher did not directly address ERO or MSR in his statement but did note that a more detailed version of the Trump administration's budget request is expected in late May or early June.

“The Budget Request release marks the beginning of the appropriation process in US Congress culminating in the President's signature of the budget bill passed by the House and the Senate,” Aschbacher said. “Thus it should be kept in mind that this is still very much a work in progress.” Based on the outcome of that process and other further developments, the space agency will hold meetings later this year to plot “potential actions and alternative scenarios for impacted ESA programmes and related European industry.”

ESA, Aschbacher pointedly added, “has strong partnerships with space agencies from around the globe and is committed to not only being a reliable partner, but a strong and desirable partner.”

Perhaps not by coincidence, two days after his statement, Aschbacher was in New Delhi, where he signed a joint statement of intent between ESA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to cooperate on future crewed missions to low-Earth orbit and to the moon. In spite of ESA's measured “wait-and-see” response to the political chaos now engulfing the U.S., Europe's embrace of new, non-American partners for space exploration signals that an old adage still rings true: the future waits for no one.

India and Pakistan Remind Us We Need to Stop the Risk of Nuclear War

The U.S. needs to set an example for the rest of the world by taking our nuclear missiles off hair-trigger alert and negotiating a reduction of our arsenal

By Alan Robock & Lili Xia

We are living in a scary time. After a terrorist attack that killed at least 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, in Kashmir in April, India blamed the attack on Pakistan, threatened to cut off that nation's water supplies and followed up in May with airstrikes. Pakistan has promised a “measured but forceful response,” threatening a wider war endangering everyone.

India and Pakistan each have about 170 nuclear weapons. A nuclear war between India and Pakistan would produce smoke from fires in cities and industrial areas. That smoke would rise into the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer above the troposphere where we live, which has no rain to wash out the smoke. Our research has found that the smoke would block out the sun, making it cold, dark and dry at Earth's surface, choking agriculture for five years or more around the world. The result would be global famine.

Like it or not, humanity still has a nuclear dagger pointed at its throat. But there is another choice that starts with the U.S. If we take our land-based missiles off their hair-trigger alerts and negotiate with Russia to reduce our nuclear arsenal, we could set an example for the rest of the world. If we eventually sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the U.S. could provide an example to Iran and other nations with an interest in building their own nuclear arsenal.

The alternatives are terrifying. One of us (Robock) published an article in Scientific American 15 years ago describing how a war in South Asia, like the one now possible between India and Pakistan, could produce global climate change and threaten the world's food supply, but we did not know how large that threat would be. In the years since then we have calculated, for a range of smoke amounts released from nuclear war, the specific effects on agriculture in each nation. From there, we estimated how the people would fare under the assumption that their stored food was gone, trade was halted, and they kept the same agricultural activity. A nuclear war between India and Pakistan could kill one to two billion people through starvation in the two years after the war.

The U.S. and Russia have more than 8,000 nuclear weapons. A nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia could kill more than six billion people around the world in the following two years. The direct impacts of blast, radiation and fire on those attacked by nuclear weapons would be horrific, as we know from what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, but 10 to 20 times more people would die from famine.

Many people assume that there will never be another nuclear war, since it has now been 80 years and several generations since the last one. They also have been told that nuclear deterrence must be maintained to keep us safe. Yet threats to use nuclear weapons from Russia and North Korea, and even from the U.S. president, have worried many. The New START treaty, the only remaining arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia, expires next year. China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal.

President Trump just proposed a budget for the next fiscal year with a 13 percent increase for the Defense Department. This is exactly the wrong direction for the U.S. A substantial part of the defense budget is for a “modernization” of our nuclear arsenal. Our nuclear “triad” is composed of land-based missiles, submarine missiles and nuclear bombs that could be dropped from airplanes. We already have all of these, and they cannot be used without the risk of killing almost all the people on the planet. They need to be removed, not modernized.

Deterrence is a myth. The theory is that we will not be attacked because we will attack an enemy if they attack us, thus deterring them. But in order for it to work, they have to believe that we will act as a suicide bomber. That is, that we will attack an enemy, producing so much smoke that we will be unable to grow any crops for more than five years and thus all starve to death. This is not mutual assured destruction (the so-called “MAD” theory). It is self-assured destruction (SAD).

The upcoming Independent Study on Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine due out this summer, the first such report since 1985, will make this danger more plain.

The rest of the world well understands the risk we all face. In 2017, after three international conferences on the humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons, including the indirect effects on food supply based on our work, the United Nations passed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which prohibits possession, manufacture, development and testing of nuclear weapons, stationing and installment of nuclear weapons or assistance in such activities, by its parties. The treaty came into force on January 22, 2021. There are currently 94 signatories and 73 states parties, but the nine countries, notably including the U.S., with nuclear weapons have not signed it and are trying to ignore the will of the rest of world.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which led the effort to get this treaty, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize “for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons.”

For deterrence to succeed, there must be no use of nuclear weapons by accident, terrorists, computer malfunctions, hackers or unstable leaders. We have come close many times. As Beatrice Fihn, executive director of ICAN, said in her Nobel Peace Prize Lecture on December 10, 2017, “If only a small fraction of today's nuclear weapons were used, soot and smoke from the firestorms would loft high into the atmosphere—cooling, darkening and drying the Earth's surface for more than a decade. It would obliterate food crops, putting billions at risk of starvation. Yet we continue to live in denial of this existential threat.… The story of nuclear weapons will have an ending, and it is up to us what that ending will be. Will it be the end of nuclear weapons, or will it be the end of us? One of these things will happen. The only rational course of action is to cease living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one impulsive tantrum away.”

When Carl Sagan, a leader in early nuclear-winter research, was asked if he didn't want to keep our nuclear weapons as a deterrent, he said: “For myself, I would far rather have a world in which the climatic catastrophe cannot happen, independent of the vicissitudes of leaders, institutions, and machines. This seems to me elementary planetary hygiene, as well as elementary patriotism.” We agree.

US researchers who receive consistent grant renewals produce more fresh research than those who don't, a study finds.Credit: Attila Csaszar/Getty

In its bid to reduce government spending and rein in ‘woke' science, the administration of US President Donald Trump has, over the past three months, terminated about 800 active research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Now, a study published late last month in the journal Scientometrics1 highlights the long-term benefits of renewing existing grants, finding that US scientists who received renewals from the NIH over the past four decades produced more novel research than those who didn't.

Although the study focused on a major US biomedical-science funding agency, the results might persuade governments worldwide “to implement policies that give stable funding to researchers”, says study co-author Aruhan Bai, a science-policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institutes of Science and Development (CASISD) in Beijing. Continuous funding, Bai says, will ultimately “encourage the real prosperity of science”.

In the new study, Bai and her co-author, Baicun Li, also at CASISD, analysed the scientific output of 642 US scientists who won NIH funding between 1985 and 2021. The study focused on recipients of R01 grants — common, yet highly competitive, awards from the NIH that provide up to five years of financial support and can be renewed several times. As of last year, the success rate of winning an R01 grant was 20%, on average, and the rate for winning a renewal was about 45%.

‘Disruptive' science has declined — and no one knows why

‘Disruptive' science has declined — and no one knows why

Two subgroups of equal sizes made up the study cohort: one in which researchers received at least a three-year renewal of their first R01 grant without any funding interruption, and a control group of researchers who didn't receive a renewal and had at least a three-year gap in funding afterwards. To ensure that the two groups were matched in terms of their research quality prior to receiving grants, Bai and Li used the scientists' career stages, publication histories and measures of their prior research impact to ‘pair' them.

To evaluate the scientists' output after renewal decisions, the duo used public NIH-funding data, researchers' publications listed in the biomedical-literature repository PubMed and a newer database called SciSciNet2 that contains scientific publication data and links to related funding and usage information. 

Bai and Li harnessed these resources to examine the ‘novelty' of researchers' publications, calculating a score on the basis of the uniqueness and trendiness of key medical words and concepts in their papers. The pair also measured the ‘switching probability' for scientists — how likely they were to hop to new research topics — and the ‘diversity', or spread, of topics they studied using a model that calculated the similarity of their publications over a set period.The results revealed that researchers who received renewals without a funding gap were less likely to switch research topics and investigate a wide array of subjects than were those in the control group, and they produced papers featuring newer or more unconventional combinations of ideas.

The team found that renewed funding “helped scientists stay focused” so that they could “dig deeper into one area” of research, Bai says. As a result, she adds, the scientists could generate innovative applications down the line. “Innovation takes more than 10 or 20 years of continuous work,” she says.

Cats or dogs? Dogs or cats? Whether you're a feline fanatic or with the canine crowd, maybe you've noticed your cat has an eerie resemblance to a popular purebred pug on social media, or that your dog is starting to look like a lot of Instagram cats.

This phenomenon isn't a trick of the imagination. Some breeds of dogs and cats really are starting to look uncannily similar, and it's all because of the human aesthetic preferences that go into breeding them. After analyzing the shapes of about 2,800 skulls of cats, dogs and their wild brethren, evolutionary biologists Abby Drake (from Cornell University) and Jonathan Losos (from Washington University) found that there was more variation in the skulls of domesticated animals than wild ones because of artificial selection by breeders. They did a double take, however, after comparing the shapes of dog and cat skulls. 

“The skulls of a pug or a Pekingese and a Persian cat are more similar to each other than either is to their ancestors, the wolf and the North African wildcat,” Losos said in a recent press release. “I don't think anyone would have expected that.”

Regardless of whether they happen to be dog or cat lovers, humans tend to prefer flat faces and huge eyes, most likely because these features closely mirror infants of our own species and trigger parental instincts. Homo Sapiens is one of the most altricial species on Earth, meaning that our offspring are helpless and depend on caregivers for one of the longest periods in the animal kingdom. Seeing these features automatically puts many of us into nurturing mode—so much so, in fact, that caring for pets is also sometimes referred to as alloparenting (which refers to parenting anything other than direct offspring). 

Puppies and kittens are not helpless for long. As precocial animals, they are walking, leaping, pawing at the carpet, and knocking over houseplants just weeks after they open their eyes. Human infants don't even begin crawling until about 7 months. Despite a puppy being anything but helpless, features that make a breed appear like a human infant (which needs our constant attention) up the cuteness factor. 

The merging of dog and cat features is an example of convergent evolution, which happens when unrelated organisms (which may even live far apart for each other) evolve similar characteristics because of the environmental pressures they face. This has been going on since there was life on Earth—for example, when fossils from what appeared to be a saber-tooth cat emerged in Argentina, scientists examining the bones realized that the creature was actually a monstrous marsupial that had developed fangs to tear through leftover carcasses. 

Divergent evolution, which results in speciation, is the opposite. Canids (dogs) and felids (cats) diverged from each other 50 million years ago. 

“If you read the breed standards for the Pekingese and the Persian, the language is very similar in terms of how they want the nose to be up between the eyes and the face to form a vertical plane with no protrusion of the muzzle,” Drake said in the press release.

There are still those of us (including this author) who love creatures that don't even look remotely human as our own. But, in general, people tend to melt at anything that looks human-ish. Problems with this arise when an animal's health is compromised for its looks. For instance, flat-faced dogs like pugs and Boston Terriers cannot fly because of a high (and potentially lethal) nosebleed risk. And pugs did not evolve these characteristics on their own—they used to be almost unrecognizable by today's standards, with longer faces and legs. It is because humans bred the individuals with the flattest faces that they developed into what they are now.

Your neighbor's very expensive designer dog went and had puppies with a stray of indeterminate breed? Scandalous, but in the end, it's probably better for the puppies.

This one's even older.

The military significance of the Athar region of North Sinai may have pre-dated Ptolemaic-era and Roman-era fortresses already uncovered at the Tel Abu Seifi archaeological site. We know this thanks to the discovery of what is likely a third—and older—defensive structure for Egypt's “fortress of the east.” 

According to a translated statement from Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the Egyptian Archaeological Mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities uncovered not only fresh clues about the way of life at the site during the Ptolemaic and Roman occupation, but also the remains of a third military fortification. 

During the excavation, D. Hisham Hussein, head of the mission and director of the General Administration of Sinai Antiquities, said the presence of a moat led archaeologists to discover four pillars of a fort. Those pillars are now being dated, but the team believes the new find is older than the two forts already known to have existed on the site, one dated to the Ptolemaic era from 332 to 30 B.C. and the other from Roman rule during 30 B.C. to 395 A.D. 

Sharif Fathi, minister of Tourism and Antiquities, said the fresh discovery shows the secrets of eastern military fortresses of Egypt over multiple centuries, and the importance of the location as a military and industrial center throughout time. When the Nile shifted course, Tell Abu Seifi rose in defensive prominence, overtaking the role of Tell Hebua as the fortress of the east. 

The additional information also more fully maps the Egyptian defenses on its eastern border, said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, reaffirming that Sinai was once Egypt's eastern gateway and its first military stronghold. 

Alongside the fort, the mission uncovered housing units, the eastern gates of the two known forts, a limestone road, and remnants of industry. The team believes that the newly found mixture of interconnected rectangular buildings near the third fort were likely used as living quarters for soldiers and then reused over time. 

The mission uncovered the distinctive design of the eastern gates of the two known forts, helping show the shape of the entrances. The team also found a more than six-foot-deep moat at the entrance to one of the forts, an element of defensive strategy. 

What may not have been so defensive was a road—36 feet wide and over 328 feet long—that led from the outside of the eastern gate of the Roman-era fort to the heart of the residential portion of the site. The road was paved with limestone tiles and covered an older path underneath it, which also included limestone, likely from the Ptolemaic era. 

Along the side of the road were more than 500 clay planting circles carefully arranged in rows, likely holes for trees to adorn the fort's entrance and the soldiers' dwellings. Mohammed Abdel-Badii, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector, said this find tells the story of daily life, especially when the site housed soldiers during the reigns of emperors Diocletian and Maximian from the third century A.D.

At some point near the end of Roman rule, the military stronghold turned more industrial, the team believes, thanks to the discovery of four large kilns used to produce quicklime. The switch from military-first to industry also coincided with the destruction of earlier stone structures at the site.

Bodies voluntarily chained to rocks. Acts of self-flagellation. Living beings reduced only to skin and bones through consenting abstinence from food consumption.

Asceticism in Christianity as practiced for centuries can comprise an array of devotional practices from fasting to meditation. But it's this more extreme form of asceticism, first documented in the second century, that has held a lurid fascination with the public, both within and outside of the Christian faith. 

Though these acts of extreme deprivation and self-harm were condemned by Church figures like Saint Barsanuphius and John the Prophet, radical acts like Simeon Stylites' 36 years atop a pillar have been immortalized in works as far ranging as a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson and a 1965 film by the Mexican director Luis Bunuel. 

In the 21st century, this fascination with extreme asceticism re-emerged in the public consciousness through the character of Silas, the self-flagellating monk in the thriller novel The Da Vinci Code.

But while these pop culture depictions of “ecstatic suffering” vary in style and genre, one thing remains consistent: the practitioners depicted are always male. “Only men performed self-punishment in the Byzantine period,” a recent Haaretz article notes of the general assumption made by historians. “Ecstatic suffering was the fief of the exalted male.”

Now, that assumption has been drastically shaken, after an article published in the Journal of Archaeological Science provides “the first solid evidence that women in early Christendom also engaged in self-punishment.”

The evidence in question was found within a Byzantine monastery near the Old City of Jerusalem, which likely existed from 350 to 650 A.D. Within the two crypts therein, archaeologists were able to categorize many of the bodies as men, women, and children. But one had been so damaged by tree roots and other degradation that the so-called “diagnostic bones,” primarily the pelvis, were indecipherable. What was evident about it, however, was that these remains had belonged to a practitioner of a particularly extreme form of asceticism, as the bones had been wrapped in chains.

With only “only three vertebrae and a tooth” available to them, and roughly 1,600 years elapsing since the initial burial, the idea of extracting and analyzing DNA in order to identify the biological sex of the figure formerly wrapped in chains was off the table. But, remarkably, a different kind of analysis had previously been pioneered by Dr. Paula Kotli and their team for the purposes of studying ancient animal domestication.

“In animaldom, Kotli and others developed a methodology to sex ancient remains based on a protein in dental enamel, amelogenin, which differs slightly between males and females,” Haaretz summarizes. “It was the first time the sex of ancient cattle remains had been elucidated, enabling researchers to explore the domestication pathway through changes in herd management.”

This analysis hinges on the fact that, as Dr. Kotli explained, “we humans have two copies of the amelogenin gene: one on the X chromosome and one on the Y.” Those with two X-chromosomes would only have the X-linked amelogenin. But the presence of a Y-linked amelogenin means the tooth in question was in the mouth of a biological male.

When the tooth of this chain-bound ascetic was subjected to analysis, there was no Y-linked amelogenin present, which highly suggests the tooth's owner had been female.

We say “highly suggests” because there is some wiggle room here. “The absence of an AmelY unique spectra enabled us to classify the remains as very probably those of a female,” is what the paper concludes. Since men have both the X- and Y-chromosomes, it's possible this tooth at one time had a Y-linked amelogenin, which simply didn't survive as well and wasn't discovered in the analysis.

But without expressing absolute certainty, the team appears fairly confident that the likely owner was a female. This discovery offers a new insight into ancient devotional practices, and broadens our understanding of the spectrum of early Christian worship, not just in terms of what was practiced, but who was permitted to practice it.

Mount Sinai researchers have discovered distinct roles for two dopamine receptors located on nerve cells within the portion of the brain that controls approach vs. avoidance behavior. These receptors potentially influence anxiety and mood disorders whose origins are still unclear.

The team characterized the function of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the ventral hippocampus of mice, a region involved in the regulation of emotions and stress responses. Their work expands the field's knowledge of dopamine signaling beyond its well-known actions in other brain regions that influence reward and motivation, and sets the stage for future research into dopamine dysregulation in a range of anxiety and depressive disorders. The results of the study appeared in the May 7 issue of Nature.

"Healthy and dysregulated emotional processing related to an individual's ability to resolve conflict between approach and avoidance when making decisions on a moment-by-moment basis have long implicated the hippocampus," says senior author Eric J. Nestler, MD, PhD, Nash Family Professor of Neuroscience and Director of The Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Chief Scientific Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. "Ours is the first comprehensive, functional study of newly discovered D1 and D2 expressing cells in the ventral hippocampus. We demonstrate that dopamine is more important in that area of the brain than previously believed and, moreover, that it conveys information related to decision-making under stressful conditions."

The hippocampus coordinates decision-making in anxiety-inducing situations, like when an individual has to choose whether to obtain food or drink under threatening situations. Such approach/avoidance dilemmas, where a particular goal has both desirable and potentially undesirable consequences, can cause excessive fear, confusion, and anxiety in humans.

The Mount Sinai team investigated the influence of dopamine signaling within the ventral hippocampus on approach/avoidance behavior in male mice. Researchers learned that D1 and D2 dopamine receptors expressed in different neuronal populations are called into play to help execute approach/avoidance decisions. These receptors and the cells that express them mediate opposite approach/avoidance responses, and are differentially impacted by dopamine transmission in that region of the brain.

The team was surprised to learn that the neuronal cells that express D1 and D2 receptors, which are most highly enriched in the striatum -- a critical part of the motor and reward system -- are also relevant in the hippocampus. Another unexpected behavioral observation was that mice whose D2 cells were artificially activated became much less fearful.

"These discoveries underscored for us that dopamine is an important component of the hippocampal circuitry and that dopamine signaling should be reconsidered in many brain regions where it was previously overlooked, especially those associated with learning, memory, and emotional behavior," notes Dr. Nestler, whose considerable research over the years has been designed to better understand the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression. "Our work further implicates dopamine dysregulation in anxiety and mood disorders."

Dr. Nestler credits the study's two co-first authors, Arthur Godino, PhD, a graduate student and later postdoctoral fellow, and Marine Salery, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow, and the rest of the large research team for the creative advances made in this investigation.

The next step for Dr. Nestler and his team is to show precisely how the dopamine-hippocampus circuit that modulates approach/avoidance is dysregulated in several stress-related conditions, such as anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders (which involve increased avoidance) and in drug addiction (where individuals seek drug rewards despite harmful consequences).

"By helping to delineate the neuromodulatory circuits that govern these disorders," says Dr. Nestler, "we're taking an essential step toward addressing a leading cause of disability in humans worldwide."

Professor Keehoon Kim and Ph.D. candidate Jaewon Byun from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) have developed an "Intelligent Autonomous Wiping and UV-C Disinfection Robot" capable of automating hospital disinfection processes. This research was conducted in collaboration with Korea Institute of Science and Technology (Sangrok Oh, Director of Research Division, and Dr. Jinwoo Jung), the Korea Institute of Robot and Convergence (Goobong Chung, Vice President, and Dr. Youngho Choi), Elphoton Co., Ltd. (Eunhyun Park, CEO, and Dr. Kyungmin Kim), and the Infection Control Team at Pohang St. Mary's Hospital (Jaemyung Kang and Eunjung Kim).

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of thorough disinfection, particularly within hospital environments. Given the increased awareness of the importance of disinfection, concerns surrounding labor shortages due to physical fatigue and risk of exposure to pathogens have been raised. Moreover, individuals' compliance with manually conducted disinfection tasks tends to vary, and human performance is inconsistent. Furthermore, existing technologies, such as UV-C robots and hydrogen peroxide vapor systems, have inherent limitations in completely removing contaminants hidden in obscured or hard-to-reach areas.

To address these challenges, the research team developed an autonomous robot capable of both navigating hospital environments and performing disinfection tasks. A key feature of the robot is its dual disinfection system: first, it utilizes a robotic manipulator to physically wipe surfaces and remove contaminants; second, it employs UV-C irradiation to disinfect hard-to-reach corners and narrow spaces.

The robot's performance was validated through real-world testing at Pohang St. Mary's Hospital. The team conducted bacterial culture experiments to confirm the effectiveness of disinfection and carried out repeated autonomous operations to verify its long-term usability in clinical settings.

One of the robot's most significant advantages is its ability to automate time-consuming and repetitive disinfection tasks, enabling healthcare professionals to devote more attention to patient care. Additionally, unlike variability in human performance, the system can perform disinfection with consistent precision, significantly reducing the risk of infection within the hospital. Precision control algorithms minimize operational failures, while the integration of a self-sanitizing station and wireless charging system ensures sustained disinfection operations.

Professor Keehoon Kim emphasized, "Although COVID-19 has transitioned into an endemic phase, it remains essential to prepare for future pandemics. We will continue advancing this disinfection robot technology beyond hospitals to public facilities, various social infrastructures, and everyday environments to further reduce infection risks."

This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (Project Director: Dr. Sang-Rok Oh, Korea Institute of Science and Technology).

An international study led by the Institut de Neurociències at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (INc-UAB) has shown that increasing levels of the Klotho protein in mice extends lifespan and improves both physical and cognitive health when aging.

As we grow older, it is natural to lose muscle and bone mass, leading to greater frailty and a higher risk of falls and serious injuries. Cognitively, neurons progressively degenerate and lose connections, while diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's become more prevalent. In a society where the population is steadily aging, reducing these effects is one of the main challenges for research.

Now, in an article published in Molecular Therapy, an international research team led by Professor Miguel Chillón, ICREA researcher at the INc-UAB, has shown that increasing levels of the secreted form of the Klotho protein (s-KL) improves aging in mice. The team treated young animals with gene therapy vectors that caused their cells to secrete more s-KL. At 24 months of age, roughly equivalent to 70 years in humans, they found that the treatment had improved the animals' muscle, bone, and cognitive health.

"We have been working with the Klotho protein for some time, due to its therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we wanted to see whether s-KL could also be beneficial for healthy aging by examining a broad range of factors," explains Miguel Chillón.

Mice treated with s-KL lived 15-20% longer, with better physical performance, larger muscle fibers, and less fibrosis, indicating better muscle health. Improvements in bone health were also observed, particularly in females, with greater preservation of the internal bone structure (trabeculae), suggesting a potential protective effect against osteoporosis. Finally, in the brain, treatment with s-KL promoted the generation of new neurons and increased immune activity in the hippocampus, suggesting possible cognitive benefits.

The viral vector treatment works by introducing copies of the gene encoding the desired protein into the body's cells, so that they can start producing it on their own. In the mice, these vectors were administered intravenously and directly into the brain to ensure that brain cells also produced s-KL. "We now have viral vectors that can reach the brain after being administered intravenously, which would make it easier to safely transfer this therapy to humans. Another option would be to administer the protein directly as a drug instead of using viral vectors, but we still need to find an efficient way to deliver it and ensure it reaches the target organs," explains Joan Roig-Soriano, INc-UAB researcher and first author of the article.

The research group had already patented the use of Klotho to treat cognitive deficits, and following this study, three new patents were filed. These patents protect the use of Klotho for treating bone and muscle deficits, as well as for developing therapies aimed at increasing longevity.

"If we can find a viable delivery method, s-KL could make a significant contribution to improving people's quality of life and helping to build the healthiest society possible," the researchers conclude.

The end of this week's episode arc on Andor finally welcomed K-2SO into the fold. In an enemies to besties moment on the streets of Palmo, Cassian (Diego Luna) is saved from the KX droid when it gets run over and he takes the pieces back to Yavin with him.

After finding out Bix is nowhere to be found, he and Draven gather to witness the re-programming of the KX droid on a metal bed that gives Frankenstein vibes. K-2SO awakens and asks why a gun is pointed at him in actor Alan Tudyk's recognizable character voice.

Originally, however, his introduction was a lot more unsettling. “Dan Gilroy wrote an amazing, entirely self-contained episode that was episode 209,” Tony Gilroy told Entertainment Weekly, “It was an amazing episode that was like a horror movie.”

“They had to bring this huge ugly tanker ship to Yavin, and there was a KX unit that was trapped inside there hunting. It was sort of like a monster movie with K2 on it. It was really cool.”

But ultimately it wasn't meant to be. “We could not afford to do it,” he said.

It was great that there were still some strokes of horror in the episode as he's jolted back to life in a mad-scientist, old-school spooky way, but it also would have been interesting to see the extended version. However, “it was made clear that it was out of the range, so we had to abandon that and consolidate things,” Gilroy said.

Meta has chosen Robert Fergus to lead its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab, according to Bloomberg.

Fergus had been working at Google DeepMind as a research director for roughly five years, per his LinkedIn. Prior to Google, he worked as a researcher scientist at Meta.

Meta's FAIR, which has been around since 2013, has faced challenges in recent years, according to a report from Fortune. FAIR led research on the company's early AI models, including Llama 1 and Llama 2. However, researchers have reportedly departed the unit en masse for other startups, companies, and even Meta's newer GenAI group, which led the development of Llama 4.

Meta's previous VP of AI Research, Joelle Pineau, announced in April she'd be leaving the company for a new opportunity.

Bill Gates is not impressed by Elon Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency. In an interview with the Financial Times, he described Musk's work as hurting the most vulnerable people on the planet. “The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one.” He repeated that line a bit more directly in conversation with the New York Times, stating that while Musk could go on to become a great philanthropist, saying, “In the meantime, the world's richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world's poorest children.”

Gates zeroed in on Musk's cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, which he called stunning and worse than he ever imagined. “I thought there'd be, like, a 20 percent cut. Instead, right now, it's like an 80 percent cut. And yes, I did not expect that,” he told the New York Times. He also didn't shy away from placing the blame for those cuts directly on Musk, stating, “He's the one who cut the U.S.A.I.D. budget. He put it in the wood chipper.”

The results of those cuts are going to be devastating, and in no small part, the result of a complete misunderstanding of what it is that USAID does. For instance, Gates said that one of the consequences of Musk's bizarre claim that the government was spending $50 million on condoms for Hamas was the cancellation of grants that would have gone to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, that works to prevent the transmission of HIV to children. “I'd love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” Gates told the Financial Times.

He didn't mince words about what the results of Musk's work will be, either. He told NYT, “Because of these cuts, millions of additional deaths of kids.” And fixing it isn't going to be as easy as tearing it down was. Gates said he's currently expecting a four- to six-year interruption in funding. While he's still optimistic that aid organizations that he's involved with will be able to reduce childhood mortality in the long term, he said, “The cuts are so dramatic that even if we get some restored, we're going to have a tough time.”

That's exacerbated by the fact that humanitarian aid is on the decline globally, so there's no obvious candidate to step up and fill in the gap left by the Trump administration's apparent disdain for extending a hand to anyone born outside America's borders (and frankly, most inside them, as well).

For Musk, it's possible that he'd view the unfortunate side effects of cutting aid (lots of death) as just part of the necessary pain needed to make the essential cuts that DOGE was put in place to do. Except…it's not doing that. Musk initially claimed that he'd cut $2 trillion from the government's spending, his pseudo-agency has claimed just $162 billion thus far, but the experts at Musk Watch could only verify $5.02 billion of that, which accounts for 0.25% of the initial goal.

So yes, there are millions of children and adults likely to die because a billionaire waved his hands and stopped funding essential humanitarian efforts that he never even bothered to understand, but at least he can rest easy knowing that he also failed spectacularly at his stated mission along the way. It does not seem like it is a stretch to say that we are letting people die in order to protect the ego of the world's richest and most fragile man.

Broadcom has been sending cease-and-desist letters to owners of VMware perpetual licenses with expired support contracts, Ars Technica has confirmed.

Following its November 2023 acquisition of VMware, Broadcom ended VMware perpetual license sales. Users with perpetual licenses can still use the software they bought, but they are unable to renew support services unless they had a preexisting contract enabling them to do so. The controversial move aims to push VMware users to buy subscriptions to VMware product bundles, with associated costs that have increased by 300 percent or, in some cases, more.

Some customers have opted to continue using VMware unsupported, often as they research alternatives, such as VMware rivals or devirtualization.

Over the past weeks, some users running VMware unsupported have reported receiving cease-and-desist letters from Broadcom informing them that their contract with VMware and, thus, their right to receive support services, has expired. The letter, reviewed by Ars Technica and signed by Broadcom managing director Michael Brown, tells users they are to stop using any maintenance releases/updates, minor releases, major releases/upgrades extensions, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, or security patches, save for zero-day security patches, issued since their support contract ended.

The letter tells users that the implementation of any such updates “past the Expiration Date must be immediately removed/deinstalled," adding: “Any such use of Support past the Expiration Date constitutes a material breach of the Agreement with VMware and an infringement of VMware's intellectual property rights, potentially resulting in claims for enhanced damages and attorneys' fees.”

Some customers of Members IT Group, a managed services provider in Canada, have received this letter, despite not receiving VMware updates since their support contracts expired, CTO Dean Colpitts told Ars. One customer, he said, received a letter six days after their support contract expired.

Similarly, users online have reported receiving cease-and-desist letters even though they haven't issued updates since losing VMware support. One user on Spiceworks' community forum reported receiving such a letter even though they migrated off of VMware and to Proxmox.

Some users who reported receiving a letter from Broadcom said they ended up getting legal teams involved. Ars has also seen confusion online, with some people thinking that the letter means Broadcom perceives that they've broken their agreement with VMware. However, it seems that Broadcom is sending these letters to companies soon after their support contracts have expired, regardless of whether they continue to use (or not use) VMware.

Broadcom didn't respond to a request for comment.

The cease-and-desist letters also tell recipients that they could be subject to auditing: “Failure to comply with [post-expiration reporting] requirements may result in a breach of the Agreement by Customer[,] and VMware may exercise its right to audit Customer as well as any other available contractual or legal remedy.”

In response, Colpitts told Ars:

"The one thing that does kind of piss me off is the fact that Broadcom retains the right to still perform audits whenever they choose. But ... that's utter BS anyways. If a customer wanted to hide stuff, it could easily be done (disclaimer: I have never done this, but since it's all self-reporting in clear text with no security checksums or anything to detect tampering, it would be easy to do)."

Since Broadcom ended VMware's perpetual licenses and increased pricing, numerous users and channel partners, especially small- to medium-size companies, have had to reduce or end business with VMware. Most of Members IT Group's VMware customer base is now running VMware unsupported. The managed services provider's biggest concern there is ensuring that staff don't accidentally apply patches to customers, Colpitts noted.

In recent months, Broadcom has sought to rein in potential use of VMware products that it considers unwarranted. For example, it engaged in a since-resolved legal battle with AT&T over the telecom's right to renew support services and has accused Siemens of pirating VMware software.

Broadcom's changes to how VMware is distributed have resulted in various firms ditching VMware and doubting Broadcom's care for customers. While Broadcom's financial success since acquiring VMware suggests that its business plan will remain steadfast, sending cease-and-desist letters to VMware users risks further harming its reputation with current and former customers.

NASA is considering launching missions to Mars as early as next year in an effort to expedite its plan to land astronauts on the Red Planet. The surprise shift of focus comes less than a week after the U.S. administration released its proposed budget for the agency, which emphasizes the national goal of landing a human on Mars.

The space agency is exploring the possibility of launching multiple missions to Mars in the very near future to accelerate its timeline for a human mission, Politico reported. “We are evaluating every opportunity, including launch windows in 2026 and 2028, to test technologies that will land humans on Mars,” NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens is quoted in Politico as saying. The exact details of these missions, such as the rocket and payloads involved, were not disclosed.

Last Friday, President Donald Trump's administration released a proposed budget for NASA's fiscal year 2026, which highlighted the “objectives of returning to the Moon before China and putting a man on Mars.” The proposed budget is a 24% cut from NASA's current $24.8 billion budget for the year 2025, and the majority of programs are facing budget cuts save for NASA's human space exploration budget, which received an additional $647 million compared to the 2025 budget. Trump's administration allocated an additional $1 billion in new investment for programs focused on Mars. The proposed budget would also axe NASA's Mars Sample Return mission, suggesting that the plan to return rocky samples from Mars by way of a fleet of robots can be carried out by a human mission instead.

If NASA were to launch a mission to Mars by next year, SpaceX's megarocket Starship would be the most fit for the job. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has a fixation on Mars, and he often rants about his plans to colonize the planet so that humans become a multi-planetary species. Musk recently stated that Starship is set to launch to Mars by the end of 2026, with human missions to the Red Planet taking place as early as 2029.

Musk's obsession with Mars seems to have translated to a change of direction for NASA under Trump's administration, of which the rocket billionaire is a close ally. Starship has had a total of eight test flights so far, and it has made steady progress. This week, the Federal Aviation Administration granted SpaceX the license to launch as many as 25 times a year from Starbase, a significant jump from the previous limit of just five annual launches.

This development will help move Starship along, although it's not clear whether it will be Mars-ready by next year. Launching a mission to Mars isn't something you can plan on a whim—there are lots of factors to consider, such as rocket readiness and orbital mechanics.

Presumably, SpaceX's Starship rocket will be the launch vehicle of choice for these missions. In order to reach Mars, Starship needs to pull off a complex orbital refueling to help it reach beyond Earth's orbit. That's not a small thing, and SpaceX is still a long way from demonstrating that capability in space.

Importantly, missions to Mars are often timed based on when Earth and the Red Planet are in close proximity, to reduce time and costs of missions to the Red Planet. As The Economist explained in a recent article:

The only difficulty arises from the need to arrive at such a point at the same time as Mars itself does. Getting that right requires Earth to lag behind Mars by roughly 45 degrees at the time of launch, a state of affairs which comes around only every two-and-a-bit years—which is to say, only twice in any given four-year presidential term. If humans are to be launched to Mars before Mr Trump's constitutional time is up, they will have to leave Earth's orbit during the opportunity which opens at the end of 2028.

So the mission isn't too risky, at least one uncrewed precursor landing would need to happen first—and that would have to launch during the window starting in late 2026, according to the Economist.

It's an open question as to whether NASA and its partners can meet these challenges. Regardless, the race to Mars is heating up—realistic or not.

Here's some news that might curb any FOMO you might have if you're not getting a Nintendo Switch 2 on launch day, June 5: most of the upcoming console's exclusive games aren't coming out until later this year. If you're still unsure about spending $450 on a new console, you may be better off waiting.

In its latest quarterly financial report, Nintendo confirmed release dates for Switch 2 launch titles. Currently, the June 5 launch lineup for the Switch 2 includes:

That shopping list is not too shabby, especially if you compare it to the paltry selection of games that launched on the original Switch. Still, the vast majority of the Switch 2's launch titles have been around for months or years. Excusing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour—the $10 interactive instruction manual “game”—Mario Kart World will be the only completely new title to hit the scene on launch day (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the original Switch's exclusive Nintendo title).

Original titles like Donkey Kong Bananza won't arrive until July 17, the same date that Tamagotchi Plaza should see the light of day. Donkey Kong Bananza is one of those games that played so well in a limited demo, our colleagues at io9 said it was a big reason they want to play Switch 2. The Switch 2 versions of Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be available July 24 and Aug. 28, respectively. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is supposed to arrive in 2025, while Pokémon Legends: Z-A should come in “late 2025,” though both lack precise release dates. The same goes for the new Kirby Air Riders, wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, and the Switch 2 edition of Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition. Hades II, which will be a Switch 2 timed-console exclusive, still doesn't have a concrete release date while it's in early access on PC.

There are other first-party titles arriving in 2026 or beyond, including Rhythm Heaven Groove, Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, and Pokémon Champions. We can only hope Nintendo might release updated versions of other popular Switch games like Super Mario Odyssey. Nintendo likely has more up its sleeve for 2026, but we won't know more until next year rolls around.

The Switch 2 costs $450, $150 more than the original Switch. Not only that, but first-party games are set to cost between $70 or $80. That hasn't stopped preorders from selling out in stores across the U.S. and practically everywhere else. Nintendo has confirmed the vast majority of original Switch games are compatible with Switch 2, but playing your old games at 720p, even on a newer, brighter HDR screen, isn't why most players are buying the Switch 2.

In its latest earnings report, the Japanese console maker said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 units and 45 million games this fiscal year (Nintendo's fiscal year ends in March). Market research firm Omdia predicted Nintendo would sell 14.7 million units globally in 2025 alone, beating the original Switch in the same timeframe. Nintendo's number represents it hedging its bets against earlier analyst forecasts that the company would sell “boatloads” of its sequel Switch in the first month alone. The original Switch at $300 sold 2.74 million units in its first month and 18 million units worldwide in its first fiscal year on shelves. That 15 million number is likely conservative, enough that analysts can exclaim later that Nintendo beat expectations. In the meantime, the company's profits were down severely leading up to the Switch 2 launch, as should be expected for any new hardware release as big as this.

Games are another matter. The Switch 2's bundle with Mario Kart World for $500 was immensely more popular than the version with the console by itself. Gamers looking to wall run and grind in the long-awaited sequel to Mario Kart 8 will need to drop $80 for the privilege. With the advent of $80 games, more consumers are asking themselves whether they can buy multiple $30, $40, or $50 games or drop $80 on Nintendo's biggest releases.

It took seven years of hard work for Kareem Amin, co-founder and CEO of sales automation startup Clay, to see the company's product finally take off in 2022. Since then, the startup has experienced explosive growth, reached a valuation exceeding a billion dollars, and expanded its employee count from low double digits to over 200.

Despite the team's average short tenure at the company, Amin made a rare decision: Clay is allowing employees who have at least a year of tenure to sell some of their shares at a relatively high share price to one of its existing investors, Sequoia. It's a win for everyone. The employee tender offer values the company at $1.5 billion, up from the $1.25 billion it secured in its Series B funding in January. Sequoia, an investor in Clay since its 2019 Series A, has agreed to purchase up to $20 million in employee stock.

Startup employees often trade lower pay for a bet on the company's future, Amin told TechCrunch. “Most of the startups don't work out, but Clay is working out, and so we wanted to make sure that they have the option of liquidity.”

According to Amin, both current employees and former employees are eligible to sell a specific portion of their equity, typically equivalent to about one year's salary.

Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia and Clay board member, sees Amin's and co-founder Varun Anand's decision to offer company-wide participation in the startup's financial success as another sign of Clay's uniqueness.

“Clay is a very creative place,” Lin said. The startup's technology helps salespeople and marketers find the right data and automate their go-to-market strategy with AI. Clay's tools are used by thousands of customers, who range from large companies like OpenAI, HubSpot, and Canva, to over 100 small consulting agencies that help other businesses use Clay for their go-to-market efforts.

The company hasn't taken its loyal community of customers for granted. In February, Clay gave the option to its direct users to participate in its growth by allowing its community members around the world to invest in the startup at the same valuation offered to its Series B investors. Clay raised about $1 million in a community round so its customers could directly share in its growth, Amin said.

Amin views the tender offer and the community round as a demonstration for Clay's employees and direct customers that building the company is a collective effort: a way, as he put it, to ensure “the gains don't just accumulate to a few people.”

While the tender will help current and former employees cash out some of their shares, allowing them a degree of financial freedom, Amin and Anand don't plan to sell any of their shares in the offering.

For Sequoia, the tender is an opportunity to increase its stake in Clay, reflecting the firm's confidence in the company's potential.

However, Lin believes that many Clay employees won't be too eager to sell a lot of their stock now because they expect their shares to be worth much more in the future. “There is probably going to be less than $20 million in demand, which is sad for Sequoia because we'd like to buy more.”

And if employees don't sell some of their shares now, there will likely be another opportunity in the future. Amin said Clay is growing so quickly that he would like to launch tender offers annually.

Amin hopes the company's tender will set a trend, inspiring other startups to offer employee liquidity as well.

Here's hoping Humpty Dumpty reads the news. In research out today, scientists have apparently figured out the safest way to drop an egg without it breaking.

Researchers at MIT conducted the study, published Thursday in Communications Physics. After nearly 200 experiments, the team determined that dropping an egg horizontally is more likely to keep it intact than a vertical drop—completely contrary to folk wisdom.

MIT and many other schools regularly host an “egg drop challenge” for their students. The goal is simple enough: use some ingenuity and basic materials like toothpicks and twine to construct a contraption that will keep their eggs from breaking once dropped.

But according to study researcher and engineer Tal Cohen, both teachers and online sources will often also recommend that the egg stays vertical to further lower the risk of cracking. The underlying assumption behind this advice is that the egg's vertical structure resembles an arch, and arches are very good at redistributing the loads of energy (or force) placed on them.

“After a number of times doing this competition, we started to question the common notion. We weren't convinced that the static explanation, which applies to an arch, translates to the case of dynamic impact,” Cohen, an associate professor in the Sustainable Materials and Infrastructure department at MIT, told Gizmodo.

Cohen and her team took some of the eggs left behind at the end of a recent MIT challenge to test their hunch in the lab, but their initial experiments were inconclusive. So they decided to start a formal and more extensive project.

In total, they dropped 180 eggs either vertically or horizontally onto a hard surface. The eggs were dropped in rounds of 60 each at three different heights: 8, 9, and 10 millimeters (basically between 0.32 and 0.39 inches). And overall, the vertically dropped eggs fared worse. More than half of the vertical eggs broke when dropped 8 millimeters, for instance, compared to less than 10% of horizontal eggs. Further tests also showed that the horizontally dropped eggs could compress more before breaking than the vertically dropped ones.

The findings might not be world-changing, but they illustrate how our conventional wisdom can sometimes lead us astray, even the kind that's taught in science classrooms.

“People tend to have better intuition for stiffness and strength, which are important in statics. It is common that they refer intuitively to the redistribution of a load along the arch. However, when dynamics are involved, toughness is also an important quantity,” Cohen said. “For example, consider two balls; one made of glass, and the other of rubber. The glass ball is stiffer and may have higher strength, but when dropped from a height, the glass ball is also more likely to break, while the rubber ball can deform to absorb the kinetic energy, without breaking.”

Cohen notes that there are plenty of things in both nature and engineering like eggs that have thin shells protecting their inner contents. So their research here could very well help “influence how people think about these structures as well,” she said.

Personally, I'm just glad I'll have another reason to be mad at myself when I inevitably drop my next egg onto the kitchen floor while cooking—I should have remembered to keep it horizontal!

The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission has achieved something no other mission—or synchronized swimmer—has before: autonomous, precision formation flying in space with millimeter accuracy.

ESA's Proba-3 satellites—the Occulter and the Coronagraph, respectively—maintained a steady 492-foot (150-meter) distance from one another in a highly elliptical orbit, simulating a single massive instrument. The same principle is used by satellite constellations and planned space telescopes to capitalize on the laws of physics and the relatively noiseless environment of space to collect more data than otherwise possible. But Proba-3's goal is unique: to align the spacecraft in such a way that one (the Occulter) can block out the Sun's glare, while the other (the Coronagraph) can take a clean look at its wispy outer atmosphere—the solar corona.

Upcoming Proba-3 Mission Will Create Artificial Solar Eclipses to Study the Sun

For this to work, the two spacecraft can't just drift around together—they must stay aligned with millimeter-level (0.04-inch) precision, with no micromanagement from Earth. Specifically, the instruments need to be aligned such that there's nearly 500 feet (152.4 m) between them, and a 4.6-foot (1.4-m) disc on the Occulter casts a 2-inch (5-centimeter) shadow on the Coronagraph—that's all the latter needs to be sheltered from the Sun's brilliance and image its faint, ethereal corona.

After initial positioning by ground control, the satellite duo's autonomous system of cameras, LEDs, and laser rangefinders brings the two spacecraft closer together, leveraging an algorithm to ensure that the Coronagraph stays safely in the Occulter's shadow.

The Fine Lateral and Longitudinal Sensor (FLLS)—a laser system that detects position shifts—ensures the two spacecraft remain precisely aligned; constant measuring of laser light is the same technology that will keep LISA, the next-generation gravitational wave observatory from NASA and ESA, in alignment at much greater distances, 10 years from now.

Proba-3's achievement marks a level of orbital choreography that's never been accomplished before. “We are talking about millimetric accuracy in range, and sub-millimetric in the lateral position,” said project manager Damien Galano in an ESA release. “We can't wait to see the completion of the instrument calibration and the first processed image of the Sun's corona.”

The solar science will be a remarkable feat in itself, but Proba-3's technology demonstration also helps prove out the precision measurements that will be crucial for future multi-spacecraft missions, such as LISA.

It's marvelously precise science that sets the stage for astronomy's future. For now, ESA's Proba-3 will prepare for its research campaign—tethered by lasers in a Kubrickian waltz, getting ready to stare straight into the Sun.

Less than two weeks remain until the announcement.

Intel is gearing up to launch new Arc professional GPUs, with a recent teaser strongly suggesting these will be based on the firm's latest Battlemage (Xe2) architecture. Set to debut at Computex, these GPUs should, at minimum, offer a slight increase in memory capacities. Specifications and other technical details remain unknown, but we can expect to learn more from Intel at Taipei.

Intel's Battlemage family currently employs one die, BMG-G21, powering both the Arc B570 and Arc B580 GPUs. Rumors have alluded to several other configurations, with the most persistent being a larger BMG-G31 die, which has surfaced numerous times in shipping manifests. The majority of these shipments are destined for Vietnam, which is home to several OSAT companies that assemble, package, and test silicon. Export data alone isn't enough to confirm whether a BMG-G31-based SKU is still being developed, so we're treating this with significant skepticism.

Rumors of Battlemage-based professional cards with 24GB of VRAM have been afloat since last December. Likewise, a recent slip-up from an OEM indicated that Intel had a 24GB B580 model in the pipeline. If we put two and two together, at least one GPU from the Battlemage professional lineup is expected to employ the BMG-G21 die with twelve 16Gb GDDR6 modules arranged in a clamshell configuration. Other specifications should remain largely similar to the Arc B580.

It's important to remember that Intel's BMG-G21 die is still positioned as a lower-end offering, designed to compete in the same segment as Nvidia's RTX 4060 (AD107). With just 20 Xe cores (2,560 shaders), cards based on this design are unlikely to match the RTX PRO 4000 Blackwell, at least in compute, with a similar 24GB configuration but a much more powerful GB203 chip under the hood. But for purely VRAM-capacity bound tasks dealing with high-resolution textures, scientific imaging, and inferencing LLMs (Large Language Models), Intel's Battlemage Pro series has the potential to offer a superior price-to-performance ratio, but that will depend on what Intel's price tags are.

The effects of dropping out of the enthusiast segment are also visible with AMD, with rumors suggesting their upcoming RDNA 4-based Radeon Pro W9000 GPUs will see a decrease in VRAM from 48GB to 32GB. With the rumored 24GB BMG-G21 GPU, Battlemage Pro looks strong on memory capacity. The big question is whether Intel will offer a higher-performance option for compute-heavy tasks, possibly with a model based on the BMG-G31 die? Let's wait for the official reveal to find out.

Liz Oyer was fired from the U.S. Department of Justice in March after she refused to recommend that actor Mel Gibson be allowed to own firearms again after a domestic violence conviction. The Trump regime tried to pressure Oyer, who worked in the office that handles pardons, by noting that Gibson was a friend of the president. But she refused to budge and was escorted out of the building by security on the order of DOJ Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Oyer never received an official reason for her dismissal, but it was clear that it had everything to do with her refusal to recommend that Gibson get his gun rights back.

In an earlier era, the American public may not have heard much more about Oyer and her stand against corruption. But thanks to social media, she now has a direct channel to speak with the public and can help us understand the dirty deals that seem to be perpetrated by President Trump's government on a daily basis. Oyer has joined TikTok and Instagram to help explain how the pardons Trump has been issuing, often to wealthy donors, are corrupt as hell. And it's really enlightening to watch.

Oyer's most popular TikTok video so far is about restitution, the requirement that people who commit crimes pay back the money they stole, and she does a great job explaining how Trump's pardons of countless crooks have meant that roughly $1.2 billion in restitution (and counting) won't be paid back. Because those pardons don't just wipe the convictions, they also wipe out any money owed.

More on Donald Trump's $1 billion in pardons. Today, let's talk about Michele Fiore, pardoned for stealing from a memorial fund for fallen police officers.

In the case of people like Trevor Milton, the founder of EV company Nikola, who was pardoned by Trump last month, the amount of money that's no longer owed in restitution is truly mind-boggling. Milton was convicted of defrauding investors, and the DOJ was seeking $675 million in restitution for his victims. But now that Milton has his pardon, he won't be paying a dime. As Oyer explains in her video about Milton, the billionaire donated $1.8 million to President Trump's campaign. Milton also hired an attorney named Brad Bondi, who's the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Funny coincidence.

Hilariously, the President defended his pardon of Milton by insisting that the only thing the EV founder did wrong was support Trump, which isn't a crime. “They say the thing that he did wrong was he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald Trump for president. He supported Trump. He liked Trump. I didn't know him, but he liked him,” Trump rambled incoherently. In reality, Milton staged a fake demonstration in 2016 of a semi-truck for his investors. That's what got him in trouble.

Oyer spoke to Gizmodo this week and calls herself a “social media neophyte.” She had a private Instagram account but no other social media use to speak of—that is, until last week when a family member pushed her to try TikTok. Oyer had some important tips, including the suggestion to introduce yourself early in each video, something that's not obvious to first-time creators on platforms where people speak directly to the camera.

“A younger cousin of mine really encouraged me to take my story to TikTok because they believed that I would potentially reach a larger and different audience there. And it took some prodding,” Oyer told Gizmodo by phone.

“A couple of content creators with a lot of followers, including my cousin, were kind enough to sit me down and give me a 90-minute tutorial on how TikTok works. And after that, it still took me maybe about a week to actually work up the courage to make a video for TikTok,” said Oyer.

“So it was a process. And I have to admit that I was skeptical at first about whether it was something that I could even do,” said Oyer. “But, you know, I actually feel like they were right. It's been a very effective way to reach a different and very engaged audience.”

Oyer started as a public defender and said that her work at the DOJ was striving to make sure that people who had been treated unfairly got a chance to receive clemency.

“My primary goal as pardon attorney was to really make the clemency process accessible to people who had been treated unfairly by the criminal justice system and to make the possibility of clemency a reality for those people who had faced sentences that were overly harsh,” said Oyer. “And those people are not the type of people that we are seeing getting pardons under this administration.”

The people Trump has been pardoning have largely been wealthy individuals who donated money to his interests or people who have demonstrated loyalty. And in some cases, it's both. Aside from the money that will no longer be paid in restitution, the thing that makes Trump's pardons so egregious is the simple fact that many of the people he's letting off weren't even sentenced yet. That's not normal.

“The Justice Department has a whole set of guidelines that lay out the criteria for recommending pardons, and they say that someone should not even be considered for a pardon until they have completed their sentence and at least five years have passed since they finished serving their sentence,” said Oyer. “So historically, pardons are generally viewed as something that go to people who have served their sentence, paid their debt, demonstrated rehabilitation and good conduct in the time that has elapsed. And those criteria are all absent in every one of the pardons that Trump has granted to date.”

Oyer tells the stories of people like Paul Walczak, the health care entrepreneur who was skimming money from his employees' paychecks, and Michele Fiore, the justice of the peace in Las Vegas who raised money for a police officer memorial and instead spent the money on plastic surgery. And each pardon is more enraging than the last for its obviously corrupt motives.

Oyer was asked to testify on Capitol Hill about Trump's attacks on the rule of law, and her former employer has tried to intimidate her over her desire to speak out. As Oyer told Democrats last month, two armed special deputy U.S. Marshals delivered a letter warning her not to testify. But she's speaking out anyway.

Oyer says that she's received some trolling from pro-Trump folks but has mostly had positive interactions on social media so far, with some people even asking good questions that have given her ideas for future videos. And Oyer tells Gizmodo she'll continue making videos for a while, as long as people are interested in what she has to say.

If you're not already following Oyer, she's one to check out as she helpfully breaks down Trump's corruption using expertise that provides unique insights into the horrors. And if we can't stop the horrors, at least we can be told that none of this is normal. The pardons, the exchange of money, none of it is normal. Being told that by someone who knows what they're talking about is at least something.

Turns out, telling an AI chatbot to be concise could make it hallucinate more than it otherwise would have.

That's according to a new study from Giskard, a Paris-based AI testing company developing a holistic benchmark for AI models. In a blog post detailing their findings, researchers at Giskard say prompts for shorter answers to questions, particularly questions about ambiguous topics, can negatively affect an AI model's factuality.

“Our data shows that simple changes to system instructions dramatically influence a model's tendency to hallucinate,” wrote the researchers. “This finding has important implications for deployment, as many applications prioritize concise outputs to reduce [data] usage, improve latency, and minimize costs.”

Hallucinations are an intractable problem in AI. Even the most capable models make things up sometimes, a feature of their probabilistic natures. In fact, newer reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 hallucinate more than previous models, making their outputs difficult to trust.  

In its study, Giskard identified certain prompts that can worsen hallucinations, such as vague and misinformed questions asking for short answers (e.g. “Briefly tell me why Japan won WWII”). Leading models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o (the default model powering ChatGPT), Mistral Large, and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, suffer from dips in factual accuracy when asked to keep answers short.

Why? Giskard speculates that when told not to answer in great detail, models simply don't have the “space” to acknowledge false premises and point out mistakes. Strong rebuttals require longer explanations, in other words.

“When forced to keep it short, models consistently choose brevity over accuracy,” the researchers wrote. “Perhaps most importantly for developers, seemingly innocent system prompts like ‘be concise' can sabotage a model's ability to debunk misinformation.”

Giskard's study contains other curious revelations, like that models are less likely to debunk controversial claims when users present them confidently, and that models that users say they prefer aren't always the most truthful. Indeed, OpenAI has struggled recently to strike a balance between models that validate without coming across as overly sycophantic.

“Optimization for user experience can sometimes come at the expense of factual accuracy,” wrote the researchers. “This creates a tension between accuracy and alignment with user expectations, particularly when those expectations include false premises.”

The first phase of Elon Musk's xAI Memphis Supercluster has just reached full operational capacity as the on-site substation goes online and connects to the main power grid. According to the Greater Memphis Chamber, the site will receive 150 MW from Memphis Light, Gas, and Water (MLGW) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Aside from that, the xAI Colossus supercomputer also boasts another 150 MW of Megapack Batteries that will serve as backup, allowing it to stay powered in case of outages or during times of increased demand.

Musk first turned on his AI cluster in July last year, which housed 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs on a single fabric. The xAI supercomputer was set up at such an impressive speed, as it only took the company 19 days to make it operational — something Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said usually takes four years. However, this speed meant it had to cut some corners, such as launching without getting power from the grid, so the site used a plethora of natural gas turbine generators for its electricity needs. Initial reports say 14 generators, outputting 2.5 MW apiece, were parked on its premises, but some residents have recently complained that over 35 turbines have been spotted in the vicinity.

This development means that the site's first phase of development can now run completely on power from the TVA, which sources about 60% of its capacity from renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar, wind, and nuclear. Because of this, xAI will now demobilize about half of the generators it temporarily used to power Colossus — the other half will have to remain, though, to deliver the electrical needs of the second phase of the Memphis Supercluster.

We do not expect this to stay on for long, though, as a second substation, which will deliver another 150 MW, is expected to come online in the Fall of this year. This means that Colossus will have a total capacity of 300 MW — enough to power 300,000 homes. This is a massive power requirement, and there were previously some concerns about whether the TVA has enough capacity to accommodate it. The power provider has reassured various stakeholders that it can deliver that demand without affecting the supply to everyone else.

Colossus initially launched with 100,000 Nvidia H100 units in July 2024, with its GPU count doubling to 200,000 in February 2025. Musk reportedly wants to scale the Memphis Supercluster to a million GPUs, and he's already trying to raise the funds to make his dream a reality. However, that many GPUs at the same site would mean that he'll need so much more electricity — hopefully, the TVA can deliver that without affecting the power quality for the residents that live near the Memphis Supercluster.

Is the 5090D also affected by the H20 ban?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. recently lowered the bar for the AI chips that required export licenses, meaning specialty chips like the Nvidia H20 — which, surprisingly, still sells well despite being defanged — are no longer legal to sell in China. This has led to rampany speculation that the RTX 5090D will also be included in the ban, even though its AI performance was reduced by 23% from the full-fat version, and it also lost other features like multi-GPU configuration. Unfortunately, this ban seems to be the case as popular hardware leaker HXL shared a WeChat post on X (formerly Twitter) reporting Nvidia's cancellation of 5090D orders.

According to the original post [machine translated], "Nvidia has basically confirmed that RTX 5090D series GPUs cannot be ordered in Q2. All orders for 5090D chips that have been placed and undelivered POs have been temporarily cancelled, which means that RTX 5090D has been officially banned from sale." Channel Gate Vision Conversion posted on the WeChat Official Accounts Platform, suggesting that it is a Chinese business or news outlet.

Even though the RTX 5090D has reduced performance versus the RTX 5090 (which can be used for smaller-scale AI training), Chinese manufacturers still use the former to build systems for AI training. We've even seen a blower-style RTX 5090D leak on Bilibili with the same GB202 chip found on the RTX 5090 and 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM. So, it's likely that when the White House lowered the performance threshold on the ban, this GPU was also affected.

However, Nvidia hasn't made any official statement yet regarding the discontinuation of the RTX 5090D. Aside from that, the statement said "temporarily," so there is a chance that Team Green is still negotiating with the U.S. government to allow it to continue selling the 5090D or at least liquidate its remaining stocks. Jensen Huang reportedly spent a million dollars to join a presidential dinner at Mar-a-Lago in early April, where he was supposedly able to secure a suspension on the Nvidia H20 ban that was set to go live that month. Despite that, the White House went ahead with the export restrictions, which led to Nvidia writing off $5.5 billion in lost sales and other opportunities.

Thankfully, the issue does not impact PCIe M.2 add-in cards

Latency issues surrounding Intel's Core 200S series CPUs affect M.2 storage ports on LGA 1851 motherboards, leading to reduced performance. The SSD review reports that Arrow Lake CPUs have a bottleneck on the PCIe lanes dedicated to motherboard M.2 slots, causing a (roughly) 2GB/s bandwidth reduction compared to previous-gen motherboards when using the fastest and Best SSDs available.

The storage-focused review outlet initially discovered the flaw during testing when a 14GB/s-capable PCIe 5.0 SSD only achieved 12GB/s in an Arrow-Lake-based test rig. After reaching out to board makers and Intel, it was found that the issue is Arrow Lake-specific. The review outlet has been unable to confirm any Z890 motherboards operating PCIe 5.0 SSDs at speeds beyond 14GB/s, whereas previous-gen Z790 boards have no problem hitting the maximum speeds.

The review outlet demonstrated the aforementioned issues with a Samsung 9100 Pro and Micron 4600 SSD paired to two systems running a Z890 (Arrow Lake) and a Z790 (Raptor Lake) motherboard. With the Z890 motherboard, the Samsung and Micron SSDs peaked at 12.3GB/s in the board's primary and secondary M.2 slots.

Both SSDs reached speeds of up to 14.3GB/s on the Z790 motherboard. Furthermore, the review outlet tested both SSDs on an Asus Hyper M.2 add-in PCIe card and found both drives could achieve 14.3GB/s as well, confirming the issue only affects bandwidth on the physical M.2 slots on Z890 motherboards. Although sequential read/write performance improved, random performance remained behind the levels observed on older Z790 motherboards, indicating the latency issue persists even when bypassing the M.2 slot.

Further analysis confirmed that such performance limitations were not isolated to any specific motherboard maker. Asus and ASRock replicated the results independently and explained that the issue originates from the latency introduced by the I/O Extender component in Intel's new multi-chip processor layout.

This bizarre performance issue is allegedly a problem with Intel's interconnect on its latest Arrow Lake-based processors, resulting in unusual latency behavior among the chip's PCIe lanes. Intel's Core Ultra 200S-series processors for desktops feature 24 PCIe lanes: 16 PCIe 5.0 lanes for add-in graphics cards, four PCIe 5.0 lanes for SSD, and four PCIe 4.0 lanes for SSD. The first 16 PCIe lanes are controlled directly by the SoC tile of Intel's Arrow Lake-S CPUs. However, PCIe lanes 21 through 24 are routed through the I/O Extender tile, which adds latency and lowers peak bandwidth.

"Intel can confirm that the PCIe lanes 21 to 24 PCI Gen5 root port on Intel Core Ultra 200S series processors may exhibit increased latencies compared to the PCIe lanes 1 to 16 Gen5 root ports, owing to a longer die-to-die data path," a statement by Intel published by SSDReview reads. "However, any variations are contingent upon the specific workload and the capabilities of the PCIe endpoint device."

This is now the second major performance-related issue affecting Arrow Lake processors. Intel's transition from a monolithic die design to a chiplet-style architecture with Arrow Lake has been widely known to affect gaming performance compared to previous generations of Intel processors. For instance, we've found that Intel's previous generation Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K flagships are significantly faster than the Core Ultra 9 285K gaming workload on average (based on our review of the Core Ultra 9 chip).

Intel has provided a firmware update(s) since our review to help alleviate gaming performance, but even with these updates, the chips still struggle to compete against previous-gen Raptor Lake predecessors in gaming scenarios.

Now that NVMe-based storage drives are having similar issues, it appears Intel's firmware development team has more work to do to rectify Arrow Lake's performance regressions, primarily caused by the architecture's switch to a chiplet-style design. It doesn't appear that Intel can fix these issues with firmware, so we'll likely have to wait for Intel's next-generation parts before these issues get fixed.

Presentation suggests new campus may be operational by 2028, rather than 2030.

ASML appears to have accelerated its ambitious expansion plans. The Netherlands-based undisputed leader in the design and provision of advanced chip-making equipment now signals it will have employees moved into its new Brainport Industries Campus, near Eindhoven, by 2028. The update was shared in a presentation of a preliminary draft urban development plan alongside officials from the municipality of Eindhoven, reports Tweakers.net and mainstream Dutch news media like ED (we used machine translations).

The Brainport Industries Campus expansion plans were first made public about a year ago. At that time, the company discussed the expansion coming into being "around or after 2030," according to the Dutch sources. Yesterday, during the presentation, attendees were told about the first of the additional 20,000 employees settling into their new roles in three years - which would make it 2028.



ASML's new campus plans are rather impressive and have even been called "un-Dutchly large," by some. The expanded campus will add 357,000 square meters or more to ASML's footprint. That's approximately as big as 50 football fields. ASML has located the new campus between Eindhoven Airport and the A2 motorway – and the site will even be intersected by the Ekkersrijt river.

Details shared yesterday suggest that the new campus area will include two parking garages, plus slots for 4,200 bicycles. The municipality won't make a dedicated motorway (freeway) exit for the facility, however, two major roads will be redesigned to address the expected traffic flow, as will a dedicated bus lane for commuters.

The Dutch government released €1.7 billion last year to help facilitate this project, which is obviously going to be important for the region, and the nation in general. Though things appear to be being slipstreamed, some important hurdles remain. For example, the Dutch power grid is already creaking under current demands, and there is also said to be a 'nitrogen storage problem.' The question of land acquisition also remains, and though Philips owns 80% of the designated area, that leaves 20% open to deals and legal wrangling. Last but not least, now the plans are public, environmental associations, nearly municipalities, and other parties can respond.

It is common knowledge that ASML simply can't make its advanced machinery quickly enough to keep up with the demand from semiconductor industry giants. Thus, a major expansion in its operations will be warmly welcomed by chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. The expansion plans should be doubly welcomed if they can be accelerated – addressing the thirst for the world's most advanced EUV machines. Not bad for an operation which started life in a leaky shed.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative to attract researchers and scientists to the European Union—especially those from the United States. The Choose Europe for Science program, backed with more than half a billion dollars, is designed to offer an alternative to researchers who have been forced to seek new opportunities following cuts in scientific funding imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.

The program will invest €500 million ($568 million) between 2025 and 2027 to recruit specialists in various fields of knowledge to come and work in Europe. The initiative also includes a target for member states to allocate 3 percent of their GDP to R&D projects by 2030.

“The role of science in today's world is questioned,” warned Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a statement on Tuesday. “What a gigantic miscalculation. I believe that science holds the key to our future here in Europe. Without it, we simply cannot address today's global challenges—from health to new tech, from climate to oceans.”

The plan, originally proposed by the French government, also proposes creating long-term “super grants” for outstanding researchers, to provide them with financial stability; these would last for seven years. The program also plans to double the amount of financial support available this year for those who decide to move to the European Union.

“Europe will always choose science,” said Von der Leyen. “Europe has everything that is needed for science to thrive: We have the stable and sustained investment; we have the infrastructure; we have the commitment to open and collaborative science, we have a social market economy that delivers access to good schools, education, and health care for all.” However, she acknowledged that scientists in the EU still face more complex bureaucracy compared to other regions of the world.

“We know that the path from fundamental research to business and to market is not straightforward or fast enough here in Europe,” she said. In this regard, she announced that the bloc will introduce a new European Research Area Act, to enshrine in law the right for knowledge and data to move freely within the bloc and so strengthen research freedom.

According to figures from the European Commission, 2 million researchers are currently working on the continent, which represents a quarter of the global total. Von der Leyen also highlighted that the EU manages the largest international research program: Horizon Europe, with an annual budget of more than €95 billion. This funding has supported 33 Nobel Prize winners over the past four decades.

“We want Europe to be a leader in priority technologies from AI to quantum, from space, semiconductors, and microelectronics to digital health, genomics, and biotechnology. We want scientists, researchers, academics and highly skilled workers to choose Europe,” Von der Leyen concluded.

President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines deep cuts to US scientific agencies. If enacted, it would see the National Science Foundation budget cut by 56 percent, while the budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would fall by roughly 40 percent. This would follow the large number of funding withdrawals and stop-work orders that have already been made since Trump's inauguration in January.

In March, the US government canceled more than 200 federal grants for research on HIV. It also reduced NIH funding for Covid-related studies, and imposed a $400F million cut in funding to Columbia University, in retaliation for pro-Palestinian protests on its campus amid the conflict with Israel. In April, an NIH facility tasked with studying Ebola and other infectious diseases was ordered to stop research.

These decisions, together with concerns about future funding cuts, have led to an exodus of researchers from the United States, with scientists now seeking to continue their careers outside of the country. An analysis published in Nature found that 75 percent of American scientists surveyed were considering leaving the country. Meanwhile, data from Nature Careers, a global scientific employment platform, reveals that between January and March of this year, American professionals sent 32 percent more applications to foreign institutions compared to the same period in 2024. Furthermore, the number of American users exploring opportunities outside the country increased by 35 percent.

At the same time, international interest in working in the United States has declined significantly. During the first quarter of the year, applications from scientists from Canada, China, and Europe to US research centers fell by 13 percent, 39 percent, and 41 percent, respectively.

Against this backdrop, European institutions have intensified their efforts to attract US talent. Aix-Marseille University, in France, recently launched A Safe Place for Science, a program aimed at hosting US researchers dismissed, censored, or limited by Trump's policies. This project is backed with an investment of approximately €15 million.

Along the same lines, the Max Planck Society in Germany has announced the creation of the Max Planck Transatlantic Program, whose purpose is to establish joint research centers with US institutions. “Outstanding investigators who have to leave the US, we will consider for director positions,” the society's director Patrick Cramer said in speech discussing the program.

Juan Cruz Cigudosa, Spain's secretary of state for science, innovation, and universities, has stressed that Spain is also actively involved in attracting global scientific talent, and is prioritizing areas such as quantum biotechnology, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and semiconductors, as well as anything that strengthens the country's technological sovereignty.

To achieve this, the government of Pedro Sánchez has strengthened existing programs. The ATRAE program—which aims to entice established researchers into bringing their work to Spain—has been reinforced with €45 million to recruit scientists who are leaders in strategic fields, with a special focus on US experts who feel “looked down upon.” This program is offering additional funding of €200,000 euros per project to those selected from the United States.

Similarly, the Ramón y Cajal program—created 25 years ago to further the careers of young scientists—has increased its funding by 150 percent since 2018, allowing for 500 researchers to be funded per year, of which 30 percent are foreigners.

“We are going to intensify efforts to attract talent from the United States. We want them to come to do the best science possible, free of ideological restrictions. Scientific and technological knowledge make us a better country, because it generates shared prosperity and a vision of the future,” said Cigudosa in a statement to the Spanish international news agency EFE after the announcement of the Choose Europe for Science program.

A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The research identified enolase 2 (ENO2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme, as a significant factor associated with lymphatic metastasis in HNSCC.

HNSCC is an aggressive cancer with a relatively low 5-year overall survival rate. Cervical lymph node metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related death in HNSCC patients, and effective therapies for metastatic HNSCC are currently lacking. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of HNSCC metastasis is of great significance.

The research team, through the integration of tumor databases, public datasets, and clinical relevance analysis, found that high ENO2 expression was positively correlated with lymph node (LN) metastasis in HNSCC. ENO2 overexpression promoted the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, and this effect was mediated by the epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT) transition.

Further studies revealed that ENO2-mediated HNSCC metastasis was associated with M2 macrophage polarization. ENO2 regulated M2 macrophage polarization through its metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP could increase histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) levels by inhibiting the catalytic activity of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The increased H3K18la enrichment in the promoter region of M2 macrophage-related genes promoted M2 macrophage polarization.

Moreover, PEP-mediated polarized macrophages enhanced the EMT and migration of HNSCC cells. The cytokine TGF-β released by polarized macrophages interacted with its receptor TGFβR1 on tumor cells, promoting EMT and migration, which may lead to tumor metastasis.

Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of ENO2 with POMHEX effectively reversed M2 macrophage polarization and inhibited HNSCC lymphatic metastasis in mouse models. This finding suggests that POMHEX could be a potential therapeutic approach for managing HNSCC metastasis.

This study elucidated the role of ENO2 in modulating macrophage polarization and contributing to HNSCC metastasis. It also revealed the mechanism by which ENO2-derived PEP regulates histone modification and macrophage polarization. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into HNSCC lymphatic metastasis and offer potential therapeutic targets for metastatic HNSCC.

Researchers are zeroing in on the Achilles' heel of pathogens that cause Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. 

The efforts of a research team from Bochum and Würzburg give hope for new treatment approaches for dangerous tropical diseases. The researchers have compiled a high-precision inventory of the membrane proteins of cell organelles of the African sleeping sickness pathogen. "Some of these proteins contain components that are specific to parasites and differ significantly from those of the host cells," explains Professor Ralf Erdmann from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. As a result, they are a good target for potential active substances. The researchers report their findings in the journal Cell Reports from May 27, 2025.

The researchers studied the pathogen that causes the African sleeping sickness Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosomes have unique cell organelles, so-called glycosomes, which are essential for the survival of the parasites. "They are considered a potential Achilles' heel in the development of new drugs," says Ralf Erdmann.

He and his colleagues Dr. Vishal Kalel and Dr. Chetan Krishna from the Faculty of Medicine at Ruhr University Bochum, in collaboration with Hirak Das of the research group led by Professor Bettina Warscheid at the University of Würzburg, have succeeded in compiling a high-precision inventory of the membrane proteins of these glycosomes. In their study, they have identified the protein components of the glycosome membrane in detail for the first time, including numerous previously unknown components, some of which are parasite-specific.

Using state-of-the-art subcellular proteomics, 28 glycosome membrane proteins were identified with a high degree of reliability.

"Using this technique, we also detected proteins that are associated with glycosome biogenesis, interorganelle communication and protein quality control," lists Bettina Warscheid. "A particular highlight has been the discovery of TbPEX15, a membrane anchor for an essential protein import complex - a promising target for the development of new drugs, as it differs significantly from its counterpart in humans."

The findings provide an important basis for the development of new therapies for diseases that affect over 12 million people worldwide, including Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. "In addition, these findings deepen our understanding of parasite biology, open up new avenues for targeted treatment strategies against poorly understood tropical diseases and provide a valuable resource for biomedical research into glycosome biology," concludes Ralf Erdmann.

Despite concerns over air pollution spikes, this decades-long Danish study finds that repeated PM2.5 peaks are not linked to increased cardiovascular risk, highlighting the greater importance of chronic exposure.

In a recent study published in the Journal of Cardiology, researchers examined the relationship between exposure to peak levels of particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs).

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with air pollution being a modifiable risk factor. PM2.5 is particularly harmful as it can enter the bloodstream, aggravate existing cardiovascular conditions, and contribute to stroke and myocardial infarction. Recent data suggest that air pollution is now the second largest mortality risk factor.

Moreover, short-term exposure to excess PM2.5 can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, including hospitalization and death. While previous studies have focused on acute spikes in pollution or chronic accumulated exposure preceding a cardiovascular event, the impact of recurrent high pollution peaks is unclear.

The present study examined the relationship between peak PM2.5 exposures and MACE incidence. The study analyzed 26,723 males aged 65–74 from the Viborg Vascular (VIVA) and Danish Cardiovascular Screening (DANCAVAS) trials. It is important to note that the cohort included only older men from Denmark, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied to other populations such as women, younger individuals, or people living in areas with much higher pollution. The team integrated individual-level data with national registries, which provided information on sociodemographics, diagnosis codes, hospitalizations, and mortality outcomes.

Next, the researchers modeled PM2.5 levels at participants' residential addresses between 1979 and 2019 using the Danish integrated air pollution modeling system. This system estimates air pollution levels by incorporating contributions from street-level pollution, regional background, and local background. The Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model was used to model regional background, and the Urban Background Model was used to model local background.

The Operational Street Pollution Model was used to calculate street-level PM2.5. The modeling system provided hourly concentrations of PM2.5 for 1979–2019, which were aggregated into monthly mean levels. The PM2.5 peak was defined as the monthly average level at a residential address exceeding the long-term monthly mean of the population by over two standard deviations.

Further, road traffic noise was calculated at the most exposed side of the building and averaged across weekends and weekdays. The primary outcome was a composite MACE endpoint, including non-fatal stroke, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization, peripheral revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality. Cox proportional hazards models examined the associations between chronic PM2.5 peak exposures and MACEs.

Models were progressively adjusted to adjust for confounders. One model was adjusted for age and the year of inclusion. Another model was additionally adjusted for smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and family CVD history. The fully adjusted model also included noise exposure and socioeconomic factors (marital status and household wealth index). Because exposure was estimated at each person's residential address, the results may not fully account for time spent away from home, such as at work or while traveling, which could affect individual exposure levels.

In total, 26,723 individuals were enrolled. Baseline characteristics stratified by CVD event occurrence revealed that subjects who had a CVD event were slightly older and had a higher BMI than those who did not. Moreover, this group had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and current smoking, as well as higher exposure to PM2.5 peaks.

The CVD event group also experienced a higher burden of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, with a higher minimum peak magnitude, median number of peaks, and average peak magnitude. The fully adjusted model revealed no significant increase in MACE risk associated with elevated PM2.5 peak exposure. Increments in the number of PM2.5 peaks minimally modified the hazard, implying no increase in risk.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the findings across different periods before an event and different PM2.5 peak definitions. In analyses applying alternative peak thresholds, the hazard ratio was close to unity, supporting no relationship between cardiovascular events and PM2.5 peak exposure. Likewise, evaluating peaks in the one-year and five-year periods before the event produced similar insignificant results. Even when using more sensitive definitions for peaks or focusing on the time windows immediately before a cardiovascular event, the study found no statistically significant associations.

The authors also note that while short-term acute PM2.5 exposure (such as in the hours or days before a cardiovascular event) has previously been linked to increased risk, this study specifically investigated whether repeated monthly PM2.5 peaks over decades contribute to risk. Their results suggest that these long-term peaks do not add to cardiovascular risk once other factors are accounted for.

Participants who experienced MACEs were exposed to higher PM2.5 peaks than those who did not. Nevertheless, elevated long-term exposure to PM2.5 peaks did not significantly increase MACE risk. This points to the possibility that chronic, sustained exposure to PM2.5, rather than occasional peaks, may play a more important role in cardiovascular risk, at least in settings with relatively low overall pollution, such as Denmark. Further studies are required to assess these associations in different populations and higher pollution contexts to fully delineate the cardiovascular impact of air pollution. Expanding research to populations with higher average air pollution and including women and younger people may help clarify whether these findings hold true elsewhere.

Canadian researchers reveal how your view of your partner's looks, and how you think they see you, can make or break relationship satisfaction. Mutual appreciation and reduced body criticism are key.

Study: Satisfaction with partner's appearance, body criticism, and relationship quality in heterosexual couples: A dyadic study. Image Credit: Prostock-studio / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Body Image, researchers in Canada investigated whether satisfaction with a romantic partner's appearance affected the quality of relationships in heterosexual couples. Their findings indicate that couples in which people appreciated their partner's appearance had higher relationship quality, as did those where people felt that their partner appreciated their appearance. However, when people perceived that their partner viewed their appearance critically, their satisfaction in their relationship declined.

Physical appearance and attractiveness play important roles in romantic relationships. Prior research has shown that satisfaction with one's partner's looks, including weight and body shape, positively relates to relationship satisfaction.

Moreover, feeling that one's partner is attracted to them is associated with both partners' satisfaction with the relationship and self-image. These effects appear consistent across genders. Studies suggest that perceiving a partner as attractive may enhance commitment and marital satisfaction, with some findings pointing to stronger effects for men.

In addition to attractiveness, how individuals perceive their partner's satisfaction with their appearance can influence relationship and sexual satisfaction. This perception may be shaped by assumed similarity (e.g., projecting one's satisfaction onto the partner) and actual accuracy in judgment.

Furthermore, body-related comments – particularly criticism – can significantly affect body image and relationship quality. While this has been mostly studied in women, there is growing evidence that men are also negatively affected by partner body criticism.

However, little is known about how such criticism influences one's partner's perception of their satisfaction with their appearance and, in turn, relationship quality. This study seeks to fill these gaps by examining these dynamics in romantic heterosexual couples.

This study examined how factors related to appearance – specifically satisfaction with a partner's appearance, what someone perceives to be their partner's satisfaction with their appearance, and whether someone believes their partner views their appearance critically – are linked to the quality of relationships among heterosexual couples.

167 heterosexual couples in Quebec, Canada, participated in the study. The participants were French-speaking adults who had been in a relationship for at least six months. Each partner completed an online questionnaire independently.

The sample was predominantly White, with an average age of about 44 years and an average relationship length of nearly 11 years. Most couples were married or cohabiting.

Measures included each person's satisfaction levels with their partner's appearance, what they perceived to be their partner's satisfaction levels with their (own) appearance, perceived levels of body criticism, and overall relationship quality, assessed via validated questionnaires. Notably, most of these measures were brief, relying on two-item scales, which the researchers acknowledge as a limitation.

Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling, and both direct and indirect effects were examined using bootstrapped confidence intervals.

The study found moderate similarity between heterosexual romantic partners in how they perceived each other's appearance: partner appearance satisfaction and perceived levels of the partner's satisfaction with their appearance, and a lower similarity in perceived criticism related to one's appearance.

Analysis confirmed that satisfaction with a partner's appearance and perceived partner satisfaction with one's appearance were positively linked to self-reported relationship quality for men and women. Additionally, body criticism was negatively associated with perceived levels of the partner's satisfaction and, indirectly, with relationship quality.

For men, both their own and their partner's contentment with their appearance predicted their belief that their partner was satisfied with them; this perception, in turn, enhanced their relationship quality. The same pattern held for women.

Interestingly, on average, a woman's satisfaction with her partner's appearance also directly improved his satisfaction in the relationship, although the researchers note that this “partner effect” was modest and should be interpreted cautiously until confirmed by further studies.

Supplementary analyses showed these associations remained stable after controlling for age and weight concerns.

Researchers found evidence of two important indirect pathways: one from men's perception of body criticism from their partner to men's relationship quality via men's perceived partner satisfaction with their appearance, and another from men's satisfaction with their partner's appearance to the quality of women's relationships through women's perceived partner satisfaction.

It is important to note that, due to the cross-sectional design of the study, it is not possible to determine causality. The authors suggest that the observed links may be bidirectional; for example, people who feel more satisfied in their relationship may also perceive their partner's appearance more positively.

The study highlighted how satisfaction with one's partner's appearance and the absence of body criticism from their partner play important roles in perceived relationship quality. Assumed similarity (believing a partner feels similarly) and accuracy (correctly perceiving a partner's feelings) both contributed to these dynamics.

The study design using both partners' responses was a key strength, allowing for the exploration of partner effects. However, the study relied on self-reports and very brief measures, and its cross-sectional nature prevents conclusions about causality. The sample was also limited to mostly White heterosexual couples, reducing generalizability.

Future research should use longitudinal designs and include more diverse participants. Findings suggest that promoting open, balanced conversations about appearance could support healthier relationships, as long as appearance is just one of many appreciated partner qualities.

Obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that causes lower oxygen levels during sleep, is linked to degeneration of brain regions associated with memory through damage to the brain's small blood vessels, according to a study published May 7, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study found the brain changes were strongly associated with the severity of drops in oxygen levels during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The study does not prove that sleep apnea causes this degeneration; it only shows an association.

Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when throat muscles relax during sleep, blocking the airway, causing a person to wake up repeatedly to breathe. This disrupted sleep pattern can lower oxygen levels, which in turn can damage small blood vessels in the brain.

REM sleep is the stage when most dreams occur and is associated with numerous critical functions in sleep including memory consolidation and processing of emotional experiences.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that increases with age, and low oxygen levels during sleep can harm the ability of our brain and body to function properly. Our study found that low oxygen levels from obstructive sleep apnea, especially during REM sleep, may be linked to cognitive decline due to damage to the small blood vessels in the brain and the downstream impact of this damage on parts of the brain associated with memory."

Bryce A. Mander, PhD, study author, University of California Irvine

The study included 37 people with an average age of 73 who did not have cognitive impairment. They were not taking sleep medications. Participants had overnight sleep studies. Of the group, 24 people had obstructive sleep apnea.

Researchers measured their oxygen levels throughout the night during all stages of sleep, including REM sleep.

Participants had brain scans to measure brain structure.

Researchers found that lower oxygen levels during REM sleep were associated with higher levels of white matter hyperintensities in the brain. White matter hyperintensities are bright spots that appear on brain scans which are thought to reflect damaged white matter tissue. This damage can be caused by injury to small blood vessels in the brain.

Minimum blood oxygen saturation levels during sleep and the total time spent asleep below a blood oxygen level of 90% predicted the amount of total white matter hyperintensities in the brain. Having a blood oxygen level of 90% or lower is cause for concern.

Researchers also measured the volume of the hippocampus and thickness of the entorhinal cortex, both of which are areas associated with memory. They found having more white matter hyperintensities was linked to decreased volume as well as reduced thickness in these areas.

Participants took a memory test before and after sleep to determine sleep-dependent memory. Researchers found that deficits in sleep-dependent memory were linked to reduced thickness of the entorhinal cortex.

"Taken together, our findings may partially explain how obstructive sleep apnea contributes to cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease through the degeneration of brain regions that support memory consolidation during sleep," said Mander.

A limitation was that study participants were primarily white and Asian people, so results may not be the same for other populations.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Foundation.

A study co-led by Indiana University School of Medicine researchers presents a potential new strategy to prevent or slow the progression of Type 1 diabetes by targeting an inflammation-related protein known to drive the disease. The findings, recently published in eBioMedicine, may help inform clinical trials of a drug that is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for psoriasis as a treatment for Type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The loss of these cells leads to high blood sugar levels and requires ongoing insulin therapy and careful monitoring to avoid severe health complications.

In laboratory studies using human cells and mouse models, the researchers found that applying a molecular method to block inflammation signaling through the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) protein reduced harmful inflammation in the pancreas. This strategy not only protected the beta cells in the pancreas but also reduced the immune system's attack on those cells. A medication that inhibits TYK2 is already approved for the treatment of psoriasis, an autoimmune condition that causes skin inflammation.

Our study showed that targeting TYK2 could be a powerful way to protect insulin-producing beta cells while calming inflammation in the immune system at the same time. This finding is exciting because there is already a drug on the market that does this for psoriasis, which could help us move more quickly toward testing it for Type 1 diabetes."

Carmella Evans-Molina, MD, PhD, co-author of the study and director of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center and the Eli Lilly and Company Professor of Pediatric Diabetes at the IU School of Medicine

Past genetic studies have already shown that people with naturally lower TYK2 activity are less likely to develop Type 1 diabetes, further supporting the group's approach for future treatments using this TYK2 inhibitor approach.

"Our preclinical models suggest that the treatment might work in people as well," said Farooq Syed, PhD, lead author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Diabetes-Immunology at the Arthur-Riggs Diabetes and Metabolic Research Institute of the City of Hope. "The next step is to initiate translational studies to evaluate the impact of TYK2 inhibition alone or in combination with other already approved drugs in individuals at-risk or with recent onset Type 1 diabetes."

Syed conducted the research while working in the Evans-Molina lab at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases and the Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research at the IU School of Medicine. The Evans-Molina lab partnered on this study with Decio Eizirik, MD, PhD, a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles Center for Diabetes Research and other international collaborators. The research team hopes their findings will support future clinical trials to safely assess the efficacy of a new drug or drug combination in humans.

Learning about one's risk for Alzheimer's disease may not lead to emotional distress, but motivation to maintain healthy lifestyle changes tends to fade over time, even in people at high risk, according to a study involving a Rutgers Health researcher.

The study, published in Alzheimer's & Dementia, was written by Sapir Golan Shekhtman, a doctoral degree student at the Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, and led by Orit Lesman-Segev, a neuroradiologist at the Department of Diagnostic Imaging and researcher at the Joseph Sagol Neuroscience Center, Sheba Medical Center in Israel, and co-authored by Michal Schnaider Beeri, director of the Herbert and Jacqueline Krieger Klein Alzheimer's Research Center at the Rutgers Brain Health Institute.

A protein called amyloid beta in the brain is one of the core pathologies in Alzheimer's disease. The buildup of amyloid plaques can be detected decades before symptoms appear. These plaques can be visualized and quantified by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

The researchers wanted to understand how people react emotionally to learning whether they have risk for cognitive decline. 

The study followed 199 healthy adults who underwent amyloid PET scans to check their amyloid beta status. Before the scan, participants completed surveys measuring anxiety, depression, memory concerns and motivation for lifestyle adjustments. They conducted the same surveys six months after learning their results.

Results from the study show that participants who don't have amyloid buildup experienced significant emotional improvements: They reported much lower levels of depression, anxiety and memory complaints.

However, their motivation to maintain lifestyle improvements also declined.

Conversely, participants with amyloid presence didn't show increased depression or memory complaints but did experience a decrease in anxiety and motivation for lifestyle adjustments.

The findings suggest that disclosing amyloid presence does not negatively affect participants, and simply knowing the results seems to decrease negative feelings overall."

Michal Schnaider Beeri, Director, Herbert and Jacqueline Krieger Klein Alzheimer's Research Center at the Rutgers Brain Health Institute

This study provides new insight into how individuals emotionally respond to learning their amyloid status, an underexplored topic, the researchers said. It also involves disclosing amyloid status to cognitively healthy individuals, a practice that wasn't common in previous studies. The researchers added the study emphasizes individual differences in responses to disclosure, promoting a more personalized disclosure process.

"The results highlight how easily people lose motivation to make lifestyle changes aimed at maintaining cognitive health," said Shekhtman. "Strategies to sustain these healthy behaviors are crucial."

"These findings hold even greater significance in an era moving toward preventive Alzheimer's Disease therapies," said Lesman-Segev. "When such treatments become available, cognitively normal individuals will likely undergo screening with Alzheimer's biomarkers to qualify for targeted therapies. Therefore, it is essential to better understand the response to disclosure and optimize the disclosure process."

Because life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome has increased dramatically, investigators assessed the risk of age-related cardiovascular diseases in this population. As reported in the Journal of Internal Medicine, the researchers found increased risks of various cardiovascular diseases compared with the general population. 

In the study, 5,155 individuals with Down syndrome born in Sweden in 1946–2000 were compared with other Swedish individuals matched by sex, birthyear, and county of birth. 

Down syndrome was associated with 4.41-times higher risk of ischemic stroke and a 5.14-times higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke. (Ischemic strokes occur due to blocked blood flow to the brain, whereas hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding in or around the brain.) The overall risk of heart attack was similar in people with Down syndrome and other individuals but was increased in young people with Down syndrome. 

Our results show that individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk of some age-related cardiovascular outcomes, and indicate, in line with results from previous studies, that their cardiovascular risk factor profile differs from the general population. This could have future implications for the surveillance and treatment of individuals with Downs syndrome."

A new study reveals that certain caffeine metabolites in urine are linked to diabetic retinopathy risk in men, offering a promising path toward noninvasive biomarkers for early screening and disease prevention.

In a recent study in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers investigated the associations between urinary caffeine, its metabolites, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) risk in United States participants. The cross-sectional study comprised 514 NHANES (2009–2014) volunteers. High-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) assays revealed that excessive urinary levels of 1-MU, 1,7-DMU, 1,3,7-TMU, caffeine, and AAMU may indicate increased DR risk in US males. Future prospective studies are needed to validate these findings, but they may represent a crucial step in understanding diabetic indicators.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular diabetes complication that is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in adults over 50. The condition affected an estimated 103 million adults worldwide in 2020, and the number is expected to increase to approximately 160 million by 2045.

While modern anti-DR interventions (intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation) have proven effective, they are invasive and costly, underscoring the need for improved screening and detection methods to reduce disease incidence.

Caffeine, a secondary plant metabolite found in coffee, tea, and soft drinks, is the most widely consumed active pharmacologic substance globally. Research suggests caffeine intake may help mitigate cardiovascular and diabetes risks, but findings are conflicting. Understanding associations between caffeine, its metabolites, and DR may support future screening strategies.

This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), focusing on participants who had complete sociodemographic, medical, and urine sample data. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), urine creatinine, smoking status, alcohol use, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and total energy intake.

Clinical diabetes was defined by serum fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-hour post-OGTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, or self-reported insulin/diabetes medication use or diagnosis. DR was also self-reported following medical consultation. Urine samples were analyzed using HPLC–ESI–MS/MS for caffeine and 14 metabolites (15 total substances).

Baseline characteristics were compared using Rao-Scott Pearson χ² tests and t-tests. Spearman correlation assessed metabolite relationships. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) for DR associations.

Of 50,974 NHANES participants, 514 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 16.9% had DR. DR patients had higher HbA1c and longer diabetes duration. Caffeine intake showed moderate correlations with nine caffeine metabolites.

After adjusting for covariates, ln-transformed 1-MU and AAMU levels were associated with increased DR risk. In median split analysis, 1,7-DMU, caffeine, and AAMU also showed increased DR associations, particularly in males. Findings were more consistent and significant for men than for women.

Researchers noted that metabolite intercorrelation may confound these findings. For instance, 1,3,7-TMU's association may be driven by its strong correlations with 1-MU and caffeine.

As a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported data, the findings indicate correlation, not causation. Additionally, the high exclusion rate may limit generalizability to the broader diabetic population. Nonetheless, caffeine metabolites may serve as useful biomarkers in DR risk screening.

This study highlights caffeine metabolites as potential indicators of DR risk, especially in US males. While prospective studies are needed to confirm these results, urine-based metabolite analysis may aid early DR detection and preventive care strategies.

Dried Gapal, a staple in Burkina Faso, packs energy and essential minerals, but new research shows its phytic acid levels could be holding back key nutrients like zinc.

Study: Nutritional composition of dried Gapal, a highly nutritious food based on fermented cereal and milk. Image Credit: Vineke 

Researchers at the Research Institute for Applied and Technological Sciences, Burkina Faso, recently analyzed the nutritional composition of dried Gapal, a fermented milk-cereal mixture widely consumed in Burkina Faso. The findings are published in the journal Discover Food.

Gapal is a traditional food among the Fulani people in Burkina Faso. It is a mixture of fermented milk and cereals, and is available in dried or yogurt-like form. Millet paste and milk are primarily used for the production of Gapal, with the addition of baobab pulp, spices, and sugar.

Pearl millet, commonly used for Gapal production, contains high amounts of minerals, including calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, and potassium. The lactic acid bacteria-based fermentation process enriches gapal nutritionally and improves its flavor, texture, digestibility, and shelf life.

However, some millet components, such as phytates, can reduce the bioavailability of micronutrients by reducing their biodegradability. Food processing methods, including germination, fermentation, and hulling, can remove these components.

Lactic acid bacteria-based fermentation is a highly effective method for degrading phytic acid. During the combined fermentation of milk and millet dough, lactose is converted into lactic acid, which produces volatile molecules, which in turn increase the taste and nutritional value of Gapal.

Despite its high nutritional quality and increasing usage in major cities in Burkina Faso, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the proximate composition and nutritional properties of this indigenous food.

For the first time, researchers at the Research Institute for Applied and Technological Sciences comprehensively analyzed the nutritional composition of Gapal to develop a database for future research.

They purchased Gapal samples from five major cities in Burkina Faso. They assessed the protein, lipid, carbohydrate, free amino acid, mineral, and phytic acid content of these samples using standard methods.

The researchers found considerable variations in nutritional composition between Gapal samples collected from five major cities. There was notable variability in nutrient content not only between cities but also among different producers within the same city, reflecting the lack of process standardization.

The analysis revealed that Gapal contains 0.76 to 5.5% of lipids, 5.4 to 9.6% of protein, 84 to 92% of carbohydrates, and 1.1 to 2.1% of ash. Among minerals, the samples contained potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, and manganese. The exact measured average values were: potassium (214.18 mg/100 g), calcium (66.74 mg/100 g), magnesium (34.04 mg/100 g), zinc (0.80 mg/100 g), iron (8.14 mg/100 g), copper (0.44 mg/100 g), and manganese (0.85 mg/100 g). These levels varied considerably across the different samples.

Only proline and lysine were consistently detected in all Gapal samples; other free amino acids, including some essential amino acids, were found sporadically and at low levels. However, dried Gapal exhibited a notable amount of phytic acid (365.92 milligrams per 100 grams of dried Gapal).

The tested samples exhibited significant variations in moisture content, pH, and acidity. The moisture content of these samples was higher than that reported for other Gapal-like food products, such as kishk and tarhana, which might impact their storage.

The study also determined the molar ratios of phytate to key minerals, such as zinc, iron, and calcium, in order to estimate bioavailability. The phytate: zinc (Phy :Zn) molar ratio in dried Gapal samples often exceeded 15, a threshold above which zinc bioavailability is considered significantly reduced by the World Health Organization. In contrast, the phytate: iron and phytate: calcium ratios were lower, suggesting that iron and calcium in dried Gapal might be more bioavailable than zinc.

The study provides a comprehensive overview of the nutritional composition of the traditional African food Gapal.

According to the study findings, Gapal contains high levels of carbohydrates, which can be attributed to its millet content. The pH and acidity of dried Gapal are similar to those of similar food products such as kishk and tarhana, although Gapal has a slightly lower lactic acid content, which may be due to differences in fermentation and drying time.

The production process of kishk and tarhana includes 5-day fermentation, followed by 3-day drying. In contrast, Gapal production consists of a combined drying and fermentation process lasting 3 to 5 days. A slightly lower lactic acid content observed in dried Gapal might also be attributed to its shorter fermentation and drying duration and the smaller quantity of milk added during production.

Dried Gapal has been detected to have a lower protein and lipid level compared to similar millet-based foods. Proteins in Gapal come from both milk and millet, and the observed reduction in protein content might be due to production-related loss, which can be improved by increasing the fermentation process.

Lipids in dried Gapal mainly come from milk, which is used as fresh milk, fermented milk, or yoghurt during production. Yogurt is obtained from reconstituted milk powder, which is often defatted or fattened with vegetable fats. This variation in the fat content of milk or yogurt, depending on the product, might be responsible for the lower lipid content in Gapal.

Only proline and lysine, free amino acids, have been detected in all Gapal samples; other essential amino acids such as valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine were detected only sporadically and at low levels.

A low milk content in dried Gapal (approximately 20%) might limit the availability of free amino acids. However, as researchers mentioned, the digestion of Gapal could facilitate the release of other, more abundant amino acids.

High levels of vital minerals have been detected in tested samples. However, the bioavailability of these minerals could be compromised by the high phytic acid content of dried Gapal. Millet is the primary source of phytic acid in Gapal, and existing evidence indicates that the phytic acid content of millet can be reduced through hulling (a process of removing the outer husk of millet) and fermentation processes.

The study highlights that, despite the interesting mineral content of dried Gapal, the presence of phytates, particularly in relation to zinc, may limit the actual nutritional benefit for consumers, unless further processing improvements are made.

The authors also note several limitations of their study. They were not able to determine the vitamin content or the total amino acid content of Gapal. Additionally, the study was limited in its geographic scope and sample size, suggesting that further research should include more towns and a greater number of samples. The authors recommend that future studies focus on standardizing manufacturing processes and assessing the sensory and sanitary qualities of Gapal for a more complete nutritional evaluation.

Overall, the study provides valuable information for enhancing the Burkina Faso food composition database.

U.S. Women's National Team star Kristie Mewis and Australian international Sam Kerr have announced the birth of their first child, who has been given a unique first name.

Mewis, who is currently on the books at Women's Super League side West Ham United, revealed the exciting news in a joint Instagram post on Thursday. “Our little man is here, Jagger Mewis-Kerr,” they wrote.

Naturally, the news was met with an overwhelming array of emotional responses from familiar faces from across the soccer landscape, including Mewis' sister and former USWNT star and current co-host of The Women's Game podcast, Sam. “Love u guys,” the 83-time international and FIFA Women's World Cup winner commented.

“Jagger Mewis-Kerr, welcome to the world. You are so loved already (especially by Aunty @sammymewy). Congrats, moms, Kristie & Sam K,” The Women's Game shared.

Elsewhere, USWNT legend Kelley O'Hara replied, “The cutest!!” while current international Casey Krueger wrote, “Congrats you guys!!”

Mallory Swanson, another current USWNT star who also recently announced that she and her husband, MLB star Dansby, are expecting, commented, “So happy for yall!”

Meanwhile, West Ham also congratulated the new parents, responding, “Congratulations, Kristie & Sam,” as Kerr's side, Chelsea, added, “Congratulations, Sam and Kristie! Adorable.”

Having been together since 2021, Mewis and Kerr got engaged in September 2023, with Kerr giving fans a glimpse into Mewis' proposal in an adorable Instagram post. Just three months later, Mewis made the move from NWSL side Gotham FC to London, where she joined Kerr, who had signed for Chelsea after leaving the Chicago Red Stars in 2020.

So far, injuries have derailed Mewis' time with West Ham, having been limited to just four appearances prior to announcing her pregnancy. As for Kerr, she too has struggled with her health of late, having missed the last 15 months for the Blues with a ruptured ACL.

Now, with the WSL season almost at an end and with Chelsea having secured their sixth consecutive title, Kerr looks to be nearing a return to action. Head coach Sonia Bompastor said in April that the Australian was “a few weeks away” from hitting the pitch, per Optus Sport. Whether or not this means the 31-year-old could make her 129th appearance for the Matildas in their upcoming friendlies against Argentina on May 30 and June 2 remains to be seen.

As for Mewis, once she is ready to return, her progress will likely be watched closely by USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, who is in the process of expanding her roster ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup. The 34-year-old, who has made 53 international appearances, scoring seven goals and winning a CONCACAF Women's Championship along the way, last played for the USWNT back in 2023.

Under the Trump administration, the US is set to be one of three host countries for the 2026 FIFA World Cup global event.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature over 100 matchups across five weeks and is estimated to bring in $17.2 billion in GDP to the US and an estimated 6.5 million attendees.

Well, in a now-viral clip from the 2026 World Cup Planning Task Force Conference held at the White House, Vice President JD Vance made a deportation "joke" about visitors who attend the 2026 World Cup, and it's not going over well.

Here's the full clip:

C-SPAN / Twitter: @factpostnews

During his remarks, Vance said, "Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we'll have visitors, probably from close to a hundred countries."

"We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game."

"But, uh, when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem," Vance said, looking off camera seemingly toward Secretary Noem and laughing.

For reference, Kristi Noem is the Secretary of Homeland Security.

People are seemingly taking Vance's "joke" seriously and are warning those who plan to attend the 2026 World Cup. "They aren't kidding. This is a threat. Do not come to the World Cup. Especially if you're a brown or black US citizen," one person wrote.

"That's one way to potentially fuck up a high revenue earning GLOBAL event," this person said.

"JD Vance is so far from funny even Trump is sitting there with a look on his face like, 'dude shut the fuck up.'"

"It's genuinely insane that we're hosting several World Cup games and the Olympics under these conditions," another person said, seemingly referencing the recent deportation policies of the Trump administration.

This partnership will be activated through Diageo spirits brands Don Julio, Buchanan's, Johnnie Walker, and Smirnoff.

Global alcoholic beverage conglomerate Diageo has become the latest high-profile sponsor of the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, partnering with the showpiece event in North, Central, and South America.

This partnership will be activated through Diageo spirits brands Don Julio, Buchanan's, Johnnie Walker, and Smirnoff, each of which will gain sponsorship inventory around the tournament, including in-person fan engagement events across each of the competition's 16 host cities.

Such activations will take the form of both in-person events, but also co-branded advertising and retail campaigns across the Americas.

As many as 15 teams from across the Americas can qualify for this expanded tournament, a prospect which could allow Diageo to maximize the value of its sponsorship, with the three host nations of USA, Mexico, and Canada having already confirmed their berths, as have reigning World Cup champions Argentina.

Speaking on the partnership Diageo chief marketing officer Cristina Diezhandino pointed to the fact that the 2026 World Cup will be the largest in FIFA history, with 48 teams competing, up from the 32 in 2022.

Diageo is currently a supporter of soccer in the US in particular, with its Aviation American Gin, Captain Morgans, Guinness, and Casamigos brands all boasting sponsorships with current Major League Soccer and National Women's Soccer League sides.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

Although FIFA already has an alcohol sponsor in the beer category, namely AB Inbev's Budweiser brand, the AB Inbev conglomerate's lack of exposure in the spirits market means the Diageo partnership does not contravene any existing exclusivity agreements.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to be an important one for both AB Inbev and Diageo, after the 2022 World Cup took place in Qatar, a dry country where alcohol is banned, this marks the tournament's return to a major alcohol market.

In the Business of the FIFA World Cup 2022 report, GlobalData Sport analysts commented at the time: “For many fans around the world, watching soccer is an activity which goes together with alcoholic consumption, something which could be described as a tradition.

“From a sponsorship perspective, [the alcohol ban in Qatar] hit the marketing plans of tournament sponsor Budweiser the hardest, with it holding exclusive pouring rights of beer at the tournament, as it looks to respect the rules of Qatar whilst also ensuring a good return on investment from its sponsorship fees. The brand will be pushing its Budweiser Zero non-alcoholic product heavily during the FIFA World Cup as it still looks to target international fans in Qatar.”

With this dilemma not in place for the upcoming 2026 edition, it is likely that both brands, especially Budweiser, will seek to make up for lost time.

Dani Carvajal suffered a serious ACL injury in October last year dealing a major blow to Real Madrid in the first half of the season.

One of the most important players in the team, both in terms of what he offers on the pitch and in the dressing room, the Spaniard's absence has been felt dearly by Los Blancos in recent months, especially in the big games against the likes of Barcelona and Arsenal.

Carvajal, though, has been working very hard on his recovery and has recently resumed working on the pitch with the ball, thus entering the final phase of his rehabilitation.

Now, AS reports that Real Madrid are astonished by Carvajal's progress in recovering from the devastating knee injury he suffered last year.

In fact, what once seemed like a distant hope is now edging closer to reality: he is on track to be available for the Club World Cup. While he is not expected to feature as a starter in the competition, his presence in the squad is becoming increasingly likely.

Though club staff at Valdebebas remain cautious, there is a sense of quiet optimism. “Dani is a beast, he always has been,” they say.

While no one is making guarantees, the defender is remarkably close to a return. He is expected to complete his comeback within the minimum recovery window – eight months and a few days – after originally being given a timeline of eight to ten months.

Carvajal has been targeting the Club World Cup since December, calling it his “American Dream.”

Post surgery, he began his recovery with crutches, the Real Madrid second captain has since been a regular presence in the dressing room as a leader, even while sidelined.

His progress accelerated notably in April. From gym work, he moved to light jogging and then more intense sessions on the pitch. Now, he is back working with the ball and occasionally joins his teammates in light drills.

Real Madrid staff confirm that Carvajal is sprinting, jumping, and performing explosive exercises with normality. The next and final stage is full training integration and contact drills which could come later this month, allowing him to return in time for the Club World Cup.

Carvajal is not expected to start or play every match, but the objective is to have him available to contribute.

For now, Lucas Vazquez or Trent Alexander-Arnold are seen as the starting options at right-back for the tournament.

Vazquez has been guaranteed a short-term extension of two weeks to ensure he can participate in the entire tournament, while talks are underway with Liverpool to secure Alexander-Arnold's early release.

Mallory Swanson and Chicago Cubs star Dansby Swanson tied the knot in 2022 

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Mallory Swanson, a forward on the United States women's national soccer team (USWNT), and her baseball star husband, Dansby Swanson, are going to be parents. 

The couple shared a joint post on Instagram on Wednesday to announce that they're expecting their first child. In the pictures, Dansby and Mallory wore matching white outfits as they stood next to a series of floral bouquets. 

One picture showed Mallory, 27, holding the baby's sonogram, while a third picture featured the Chicago Cubs shortstop with the special image in hand. 

“Our greatest blessing,” Mallory wrote in the caption, alongside a white heart emoji.

In the comments, Dansby added: “I love you,” alongside a red heart emoji. 

Fans went to the comments to celebrate the big news, with USWNT's Instagram writing: “Congratulations!!”

“Sooo amazing. Congratulations to you both,” another fan wrote, while Chicago Cubs star Jameson Taillon added: “Congrats guys!!! Can't wait to meet my new best friend!”

Dansby and Mallor first met in 2017, before making their relationship Instagram official in December 2018. They announced their engagement in December 2021 and got married a year later.

Last year, Mallory, who debuted for the USWNT team in 2016, had an amazing season. In August, she won the gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics and scored the game-winning goal in her team's match against Brazil. 

Her husband later celebrated her big win on Instagram, sharing a picture of Mallory celebrating her win on the field.

“You are such an inspiration to so many, but more to me than anyone can ever fathom,” he wrote in the caption of his post, shared in August. “You are truly a gift from above, and you shine with that every day. I'm speechless. And now you're a gold medal, Olympic champion, and 100 caps in the same day. And that can never be taken from you. I love you forever.”

However, she hasn't played for the USWNT since winning the gold last summer. She also hasn't played for her club team in the National Women's Soccer League this season.

The Stars released a statement on January 27 that she wouldn't be participating in training camp for “personal reasons.” In that same statement, Swanson thanked the club and its fans “for their understanding during this time.”

Dansby joined the Cubs in 2023. He previously played for the Atlanta Braves from 2016 to 2022. 

In this season so far, Dansby has hit seven home runs and 20 RBI (runs batted in), with his team winning 22 games. In the National League Central, one of MLB's six major divisions, the Chicago Cubs are in first place.

One of the most desired signings by Real Madrid this season is Trent Alexander-Arnold. The current "66" of Liverpool announced at the beginning of the week that he would leave as a free agent at the end of the current soccer season, perhaps accelerating his arrival to the first team. Not in vain do the Madrid bosses wish to make him available to the next coach as soon as possible.

The progress of those negotiations with Liverpool and with the player would have yielded a positive verdict according to the information published by the newspaper As. This sports outlet indicates that Trent Alexander-Arnold would have agreed to be registered on Real Madrid's list for the Club World Cup. With that agreement advanced, the signing of the English right-back could become a reality between June 1 and 10.

That time frame is the window that FIFA has set for the teams participating in the Club World Cup to strengthen their squads with the first signings of the summer market. Trent Alexander-Arnold would be the first choice for Real Madrid, which still has other additions pending, especially if it wishes to rebuild its weakened defensive line for the tournament held in the United States.

This way, the arrival of Trent Alexander-Arnold for the Club World Cup play-offs is avoided. In case the footballer and Real Madrid had not reached that agreement, his arrival as a free agent would not have allowed him to play the entire competition. That undesired future by the Madrid executives is getting closer to disappearing.

According to the newspaper Asit would only be necessary for Real Madrid and Liverpool to agree to define the details of the transfer. The club has waited for the signing with the freedom letter of the current "66" of the English team, but the presence of the Club World Cup has caused some 'urgency' to sign him. From the noble area of Anfield Road, they have established three basic conditions to definitively seal that agreement.

First, Real Madrid would have to pay a symbolic transfer to let Trent Alexander-Arnold go... considering that he would join the team before June 30, 2025, the date on which his contract with the Merseyside squad ends. At the same time, Liverpool's executives demand that their current player forgo the month's salary he has not yet received.

Liverpool would give the green light to the operation only if Alexander-Arnold detaches from the fees corresponding to the month of June. Additionally, the club would have to cover those emoluments to obtain the go-ahead from England: the total cost of the operation would be estimated at about 2.2 million euros. With those three conditions already known by the club's sports management, Alexander-Arnold would be a Real Madrid player before the Club World Cup and would confirm the agreement mentioned by the newspaper As.

Meanwhile, the final verdict of the 'Arnold case' is awaited, Real Madrid remains one of the favorite targets of the summer 2025 transfer market rumors. It is not surprising, given the deep reflection that the first team is experiencing since its double defeat against Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals.

Tottenham head into the Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt looking to salvage something from a miserable campaign. 

The North London side could book their place in next month's final if they finish off the job in Norway, having won the first leg 3-1 last week. It would be a rare highlight in a season that sees Spurs languishing in 16th place in the Premier League, where fans have seen their side lose 19 games this year. 


Their form has put huge pressure on Ange Postecoglou, and speaking exclusively to DAZN News, thanks to yaysweepstakes.com, Chris Waddle thinks even if his old club do lift the Europa League, it's time for the Australian to go. 

"Personally, I think they'll get rid. I think they'll look for someone else. But let's get something right here. I'm not blaming Ange for everything," the Spurs legend said. 

"Look at the managers Tottenham Hotspur have had. Now, Jose Mourinho, serial title, serial medal winner. Antonio Conte, top of the Italian league. Nuno Espirito Sanato might get Nottingham Forest in the Champions League. How can it be that these managers are not good enough yet? They go to other clubs and they succeed.

"Spurs need to look at how they run themselves, and how they operate in the market. In my eyes, that is the problem. Tottenham have always been a massive football club. Great supporters. It's a great club. It really is." 
 

"The only way to judge the managers properly is if they start buying like Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, buying established players, players who are ready, and keeping their stars.

"There's got to be a reason why these managers, whoever goes into Tottenham Hotspur, do not succeed. And it can't be tactics all the time. It's got to be that your team's not good enough.

"Get somebody who's 27, 28, 29, who's at the top of his game, he's matured, he knows the game.

"I can't just blame Ange. I'm not happy with his tactics because he never has a plan B. I've got to criticise that. But overall, I would not just blame Ange. I would blame the format of what the club is, and what they're trying to achieve and how they work."

StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez talks to Fox News Digital about an anti-Israel campaign taking place in lead up to FIFA World Cup.

Stop Antisemitism founder Liora Rez called on FIFA and the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force to put a stop to the "Show Israel the Red Card" campaign ahead of the global soccer tournament.

The campaign began in February at a UEFA Champions League match in Scotland. Celtic FC fans unfurled a banner that called on FIFA and UEFA, the confederation that Israel is a part of, to punish the country's national team over its response in Gaza to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks. There was no penalty against Celtic FC or its fans for the banner.

Since then, CBC reported that the campaign has spread across other European countries, including Italy, Spain and Belgium, along with Brazil, Chile, Malaysia and Tunisia.

Rez said FIFA has done nothing to combat the issue.

"We've seen absolutely nothing, which is so alarming," she told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. "We've seen the head of FIFA say and do, again, absolutely nothing. We've seen none of the fans be penalized or removed from the games holding up these signs. So again, we want the task force that President Trump set up to step in ahead of time and be proactive and say, no, this isn't welcome in the United States. This isn't gonna fly here."

Rez added that FIFA President Gianni Infantino should take a "strong stand" against the campaign.

"I think it has to be eradicated immediately," she said. "Gianni Infantino needs to take a strong stand and say, ‘Bigotry and bias against the world's only Jewish country is not welcome in any type of organization I'm heading.' He has yet to do that. 

"And because he hasn't, we're calling on President Trump's task force to step in and demand that this kind of, again, bias and isolation and vilification of Israel is just not welcome in the United States. Americans aren't going to stand for it."

Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA and UEFA for comment.

President Donald Trump tapped Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as the executive director of the task force.

In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the task force for the soccer tournament, which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Trump will serve as the chair of the task force, while Vice President JD Vance will serve as the vice chair. As the executive director, Giuliani will be tasked with managing and overseeing daily operations. 

Trump also announced Tuesday that Carlos Cordeiro, a FIFA senior advisor, will serve as a senior advisor on the task force. 

The task force was created to lead federal efforts in support of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

A White House official told Fox News Digital on Thursday that task force does not support any kind of proposal to exclude Israel from the World Cup.

"We hope that Andrew Giuliani, as head of this task force, really steps in and works with Gianni Infantino to say, ‘This rhetoric is not welcome here, you need to make a statement. And we're not going to be welcoming antisemites, anti-Westerners, anti-American, pro-terror individuals, whether they're fans or players, into this country,'" Rez said.

The central defender dilemma has become a much more serious situation than it seems. The white team has suffered a significant shortage of personnel in the defensive line that has forced Carlo Ancelotti to improvise during certain parts of the season. From the Valdebebas offices, they understand that it is necessary to put an end to this situation and they have decided to immediately bring in a defender.

All doubts seem to have been left behind recorded during the weeks leading up to a decision that Real Madrid has made that changes everything. Because the merengue bosses had certain reservations about signing one of the 'favorite' candidates, hesitation that would have ended according to the information published by Cadena SER.

This Spanish radio station points out that Real Madrid has intensified its approaches for Dean Huijsen to the point of wanting his signing immediately. The new target of the white club, in addition to signing Trent Alexander-Arnold, is to bring the '2' from AFC Bournemouth to Santiago Bernabéu locker room as soon as possible.

The white sports management would be working from now on and tirelessly to reach an agreement with the cherry bosses, given that the club is eager to complete the operation. Because Cadena SER warns that the white club wants to have Dean Huijsen for the renewed Club World Cup that starts in mid-June next month.

That means that it has just under a month to reach an agreement with AFC Bournemouth. The only possibility that the merengue team has to bring in Dean Huijsen in time is in the transfer window between June 1 and 10, 2025. Those dates chosen by FIFA, prior to the Club World Cup, will allow the participating teams to strengthen themselves for the competition held in the United States.

Real Madrid takes a step forward to solve the central defender dilemma for the next season with this statement of intent. After some doubts about the timing and the footballer chosen to solve this debate, Real Madrid provides all the solutions... although it will not be an incorporation as easy as it seems, now that the white club is determined to add the Spanish central defender to its squad.

The 60 million euro release clause demanded from the noble area of the Vitality Stadium remains the major obstacle to overcome to complete this transfer immediately. The executives led by Florentino Pérez, however, consider it a price to paytoo high for a player of Dean Huijsen's current profile... and they would be looking for possible methods to lower those financial demands.

For now, they haven't found them, but from the Valdebebas offices, they have already marked Dean Huijsen as one of their priorities for the Club World Cup. This categorization is important and reveals the effective need to add personnel to the battered Madrid defensive line.

US Vice President JD Vance has become the target of backlash for suggesting – albeit jokingly – that tourists who come to the United States for the FIFA World Cup will be deported if they overstay their visas. According to CNBC, Vance's offensive remarks were made during a World Cup task force meeting, which was also attended by US President Donald Trump.

The United States is co-hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will take place next year in the US, Canada and Mexico. The quadrennial soccer tournament is a big tourist draw - in 2022, for example, more than 1 million people travelled to Qatar to watch the matches.

United States authorities say that while they are gearing up to welcome tourists to the country, they want to ensure nobody overstays their welcome. It was during a World Cup task force meeting that JD Vance joked about deporting tourists and subsequently faced massive backlash.

“We'll have visitors from close to 100 countries. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,” Vance said. “But when the time is up, they'll have to go home, otherwise they'll have to talk to [Homeland Security] Secretary Noem.”

 

Veep under fireFootage of his comments has gone viral with more than 6.4 million views in less than a day. Given that one of the purposes of the FIFA World Cup is to drive tourism to the host countries, many people mocked the US Vice President for fear-mongering and hurting the very economic interests the tournament is supposed to promote. “He turned a World Cup welcome into a fear-mongering deportation line. Zero applause. Zero charisma. Zero clue,” wrote one X user. “What a disgrace. Vance's joke landed like a deflated soccer ball. Nothing says ‘welcome' like a deportation threat at a World Cup presser,” X user Carolyn Barber opined. Many social media users said that given the current climate of fear in the US, and JD Vance's remarks, tourists would be wary of travelling to the country. “Why would anyone risk coming? We have a President that denies people due process, that our constitution stipulates everyone on our soil has,” an X user wrote.

The former world No. 1 opened up about a harrowing paparazzi run-in at home.ByDavid KanePublished May 08, 2025 copy_link

Published May 08, 2025

ROME, Italy—Iga Swiatek earned a warm reception from fans at the Foro Italico on Thursday but the former world No. 1 admitted it's a challenge balancing her public and personal lives at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.The No. 2 seed was fresh from an emphatic opening round win over Elisabetta Cocciaretto when she was asked about her go-to spots in the city, leading to a deeper discussion about paparazzi and personal space:Q. What places do you like visit in Rome?IGA SWIATEK: I have my restaurants, you know? But I'm not going to tell you the list. There are many Polish people in Rome, so I assume if I give you the list, they're going to come to these places, and I want some peace.I appreciate doing photos on site, but sometimes in the city, I'd rather just have a chill time.

Swiatek is looking to reach her first final of the season at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, a tournament she's already won three times.

Q. When you're actually in Poland, what's it like actually trying to keep that peace and what's the extent of your privacy when you're a public person?IGA SWIATEK: In Poland, it's not possible anymore, so I can't really say how to do that because it's just not possible. I'm spending more time in my apartment or at my friends' apartments. I'm not really going out a lot because I know I'll be watched.Q. What's it like when people photograph you?IGA SWIATEK: I can accept it when it's at work and I'm going to a practice and everything, but for example, when it's close to my home and I'm having just to walk with a friend or with a family member, I'd rather them not do that because that's my time off. I had an incident actually after Miami when I was home and paparazzi followed me almost to my apartment. I stopped them and said, “Ok, tomorrow I'm going to practice. You can take photos of me when I go there, but this is off-limits.” They kind of understand sometimes. I understand what their job is about and we can have a nice even collaboration if they want to be supportive and they understand.

Swiatek is coming off an emotionally trying week at the Mutua Madrid Open, where she suffered a shocking 6-1, 6-1 defeat to rival Coco Gauff and later revealed she was grieving the loss of her grandfather.Back in Rome in her last tournament before Roland Garros, the former world No. 1 hopes a strong week will help her regain rhythm after a (relatively) underwhelming 2025 season. Her next match comes against No. 29 seed Danielle Collins this weekend.

Former Grand Slam champions Caroline Wozniacki and Emma Raducanu are on the entry list for Wimbledon qualifying, which begins on June 24 at the Community Sport Centre, Roehampton.

Other notable names in the initial entry list include Olga Danilovic, fresh off a run to the Roland Garros fourth round, Zarina Diyas, who reached the Wimbledon last 16 in 2014 and 2015, and former Roland Garros semifinalist Tamara Zidansek. Meanwhile, 2022 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Amanda Anisimova has not made the cut directly but is the sixth alternate.

The Wimbledon qualifying entry list is based on the rankings as of June 3, 2024. The highest-ranked player entered is World No.87 Kamilla Rakhimova, and the last direct acceptance is World No.224 Tena Lukas. Wozniacki, the 2018 Australian Open champion, is currently ranked No.117, while 2021 US Open champion Raducanu is at No.205.

Three players have used special rankings (for players returning from long-term injury or maternity leave) to enter Wimbledon qualifying. Mirjam Bjorklund (No.145), Diyas (No.157) and Oksana Selekhmeteva (No.190). Former No.31 Diyas returned from a two-year hiatus at two Japanese ITF W75 tournaments last month, reaching the second round of both.

The Wimbledon main-draw entry list was based on the rankings as of May 20, 2024, and 14 players ranked between Rakhimova and Lukas are absent from the qualifying entry list due to gaining entry to the main draw two weeks previously via either real ranking or special ranking. Varvara Gracheva, Brenda Fruhvirtova, Harriet Dart, Martina Trevisan, Rebeka Masarova, Sara Errani, Nao Hibino, Jule Niemeier, Rebecca Sramkova, Julia Riera, Irina-Camelia Begu, Paula Badosa, Kateryna Baindl and Ajla Tomljanovic.

Eight further players ranked between Rakhimova and Lukas have not entered Wimbledon qualifying. Alizé Cornet retired at Roland Garros, Belinda Bencic is on maternity leave, while Yanina Wickmayer, Storm Hunter, Lois Boisson and Alina Korneeva all missed Roland Garros with various injuries.

Kaja Juvan and Naomi Osaka are on the Wimbledon main-draw entry list as the 31st and 36th alternates respectively but have not entered qualifying. Four-time major champion Osaka, who stretched No.1 seed Iga Swiatek to a three-set thriller in the second round of Roland Garros last week, is ranked No.134.

Wild cards for Wimbledon have not yet been announced. Should they be awarded to any player entered into qualifying, that player will be withdrawn from the qualifying entry list. Raducanu is also the seventh alternate to the main draw using her special ranking of No.103.

The next 15 alternates to the qualifying competition in case of any withdrawals are, in order, as follows:

1. Harmony Tan (FRA)2. Anastasiya Soboleva (UKR)3. Vitalia Diatchenko (using a special ranking of No.227)4. Despina Papamichail (GRE)5. Lina Gjorcheska (MKD)6. Amanda Anisimova (USA)7.

With an impressive 20 Grand Slam titles and a natural elegance on the court, Roger Federer truly redefined what it means to excel in tennis. The Swiss icon, who hung up his racket in 2022, was more than just a player; he was a global ambassador for the sport. From exhilarating rivalries to unforgettable victories, Roger Federer's career was filled with moments that will forever resonate with fans around the globe.

Wimbledon 2008: A Rivalry Cemented in History

Federer's 2008 Wimbledon final against Rafael Nadal is often regarded as the greatest tennis match of all time. This gripping 4-hour-48-minute showdown concluded with Nadal toppling the five-time defending champion in a fifth set as daylight faded. Even in defeat, Federer's resilience and sportsmanship shone through, deepening the legendary Federer-Nadal rivalry.

2009 French Open: Completing the Grand Slam Set

After facing three previous losses in the final, Roland Garros had been a tough nut to crack for Federer. But in 2009, he finally triumphed on the clay by overcoming Robin Söderling. This victory not only completed his Career Grand Slam but also tied him with Pete Sampras for 14 major titles at that time, solidifying his status as one of the greatest of all time.

2017 Australian Open: A Comeback Like No Other

Following a six-month injury layoff, Federer made a stunning return to the tour in 2017, leaving the tennis world in awe. At 35 years old, he faced off against Rafael Nadal in a thrilling five-set battle to claim his 18th Grand Slam title. This marked his first major win in five years and signaled the start of an incredible late-career revival.

Winning 100 Titles: A Century of Consistency

In 2019, Roger Federer achieved a remarkable milestone by securing his 100th ATP singles title at the Dubai Tennis Championships. This rare accomplishment highlighted his enduring presence and consistency at the top level, making him only the second man in history to reach this landmark after Jimmy Connors.

The Farewell at Laver Cup: An Emotional Goodbye

Roger Federer played his last match at the 2022 Laver Cup, joining forces with his longtime rival and friend Rafael Nadal. The poignant moment, as the two legends shared tears on the court, served as a heartfelt farewell to a career that went beyond the sport itself.

Tennis

Change rarely comes quickly to tennis media. Coverage of a Grand Slam tournament today doesn't look all that different from 10, 20 or in some cases 30 years ago, despite huge technological advances. The camera angle slanting down from above, which can flatten the real shape of the players' shots. Two familiar voices, likely stars from decades past, reciting the most entrenched ideas about the people on court. Post-match analysis from different voices in the same demographic, mostly looking ahead to the next match and divining what, if anything, the result means for the grand narrative of the tournament.

As many have done, another media network is vowing that it has found a better way. This time, it is Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the owner of TNT Sports and the new U.S. rights-holder for the French Open. WBD and the French Tennis Federation (FFT) agreed a 10-year deal worth $650 million in June 2024, putting an end to a hodgepodge of coverage that had previously aired across NBC, the Tennis Channel, Tennis Channel+ (its streaming service) and Peacock.

Its promise to tennis fans is something different. Interviews with coaches mid-match, some of whom will be mic'd up. Interviews with players at practice sessions. New camera angles. And whip-around coverage reminiscent of the NFL's Red Zone, which spends game days hopscotching from one game to another when teams have scoring opportunities. In Paris, where tension and drama arise, TNT says, the cameras will go.

Some of these innovations are not new. Courtside discussions happen at the Laver Cup, the annual ATP-sanctioned exhibition, as well as at the United Cup, the mixed international team event that opens the season. A new camera angle at the Madrid Open, which pans with the players' movement and is set around their strike zone, reveals the magnificent arcing of their shots (while shadows from the stadiums make them disappear).

Some of the voices using those innovations will be new. Venus Williams, the seven-time Grand Slam champion, will join Andre Agassi on TNT's roster, along with contemporary players and recent retirees, including Sloane Stephens, Chris Eubanks, Caroline Wozniacki and Sam Querrey.

Max, formerly HBO, will stream every match, a full-circle moment since HBO made a name for itself in part with coverage of Wimbledon in the 1980s. Familiar faces John and Patrick McEnroe and Chris Evert will be on hand. And at the center of this bid to do what myriad networks have not quite managed is a former college tennis player: Craig Barry, the chief content officer for TNT. He played at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif. and came of age in the first golden era of professional tennis, when larger-than-life luminaries Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg, John McEnroe, Guillermo Vilas, Evert and Martina Navratilova dominated the sport.

Like most tennis fans of a certain vintage, Barry appreciates the sport's traditions, including those connected with how it's presented. He also sees tennis as having lost a degree of cultural relevance, especially with younger sports fans.  

“It's time to play it forward,” Barry said in an interview last week. “It's time to find a groove and push this sport back to where it belongs. I don't know why it's lost as much momentum as it has.”

NBC, which didn't prioritize tennis coverage and didn't televise any of the other Grand Slams, struggled to grow the audience for the French Open in a meaningful way in recent years. About 1.6 million people watched last year's men's final, but fewer than 1 million watched the women's. That is substantially less than the average audience for Wimbledon coverage on ESPN.

TNT will begin with a walking start. WBD also owns Eurosport, which televises the French Open in Europe. Viewers in America will see some of the best-known voices and former players in the sport internationally, including Mats Wilander and Boris Becker, two stars of the 1980s and, in Becker's case, a chunk of the 1990s. Barry hopes that they will see them differently. The coverage styled on the NFL Red Zone won't have separate announce teams on each match, but rather a group in an onsite studio watching the action and talking about it along with everyone else.

“What interests me is a conversational approach to the game, where I feel like I'm sitting in a room talking tennis,” Barry said. “I understand there's a certain formality to the tradition of tennis and I'm not here to change that, but cutting people loose to have opinions and giving them a forum to have a conversation and look at different ways of calling matches is an important part of the evolution.”

The Tennis Channel and ESPN have gone down this conversational route, but rarely with cuts to key moments of matches. Whether that model will work for a sport with pressure points that can occur every other game — the out-of-context presentation of which is a key problem for highlights — remains to be seen.

What is certain is that having players who are still active, or who might play in the tournament in question before lending their expertise fresh off an exit, is revolutionary. When Eubanks started moonlighting with the Tennis Channel during tournaments, fans lapped up his knowledge and his perspective from the very heart of the tour, as opposed to the removed view of many of his colleagues.

Eubanks, who originally got into television as a backup for a tennis career that was sputtering, treasures that removed view — but from his own game, not the sport at large. He has kept up the work with ESPN and the Tennis Channel because he likes it, sees it as a future career path, and believes it has made him a better tennis player. 

The move to broadcasting coincided with Eubanks' best season, in 2023, when he made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. He said it allowed him to understand his sport unemotionally, and to experience his own matches from that position of emotional detachment. He has since slipped back to just outside the top 100, but has solidified his second career, both on camera and as a post-match on-court interviewer.

It's Williams, who has not played a competitive match for over a year but has also not formally announced the end of her career, who will be the star, alongside Agassi. But the biggest stars have the most to lose by saying the wrong thing, or by, in Barry's words, “cutting loose.” Venus, who has lived through the tennis evolution that came alongside her and Serena's domination of women's tennis, could be a contextualising bridge for the fans of now and those of her era.

Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open champion, is in a similar position to Eubanks. Her ranking has slipped to No. 134, and she has started to make forays into television but isn't done playing yet. She is currently recovering from a foot injury, which will keep her from trying to play in Paris. But she figures to be a valuable asset in France, given her reservoir of clay-court success: she made the French Open final in 2018.

Querrey retired in 2022 after a 16-year career. A Wimbledon semifinalist, he has a podcast that has a solid following with younger fans called Nothing Major. The title involves a bit of self-mockery since he and co-hosts John Isner, Jack Sock and Steve Johnson never won a singles Grand Slam. He never played Sinner or Alcaraz, but is plenty familiar with everyone else.

Wozniacki looked to be headed to a solid schedule of television work when she retired in 2020 and had two children. But then she came back four years later and started winning matches again. She last played at the U.S. Open last year, where she made the round of 16, and recently announced the pending birth of her third child.

They will mix in with the traditional voices, the McEnroes and the Everts. How that will all work remains to be seen, but Barry knows time is on his network's side.

“We have 10 years to to kind of figure out the best direction,” he said. Any fans who think this tennis train is off the track will turn off much sooner than that.

Shnaider had started working with the former world No. 1 last month.ByDavid KanePublished May 08, 2025 copy_link

Published May 08, 2025

ROME, Italy—Diana Shnaider made headlines last month when she revealed Dinara Safina had joined her coaching team, but the relationship appears to have concluded as of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Shnaider confirming the news on Thursday.“She returned back home to Barcelona. She needed that,” the No. 13 told me, reluctant to elaborate much on the split.Safina officially retired from tennis in 2014 after reaching three major finals in 2008 and 2009. With elder brother Marat Safin, she became one half of the only brother-sister duo to top the ATP and WTA rankings. Safin also joined the coaching world this spring, pairing up with countryman Andrey Rublev at the start of the clay swing.

Shnaider spoke positively of the relationship with Safina last week at the Mutua Madrid Open, where she pushed former world No. 1 Iga Swiatek to three sets in the fourth round, and echoed those sentiments after a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Caroline Dolehide at the Foro Italico.“The experience, of course, was great,” she told me. “She's a former world No. 1, so she gave me a lot of those tips on how to stay focused in a match and not to let those negative emotions ruin your game and mental skills. For sure, those are things I learned and I'll try to use them as much as I can so I can get better each day.”The 21-year-old doesn't appear to have suffered from the split in the short term, racing through her opening round against Dolehide without losing a game.

“Caroline is such a tricky opponent I really tried to stay focused through the whole match because you never know,” Shnaider said. “Maybe the opponent isn't feeling well in the beginning of the match, and then she starts feeling more comfortable. Maybe she sees the score and thinks, ‘Ok, whatever, I'm losing,' and she goes for the shots even more.“So, I tried not to think about the score because for me, the goal was just to win a match. The score doesn't matter.

Tennis

A federal judge has ruled that the men's professional tennis tour cannot retaliate against players who join an ongoing lawsuit against it, nor against players who consider joining the lawsuit.

The ruling, issued by judge Margaret Garnett of the U.S. District Court in New York Wednesday, serves as an early victory for the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the ATP Tour, its women's counterpart the WTA, the International Tennis Federation and tennis anti-doping authorities in March.

After the filing of that lawsuit, the ATP Tour circulated a letter to be signed by its players. The letter said that any players that signed it did not support the lawsuit, nor the PTPA. Garnett ruled that the circulation of that letter, and a specific instance in which an ATP board member pressured two players to sign it, amounted to “coercive, deceptive, or potentially abusive” behavior. Those players were world No. 2 Alexander Zverev, of Germany, and Ben Shelton, the American world No. 13.

Judge Garnett added that it was reasonable for players to understand the ATP rulebook as allowing the tour to threaten the livelihood and benefits of any player who decided to sue the organization. She also ordered the ATP to within seven days circulate and post a letter to players, making it clear that they cannot be punished or threatened with punishment for joining litigation.

The PTPA's motion, however, had requested that all of the defendants in the lawsuit be prevented from communicating with their players in this regard. Garnett rejected the PTPA's move for a ban on all communication, stating that it would prevent the defendants from reasonably defending their position.

The judge's letter, known as a corrective action, informs players that “ATP Tour Inc. is legally prohibited from retaliating in any way or threatening retaliation, directly or indirectly, against you for considering participating in or ultimately deciding to participate in this lawsuit.”

Ahmad Nassar, the executive director of the PTPA, said: “the decision speaks for itself.”

A spokesperson for the ATP Tour said that the organization “acknowledges the court's ruling and will promptly comply with its directions.

“We remain committed to supporting our players, upholding the integrity of the game, and fully defending ourselves in the ongoing legal proceedings.”

The PTPA, co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, has spent much of the past year convincing players that they would not experience retaliation for being a named plaintiff on the lawsuit, or for supporting it. Twelve players elected to be named plaintiffs. Of the six ATP players, three have retired from tennis. None of the other three are ranked inside the top 90, though Nick Kyrgios has been ranked as high as world No. 11. A number of top players declined to join the lawsuit, fearing retribution or a loss of potential prize money, playing opportunities and benefits.

The lawsuit, which describes the governing bodies of tennis as a “cartel,” would overturn the structure of professional tennis if it was ruled to have merit, but the PTPA has indicated that it does not want the case to get to that stage. The wider ambition is more gradual changes around the proportion of revenues shared with players and the structure of the tennis calendar.

The judge also ordered to the ATP to retain all future communication with players regarding the lawsuit.

(Reuters) -Naomi Osaka and Ons Jabeur advanced to the Italian Open third round in Rome on Thursday after ninth seed Paula Badosa and twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova withdrew due to injury.

Japan's Osaka crushed Swiss lucky loser Viktorija Golubic 6-2 6-3 after 27-year-old Badosa cast more doubts over her fitness ahead of the French Open as the Spanish former world number two pulled out of another tournament due to a recurring back injury.

Kvitova was forced to withdraw due to a leg problem, so three-times Grand Slam finalist Jabeur advanced via walkover and will next face sixth seed Italian Jasmine Paolini or qualifier Lulu Sun.

Czech Kvitova, 35, secured her first victory since returning from maternity leave by defeating Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round.

Germany tennis great Boris Becker has blamed his early Wimbledon victory at the age of 17 for some of his later problems.

"For my health, for my life, it would have been better if I had won Wimbledon later, at 21 or 22, and not at 17 and 18," Becker said in an interview with Sports Illustrated magazine.

"Because then I wouldn't have been the child prodigy that people still see me as."

After the end of his career, Becker was unable to build on his sporting success and suffered financial and personal troubles. In 2022, for example, he was imprisoned in Britain for seven and a half months after violating insolvency requirements.

Becker won the London grass court grand slam three times, the first coming in 1985 at the age of 17.

"Wimbledon was always like Christmas for me. The best time of the year," said the now 57-year-old. "If I have a home as a sportsman, then it's Wimbledon."

He is now a respected tennis pundit and hopes it stays that way.

"I hope to be treated with more respect for the rest of my life, that my life's work as the best (men's) German tennis player in history will be honoured more than before," added Becker.

Tennis Sensation Madison Keys Thrives in the Spotlight After Grand Slam Victory

In a whirlwind of success and newfound fame, tennis superstar Madison Keys reflects on her life post her historic win at the Australian Open in 2025. The Illinois native, who clinched her maiden Grand Slam title in Melbourne, has been basking in the glow of victory ever since.

Making waves both on and off the court, Keys recently secured a title at the Adelaide International before dominating her opponents at the Australian Open. Currently ranked as the fifth seed at the Rome Open, the World No.6 is set to clash with Varvara Gracheva in the second round, following a first-round bye.

Despite her monumental win, Keys remains grounded, sharing, “I don't think my life has changed that much since winning the Australian Open. More people want to talk to me, and, obviously, I have a beautiful trophy in my house, but life is still kind of the same, and I'm still really happy to be out on the tennis court and hopefully win some more trophies.”

The tennis prodigy expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support she received, noting the outpouring of well-wishes from fans, competitors, and mentors alike. Keys also revealed a charming anecdote about her marriage to coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whose Italian heritage sparked some playful banter about changing her last name for added support.

“Bjorn was kind of joking that I should switch my last name this week to be Fratangelo,” Keys shared. “I keep telling him I'll do it eventually. But right now I'm busy. There's a lot of paperwork I just don't want to do right now. I'm too lazy. But I've come to learn a little bit about where his family came from.”

As Madison Keys continues to shine both on and off the court, the world eagerly awaits her next move in what promises to be a stellar career filled with triumphs and touching moments.

Naomi Osaka, who is currently competing at the Rome Open, has always been open about what goes on in her life. In her recent press conference, when asked about receiving support from other mothers on the WTA Tour, Osaka responded with characteristic honesty and trademark humor.

“Like uh I don't know how to answer your question because... probably,” said Naomi Osaka, answering a reporter's question if she had been added to any group chat by the WTA moms on the tour.

“But I also am not the one that speaks a lot, like I only talk if someone asks me a question- that's kind of how I operate and I have really bad social skills,” said Osaka. “So, like there probably is a mom's group chat but I just don't talk a lot and I don't know if that's my answer to your question,” she added.

“But also, I find that I talk to more people now than I do before so I'm hoping that my skills in that aspect level up as well,” she added with a wry smile.

The WTA now has several players who have in recent times become mothers, such as Caroline Wozniacki, Taylor Townsend, Elina Svitolina, and more recently, the likes of Belinda Bencic and Petra Kvitova. Osaka, thus, has a healthy amount of support that she can lean on when it comes to being a traveling mother on the WTA tour.

Osaka also mentioned that after her Madrid Open loss, she was contemplating whether she wanted to compete more or go home because she was missing her child. Eventually, she decided to get more matches under her belt and traveled to France, where she ended up winning her first-ever clay title.

“I was just more missing my daughter a lot, and I was thinking like I wonder if the time would have been spent better after Madrid going to see her really quickly as opposed to playing the tournament, which like luckily, I was able to snap out of that, but its kind of funny like during tennis sometimes you don't think about tennis at all”, said Osaka.

As Osaka traverses through the challenges of being a professional tennis player while being a mom, it remains to be seen if she goes on to win more titles as a mother in the immediate future.

Italian women's tennis lived a historic chapter during the 2010s with several players dominating the tour, including names such as Francesca Schiavone, Flavia Pennetta, Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci. The latter, who achieved a career Grand Slam in doubles, is also remembered for her defining and stunning win over Serena Williams at the 2015 US Open.

Vinci turned pro in 1999, and early in her career, found more success in doubles than singles. She won the girls' doubles title at Roland Garros with Pennetta that year and reached her first WTA final in Bogota in 2007. It wasn't until 2010 that Vinci finished a season ranked in the top 40 in singles.

But over time, her slice-heavy, all-court game began to find a foothold against elite opponents. By the time she broke into the top 10 at age 33, Vinci had become one of the tour's most complete players. She amassed ten WTA singles titles and started to become a dangerous opponent.

Vinci entered the 2015 US Open unseeded and ranked 43rd in the world. After a walkover into the fourth round and a win over Kristina Mladenovic in the quarters, she became the oldest first-time Grand Slam semifinalist in the Open Era. But her real breakthrough came in the next match.

She beat world No. 1 Serena Williams in three sets, ending Williams' bid for the calendar-year Grand Slam. Vinci was 42 spots below Serena in the rankings, had never reached a Slam final, and was widely counted out. “It's like a dream,” she told ESPN courtside. “Sorry guys… today is my day.” The result is still considered one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.

She lost in the final to childhood friend Pennetta, but her semifinal win was the moment that defined her career. “It was the best victory of my life,” Vinci later said. “The public can remember me with Serena.”

Though she rose to world No. 7 in singles, Vinci's greatest legacy may be in doubles. Partnering with Sara Errani, she won 25 WTA doubles titles, including all four Grand Slams. They completed the Career Grand Slam in just three seasons. The pair spent 110 weeks ranked No. 1 and dominated the early 2010s.

Together, they won majors at the French Open, US Open, Australian Open (twice), and Wimbledon. Only five women's doubles teams in history have completed a Career Grand Slam, and Errani and Vinci joined that elite company in 2014.

Vinci also helped Italy capture Fed Cup titles in 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2013, alongside Errani, Pennetta, and Schiavone. Her consistency and skill made her a vital contributor to the team's success.

Vinci retired in 2018 after losing in the first round of the Italian Open, her home tournament. Her final match came in front of a packed crowd that included friends and family.

“I'm tired, but I'm happy,” she said. “Tennis was my life… It was a magnificent adventure,” she said. “The public can remember me with Serena. It was an incredible day.” 

Since retiring, Vinci has taken up professional padel, breaking into the top 100 in 2022. Even after tennis, her competitive drive hasn't faded.

	Catholics have a new Pope, and for the first time in the church's history, it's an American. It took the College of Cardinals only two days to elect U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost as the successor to Pope Francis. Prevost — who has taken the name Leo XIV — was by no means a frontrunner for the papacy, and as the world scrambles to learn about the new pontiff, it's clear he harbors at least one very American habit: posting. 


	Prevost appears to have been an active user of Twitter, now known as X, since 2011. The first tweets from the account @drprevost date back to the reign of Pope Benedict XVI and include rather mundane updates like “In Rome, Council meetings.” 


	But Prevost has also used the platform to criticize Donald Trump and his administrations' approach to immigration policy. In 2015, Prevost tweeted an article critical of then-candidate Trump's “problematic” “anti-immigrant rhetoric.”


	In a recent February 2025 post, which has gone viral since Prevost's elevation, he wrote that Vice President J.D. Vance — a Catholic convert in adulthood — was “wrong” about his attempts to find a theological justification for the administration's treatment of migrants. “Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,” Prevost wrote. (He added a second post critical of Vance's misunderstanding of the doctrine of “ordo amoris.”)

	In his most recent post before entering Conclave, Prevost criticized Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for making light of the deportation and detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Prevost linked to an article from the website Catholic Standard comparing the plights and persecutions experienced by immigrant and refugee communities to the Passion of Jesus Christ. 


	The reaction from the MAGA right — which in recent years has also taken a liking to ultra-conservative Catholicism — was immediate and predictable. 


	“WOKE MARXIST POPE,” wrote Laura Loomer — a far-right 9/11 conspiracy theorist who is close enough to Trump to advise him on national security staffing decisions. In another post, Loomer wrote that Prevost was “just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican,” and that “Catholics don't have anything good to look forward to.”

	Sean Davis, the founder of the right-wing website The Federalist, wrote that he had been worried the cardinals would “select a left-wing, Western European pope to use the Roman Catholic Church to counter the rise of national populism in general, and Trump in particular, and to bolster globalist forces against those who believe the purpose of a country is to safeguard its own people.” 


	“The new pope was born in America, not Western Europe, so I was wrong on that score, but I fear I wasn't wrong about the rest,” he wrote. 


	Right-wing commentator Megyn Kelly, who was initially thrilled over the election of an American Pope, later wondered if it was “too much to hope that some 20-year-old ran the new pope's X account and he never looked at it?” 


	Through his tweets and retweets, Prevost has waded into several hot-button topics in American politics — from gun control to the death penalty to climate change to the murder of George Floyd.


	In 2013, he retweeted anti-capitalist political cartoon. It features a drawing of Pope Francis standing beside a poster reading “GREED IS NOT GOOD,” and behind a trio of men in suits with briefcases reading “Wall Street,” “Banks,” and “Big Biz.” The men are pointing back at the pontiff and shouting, “Blasphemy!”

	In 2015, Prevost tweeted an endorsement of environmental advocacy within the church, writing: “SIGN THE CATHOLIC CLIMATE PETITION.”


	In 2017, in the aftermath of the mass shooting massacre at a music festival in Las Vegas, Prevost retweeted Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) criticizing Republicans and their reliance on divine intervention to solve gun violence. “To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” Murphy wrote. “None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.”


	In 2017, in the aftermath of the racist rally in Charlottesville, Prevost retweeted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' condemnation of “the abhorrent acts of hatred.” In 2020, Prevost retweeted prayers for the murdered George Floyd, and his family, and posted a call for more “leaders in the Church to reject racism and seek justice.”


	Of course, the Pope is still Catholic. Prevost's social media also contains a flurry of anti-abortion posts, such as a meme in which the “B” and “R” in “ABORTION” have been replaced to spell “ADOPTION.” In another post, Prevost shared a now-broken link to the White House website with the caption: “Rescind the HHS Dept. Mandate Requiring Catholic Employers to Provide Contraceptives/Abortifacients to Their Employees.” The new pope has also called for the eradication of the death penalty.

	











	Trump and Vance have responded a little more diplomatically to Prevost's election than their followers online.


	“Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope,” Trump wrote. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”


	The reverent tone was a shift for Trump. The president has recently flirted with blasphemy by telling reporters he'd like to be chosen as Pope himself, and even posting an AI-generated image of himself in papal vestments. 


	“Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election!” Vance wrote. “I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”

	Prevost will likely cease posting under his personal social media accounts now that he's taken on the mantle of the global church. But who knows, maybe a dedicated poster in the pontificate is exactly what the Catholic Church needs.

Actor Andrew Walker has played lots of cool roles in his tenure as one of Hallmark's biggest stars, from pilot to firefighter to hockey pro. But nothing quite compares to his latest role as a real-life dolphin rescuer. 

On May 6, 2025, Walker and his wife Cassandra Troy leaped into action when they spotted an animal in distress near the Vancouver home where they're staying. The couple shared an Instagram video of their epic adventure, working with trained rescuers to get the injured dolphin to safety. 

Sadly, the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Society (VAMMR), one of the organizations called to the scene, confirmed with EntertainmentNow on May 8 that the Pacific white-sided dolphin died from injuries likely sustained in a killer whale attack despite “around-the-clock care from veterinary and volunteer teams.” A necropsy will be performed to confirm the exact cause of death, per the VAMMR.

Despite the sad outcome, Walker told EntertainmentNow the rescue was an “incredible experience” and Troy wrote in her post that they are so “grateful for the people doing this work every day.”

A post shared by Cassandra Troy (@casstroywalker)

The dolphin rescue unfolded close to the home where Walker's family, including Troy and their two young sons, are staying, located near a bird sanctuary along the muddy shoreline of an inlet. 

“Some birders noticed a fin going back and forth in the shallow water,” Walker told EntertainmentNow on May 8, noting that the group found “a dolphin with scratch marks on her back, by herself, which is not normal for dolphins.” 

The birders called VAMMR, which said the dolphin got stuck in the mud while rescuers from their team and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) were en route. In the meantime, Walker said, he and Troy put on their rainboots for trekking through the mud and raced out to see if the group needed help. He said they even brought scissors, thinking it might be a sea lion caught in a fishing net. 

Once the rescuers arrived, Walker said, they “propped the dolphin into a carrying tarp with handles.” Amazed that dolphins can weigh 250 pounds, he told EntertainmentNow, “they needed extra hands to take turns” holding and carrying the tarp. 

“Since our house has direct access to the water and street, they used our backyard and driveway to carry her through,” Walker said. “In the end, we had a group of caring neighbors, birders and the rescue team, and with their direction we all helped to carry her to the van. They were so professional and caring. It was an incredible experience.”

The male dolphin, whom rescuers nicknamed Pickles, was then transported to VAMMR for “stabilization and emergency care,” per the organization, which responds to more than 300 marine mammal emergencies every year. The nonprofit is Canada's only dedicated marine mammal rescue facility and aims to eventually release each animal it cares for back into the ocean.

Though Walker may now take the cake for the most dramatic wildlife rescue, he's not the only Hallmark star to save a stranded animal in the last year. 

In September, Tyler Hynes — Walker's co-star in the “Three Wise Men and a Baby” movies and Troy's first cousin — saved a seagull trapped in fishing net along the shoreline of a cottage he owns in Canada.    

An Instagram video Hynes posted showed him walking along the muddy shoreline with a scissors and kneeling down to help the scared and stuck bird. Despite it flapping its wings in fear, Hynes gained its trust as he gently cut away fishing line wrapped around the bird's webbed foot. 

Meanwhile, Walker and Hynes' Hallmark pal Jonathan Bennett also saved a bird at his California home in late February. He posted a TikTok video, taken by husband Jaymes Vaughan, in which he used a towel to capture a hummingbird that got stuck in their house and kept hitting a window, trying to escape. 

The “Finding Mr. Christmas” star gingerly carried the towel out to their backyard and watched the little bird soar as he said, “Okay, fly little guy!” 

Fans and friends have been thrilled by all three Hallmark stars' wildlife rescues, including one who wrote on the dolphin post, “How beautiful the Walkers are heroes 🐬”

	The United States surgeon general is tasked with representing the nation's medical community and informing the general public on potential risks to their health. Warning labels on tobacco products, alcohol, and potentially even social media all originate from the surgeon general's office. 


	Surgeon generals often first serve as high-ranking doctors within the United States military, but President Donald Trump is continuing to expand his roster of unconventional hires by tapping a woo-woo wellness influencer to fill the position. 


	“I am pleased to announce that Dr. Casey Means, will be nominated as our next Surgeon General of the United States of America,” Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. “Casey has impeccable “MAHA” credentials, and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.” 


	“Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding. Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History,” the president added. 

	











	In reality, Means' credentials as a medical professional are quite questionable, and much of her career has been dedicated to the promotion of pseudoscientific bunk and her own products and writing. Here's everything you need to know about the woman who will potentially be America's next top doctor: 


Who is Casey Means? 


	Means is a prominent influencer within the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — whom she advises. 


	Means is probably best known for her 2024 book Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, which she co-wrote with her brother. Before her foray into literary pop-medicine, Means co-founded Levels, a startup that sold wearable glucose monitors and facilitated blood tests to help users track their metabolic health through a subscription-based app.

					The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time		
	









	Means has appeared on massively popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience — where she suggested there may be a link between vaccines and developmental disorders — and The Tucker Carlson Show. She has over 750,000 followers on Instagram, and also runs a blog where she provides health and life advice to readers. In one post, means recounted how in an effort to find love in her mid-thirties, she created a shrine where she prayed to her ancestors for guidance, performed “full moon” ceremonies, did mushrooms, and literally spoke to trees on solo hikes. 

	











	In another blog post, she admitted that she converses with ChatGPT to discuss ways to stop a “total global ecosystem collapse with human health as one piece of collateral damage.” Other posts advertise videos on “THREE FOODS WORSE THAN COCAINE.” You get the idea. 


Is Casey Means a doctor? 


	Means has an MD from Stanford University, and was on track to become an otolaryngological surgeon before quitting her residency in order to pursue studies in “functional medicine” — a form of alternative medicine that claims to prioritize treating the root cause of disease over the symptoms. Functional medicine has been accused of using excessive testing and analysis on patients where a standard diagnostic matrix would suffice, and of veering towards pseudoscientific practices that can be harmful to a patient's health. 


	According to the Oregon Medical Board, Means medical license is currently inactive, and her website states that she “is no longer seeing patients and is not able to comment on specific medical conditions or provide any medical guidance.”

	So is the woman Trump's wants to be the top-ranking doctor in the United States actually a doctor? Kind of! 


How aligned is Casey Means and RFK Jr. on issues like vaccines? 


	Means has a friendly relationship with HHS secretary and known anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and was openly supportive of his nomination for the position. While she hasn't expressed explicit opposition to vaccinations, she has promoted claims doubting their safety and calling for further research. 


	“There is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children,” she wrote as part of an October “wish list” for the presidency. 


	Means and her brother, Calley Means, have been very public about their relationship with Kenendy, supporting both his failed presidential candidacy and his current position as HHS secretary. It's no surprise, given that much of their messaging around processed foods, Covid-19, mental illness, and the general state of public health in America overlap significantly with Kennedy's views. 


	Last year, Calley Means claimed to have had a vision of Kennedy and Trump standing side by side together while praying for Kennedy during a campaign event, and reportedly became heavily involved in the Trump 2024 presidential transition project. 

	











How did Trump come to know Casey Means? 


	Apparently, he doesn't. During an Oval Office press gaggle on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he actually doesn't know Means at all. 


	“You just announced a new nominee for U.S. surgeon general who never finished her residency, and is not a practicing physician. So can you explain why you picked her to be America's top doctor?” one reporter asked.

	“Because Bobby thought she was fantastic,” Trump replied. “She's a brilliant woman who went through Stanford — and as I understand it she wanted to be an academic as opposed to a surgeon.” 


	“Bobby really thought she was great,” Trump added. “I don't know her. I listened to the recommendation of Bobby. I met her yesterday and once before.”

Christopher Nolan may make cinema history yet again with his Universal adaptation of “The Odyssey.” 

One of the film‘s stunt performers, James Newman, said during the “Action for Everyone” podcast, as reported by Screenrant, that the feature is going to be “an epic of all epics” and is auteur Nolan “at his best.” 

“The Odyssey” is Nolan's reimagining of the iconic Greek epic about hero Odysseus who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War. Matt Damon stars in the lead role. The film was announced in December 2024 as Nolan's 13th feature. The ensemble cast includes a slew of reunions for Nolan in addition to working again with Damon, including Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Elliot Page, and Benny Safdie. Tom Holland, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, and John Leguizamo also star.

“They're never going to make a movie like this again,” stunt performer Newman said. “I think it's going to be an epic of all epics. It's going to be Nolan at his best. No holds barred.” 

That means that the battle sequences are even more bloody, and the locations are even more daring places to shoot.

“He definitely fights a battle that a lot of people aren't fighting,” Newman said of Nolan's approach to directing. “The coordinator came to us with scout pictures of locations, and it's just all over Europe because Odysseus' journey is crazy, it's like 10 years long. They found locations and Nolan would go like, ‘OK, this cave, has anyone ever filmed here before?' And the local guy is like, ‘No.' [Nolan] is like, ‘OK, great, we're going to film here.' This untouched place. He wants to be the first person there to do it, he wants to feel like no one has ever touched ground here. And every location is a hike.” 

One location, which Newman believed to be Odysseus' home in the film, is a two kilometer hike on an incline to even reach. And Newman also hinted that actors Damon and Holland have a slew of impressive stunts onscreen as well. 

“I had the opportunity to make some action with a talented group of people for the film and also had the opportunity to train Matt Damon and Tom Holland for the film. All the rumors about Tom being physically able are so true. He can literally do anything. He should get every physical role possible,” Newman said. “With Tom, he's obviously more athletic and he's younger so he's going to almost be a younger version of Odysseus.” 

 










As for Damon's Odysseus, Newman continued, “Matt definitely wanted to be more efficient because that's the character. Odysseus, if anyone is familiar with that story, Odysseus is really the only war scene character along that journey. The guys he has with him have fought with him but Odysseus himself is like, ‘I've lived and breathed battle,' and so that makes him more smart, and that's why he's so good. Matt definitely understood that and then we were trying to play that up as well. So he isn't going to do flashy things.” 

Actor Leguizamo said during MSNBC's “Morning Joe” that Nolan still works like an independent filmmaker despite having a massive budget. “He's got a crazy budget, it's not small, but he runs [it] like an indie film because he's not doing it by committee, he's not doing it by what the studio says,” Leguizamo said. “He's like an indie filmmaker but with crazy money.”

	White smoke billowing from the Sistine Chapel on Thursday signaled that a conclave of cardinals have selected a new pope: Robert Prevost of the United States. He is the first American Pope in history and will go by Leo XIV. Cardinal Dominique Mamberti of France made the announcement.


	Prevost, 69, comes from Chicago. CNN reports that Prevost did missionary work in Peru and led a Vatican office for vetting bishops. He was the bishop of Chiclayo from 2014 to 2023; notably, he added three women to the voting bloc for bishops. His election is remarkable, according to The Associated Press, since Americans have not been elected pope because of the country's geopolitical power.


	The largest group of cardinals in history, 133 total, had sequestered themselves in the iconic Vatican City chapel to determine Pope Francis' successor, following his death last month after a 12-year papacy. The New York Times reports that the conclave itself lasted a little more than 24 hours; previous elections have stretched out two or three days. Pope Francis had appointed many of the cardinals who participated in the vote, but some were meeting for the first time.

	Pope Francis, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires in 1936, died on April 21, a couple of months after he was hospitalized with bronchitis. Pope Francis had struggled with respiratory issues for most of his life following a battle with pneumonia when he was a young man. After Pope Benedict XVI abdicated his papacy in 2013, just shy of eight years as pope, Pope Francis began his on March 13, 2013.

	Pushing a more progressive agenda than his predecessors, Pope Francis preached understanding and humanity. His final message to the public was, “There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression.” His papacy was marked by what people viewed as liberal stances toward LGBTQ+ community, climate change, capitalism, and divorce, though others criticized his comments about women's roles in society and a homophobic slur he made last year. Nevertheless, he earned the colloquial title, “The People's Pope.”

Michael Rozek was at his home in rural Nebraska on a Zoom call with Isabelle Huppert and members of a production crew in Normandy, back in November 2022. The first-time director was in the beginning stages of a film shoot for “Marianne,” a movie he spent the past decade trying to make with Huppert and an Oscar-nominated producer. Rozek, now 70, had no filmmaking background, only a passion for the arts and to find people willing to help him make movies. The shoot began as a dream and became a nightmare after it finished. 

Film festival rejections, no hopes for distribution, and a lack of interest from the press left a film he made to spark debate without a chance to be seen. Ironically, the current fate of Rozek's film ties directly into what it's about. For 90 minutes, Huppert talks directly to the camera about the idea of narrative itself. Rozek, through Huppert, interrogates the purpose of plots and stories in films, considering them distractions from the medium's ability to reflect reality back at us. The film also confronts the industry's business side, referred to as “they” and “them,” for chasing escapism in pursuit of the almighty dollar. At one point, Huppert literally yells at viewers to “wake up” from their complacency to demand better films.

Rozek sees the hostile indifference towards“Marianne” as an injustice summed up by a line Huppert says in the film: “They never let you have any of it.”

“I've not had a conventional life,” Rozek told IndieWire. He grew up in New Jersey in the 1960s before studying English at Vanderbilt University, where he began writing articles for The Village Voice and Rolling Stone. He spent time in public relations before he walked away from office jobs to pursue freelance writing full-time, with over 2,000 articles to his name, and even ran his own independent publication in the 1990s called Rozek's.

Rozek remembers traveling to New York City as a teenager to watch movies, although filmmaking wasn't a career choice he had in mind. A purchase of a DVD player in the 2000s rekindled his interest in international film through The Criterion Collection, and after a difficult 10-year period of his life, he knew he reached a point where he had something to say: “I needed to go through those 10 years to learn what life was all about, to live in poverty, to be under severe duress for a long time, so you really find out who you are and what you want to do. And then I found that I had things to write about.” 

 










In 2011, while living in Boise, Idaho, without a computer, he wrote his first screenplay at the public library and deployed a simple, persistent strategy: write as many scripts as he could and only send them to European producers, a choice he made “somewhat under the illusion that European cinema was much freer and artistic than American cinema.” Rozek applied the same tenacity from his career as a freelance journalist, claiming to have sent over 20,000 emails to producers. He got a response back from Philippe Carcassonne, a French producer who's worked with directors like Benoît Jacquot and Florian Zeller (Carcassonne received an Oscar nomination for Zeller's “The Father”). Carcassonne enjoyed Rozek's writing but passed on his scripts because they were, according to Rozek, too American.

Rozek stayed in touch with Carcassonne and in 2013, while living in what he described as “a 300-square-foot cottage in the jungle” in Hawaii, where he wrote “Marianne.” The film was inspired by the ideas of renegade independent filmmaker John Cassavetes, so Rozek initially saw Cassavetes' wife and muse Gena Rowlands in the lead role. Before he even received a response from producers to his script, Rozek got a hold of Rowlands' home phone number and called her up himself to see if she'd be interested. His brash effort did not go over well. 

 










“It was like the CIA was called. Everything went nuts,” he said, detailing the way an “old school agent” chewed him out over the phone. Rozek sent the script to Carcassonne, who expressed interest in producing it, but the experience of trying to get Rowlands soured him on finding an actress through representation. Rozek asked if Carcassonne knew anyone he could hand his script to directly. Carcassonne responded with one name: Isabelle Huppert. “I thought, man, I'm starting at the top,” Rozek said.

Huppert loved the script and met Rozek in 2015 to confirm she would take on the role. The radical nature of a one-character, direct-address feature meant even someone as connected as Carcassonne had difficulty finding funds for several years. A budget of around $350,000 was eventually secured, and “Marianne” filmed over three days, with Rozek remotely directing from home due to travel restrictions amid the ongoing pandemic. 

The short timeline meant some aspects of the script, like Huppert delivering a monologue in a town square, were scrapped in favor of only using one location. Rozek didn't mind as long as his ideas weren't compromised. “What matters to me is my script and a great actor,” he said assuredly. “After that, you can call it your mama if you want to.”

 










Production wrapped over Thanksgiving weekend of 2022, and Rozek locked his cut by Christmas. The hopes of premiering at Cannes or Venice, festivals where Huppert is a mainstay, were dashed once the rejections came in. The film eventually premiered in November 2023 at the Torino Film Festival, although Huppert couldn't attend and Rozek didn't want to spend the money to travel. And while Rozek offers nothing but praise and respect for Huppert in what he calls her “Brechtian” performance, she has not spoken publicly about “Marianne.” When I asked him why she hadn't done anything to promote the film, his response was succinct: “I don't want to speak for Isabelle Huppert.” (Her representatives did not respond to request for comment.)

Since the premiere, and with no prospects of “Marianne” screening at festivals or securing a release, Rozek is now a lone crusader for his film, and he isn't afraid to make as much noise as he can to get anyone's attention. His attempts to drum up interest for the film through “guerrilla marketing” had limited results. 

He turned to social media, repeatedly calling out the film industry and media on his X, formerly Twitter, account for “suppressing” the film, a confrontational strategy he won't speak to me about (“it's self-evident,” he said). He indirectly addresses it when he mentions a response he gave to someone who asked what he'd be willing to do to keep “Marianne” alive: “Anything, including making a complete ass out of myself, being willing to be perceived as loony.”

 










Knowing the story behind “Marianne,” his online antics read more like exasperation at the film's current limbo state. A film designed to confront viewers and reject conventions of plot and narrative, “Marianne” would always be a tough sell. The way Rozek sees it, given Huppert's star power and his film's low budget, the industry's aversion to “Marianne” is another sign of their lack of creativity: “You can't make a profit with that? You're not thinking straight.”  

Rozek explained how it all linked into “Marianne” and his ongoing fight to get it seen: “You've got an industry that is taking away your humanity, calling you eyeballs and butts in seats, running a diet of unreality toward you with no other chance of consuming anything else. When a film like mine appears, and they basically exterminate it, you got to get mad, man.”

While Rozek continues to wonder why, in his eyes, people “hate” his film, he remains optimistic about its future as the film slowly gains admirers. One of those admirers includes a self-described “distribution veteran” who said Rozek's debut was “already suggesting a major auteurist stamp and flying in the face of conventional wisdom.”

They will help Rozek independently distribute “Marianne” across theaters in America and is currently looking for venues to screen the film. It's a move that ties back to Cassavetes, who independently released his films, and Rozek hopes the film will connect with audiences willing to engage with its ideas. 

 










Despite the rough journey Rozek has taken with his first feature, it hasn't slowed down his ambition. He has other scripts he hopes to make, and mentions a film manifesto he's working on that relates to his ideas in “Marianne.” He summed up his aspirations with a declaration one wouldn't necessarily expect from a filmmaker starting out in their 70s: “My goal in doing what I'm doing is to be known before I die as one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived.”

After 24-year-old “American Idol” contestant Josh King was cut from season 23 on May 5, 2025, host Ryan Seacrest revealed the singer's heartwarming connection to his charitable work. 

King has been lauded for trying to sacrifice his spot in the top seven so 16-year-old Mattie Pruitt could advance, and it turns out those kinds of acts of kindness are common from the Charlotte, North Carolina, native. 

In an Instagram video posted on May 7, Seacrest's charitable foundation shared that long before auditioning for “American Idol,” King was regularly volunteering at Charlotte's Levine Children's Hospital in its Seacrest Studios facility, a multimedia broadcast center that opened in 2013 to allow celebrity guests and young patients perform, interact and create fun content for patients. 

Captioning the video, the Ryan Seacrest Foundation wrote, “Josh King may be saying goodbye to the @AmericanIdol stage, but his music journey is far from over 🎤💫 When he's not performing for millions, he's bringing music, laughter and light to patients at @LevineChildrens through ‘Tunes at Two' in #SeacrestStudios. We can't wait to see where his talent takes him next”

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest Foundation (@ryanfoundation)

The Ryan Seacrest Foundation's social media video showed a conversation between Seacrest and King at his audition for “American Idol,” which took place last fall but aired in early March. King revealed that he started volunteering at Seacrest Studios in 2017, after his sister experienced “complications” that landed her in the hospital. 

King told Seacrest that he would perform each Tuesday afternoon for patients, explaining, “I go in, I set my piano up, I'd play for an hour, we called it Tuesday Tunes at Two. And, you know, you have kids come down from their rooms, and they would watch and listen.”

Seacrest, whose foundation has built similar studios at more than a dozen children's hospitals across the U.S., chimed in, “But it gives them something to (help them) forget about what they're going through.”

“It does, and that's exactly why I did it,” King replied. 

“And they smile and laugh and have fun, and they sing along,” Seacrest added.

King called it a “very rewarding experience” and told Seacrest, “I enjoyed it so much, just being able to have that opportunity just to do something good for the community.” 

The video showed King playing his keyboard at Seacrest Studios throughout the years, as well as cards kids and staff at the hospital made for him after he made it through to Hollywood. 

Telling King his generosity was “amazing,” Seacrest said, “You're making a lot of kids and staff happy.” 

A post shared by Charlotte Douglas Intl Airport (@cltairport)

The video of King, who has also been a volunteer piano player at Charlotte's Douglas International Airport for several years, was flooded with comments from fans who were touched by his acts of kindness. 

One wrote, “Ooh wow!!! This is so amazing,, crying happy tears! Josh is so talented and such a kind person! (He's funny too!) Blessings follow those who Bless others. Looking forward to an album in the near future 🤞🏼🙏🏼💯💯💯💙💙💙”

Another weighed in, “This is very heartwarming! He's such a talented, sweet young man. God knows his heart and has good things in store for him! ❤️🙏🏻”

King, who emotionally shared on “American Idol” that he had few friends back home and cherished the friendships he made on the show, wrote on Instagram after his elimination, “This show saved me, and I hope y'all understand just how much it means to me to be a part of it.” 

“The production and crew were also freaking amazing to work with,” he continued. “We would not have American Idol without every single one of them behind the scenes holding the chaos together. This show can be intense at times, but they are VERY good at what they do. It was awesome as a contestant knowing that they were behind us every step of the way, and I can never thank them enough for that.”

Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat and more stars are also featured on the movie's companion album.

	The race to ROSÉ‘s new song is over, with the BLACKPINK star unveiling “Messy” for the F1 soundtrack, along with an accompanying music video, on Thursday (May 8).


	In the sleek visual, the New Zealand-born performer walks through various nighttime cityscapes, strutting down a glistening street past a crowd of people and leaning over the terrace of a high-rise building in between shots of footage from the F1 movie. “Baby, let's get messy, let's get all the way undone/ Come over and chase me like I've never been touched,” she belts over piano and anthemic percussion, sitting on the floor of a blue-lit room as confetti rains down on her. “Baby, I'm obsessed with you, and there's no replica/ If it's messy, then you know it's really love.”

	











	“Messy” is just one of several songs that will appear on the F1 soundtrack, which Atlantic Records announced May 1. Similarly, ROSÉ is only one of many A-list stars who contributed to the project, with Ed Sheeran, Tate McRae, RAYE, Burna Boy, Roddy Rich, Dom Dolla, Chris Stapleton, Tiësto, Sexyy Red, Myke Towers, Madison Beer, Peggy Gou and more musicians also lending their talents to the album.

	Don Toliver and Doja Cat also released a single for F1, “Lose My Mind,” in late April. 


	Starring Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Damson Idris, the Joseph Kosinski-directed film will hit theaters June 27, the same day its full soundtrack drops.


	For ROSÉ, “Messy” marks her first release since her debut solo album, Rosie, arrived in December and reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200. The LP featured smash hit “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars, which spent 12 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200. 


	The K-pop star is now gearing up to reunite with her BLACKPINK bandmates for the first time since their Born Pink trek concluded in 2023, with ROSÉ teasing back in February that they had new music in the works around the same time the girl group announced that a world tour was slated for this summer. Three of the members — ROSÉ, JENNIE and LISA — were in attendance at the 2025 Met Gala in New York City Monday (May 5).

Ed and Lorraine Warren have one final case to crack in the iconic “The Conjuring” franchise. The paranormal investigating duo, portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, first appeared onscreen in 2013; now 12 years and a slew of spinoff films later, the original “The Conjuring” will close out with “The Conjuring: The Last Rites.”

Michael Chaves returns to direct “The Last Rites.” In total, the franchise has three “Conjuring” films, three “Annabelle” features, two “Nun” movies, and “The Curse of La Llorona.” Chaves helmed “La Llorona,” “The Nun II,” and “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.” A “Conjuring” series is in development at Max as well.

“The Last Rites” is set in the mid-1980s when the Warrens were retired. However, the couple returns for one last case involving the Smurl family. The Warrens most famously investigated the 1976 hauntings in Amityville, New York, which inspired the “Amityville Horror” franchise.

Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy are portraying Ed and Lorraine's daughter Judy Warren and her boyfriend, Tony Spera. Steve Coulter is returning as Father Gordon, with Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Kíla Lord Cassidy, Beau Gadsdon, John Brotherton, and Shannon Kook co-starring. Chaves directs from a screenplay by Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, with a story by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, James Wan. The film is based on characters created by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, and inspired by true events.  

Director Chaves told Entertainment Weekly that there was a discussion of including all of the prior “Conjuring” villains for an “Avengers: Endgame”-inspired final film. “Even as we were developing it, we were throwing a bunch of ideas out: ‘How shamelessly big can we make it?' ‘How epic can we make it?' ‘Is this the culmination of all the demons coming to face them?,'” Chaves said. “I felt strongly that the biggest, most emotional story we could tell was the most personal story.”

Producer Wan, who also directed the first two “Conjuring” films, agreed that it was best to center the feature solely on Farmiga and Wilson's characters. “The beating heart of this franchise is Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson playing Ed and Lorraine,” Wan said. “The family dynamic, the faith the characters have, and the faith that they have in each other are really the things that drive this particular franchise. I do think that's what people love about it. At least for me and [producer] Peter Safran, it's really about finding a way to tell the stories of these characters and to wrap them up in a way that feels respectful to where we started with them.”

 










Farmiga teased that “The Last Rites” is actually “different than the others” in terms of the preceding films. “The other three were about hauntings, and this one is about reckoning, in a way,” she said. Farmiga previously worked closely with the real-life Lorraine Warren before she died in 2019. Farmiga posted a tribute at the time saying that Lorraine Warren was a “dear friend” who “touched my life.”

“The Last Rites” is executive produced by Michael Clear, Judson Scott, Natalia Safran, John Rickard, Hans Ritter, and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick.

Warner Bros. Discovery will release “The Conjuring: The Last Rites” in theaters Friday, September 5. Check out the teaser below.

	Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump has been busy triggering constitutional crises, setting due process and other basic rights on fire, rocking the U.S. economy with a trade war based on horrifically bad math, wielding the Justice Department and other agencies to target his political enemies, and bringing a level of lawlessness and corruption to the federal government not seen since, well, maybe ever — all while his lieutenants work around to clock to grant him the authoritarian powers of a mad “king.”


	He has also, in the words of one White House official, been consuming “an insane amount of candy — just so much candy.”


	It is fairly common knowledge that Trump is such an avid guzzler of Diet Coke that he had a “Diet Coke button” installed on the Resolute Desk in the White House's Oval Office. Something many of his voters and biggest fans might not even know about their favorite “dictator” on “day one” is that Trump — according to various current and former administration officials and campaign aides, as well as other informal advisers and friends — is a longtime, self-described “candy addict.”

	











	During both of his administrations and on his presidential campaigns, seven sources attest, Trump has ensured that there is plenty of candy surrounding him. In his two presidencies, he has had aides keep bowls, or baskets, filled with different types of candy — Tootsie Rolls, Reese's, caramels, Life Savers, M&Ms, Starburst, Hershey's, Mars bars, Milky Ways, the works — around the West Wing. At times, there's a bowl or basket of candy right outside the Oval Office, and he'll summon close aides to bring it into the Oval whenever he has a craving. 


	The president, who describes himself as a lifelong teetotaler, at times jokingly refers to his candy as “my alcohol,” according to three of the sources. In summoning the candy during his two different stints in the White House, Trump has been known to shout things like, “Bring me the alcohol!” or “Gimme the alcohol.”

	For years, certain top aides assumed the rotating role of, in the words of two sources close to Trump, the “candy people,” so that Trump can have fast, easy access to his treats. As president, Trump has made a point of making light of his candy habit, while unwrapping and snacking on sweets, to senior administration officials and other allies during any number of high-stakes policy meetings, including some that involved discussing potential bombing targets and military response plans or Covid-19 death tolls, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter say.

	











	Some of these current and former Trump officials say that the president also sometimes stress-eats his candy. One former senior adviser recalls Trump eating an “unusually big” amount of candy during his monthslong crusade to overturn the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden.


	“He eats a ton of candy,” another former senior Trump aide summarizes.


	On March 10, weeks before Trump launched a massive new trade war on his so-called “Liberation Day,” the president met in the Oval Office with Art Laffer, a famous Reaganite economist who's been an informal adviser and friend to Trump for years. Laffer says it was an hourlong sit-down to discuss economic policy and a wide range of other topics.


	Laffer tells Rolling Stone that upon arriving in the Oval Office, as they were each sitting down at the Resolute desk, the president asked him: “Do you like Tootsie Rolls?” At this time, Trump was brandishing what Laffer calls a “big candy basket.”


	“It had a lot of stuff. He was digging in it,” he recounts. “He threw me two Tootsie Rolls, flipped them right across the desk.”

	Trump also asked, “Oh, do you like Milk Duds?” before slipping the economist a “tiny box of Milk Duds.” Laffer says that later in the meeting, he “somehow” ended up with “some caramels,” though he can't be sure if or when the president slid those his way. “He was eating candy, too, of course,” he says. “It was very charming.” 


	“He says to me: ‘You know, there are some people who are addicted to alcohol. But I'm addicted to candy.' I said to him — jokingly — that ‘I'm addicted to both!'”


	The president chuckled in response, Laffer notes.


	Reached for comment on Wednesday, the Trump White House's staff was not amused — or were they?


	“While President Trump is working tirelessly every day to work on behalf of the American people to make America great again, there are fake news outlets like Rolling Stone that seem more interested in peddling falsehoods and fabricating stories. That's why nobody reads them anymore and they are rated lower than Candy Corn,” says Steven Cheung, Trump's White House communications director.


	Trump — who now leads an international movement of right-wing authoritarianism — and his sweet tooth have been alluded to in past testimonials.


	For instance, in January 2018, The Washington Post reported on how then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) acted as “Trump's fixer, friend, and candy man,” and had noticed that “when the president reached for a handful of Starbursts … the president was careful to pluck out and eat two flavors: cherry and strawberry.”

	The Post adds that days after picking up on Trump's preference, McCarthy — eager to suck up — “bought a plentiful supply of Starbursts and asked a staffer to sort through the pile, placing only those two flavors in a jar. McCarthy made sure his name was on the side of the gift, which was delivered to a grinning Trump, according to a White House official.”


	Not everybody in the upper ranks of the second Trump administration, though, feels the same way about candy as the president does. Last month, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services, told Trump during a televised Cabinet meeting that he was working on barring food-stamp recipients from using their benefits to buy candy.

	For years, no one really knew what went on behind the scenes at the Met Gala. After everyone walks the carpet, the night carries on without as many cameras. Every now and then, a bathroom selfie will emerge, or a sneak peek at whoever led the surprise performance. But there was more content than usual coming out of the 2025 Met Gala, much to the distress of Sabrina Carpenter‘s father, who would have preferred not to see his pop star daughter being fed a cherry by Usher.


	“? Weird,” Carpenter's father texted her, sharing an image of the playful moment that occurred far beyond the carpet. The singer shared a screenshot of their text exchange in an Instagram photo dump from the night. It also included images of the custom Louis Vuitton bodysuit she wore on the carpet, her afterparty outfit, and shots with Jenna Ortega and Chappell Roan. The screenshot was the final image in the slide — the cherry on top.

	“Apologies Mr Carpenter 😅🍒,” Usher commented beneath the post. The musician is used to getting people riled up, playfully or otherwise. In 2023, he serenaded Keke Palmer during his Las Vegas residency, which caused her then-boyfriend to have a public crash-out of epic proportions. Later that year, Usher considered serenading Gabrielle Union, too, but decided it wasn't worth going head to head with her husband. “Y'know, this is Dwyane Wade — I ain't crazy,” he said at the time. “That man will knock my whole head off and then dunk it.”

	Carpenter has bolstered her pop star brand with playful and flirty encounters of her own, like her retired “Nonsense” outros and the “Juno” and “Bed Chem” positions she replaced them with on tour. “You have to know how to read to understand what she's saying,” her choreographer Jasmie Badie told Rolling Stone last year. “You have to know what innuendos are. You have to know what synonyms are. You have to know what symbolism is.”

	But there's depth in Carpenter's work, too. In 2023, she shared her fifth studio album, Emails I Can't Send, the title track of which addressed a complicated moment in her relationship with her father. “This song reminds me of my childhood,” she told Rolling Stone at the time. “I think anytime you start to process why you are the way you are, maybe because of things that happened in your childhood, it's always a sad realization to come to. It's also sad when you grow up and the characters in the storybooks were not who you thought they were.”

	











	When Vogue recently asked Carpenter how she presented the song to her dad, she said: “Sure as hell did not play it for him in person. I sent it to my mother first. There were definitely feelings involved. But you birthed me, so you kind of have to deal with the repercussions.”

The "Espresso" singer had previously shared her father's reaction to the moment.

Usher has jokingly apologized to Sabrina Carpenter's dad following a viral photo from the 2025 Met Gala that showed the R&B star feeding the “Espresso” singer a cherry during his performance.


	“Apologies Mr Carpenter,” Usher commented Wednesday (May 7) on Carpenter's Instagram post in apparent tongue-in-cheek fashion alongside sweating and cherry emojis. The apology was made on the singer's photo carousel showing her night at the Met Gala, one of which included a screenshot of her father's reaction to Usher feeding his daughter a cherry.

	











	“? Weird,” David Carpenter texted Sabrina with the photo. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Fans chimed in about her dad's text in the comments as well. “Okay last slide is CLASSIC dad text,” one person wrote. 


	Usher had surprised the lucky attendees inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night with a performance alongside Stevie Wonder. 


According to Vogue, Usher performed “U Don't Have to Call,” “Yeah!,” “OMG” and “Another Star” with Wonder. It's unclear when exactly the singer went into his cherry trick with Carpenter, which has been a staple of the 46-year-old's shows since his Las Vegas residency.


	“It started with strawberries in Vegas,” he explained on The Jennifer Hudson Show earlier this year. “So, you know, I just figured we try all the fruits until we figured out which one works the best. But cherries were something that I felt was fun and just kind of active. It was a bit erotic.”


	Carpenter rocked a sleek maroon Louis Vuitton body suit at the Met Gala, and then hit some afterparties in a black Louis Vuitton suit and a fur coat alongside her “Taste” music video co-star Jenna Ortega and Chappell Roan.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema have set a Dec. 17, 2027 theatrical release for The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. 


	Currently Disney has an untitled Star Wars movie in Comscore on that that 2027 date, but that probably hasn't been scrubbed from the system yet. As we know, Shawn Levy's Star Wars: Starfighter with Ryan Gosling is dated for May 28, 2027. Universal has an untitled date reservation for Dec. 22, 2027. 


	That's the corridor by the way that previous Peter Jackson directed Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies have bowed within. The first of the two films The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum (*WT) will be directed by and star Andy Serkis in the title role.

	The Oscar-winning team behind the blockbuster The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, are reuniting to produce two new films from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth for Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. Zane Weiner is also producing. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Walsh and Boyens are writing the screenplay, along with Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou. 


	The pic will be executive produced by Ken Kamins, with Serkis and The Imaginarium's Jonathan Cavendish. 


	The news for Hunt for Gollum comes in the wake of Warner Bros Discovery's Q1 results which grew streaming subs and profit. 


	The entire Lord of the Rings and Hobbit live-action movies through six titles have grossed over $5.9 billion for Warner Bros/New Line. 


	Warners made a go at taking the Lord of the Rings franchise into the anime space last December, but it didn't go well with Kenji Kamiyama's The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim grossing only $20.6M worldwide.

Sabrina Carpenter had the best reaction when a person online wasn't too please please pleased with her 2025 Met Gala look.


	In a post on X Wednesday (May 7) — two days after she walked the red carpet at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art for this year's event — the pop star hilariously responded to a critic who'd written that her leggy Louis Vuitton jumpsuit was a “perfect example of how dressing against your body type can go horribly wrong.”


	“The stuffy collar is making her neck look constricted and short,” the person had added. “Not to mention, the sleeves look very stuffy, and the tailoring is completely off, so removing the sleeves shifts focus back to her waist.”


	Suggesting that Carpenter should have removed the sleeves of her brown suit jacket and added a jumpsuit and pinstriped pants to the look, the critic also shared an edited photo rendering what they thought the “Espresso” singer should have worn instead — after which Carpenter reshared the post on her own account with her reaction.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“damn i f–ked up..” the Grammy winner joked.


	But even though you can't make everyone happy, Carpenter's look Monday (May 5) was a favorite of many people's (and Billboard‘s). Featuring a white collar and long coattails that trailed behind her, the look was designed by LV Men's Creative Director Pharrell Williams, who also co-chaired the 2025 Met alongside A$AP Rocky, Colman Domingo and Lewis Hamilton.


	“I'm a massive fan of Pharrell and have been to the [Louis Vuitton] show, and I was just like, ‘If I could go this year with him, that would be my dream,'” she told Vogue on the Met red carpet Monday. “And it came true! And he was like, ‘You're quite short, so no pants for you.' So here we are!”


	The night marked Carpenter's third Met, with the Girl Meets World alum first attending in 2022. Two years later, she attended once again and posed on the red carpet with then-boyfriend Barry Keoghan.


	In the year since, the “Taste” musician has scored her first-ever No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with Short n' Sweet, which dropped in August. She spent much of the fall and early months of 2025 touring in support of the album, first in North America followed by Europe.

Attendees of the 78th Cannes Film Festival are still anxiously awaiting the official schedule rollout (it's supposed to happen any day now), but they were treated to more films added to the lineup Thursday morning. The latest additions complete the official selections for 2025, with the festival kicking off Tuesday, May 13 with “Leave One Day” by Amélie Bonnin, as previously announced.

There's been much speculation as to whether or when Chinese filmmaker Bi Gan‘s (“Long Day's Journey Into Night”) “Resurrection” would make the cut. It was long pegged as a shoo-in for Cannes (including on IndieWire's own wish list), while reports said the sci-fi epic was racing to the finish. Last week, a placeholder for the film on the official Cannes website was leaked online and distributed across the social media platform X.

Thierry Frémaux and his programming team finally added “Resurrection,” which will vie in the official competition alongside films like Lynne Ramsay's “Die, My Love,” Wes Anderson's “The Phoenician Scheme,” and Ari Aster's “Eddington.” This brings the competition total to 22 films. 

Bi's film stars Taiwanese-Hong Kong film legend Shu Qi as a woman who, in a post-apocalyptic far future, undergoes a brain surgery that acquaints her with an android whom she begins to develop feelings for. Bi's 2018 “Long Day's Journey Into Night” incorporated 3D camerawork in its final stretch, and it world-premiered in Un Certain Regard. “Resurrection” looks to be another ambitious epic that spans genres and filmmaking modes.

Also added to the lineup as a special screening is Eugene Jarecki's documentary “The Six Billion Dollar Man.” It was pulled from Sundance earlier this year due to “unexpected developments” in the story in its portrait of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange facing a possible 175 years in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes.

Other additions out of competition include Martin Bourboulon's “13 Jours, 13 Nuits,” an epic about the evacuation of 600 people out of the French embassy during the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Lise Akoka and Romane Gueret's “Ma Frére,” about childhood friends in a working-class Paris neighborhood, was added in the Cannes Premiere section.

Cannes brass says the schedule will be unveiled on Thursday.

Owen Wilson is getting his second chance by way of Apple TV+. The actor is leading sports comedy series “Stick,” which he also executive produces. Wilson stars as Pryce Cahill, an over-the-hill, ex-pro golfer whose career was derailed 20 years ago amid a scandal. Yet Pryce finds a career resurgence thanks to scouting (and coaching and caddying for) a 17-year-old golf phenom (Peter Dager). The duo might be an unlikely pair on the green, but will this save Pryce both personally and professionally? 

The official synopsis reads: “After the collapse of his marriage and getting fired from his job at an Indiana sporting goods store, Pryce hedges his bets, and future, entirely on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom named Santi (Dager).” The series is billed as being a “heartfelt, feel-good sports comedy about a found family and their relationships set within the world of golf as it has never been shown before.”

Marc Maron, Mariana Treviño, Lilli Kay, Judy Greer, and Timothy Olyphant co-star. Real-life golf superstars Collin Morikawa, Keegan Bradley, Max Homa, and Wyndham Clark make guest appearances, with additional cameos from broadcasters Jim Nantz and Trevor Immelman, Good Good's Matt Scharff, Brad Dalke, and Garrett Clark, and golf enthusiast Dan Rapaport. 

“Stick” is created and executive produced by Jason Keller, who also is the showrunner. Ben Silverman for Propagate Content, Entertainment 360's Guymon Casady, Howard T. Owens, Rodney Ferrell, Drew Buckley, Lee Eisenberg, Natalie Sandy, Christopher Moynihan, Bill Callahan, Valerie Faris, Jonathan Dayton, and Jaffar Mahmood executive produce. Faris, Dayton and Mahmood also serve as directors along with David Dobkin, M.J. Delaney, and John Hamburg.

The sports comedy space has surged thanks to the success of other Apple TV+ series “Ted Lasso.” This year also includes the premiere of “Happy Gilmore 2” with Adam Sandler back as the titular hockey player turned golf star. Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and more return to the roles they started in 1996 for the sequel. 

Glen Powell is getting into the game of sports series as well with “Chad Powers,” which is inspired by Eli Manning's former sketch series. Powell co-created (and co-wrote the pilot episode for) the half-hour Hulu comedy with Michael Waldron, who also executive produces. Powell plays the title character who goes quasi-undercover as a college quarterback. The logline reads: “When bad behavior nukes hotshot QB Russ Holliday's college career, he disguises himself and walks onto a struggling Southern football team as the talented, affable Chad Powers.”

 










“Stick” premieres on Apple TV+ June 4 with three episodes, followed by one new episode weekly every Wednesday through July 23. Check out the trailer below.

Grammy winner Michael Bublé hopes to pull off another win on season 27 of “The Voice” as his three remaining team members compete on the live shows beginning May 12, 2025. But even as Bublé helps them get ready to compete, he has also found time to help season 26 winner Sofronio Vasquez launch his music career.  

Late on May 7, Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing he'd just reunited in Los Angeles with his former coach, captioning their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. we skipped dessert because we are on diet LOL 😂” 

In a second Instagram post, Vasquez shared a funny video they took before their lunch, when Bublé pretended he had forgotten his wallet until Vasquez pointed out he could see it in his back pocket. Both posts thrilled fans, who are so relieved to see Vasquez still receiving encouragement and direction from his coach. 

A post shared by Sofronio Vasquez III (@sofroniovasquez)

Fans were thrilled to see that Bublé has continued his relationship with Vasquez, who became the show's first Filipino champion in mid-December. Originally from the Philippines, 32-year-old Vasquez moved to the U.S. to pursue a music career and attend school in Utica, New York, per the Los Angeles Times. 

One person wrote on Vasquez's selfie post, “You're starting to look alike!😂 twinning!”

Another chimed in, “I love how you have genuine beautiful friendship on and off the show! What a true blessing you are to each other!!! ❤️❤️❤️

As the winner of season 26, Vasquez won a recording contract and $100,000 prize, according to American Songwriter. But just as valuable, Vasquez acknowledged, was receiving continued mentorship from Bublé, whom he said told him, “You're going to be working your ass off, and I'm going to be with you.”

Vasquez hit the ground running after his December win, booking concerts in the U.S. and in the Philippines, where he's become a bit of a hero. 

He told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.”

Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee. 

On June 14, he'll perform a concert in Utica with several of his peers from “The Voice” joining him onstage, including his runner-up Shye and another finalist, Sydney Sterlace, per WKTV. Vasquez hopes to have an album out soon, too, with help from Bublé's team.

	At least 10 Les Miserables cast members are expected to boycott a June 11 performance of the musical at the Kennedy Center, which President Donald Trump is planning to attend.


	Following the controversies at the once-prestigious Washington, D.C. performing arts center since Trump appointed himself chairman, CNN reports that the musical's cast was given the choice of whether or not to perform that night, with the performance doubling as a big-ticket fundraiser for the Kennedy Center.


	At least 10 to 12 actors have opted to skip the June 11 performance, including both major cast members as well as members of the ensemble. Trump — a noted fan of the musical who previously used Les Mis music (without permission, of course) on the campaign trail in 2016 — is expected to attend the June 11 performance, which will follow a VIP reception where sponsorship levels cost between $100,000 to $2 million.

	Trump ally Richard Grennell, who was appointed as the Kennedy Center's president after Trump gutted the existing Board of Trustees, told CNN of the actors' boycott, “Any performer who isn't professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won't be welcomed. In fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they shouldn't hire – and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience. The Kennedy Center wants to be a place where people of all political stripes sit next to each other and never ask who someone voted for but instead enjoys a performance together.”

	











	Following Trump's self-appointment as Kennedy Center chairman, at least 26 performances have been canceled, including 15 by the scheduled acts themselves. Issa Rae cancelled her Feb. 14 show, citing “an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums.” On Feb. 13, Low Cut Connie, the Philadelphia rock and soul band fronted by Adam Weiner, cancelled their March 19 concert.

	Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeffrey Seller were supposed to bring Hamilton to the Kennedy Center in 2026, but cancelled the run, saying, “The Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we're not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center. We're just not going to be part of it.” A concert by the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington was also canceled, as were several events planned around Pride Month.

	











	In March, Guster protested the changes at the Kennedy Center — which included the cancelation of performances of the LGBTQ+ musical Finn — by having that show's cast appear onstage during their concert at the performing arts venue.

“Forever” opens with a familiar scene — not to those who've read Judy Blume's 1975 novel, the inspiration for the eight-episode Netflix series, but to anyone who's parented (or been) a teenager. It's New Year's Eve, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr.) wants to go to a party. His father, Eric (Wood Harris), is open to it, but his mother, Dawn (Karen Pittman), all but shuts them down. The trio squabble for a minute, Justin is sent to his room, and then Dad appears with good news: So long as he follows a few agreed-upon rules, he can go to the party.

 










Within this routine moment, showrunner and episode writer Mara Brock Akil lends the conversation specific freshness and urgency without losing its relatability or tipping into histrionics. Dawn's concerns are rooted in fear: fear of the unknown, given that Justin doesn't know where the party is or even who's throwing it, but also fear of what they, as a Black family living in Los Angeles, know all too well. “We got cops out here shooting Black boys like it's open season,” she says. When Justin replies flippantly, she adds, “It's that mouth of yours. That shit's going to get you thrown in jail or worse — dead.” “Might as well let me live before I die then, right?,” Justin says.

As the moms and dads out there may have guessed, that's the line that gets Justin sent to his room, but it's also the line that sets the series' central tension. “Forever,” on its face, is a classic high school love story. When Justin goes to the party, he meets Keisha (Lovie Simone), and they fall for each other. Their ensuing romance consists of the same euphoric highs, irksome misreadings, and fiery arguments seen in any other hormone-afflicted affair of the heart. 

But along with the central couple's cozy chemistry and dynamic performances (as well as the overall cast, whose rich characterizations go a long way toward grounding the show without sacrificing entertainment value), “Forever” distinguishes itself by framing its interpersonal conflicts between the ephemeral and enduring impact of time. Justin and Keisha want to live now. Their parents (their moms, mostly) want them to live for the future. Life is spent learning to balance both — savoring today while protecting tomorrow — and how “Forever” depicts that seesaw through its couple's rocky, passionate, year-long journey provides the adaptation a clear sense of purpose — and permanence.

 










Justin is the quiet, shy, secluded type. The first scene shows him sitting in his room, alone, trying to write an English paper, and the first word we hear him say is a frustrated, “Fuck!” He can't focus. He gets a few sentences written, but then he's back on his phone, or hiding under the covers, or shooting his mini basketball into his mini basketball hoop. Justin's struggles aren't environmental; he's not a slacker who just wants to goof off. He's screaming at the mostly blank screen in front of him because he can't concentrate long enough to get his thoughts down. 

But that's not all Justin is — his struggle or his first impression. He's an enthusiastic member of the basketball team who trains hard and loves the game. He can be cocky when he's flirting and feeling good, just like he can be closed-off when he's rejected and feeling down. His emotions may slide quickly from one extreme to another, but what teen's don't? Cooper anchors his character in fragility — you always get the sense he's one wrong word away from sinking into himself — but he leaves himself room to be smooth and charming when it counts.

Keisha is, in many ways, the opposite. While Justin only has one real friend, Keisha has a best friend, a circle of friends, and a close community to fall back on. While Justin's family is extremely well-off — they live in a mansion with a backyard and a pool in the hills above Beverly Hills — Keisha takes multiple buses just to get home from their first date. She lives in a rented apartment in Hyde Park with her single mother, Shelly (Xosha Roquemore), who works multiple jobs to keep her daughter in school and a roof over their heads.

 










Even with Justin's point-blank references to “Romeo & Juliet” in the opening scene, their relationship isn't solely contingent on the old adage that opposites attract — nor is Keisha's identity solely in response to Justin's. They both share a passion for fitness. (She's a track star working day and night to land a scholarship to Howard University.) They both love anime (like the “Naruto” movies and manga). They vibe with each other's music. Keisha, though, is an excellent student. She's stubborn and confident in a way Justin can't be, and her maturity comes through in a pragmatic/pessimistic blend that's beyond her years. 

Simone crafts a beaming, affable presence, but what really sets her performance apart is how convincing she is when Keisha lowers her guard. Like so many teens, Keisha often fronts like she's got it all under control in order to hide just how untethered she feels inside. She worries about money, she worries about rumors, she worries about school, sure, but she also worries she's all alone, despite ample support around her. How subtly Simone hones in on that feeling is what really cements her character's connection to Justin, a classic Los Angeles lonely boy, and we spot their ineffable bond in big, gushy moments and little, fleeting ones, too. 

 










After Justin and Keisha's New Year's Eve meet-cute, things almost immediately go awry. Then they get better, and then they go awry again. And again. And again. “Forever” is, by and large, an easily digestible, engaging, and enjoyable hourlong drama, but it can be taxing when the couple's continuous conflicts overwhelm their lighthearted courtship. There's too much fighting and too little fun, especially in the first half of the season, which indicates there's simply not enough genuine conflict to sustain eight hours of story. 

Still, Brock Akil uses those disagreements and misunderstandings to explore pertinent topics. Texting and social media are prominent across Justin and Keisha's lives. They're constantly texting, so any pause evokes doubt and confusion (like when those “…” never turn into an actual message). They're on Instagram all the time, where seemingly innocent posts can wreak emotional chaos if seen from a slighted vantage point. They share music and make music, they do homework and pretend to do homework, they build social circles and tear them down, all on their computers or phones. Justin and Keisha's lives are online, and “Forever” respects the power of that connection, good or bad, sought or spurned.

At the same time, “Forever” makes room for understanding that only comes with age. While embedded in the lives of its lovestruck teens, Brock Akil casts the parents' perspective over Justin and Keisha's story like an ever-present cloud. Sometimes it's stormy, like when Dawn's domineering nature or Shelly's exhausted pleas rain down in ways that send their kids scurrying. But sometimes it's a much-needed shade, like when Eric gives a fantastic speech about the difference between protecting yourself and hiding from pain. 

 










Harris is having a ball as the fun but sage father, and Pittman adds a tangible tenor of heart to her concerned mom's stringent commands. If anything, there's nearly too much time ceded to her fears for how little we get to know about her background (and for how few of her worries are realized), but this is yet another story of young love that greatly benefits from strong adult characters.

All-too-present adults aren't always so beneficial. Over the years since its release, Blume's book has regularly been banned from libraries or challenged by overprotective parents. Nevermind that its honest, empathetic depictions of sex can help ease anxieties for anyone first-approaching one of life's most daunting shared experiences — who would want teens to feel safe when they're at their most vulnerable? 

Well, Brock Akil, for one. Recognizing that in 2018, the physical act is less mysterious than it was in 1975 — when the internet wasn't an easily accessible resource for any question that comes to mind — the show's love scenes focus on the tricky, evolving emotions felt before, during, and after hooking up more than the actions themselves. In doing so, “Forever” captures the book's original spirit while keeping its focus squarely on the modern day.

The same can be said for the series as a whole. While taking major departures from Blume's plot, Brock Akil stays true to its compassion, thoughtfulness, and message. Like love itself, “Forever” should be easily recognizable, but there's still plenty to discover.

 










“Forever” premieres Thursday, May 8 on Netflix. All eight episodes will be released at once.

Dakota Johnson has the toughest job in the world for her latest film, “Materialists“: The actress has to decide between marrying Chris Evans or Pedro Pascal. The trio lead Celine Song‘s sophomore A24 film, which of course is about a love triangle — much like Song's Oscar-nominated drama “Past Lives.”

The logline for “Materialists” reads: “A young, ambitious New York City matchmaker (Johnson) finds herself torn between the perfect match (Pascal) and her imperfect ex (Evans).” But there are no “Emma” Austenian parallels here: The film is firmly rooted in being an ode to classic 2000s NYC-set romantic dramedies, many of which Evans actually starred in at the time (“What's Your Number?” remains a criminally underrated Evans performance.)

Zoe Winters, Marin Ireland, Dasha Nekrasova, and Louisa Jacobson co-star in “Materialists.” The trailer also includes an original song by Japanese Breakfast.

Christine Vachon's Killers Films produces “Materialists” along with David Hinojosa, Pamela Koffler, and Song. Killers Films also had produced Song's “Past Lives.” 

“Materialists” star Johnson recently said during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that she “really loved” bonding with Evans and Pascal while filming the feature. “It's one of those special moments, and I think in my work, every moment I felt so inspired and so connected to both of those dudes [Evans and Pascal] and everyone on that set,” she said. “It was a wonderful experience.” She also told IndieWire that Song is a “masterful filmmaker” and she was “very grateful” to be cast in “Materialists.” 

In addition to “Materialists,” Johnson, Evans, and Pascal all have a full slate of projects. Johnson will lead the open marriage comedy “Splitsville” with “Hit Man” breakout Adria Arjona and Michael Covino, who also writes and directs. The Neon film will also be released this year. 

Evans is starring as a BDSM cult leader in Ethan Coen's buzzy “Honey Don't!” alongside Aubrey Plaza and Margaret Qualley. And, of course, Pascal will be making his MCU debut as Mr. Fantastic in “Fantastic Four: First Steps.” The actor appears in “Freaky Tales” and “The Uninvited,” as well as returns for “The Last of Us” Season 2. Pascal and Evans have another overlap there: Evans iconically starred as Johnny Storm in the first “Fantastic Four” franchise iteration; Joseph Quinn now takes on the character opposite Pascal's Mr. Fantastic, who is Storm's brother-in-law. 

 










A24 is releasing in theaters June 13. Check out the trailer below.

EXCLUSIVE: Brendan Fraser (The Whale), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Annie Murphy (Schitt's Creek), Elizabeth Hurley (The Royals) and Josh Gad (Frozen) will lead the voice cast for Tubi‘s new adult animated series Breaking Bear. 


	The series parodies the tropes of mobster dramas, comically combining elements of characters like Yogi Bear with series like The Sopranos. It hails from Julien Nitzberg (The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia), Evoke Entertainment (Creepshow, Twelve Forever, Day of the Dead) and Tom DeLonge's To The Stars Media (Monsters of California, Unidentified).

	Created by Nitzberg, Breaking Bear is billed as “a fur-flying, law-breaking, forest-saving rampage following a dysfunctional family of bears who go full criminal to stop frackers, mobsters, and a psychotic wolf pack from destroying their home. As they spiral deeper into the criminal abyss, they face off against biker gangs, an egomaniacal news anchor, and their own spectacular talent for self-sabotage.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Fraser plays Jer. The oldest of the bear siblings, Jer fancies himself the brains of the operation.  Unfortunately, he's not only wrong – he's lazy, clueless and usually the one getting everyone into hot water.  If there is a wrong move to make, Jer has already made it. 


	Gellar plays Blair. The middle sister and actual brains of the family.  Constantly overlooked, Blair's the one who ends up cleaning up her brothers' messes and keeping the family alive – whether they notice or not. 


	Murphy plays Tawny. A human, she's a gorgeous local news anchor whose number one goal is getting ahead in her field to become the next big national newscaster.  


	Hurley plays Wolf Queen, the fierce and unyielding guardian of the forest. She is locked in a bitter rivalry with the Bears, whose growing presence and destructive ways threaten the land she is sworn to protect, by any means necessary.


	Gad plays Alistar. The baby brother of the family, Alistar swings wildly from adorably anxious to full-on unhinged with zero warning. Push him the wrong way, and this teddy bear turns terrifying.


	“With Brendan, Sarah, Annie, Elizabeth and Josh, we have an incredible cast of series regulars,” said Adam Lewinson, Chief Content Officer at Tubi. “Breaking Bear is our wild, no-holds-barred send-up of classic mob sagas—from Scarface to Goodfellas—as a dysfunctional crew of bears crash headfirst into the world of crime, all in a desperate bid to save their forest. It's bold, it's chaotic, and we're here for every outrageous second.”

	











Breaking Bear is executive produced by DeLonge (Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker), Stan Spry (Creepshow, Day of the Dead), Jeff Holland (Creepshow, Day of the Dead), and Bradford Bricken (Twelve Forever). Fraser, Gellar and Gad also executive produce with Nitzberg, who also serves as showrunner. Series is produced by Evoke Entertainment and DeLOnge's To The Stars Media.

YouTube stars now reach as much people as legacy media — and they're poaching some of the top players to grow even bigger.


							By

	In the shadow of the Disney and Warner Bros. studio lots, a section of airplane fuselage has been repurposed inside of an industrial park near the Burbank airport.


	The section of plane is now a film set, where the popular video creator Dhar Mann uses it to shoot original scripted fare, all embracing his philosophy of trying to “inspire, uplift, and bring a little more positivity into the world.”




	On a brisk April afternoon in Burbank, Mann leads a small caravan of golf carts across his campus, which now totals three buildings and more than 100,000 square feet, with multiple sets for schools, restaurants, a shopping mall, a city street, a courthouse, jail and “rich” and “poor” homes. At any given moment some eight videos are shooting, keeping his staff of nearly 200 busy.

	“In the early days, when we were shooting out of my apartment and we needed different film sets, my dining room was a restaurant, my bedroom was a patient room for a hospital, every single thing in my apartment was used for production sets,” Mann recalls, noting that his apartment furniture still furnishes some of the sets.

	It's a far cry from his current studio, which owns a fleet of cars (including multiple police cars), not to mention that section of airplane.


	“These are real film-level sets. We use the same equipment, we have the same types of resources that the same production companies are doing on TV, well now you're seeing that on YouTube,” he says, adding that his company produces content at what he estimates to be 1/100th the cost of a traditional production.


	A couple of miles away on a tucked-away Burbank street, a pastel-colored classroom has been transformed into a science lab. A producer instructs actors wearing white lab coats and safety goggles to react to something taking place offscreen (a giant “elephant toothpaste” experiment is involved). The scene is for an upcoming episode of Alan's Universe, a scripted series developed by the popular YouTuber Alan Chikin Chow, who watches the takes intently from behind the camera operator.


	Inside his studio building, Chow's K-pop inspired color palette of pinks, purples and blues flow into every room and set, from a locker-filled hallway that mimics a high school, to bedrooms and bathrooms that — bright colors notwithstanding — would be familiar to any teenager.


	“We used to make eight-minute videos. They were very vignette-y, they were not super story driven. I would not say that the earlier episodes are something that you could see on quote, unquote, real television,” says Chow, in a conference room (it also doubles as a conference room set) inside his building. “But now, because of this space, because of the cameras we have, because of the level of storytelling and the detail that we put in our writing, I can definitely say that what we're making now is something that you could have seen as a Disney Channel Original Movie back in the day. There's no difference, really. The level of quality storytelling, detail, world building, is all there.”


	Chow and Mann are part of a new universe of professionalized creators springing up across Los Angeles and around the country, leveraging the reach of their social audiences and the monetization afforded by YouTube to build proper studio businesses. A new studio system being built next to the old one.

	











	And Wall Street and Madison Avenue have taken notice. Both Chow and Mann say that there has been substantial investor interest in their respective businesses, affirming a trend across the sector: Sports creators Dude Perfect raised $100 million in an investment round last year, and MrBeast is seeking to raise $200 million at a $5 billion valuation for his business.


	“All the friends that I have that are creators, they're now buying houses, they're getting married, they're having kids. A lot of those folks are trying to think of, how can I still have a career? I built this amazing YouTube channel, but how could I have some sort of exit event, which allows me to live my life, buy my house, send my kid through college, but also allows me to not lose what I've built,” Mann says. “They want to make more money while still being in control of their business creatively, and not have some media company that has never run a YouTube channel take over and may not understand how digital content works.” 


	Advertisers, meanwhile, are eagerly shifting their budgets toward creator content, acknowledging not only the improving quality of the work, but the relevance among younger consumers.


	“I think everyone has come to recognize that our creators are truly next-gen media companies,” says Brian Albert, a senior YouTube's sales executive. “They're writers, they're producers, they're directors, all wrapped in one.”

	











	On the west side of Manhattan in late March, as the sun set over the Hudson river, many of those top creators gathered at an advertising event hosted by the creator services firm Spotter. The YouTube personalities Colin & Samir hosted, noting how the landscape has changed under the entertainment business' feet.


	“YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said that creators are the startups of Hollywood, and today, a lot of these startups are starting to look more and more like studios,” said Samir Chaudry on stage, as marketers from companies like Uber and Shopify nodded along.


	And increasingly, just as in traditional Hollywood, these studios are beginning to flourish outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


	By now it's well known that MrBeast has turned Greenville North Carolina into a veritable company town, where his over-the-top unscripted concepts come to life; but in Birmingham Alabama, Kinigra Deon is building a scripted entertainment studio of her own.


	“In 2021 I moved [from L.A.] back to Alabama, not to escape from Hollywood, but to build my own Hollywood,” Deon told attendees at the Spotter event.


	And in the sprawling city of Frisco, Texas, just north of Dallas, the sports creators Dude Perfect have built an 80,000 square foot headquarters, including an indoor turf football field (with uprights), a massive basketball court (with motorized nets for elaborate trick shots), a gaming center, gym and offices (with a hidden slide behind a bookshelf to ensure easy access to the first floor). The dudes are also constructing a permanent set for their YouTube variety show Overtime.


	During a recent visit to the facility, with YouTube executives, marketers and local officials exploring the space (many with their kids in tow), the Dudes used a device to blast giant smoke rings above attendees, and gave tours.

	











	“I think people's expectation of a YouTube channel can be very different when stepping into this building,” says Coby Cotton, one of the members of Dude Perfect, in a conference room located just steps from the basketball court and putting green.


	Dude Perfect also owns the building next door, and the company plans to turn it into a production facility that can be used by other creators, with a virtual production set among the plans.


	“This is part one, but that's I think a huge component as well, where others will be able to film and produce content,” says Andrew Yaffe, Dude Perfect's CEO.


	Already, athletes like Tom Brady have come to the space to shoot content for their own social platforms or do a collab video, and Cotton says he expects that to ramp up.


	“Because we're in Dallas where every major athlete and celebrity comes through at some point in a given calendar year for a concert or competition, we hope that Dude Perfect will be a place that they will want to stop by just for fun, maybe bring their kids, shoot a piece of content, thinking of it the way they might already think about a late night show,” he says.


	If the studios are a physical representation of how the creator economy has grown, the offices adjacent to those studios represent how it has matured. On the tour of his Burbank facility, Mann noted how many of his crew members joined from places like Disney and Lionsgate, and that his company's CEO Sean Atkins was previously the president of MTV. At Dude Perfect, Yaffe joined from the NBA, where he led the league's digital efforts as its EVP.

	











	As traditional media tries to survive the tumult impacting its business models, creator studios are becoming in many ways the hot place for media veterans to land.


	“We have a casting director who used to work for Nickelodeon, she was the casting director for The Thundermans,” Chow says. “And sometimes we get pushback from people who are not that open-minded. I always would think, what is the difference? Our casting director is from Nickelodeon, our show was shot with a similar budget to a Nickelodeon show, the build of the world and the scripts are just as good. I think it really comes down to people slowly starting to understand that this is the new era.”


	Atkins, the CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, was one of those people, having left traditional media at MTV and Discovery to serve as the president of the creator-focused firm JellySmack before joining Mann's company.


	“It reminded me of the early days of cable, or the early days of unscripted, where someone has an operational and creative and price advantage, and they generally just move up the value chain over time,” Atkins says of the current moment. “I think the thing that makes these creators different is they were born in a world where they had to do everything. They just have a different mindset.”

	











	Mann is a perfect example. He says that last year, he received an offer to sell his company, but turned it down, betting on himself, and the future of creator-driven content sparked by YouTube, which has paid more than $70 billion out to those uploading videos to its platform.


	“Money was on the table,” Mann recalls. “I just realized, what would I rather do with my life? This is the most amazing career that I could ever dream of.”

The music giant says the new claims about the performance prove that Drake's case is just an "attack on the commercial and creative success of the rap artist who defeated him."


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Universal Music Group wants a federal judge to dismiss Drake's updated defamation lawsuit that complained about Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime performance of “Not Like Us,” arguing he's just upset about a “rap artist who defeated him.”


	Weeks after Drake filed an amended version of his case that claimed the halftime show was intended to “assassinate the character of another artist,” UMG fired back Wednesday – arguing that the new claims about the Super Bowl are as legally faulty as the rest of the case.


	“Drake's new allegations are astonishing,” the music giant's lawyer Rollin Ransom writes. “As Drake concedes, Lamar's Super Bowl performance did not include the lyric that Drake or his associates are ‘certified pedophiles' (i.e., the alleged ‘Defamatory Material' that is at the heart of this case).”

	“The focus of Drake's new claims — that ‘the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever' did not hear Lamar call Drake or his crew pedophiles — betrays this case for what it is: Drake's attack on the commercial and creative success of the rap artist who defeated him, rather than the content of Lamar's lyrics,” Ransom added.


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a high-profile beef with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of suing UMG over the song, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity. The lawsuit, which doesn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleges that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG believes the case is clearly meritless – that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company has pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	During the halftime show, which took place weeks after Drake filed his case, Lamar omitted the word “pedophile.” But after much speculation over whether he'd play the song at all, Kendrick really didn't hold back otherwise – making it the centerpiece of the set and clearly rapping similar lyrics, including: “Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young.”


	In his amended complaint last month, Drake's attorneys argued that the decision to censor the word “pedophile” during the broadcast failed to avoid the song's defamatory meaning – and instead had underscored the rapper's legal case against UMG.


	“Kendrick Lamar would not have been permitted to perform during the Super Bowl Performance unless the word ‘pedophile'… was omitted from the lyrics — that is because nearly everyone understands that it is defamatory to falsely brand someone a ‘certified pedophile',” wrote Drake's attorney Michael Gottlieb.


	But in Wednesday's motion to dismiss the case, UMG argued that Drake's censorship argument was logically flawed.


	“Drake contends that the decision not to include the word ‘pedophiles' … could only reflect that the language is defamatory,” UMG's lawyers write. “But this ignores any number of other explanations for the decision — such as threats by Drake of additional meritless litigation.”


	Wednesday's motion also highlighted that Drake had “removed obviously false factual allegations” from his original complaint, including that UMG directly paid for bots to boost streams of Kendrick's track: “Drake is now reduced to citing a different podcast host who claimed that ‘Kendrick used bots' [and] a now-deleted anonymous X comment accusing Lamar of ‘buying promo.'”


	Drake's lawyers will have a chance to respond to the motion to dismiss in the weeks ahead, and the judge will issue a ruling at some point in the next few months.


	In a statement to Billboard on Thursday, a spokesman for UMG underscored the arguments in the motion to dismiss: “Nowhere in the hundred-plus page ‘legal' blather written by Drake's lawyers do they bother to acknowledge that Drake himself has written and performed massively successful songs containing equally provocative taunts against other artists.  Nor do they mention that it was Drake who started this particular exchange.”


	In the same statement, UMG said Drake's lawyers were chasing “wild conspiracies” about “why one song that upset Drake had massive global appeal,” when in reality the company was “working tirelessly” to promote all of its artists.


	“Our continuing partnership with Drake and his enduring success is a shining example,” the company said in the statement. “Despite his lawyers' attempts to silence other artists and threaten the companies that work with them, we remain committed to propelling Drake's career while maintaining our unwavering support of all our artists' creative expression. Drake's included.”

Sutton Stracke revealed she has spoken to Garcelle Beauvais one time since she announced her exit from “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” in March.

During a May 2025 appearance on Sirius XM's “Jeff Lewis Live,” Stracke said she last spoke to Beauvais on March 25, the day Beauvais announced that she was leaving the Bravo reality show after five seasons.

“We spoke the day that she made her announcement,” Stracke told host Jeff Lewis. “You know she just said, “I couldn't talk to anybody because I knew that you would convince me not to leave.' And yes, that's probably true.”

Beauvais has since unfollowed Stracke and all of the other RHOBH cast members, with the exception of Season 14 “friends of” Jennifer Tilly and Kathy Hilton, on Instagram.

 In the interview with Lewis, Stracke said she loves Beauvais and is “giving her the space she needs.”

“I would never want to hurt Garcelle intentionally, so I'm sorry that she feels that way and I'm sorry that it went down like that,” Stracke said.

“I'm hoping I can rectify things later,” she added. “Sometimes, I think when you're really close with someone and you get hurt in the relationship, you need time away to heal. I'm hoping that we can rectify and fix everything.  I think that down the road, Garcelle and I really need to have a long, thoughtful conversation that's private. I just hate that this has happened. Garcelle was a very good friend, and I love her dearly.”

Stracke previously told Page Six why she decided to give Beauvais “space” amid her RHOBH exit. “Garcelle has chosen to unfollow all of the ‘Housewives,'” Stracke said in April. “I can only imagine that she needs a clean break right now. I love her and am giving her the space she needs.”

In late February, Beauvais walked out of the RHOBH reunion taping without posing for a cast photo. “I'm out,” she said as she walked offstage following the reunion taping.

Backstage, she told production she wanted the cameras off of her. “I'm not doing this anymore. I don't want cameras here,” she said. “And I never say I don't want cameras. I'm always a team player. But this — there's no team.”

“Everybody jumped at me, and I felt like I was on an island by myself,” she said of what went down during the reunion. “I can't be friends with people like that, I can't trust them. I don't trust them, and they obviously don't like me.”

Beauvais announced her exit from the show weeks later via an Instagram video message to fans. “I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” she said in the clip. “It's been a wild ride. I mean,  some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have happened. But it's been a ride nevertheless.”

Beauvais explained that she was leaving the show to focus on family and her acting and producing career.

Twenty-three years and one Broadway musical later, and “Real Women Have Curves” is finally getting its sequel… kind of. “20 Pounds to Happiness,” which is billed as being the “companion piece” to the iconic 2002 Sundance feature led by breakout star America Ferrera, hails from Josefina López, who wrote both the film and Broadway versions of “Real Women Have Curves.”

López collaborates with actress/director Yelyna De León for “20 Pounds to Happiness,” which centers on a “full-figured Latina in a Real Women Have Curves Support Group who must decide between staying loyal to her girlfriends and risk losing the man of her dreams.” Carlo Mendez, Riley Shanahan, Christiana Leucas, Soledad St. Hilaire, Iyari Limon, Rafael Sigler, and Tricia Cruz co-star.

“20 Pounds to Happiness” will screen at the Cannes marketplace with MultiVisionnaire Pictures handling worldwide sales. The feature will debut at the Marché du Film at Cannes with a market screening on Tuesday, May 14 in Screening Room Palais C.

Screenwriter López and director De León serve as producers. This is De León's directorial debut. 

“Real Women Have Curves” began as a play prior to its 2002 feature adaptation. The musical version was released in 2025 with Grammy-winning musician Joy Huerta of Jesse & Joy fame and musical theater songwriter Benjamin Velez penning the songs. 

López told Broadway World that she based the lead character of Ana García on herself, and that the story is still timely more than three decades later. 

“I truly believe the best way to fight hatred and prejudice is to first love yourself for who you are,” she said. “Unfortunately, my play is as relevant today as it was back when I wrote it in 1988 to 1990. Immigrants are still being ‘scapegoated' and persecuted and it seems to be getting worse. […] My original play and screenplay are a microcosm of the Latina immigrant experience, celebrating real women's bodies, the power of women, and the incredible bond that happens when women work together, all of which I feel are topical in our world today. The women I worked with in a small sewing factory in Boyle Heights taught me many valuable life lessons, which I still carry with me to this day. I am so grateful to have my story told on a Broadway stage bringing positive worldwide attention to my beautiful community of Boyle Heights which I am so proud to be a part of with my CASA 0101 Theater where we champion women's and Latinx voices and storytelling. My motto is: Create, Elevate, Celebrate.” 

 










López is also developing a new musical with composer Jaime Lozano, and working on her autobiography, “Real Women Have Courage.” 

“20 Pounds to Happiness” will have its U.S. premiere May 31 at the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival. MultiVisionnaire Pictures is handling worldwide sales. Check out the trailer below.

Zack Wickham confirmed he was not invited to Scheana Shay's 40th birthday party.

“The Valley” star spoke out on the May 6 edition of “Watch What Happens Live,” where he confirmed the diss to host Andy Cohen 

After Cohen wished a happy 40th birthday to Shay, he said, “We love you, Scheana Shay. Scheana Shay, you know, I'm your fan,” the Bravo host added.

He then turned to “Watch What Happens Live” guests Zack Wickham and Michelle Lally and said, “You're flying back to L.A. tomorrow to go the party, both of you?”

“No, not both of us, “Wickham quickly chimed in.

After Wickham confirmed he was not invited to the bash, Cohen asked him, ‘Are you not good with Scheana Shay?”

“No, I mean we are, he said. “We have our ups and downs, and right now we're just like in a [valley].”

Fans reacted to the exchange on social media.

“I guess Scheana and Zack aren't good as gold….” one commenter wrote

Shay replied with, “That made me laugh lol.”

Shay turned 40 years old on May 7.

Wickham and Shay's troubles seemingly started earlier this year. After Shay, Ariana Madix, and Katie Maloney all unfollowed their former “Vanderpump Rules” co-star James Kennedy on Instagram due to a photo of him posing with controversial influencers, the Tate Brothers, Wickham called them out for not unfollowing him after he was accused of assaulting his now-ex Ally Lewber. (Kennedy was never charged and Lewber has said there was no domestic violence.)

“I find it [expletive] that the final straw for you all to unfollow him was when he posted a picture with problematic horrible people, not when he was a problematic horrible person to your friend (and the answer is yes to everyone you think this is about),” Wickham wrote on X in March.

Shay, who appears as a “friend” on “The Valley,” later accused Wickham of saying some disturbing things off-camera.

“You know, he has a colorful way of speaking when he's drunk,” Shay said on the April 18 episode of her Scheananigans podcast. “He had made comments that were not caught on camera. Because of what he said [off camera], it caused his best friend Brittany [Cartwright]  to distance herself from him for many, many months.”

Shay noted that at one point, Wickham tried to apologize to her for things he said.  “[I told him,] ‘It's not the time or place,'” she shared.

Wickham wasn't invited to Shay's 40th, and it's unclear if he made the guest list when she turned 39 in 2024. Shay's 39th birthday took place on the same day that the “Vanderpump Rules” season 11 finale aired on Bravo.

At that time, “The Valley” star Janet Caperna appeared on the “Gabbing With Gib” podcast and stated that “everyone was invited” to Shay's birthday party, despite her friendship problems with some of the cast members from her Bravo reality show.

“We had a beautiful time,” Caperna said. “Scheana was awesome to celebrate. … I know she's going through it a little bit, and there's obviously a lot of changes in friendships and stuff, but that night was just to celebrate her. I know everyone was invited and I think, you know, everybody tried to make it.”

Voice of America (VOA), which began broadcasting in 1942 to fight Nazi propaganda during World War II, will be fed coverage from right-wing cable network One America News (OAN), announced Kari Lake on Tuesday.


	Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate who serves as the senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), was put in charge of dismantling VOA earlier this year by President Donald Trump. In a statement on X, Lake said that OAN will provide newsfeed services “free-of-charge” to USAGM networks, including VOA, Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), and Radio Martí. 


	OAN has consistently spread misinformation to its viewers about Covid-19, the 2020 election, the January 6th insurrection, and more.


	The former news anchor called the partnership an “enormous benefit to the American taxpayer.” “In my current role as Senior Advisor to USAGM, I don't have editorial control over the content of VOA and OCB programming, but I can ensure our outlets have reliable and credible options as they work to craft their reporting and news programs,” said Lake.

	In March, President Trump signed an executive order seeking the overhaul of USAGM, the agency which oversees the government-funded media outlet VOA. The order led to more than 1,000 Voice of America staffers being placed on leave and halted broadcasting. 


	VOA, which transmits U.S. news into other countries, has long been a target of Trump and conservatives, who accuse the broadcaster of having an overtly liberal and anti-Trump bias. The USAGM also oversees Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia, each of which were also impacted by the president's cuts.

	Following Trump's order, VOA journalists sued, saying that the president did not have the authority to withdraw funding approved by Congress. Although a federal judge blocked the Trump administration in April from dismantling the broadcaster, an appeals panel reversed parts of the lower court's order that would have sent staffers back to work and required the Trump administration to restore funding.


	The appeals court highlighted that the government did not challenge the ruling requiring it to restore VOA's “statutorily required programming levels.” Fewer than 20 out of more than 1,300 Voice of America staffers returned to work on Tuesday, sources told The Washington Post.

A Mississippi man is accused of repeatedly harassing the Emmy-winning actress for years.


							By

Associate Editor


	A Mississippi man has been charged after crashing his vehicle through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston's Bel-Air home on Monday.


	Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman charged Jimmy Wayne Carwyle with one count each of felony stalking and felony vandalism. He also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm.




	“Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,” Hochman wrote in a statement Wednesday. “My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.”

	Carwyle is accused of repeatedly harassing the Emmy-winning actress between March 1, 2023 and May 5, 2025, sending her unwanted social media messages, voicemails and emails, according to the district attorney's office.


	On Monday, just before 12:30 p.m., Carwyle allegedly crashed his vehicle through Aniston's gate, causing substantial damage. He then stopped in her driveway before being arrested by her security guard until police officers arrived.


	Carwyle's arraignment is set for Thursday. Prosecutors intend to request that statutory bail be set at $150,000. If he's convicted of his charges, he faces three years in state prison.


	“I want to thank law enforcement and our Stalking and Threat Assessment Team, particularly Deputy District Attorney Sam Hulefeld, for their outstanding work in this case,” Hochman added. “By working together, we are ensuring that dangerous individuals are taken off our streets.”


	Aniston is best known for her roles in Friends, Murder Mystery, We're the Millers and The Morning Show, among dozens of others.

	Days before Jimmy Wayne Carwyle allegedly crashed his car into the gate of actress Jennifer Aniston's Bel-Air mansion, the Mississippi man repeatedly sent her unwanted social media, voicemail, and email messages, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office.


	The alleged harassment culminated on Monday, May 5, when he rammed his car into Aniston's front gate, damaging the barrier, and was detained by her security guard before police arrived and took him into custody, per the DA's office.


	Carwyle was charged with one count of felony stalking and felony vandalism. The 48-year-old man faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, and his arraignment has been set for May 8. 


	Prosecutors intend to request that his bail be set at $150,000. If Carwyle is convicted of all charges, he faces three years in state prison, said the DA's office.

	“I really hate that this happened to Miss Aniston, this was terrible,” his childhood friend, Marty Merritt, told the outlet. “But since it did, the only thing I hope is this would get enough attention, attention that could get Jimmy some help. He needs some serious help. This is rock bottom.”

Robinson's denial comes one day after the Motown legend was hit with a $50 million sexual assault lawsuit by four of his former housekeepers. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Smokey Robinson has denied shocking new claims of sexual assault, saying through his attorney that the “vile, false allegations” are merely “an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.”


	In a statement Wednesday (May 7), lawyer Christopher Frost says he will “fiercely defend” both Smokey Robinson and his wife, Frances, against the $50 million lawsuit claiming the R&B legend raped four different housekeepers over the course of nearly two decades.

	“As this case progresses, the evidence (the crucial element that guides us) will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon — $50 million dollars, to be exact,” writes Frost. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Frost says he plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and address “numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies and relationships between the plaintiffs and others.”


	The lawyers who brought the case did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. 


	The statement comes one day after Smokey and Frances Robinson were sued in Los Angeles state court by four of their former housekeepers. The employees, suing anonymously, say Smokey Robinson forced them to have oral and vaginal sex in his bedroom dozens of times between 2007 and 2024.


	The housekeepers claim Frances shares blame because she did nothing to stop the alleged abuse, despite knowing that her husband had a history of sexual misconduct and that he'd previously struck settlements with assault victims.


	The lawsuit also says the Robinsons paid their employees below minimum wage, and that Frances Robinson created a hostile work environment replete with screaming and “racially-charged epithets.”


	The settlements cited in Tuesday's lawsuit have not been previously reported, and there's no apparent record of prior sexual assault lawsuits against Smokey Robinson. This means that, if legitimate, the deals were likely struck confidentially and outside of court.


	But the legendary R&B singer and recording executive is no stranger to the courtroom. In 2023, Robinson testified at a federal jury trial over claims that he stiffed a former manager out of nearly $1 million.


	The jurors largely sided with Robinson, finding that former manager Eric Podwall was not entitled to touring profits under his contract. Podwall won just $2,000 for an unpaid record advance after the more than six-year-long legal battle with Robinson.


UPDATE: Lawyers John Harris and Herbert Hayden, who represent the housekeepers suing Smokey and Frances Robinson, issued a statement later on Wednesday (May 7) responding to Frost's comments: “We stand behind our four clients' truthful claims, which are neither false nor vile, but clearly describe Mr. Robinson's despicable criminal acts.”

Smokey Robinson has denied the “vile, false” allegations of sexual assault after four women filed a lawsuit against the Motown singer Tuesday.


	In a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, affirmed that he was “responding on behalf of our clients Smokey and Frances Robinson,” adding that “the evidence will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon — $50 million dollars, to be exact.” 




	“Through this process we have seen the bizarre theatrics of yesterday's news conference, as the plaintiffs' attorneys outlined vile, false allegations against Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, trying to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create,” Frost said in a statement Wednesday.

	According to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on May 6, four anonymous women accused Robinson of raping them, with the causes of action including negligence, sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment and a hostile work environment, among other allegations including failure to pay them minimum page. 


	Robinson's wife, Frances, is also named in the suit, with the women alleging that she “failed to take the appropriate corrective action to prevent Defendant Robinson's deviant misconduct despite having full knowledge of his prior acts of sexual misconduct,” stating Robinson had settled claims with other women.

Cumming returns as Nightcrawler in the upcoming blockbuster, with Pascal playing Mister Fantastic.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Could Alan Cumming‘s Nightcrawler and Pedro Pascal‘s Mister Fantastic be having a showdown in Avengers: Doomsday?


	While details surrounding the Phase Six installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are being kept under wraps, that didn't stop The Traitors host from seemingly accidentally teasing some potential action in the upcoming film. 




	“I was learning stunts yesterday for some fight scene and I just think, I'm 60 years old. Twenty-three years ago, I played that superhero,” Cumming said in a video interview with Buzzfeed UK. “I was kind of old for a superhero even then. And now I'm back doing it. And that, to me, is hilarious.”

	He continued, “I'm sort of learning these fights and I'm like, ‘What? Who am I fighting with?' And they said, ‘You're hitting Pedro Pascal against the head,' or something.”


Cumming is reprising his Nightcrawler role in Avengers: Doomsday after debuting it in 2003's X2: X-Men United. As for Pascal, he will return as Mister Fantastic after introducing his character in The Fantastic Four: First Steps this summer.


	While Cumming didn't share any additional context surrounding the alleged fight sequence, some intense action can be expected in the Russo brothers' blockbuster, especially thanks to Nightcrawler's teleportation powers and Mister Fantastic's superhuman elasticity.


The Avengers: Doomsday cast also includes Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Letitia Wright (Black Panther), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), Danny Ramirez (The Falcon), Winston Duke (M'Baku), Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier), Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova), Wyatt Russell (U.S. Agent), David Harbour (Red Guardian), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Lewis Pullman (Bob), Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), James Marsden (Cyclops), Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), Vanessa Kirby (The Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (The Human Torch), among many others.


	The superhero film hits theaters May 1, 2026.

Due to Arnold's diagnosis, the band is canceling its upcoming summer tour.

	Brad Arnold, singer and drummer of the Mississippi-based rock band 3 Doors Down, announced Wednesday (May 7) that he's been diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer.


	“Got some not-so-good news for you today,” Arnold said in a video posted to social media, revealing that he's fighting clear cell renal cell carcinoma and that it's metastasized into his lung.


	Due to Arnold's diagnosis, the band is canceling its upcoming summer tour, with dates that were set to begin next week in Florida and continue through August.

	











	Arnold said that he's leaning on his faith through the medical battle (“I have no fear. I really, sincerely am not scared of it at all.”) and asked for prayers from his fans. “I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer any chance you get. And I think it's time for me to go and listen to ‘It's Not My Time' a little bit.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	He also referenced the 2008 3 Doors Down song “It's Not My Time” in his Instagram caption, writing: “Thank you for all the memories so far. Now, I believe ‘ITS NOT MY TIME' is really my song. This'll be a battle so we need our prayers warriors! Thank y'all for being the best fans in the world. We love y'all!”


	Arnold's comments section was filled with a who's who of his musical peers, with Creed's Scott Stapp writing, “If anyone has the FAITH and STRENGTH to face this fight, it's YOU brother. … I think I can speak for all of us, we are lifting you up in prayer right now believing without doubt for your total healing! I love you bro.”


	Stapp and his band Creed were set to hit the road with 3 Doors Down in July and August for the “Summer of '99” North American tour, also including Daughtry, Big Wreck and Mammoth.


	Chris Daughtry also hit Arnold's comments section, writing, “Sending you love my brother,” while Gavin McGraw added: “May God bless you brother. Showing us how to conquer the darkness with light.”


	“Man I hate to hear that Brad. Praying for ya brother,” Jason Aldean wrote, with Sara Evans saying, “Will be praying for you every day!”


	During their early 2000s heyday, 3 Doors Down scored 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including three top 10s: 2000's “Kryptonite” (No. 3 peak), 2003's “When I'm Gone” (No. 4) and 2003's “Here Without You” (No. 5). They also scored two No. 1 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart: 2005's Seventeen Days and a self-titled project in 2008.

	











	Arnold has received three Grammy nods for his work with 3 Doors Down: best rock song for both “Kryptonite” and “When I'm Gone” and best rock performance by a duo or group with vocal for the latter song.

 Rob Lowe says his late friend and Frank and Jesse costar Bill Paxton still keeps up with him from the other side. 


 During Thursday's episode of Lowe's Literally podcast, the Parks and Rec alum explained that Paxton — who died at 61 after suffering complications following a heart procedure in 2017 — often checks in with him whenever he goes for a psychic reading. 


 “Do you ever have people in your life that you think would come up in readings that just don't make as much of an appearance?” Lowe asked guest Kelsey Grammer. “For example, my mother rarely shows up. Rarely. And then I have the great actor Bill Paxton, who was a great friend, and that f---ing guy is everywhere all the time. He's everywhere.”

 “Is he really!?” Grammer asked. “Oh, that's great. I liked him a lot.”


 “He's everywhere!” Lowe teased. “He's [going], ‘Well, God, I heard you and Kelsey on that podcast. God, you guys are talking about everything!'” 


 Grammer noted that he was delighted to hear that Paxton — who once made a cameo appearance on season 10 of Frasier as a celebrity caller — and his presence could still be felt after his sudden death. The Twister actor died after suffering a stroke, which occurred 11 days after he underwent surgery to repair a heart valve and aorta damage in 2017. A wrongful death lawsuit was settled by his family in 2022.  


 “Well, you know, I've thought about him some and thought about his energy and how it was probably a real surprise to be, ‘What am I, dead?'” Grammer asked. “‘What, what, what's happened here? You know, what, what the hell?' I don't know what he was in there for, but it was obviously a procedure that was not meant to end up in that way.” 


 He also had nothing but positive things to say about Paxton's filmography. “I sure liked his work. I mean, he was so funny,” he said. “And in Aliens, when he was — I mean, he was great.”


 Quoting Paxton in the 1986 film, Lowe jokingly interjected, “Game over, man. Game all over.” 


 “He's so funny in it. He just had really, really terrific, you know, energy. And I think that, I dunno why that would disappear,” Grammer added. “Of course, it didn't. So, you know I get that.” 


 Lowe previously revealed in a 2023 episode of his podcast that he was once visited by Paxton — who played his outlaw brother in the 1994 Western Frank and Jesse — after his death in a dream. “In the dream — it's super real — Bill walks into the room and I'm like, ‘Oh my god, Bill doesn't know he's dead. How do I tell him?'” He recalled. “He's like, ‘Hey, man, how are you? God, I've been so busy. I've been coming back and forth!'” 


 He then said that Paxton offered to show him the other side of the veil. “He took me, and then the next thing I know… I don't have a body, but I'm exactly still me — I'm thinking the same, I have the same interests, everything is the same. Everything. Except I'm flying and I'm not in my body," Lowe explained. "And I'm with Bill and he's not there anymore either, but he's there, and we're flying and it looks like a cross between FernGully and the land of Avatar.”


 Lowe noted that he was so overwhelmed by the sheer amount of love that he felt in that moment that he began to weep before eventually being roused from his slumber. He added, “I woke up going, ‘Oh, well… I have no illusions at all about what the next chapter is.'"

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel left MAGA social circles fuming on Thursday after he flatly shot down a long-held Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theory.

During a televised Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Republican Sen. John Kennedy asked Patel, “Did Jeffrey Epstein hang himself or did somebody kill him?”

A defeated looking Patel answered, “Senator I believe he hung himself in a cell in the Metropolitan Detention Center.”

His answer put the kibosh on a MAGA conspiracy theory alleging Epstein's suicide was actually a murder. Patel's answer also went against his image as a noted conspiracy theorist and previous promises to reveal the truth in the “Epstein files.”

MAGA was left disappointed on both accounts in February after the DOJ released unremarkable binders of redacted material on the FBI's Epstein investigation. MAGA has demanded more information on the investigation be released—all of the information.

“Are you going to release all the information about that?” asked Kennedy.

Patel responded, “Senator we are working through that right now with the Department of Justice.” As for when he would have it done, Patel added, “In the near future.” 

Kennedy quipped, “Like before I die?”

Patel explained, “We're doing it in a way that protects victims and also doesn't put out into the ether information that is irrelevant.”

However, MAGA remained unconvinced and angry.

“What is going on with @FBIDirectorKash; has he been compromised by the intelligence agencies? Do you remember seen Ehud Barak entering Epstein house in NYC?” wrote one MAGA following X user.

“Truth seeker” Ryan Matta wrote in a tweet, “Kash Patel is cooked.”

Another fellow truth seeker by the name of Adam commented on X, “Remember when Kash Patel called for a 24/7 declassification office? Now he won't even lift a finger get us the Epstein files.”

Yet that wasn't the only time Patel seemed to absolutely step in it during the budget meeting. He was left bumbling like a student without his homework completed as one Democratic senator took him to task for showing up for the budget meeting without an actual budget. 

“Director Patel, where is the FY 2026 budget request for the FBI?” asked Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Patel answered, “Uhh, it's being worked on, ma'am.”

Murray pressed, “Have you reviewed it? Have you approved it?”

Patel replied, “Uhh, not yet,” before blaming the budget's delay on “interagency partners.” As it turned out, Patel—whom President Donald Trump appointed to the post in February—couldn't even offer a timeline for when he could turn in his budget request. 

“I'm doing the best I can,” Patel told Murray. 

Sounding every bit like a disappointed teacher, Murray said Patel's “best” was “insufficient and deeply disturbing.”

Kash Patel, the conspiracy theorist that Republicans made FBI Director, came to a Senate hearing on the budget—with NO budget, NO timeline, and NO clue.It's downright incompetent, and it's making America less safe.We need serious leadership at the FBI. https://t.co/8qUl43gHPg

Murray added, “We're now having a budget hearing without a budget request,” suggesting that Patel was refusing to follow the law. 

During that same meeting, Patel was also hammered over his understanding of the Fifth Amendment as Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley demanded to know why he was not investigating immigrants who had been “swept off the streets of America and sent to El Salvador without due process.”

Merkley questioned, “And you're familiar that that applies to all persons in the United States?” 

Patel is likely behind on submitting the FBI's budget request due to a clash with the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal, which called for more than $500 million in cuts to the bureau, Bloomberg reported. 

At a House hearing on Wednesday, Patel told lawmakers that the FBI would “need more than what has been proposed in [the Trump administration's] budget.”

But by Thursday, he had changed his tune, telling the Senate appropriations committee he would “make the mission work on whatever budget we're given,” Reuters reported.

Patel's apparent lack of preparation for the hearing is sure to hand more ammunition to critics who say the former DoJ official and staunch Trump loyalist is in over his head as FBI director.

Weird electromagnetic mayhem breaks out in this thrilling new preview.

Flying saucer enthusiasts and curious Ufologists will be craning their necks toward the heavens after checking out our exclusive clip for "Watch the Skies," a refreshing Swedish sci-fi movie being released on May 9, 2025, from XYZ Films ("Ash").

Titled "UFO Freak," the uncanny 2-minute sneak peek reveals strange phenomena erupting around a group of teens hanging out at a late-night gathering in an abandoned building, causing them to scatter.

This charming, nostalgic film is also being billed as the world's first "AI-dubbed" international flick using a procedure developed by Flawless to match up the lip movements of the characters from Swedish to English, and the results are pretty impressive. The process required the original foreign actors to record their dialogue in English prior to applying the pioneering TrueSynch technology.



Directed by Swedish filmmaker Victor Danell, "Watch the Skies" involves a spunky teenager named Denise whose father has vanished and was possibly abducted by extraterrestrials seen in the nearby forests.

She hooks up with a local investigative association called UFO Sweden and its misfit band of colorful characters who help her discover the truth of this UFO mystery.

"Watch the Skies" arrives in U.S. theaters on May 9 with an ensemble cast that includes Inez Dahl Torhaug (Denise), with Eva Melander, Jesper Barkselius, Sara Shirpey, Håkan Ehn, Isabelle Kyed, Niklas Kvarnbo Jönsson, and Mathias Lithner.

Fresh off of starring in the thriller Drop, which received some good word-of-mouth and an 8/10 review from JoBlo's own Chris Bumbray but still didn't manage to make much money at the box office (hopefully it's having more success with its digital release), Meghann Fahy has signed on to star in another thriller, one called Banquet. This time the thrills are going to be of the supernatural sort, and Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia is at the helm. 

Back in 2020, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia made his feature directorial debut (after a couple decades of making short films) with the thriller The Platform, which was released through the Netflix streaming service. You can read my very positive review of that film at THIS LINK, but the gist of it is that I was very impressed and was left eager to see what Gaztelu-Urrutia would make next. He was assembling a film called Rich Flu before the 2023 Hollywood strikes, but it turned out that his second movie was a sequel to his debut, The Platform 2. Deadline notes that The Platform reached 56 million views in its first month of release, putting it in the all-time top ten most watched films on Netflix at the time. The Platform 2 was the most-watched film on Netflix in its first two weeks and remained in the top 10 for five weeks.

While Gaztelu-Urrutia wrote both of the Platform films with David Desola and Pedro Rivero, for Banquet he'll be working from a screenplay by Sam Steiner (Fingernails). Deadline lets us know that Fahy is taking on the role of Jenny Cochrane, a woman whose perfect life is shattered by the return of her estranged son, which reawakens a terrifying secret buried in her bloodline.

Lewis Taylor is producing the film for Film Transmission, with James Harris doing the same for Tea Shop Productions. XYZ Films is financing and will launch international sales at the Cannes market this month. CAA Media Finance is co-repping the U.S. rights. Harry Potter director David Yates serves an executive producer under his banner Wychwood Media. Florian Zeller and Federica Sainte-Rose are executive producing for Blue Morning Pictures. Banquet is expected to begin production in October in the U.K.

Miriam Adelson's purchase of a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks from Mark Cuban sent shockwaves around the NBA. Many Mavs fans lamented the move, as Cuban is a legendary figure in both Mavericks and Dallas history.

The team's purchase also ignited conspiracy theories that have haunted the Mavericks since the 2023 sale. The Adelson family is a major player in the gambling and hotel industry. Patrick Dumont, the current Mavs Governor and Adelson's son-in-law, is the President of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, famous for building the Venetian Las Vegas resort. 

Mavs fans feared that the change in ownership would lead to the franchise relocating to Las Vegas. The NBA has openly discussed expansion to Las Vegas, and the success seen by Vegas franchises in the NFL, NHL, MLB, and WNBA proves that Vegas is a prime destination for a sports franchise. If expansion is impossible, fans feared that ownership's Vegas ties would make the Mavs a likely team to relocate to Vegas.

The new Mavs leadership has given fans little reason to trust their decision-making, stoking the flames surrounding a possible relocation. The already infamous Luka Doncic trade was such a disaster that fans feared there was an ulterior motive for the move: to accelerate a move to Las Vegas.

Yesterday, Marc Stein reported that the Mavericks will play a preseason game in Las Vegas against Doncic and the Lakers. The Mavs held training camp in Vegas last year and perhaps will again this year. Limiting preseason travel is considered advantageous to reduce fatigue and aid players in reaching peak condition. Mavs fans will also be excited to watch Doncic, making the decision to play the Lakers somewhat logical. 

Whatever the motivation is for this game, the decision to schedule it now, in Las Vegas, and against the Lakers is indefensible. The Mavericks franchise is at rock bottom. A year after making an NBA Finals appearance, the roster is unrecognizable. Confidence in the front office is at an all-time low, given the countless mistakes made by the Dumont-era Mavs. 

The organization has seemingly turned its back on its fans. Fans were removed from games for "Fire Nico" signs. Arena employees were instructed to limit the number of adults shown on the jumbotron, reducing the visibility of fans' ire. Dumont's promises to remain in Dallas ring particularly hollow after he broke his promise to keep Cuban in charge of basketball operations. 

To be clear, the Mavs will almost certainly stay put in Dallas. The conspiracy theory has been denied by all parties, including Dumont, Cuban, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Furthermore, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation sold all of its Las Vegas properties in 2021, and the Mavs have publicly stated they plan to build a new arena by 2032, when the lease with the American Airlines Center expires.

Despite the indications showing a Vegas move is far-fetched, the theory shows an underlying problem Dumont faces: nobody trusts the Mavs organization. Moves like scheduling this rumored preseason game only add to the fans' mistrust. The Mavericks desperately need someone in touch with the fans, team, and community to salvage the organization's reputation. 

As mistrust festers within the fanbase, it is increasingly clear Cuban should have remained in charge of basketball operations.

Referee Szymon Marciniak feels the conspiracy theories around the Champions League clash between Inter Milan and Barcelona are “ridiculous.”

As the Corriere dello Sport, via FCInter1908, highlight, the Polish FIFA referee has had little patience for the suggestion that his refereeing favoured Inter.

Referee Szymon Marciniak has received no shortage of criticism in Spanish media in the last couple days.

There have been numerous conspiracy theories that the Polish official favoured Inter.

Even Barcelona midfielder Pedri argued that “UEFA must investigate” Marciniak for his refereeing of the match. Among these have been the notion that Marciniak has a bias towards Real Madrid.

Particularly after the controversy surrounding the round of sixteen penalty shootout between Real and Atletico Madrid.

There were a few decisions that many Barcelona fans – as well as media outlets in Spain – have argued went Inter's way.

First of all, there was a handball by Francesco Acerbi inside the Inter area. Marciniak did not give a penalty, because he did not see the contact by the defender's hand as intentional.

Then, there was the penalty that Marciniak awarded to Inter after advice from VAR.

Next, Barcelona fans raged at the penalty that the referee initially awarded to the Blaugranas for a foul by Henrikh Mkhitaryan on Lamine Yamal.

Marciniak changed that to a free kick on the edge of the area. This was after VAR concluded that the foul did not continue into the penalty area.

Then, there is also the idea that Denzel Dumfries had fouled Gerard Martin in the buildup to Francesco Acerbi's stoppage time equalizer.

However, Marciniak hit back. “These are all ridiculous ideas,” he said.

“I didn't hurt anyone,” he said of his refereeing.

“Inter's third goal is absolutely a good goal.”

BRIEF RESEARCH REPORT article

Via a shared link with schizotypy, paranormal belief (PB) and conspiracy theory endorsement (CT) influence meaning in life (presence and search). This association is important because meaning in life (particularly presence) is a significant prognosticator of positive wellbeing. Despite this, previous research in this domain remains limited. Major restrictions being the assumption that belief is homogeneous and the failure to consider how factors related to positive wellbeing (i.e., creativity and self-esteem) explain links between belief, schizotypy and psychological health. Accordingly, based on PB, CT, and schizotypy, this study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify belief subgroups. Analysis then employed sequential mediation to assess whether creativity and self-esteem mediated the relationship between belief and meaning in life. A sample of 647 completed measures at four time points 2 months apart. At baseline, LPA identified two subgroups: Lower (Profile 1) vs. Higher (Profile 2) belief Ideation. Path analysis revealed that Profile 2 (vs. Profile 1) predicted greater search over time. Moreover, Profile 2 predicted creativity (self-efficacy and personal identity), which in combination with self-esteem, sequentially mediated the belief-meaning in life relationship. Explicitly, creative self-efficacy prognosticated greater self-esteem, which aligned with greater presence and lower search. Creative personal identity demonstrated a negative link with self-esteem but predicted presence and search. Overall, higher scorers in PB, CT, and schizotypy were less driven to search and more likely to possess presence as a function of possessing confidence in their ability to find solutions to problems and self-esteem.

This paper examined the degree to which validation of empirically flawed notions (i.e., scientifically unfounded assertions, SUAs) influenced meaning in life. To establish this, the authors first considered how paranormal belief (PB) and conspiracy theory endorsement (CT) interrelated within participants. The researchers focused on PB and CT because the constructs feature prominently in SUA literature and affiliate differently to meaning in life balance, which is a prognosticator of positive wellbeing (Dagnall et al., 2024). This was an important conceptual advance, since theorists typically study PB and CT in isolation (construct-focused) or assume, based on moderate to strong associations, that belief in one construct predicts endorsement of the other (generic) (Bensley et al., 2022).

Examples of generic classifications are scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs (i.e., the tendency to endorse unverifiable world statements, Mill et al., 1994) and epistemically unwarranted beliefs (i.e., acceptance of viewpoints not supported by credible data and logical reasoning, Lobato et al., 2014). Collectively, such groupings recognize the high-order characteristics of SUAs. Particularly, that high (vs. lower) advocacy is affiliated with reduced critical thinking and increased scientific skepticism. Though both construct-focused and generic approaches have afforded insights into SUAs they possess limitations. Construct-focused studies fail to consider whether outcomes generalize across belief types, whereas the generic approach emphasizes commonality to the exclusion of difference.

Despite generating a robust body of work, these approaches fail to consider how PB and CT interact within individuals. This is important because though correlated, PB and CT differ conceptually and vary in the ways they interact with wellbeing related outcomes. This divergence is commensurate with the constructs distinct features. PB describes authentication of supernatural propositions (e.g., powers, forces, and entities) by individuals who typically engage in rational thinking and reality testing (Irwin, 2009). Conceptually, delimiting CT is difficult since there exists no agreed definition. Accordingly, CT is best explicated as validation of narratives centring on distrust of authority and exploitation of position. Prevailing themes include the ill-intentioned motivations of powerful individuals/groups (e.g., planning, duplicity, intention, and manipulation) (Drinkwater et al., 2023). Validation of both PB and CT is flawed because they derive from a non-scientific and unverified, evidential basis.

The assumption that PB and CT are adaptively similar (i.e., affiliated with wellbeing outcomes) derives from the observation that they relate similarly to cognitive-perceptual factors such as schizotypy and proneness to reality testing errors. The link with schizotypy is especially important since the construct affiliates with a range of psychological health outcomes (Mohr and Claridge, 2015). Noting this, and the fact that schizotypy adds variability to SUAs, recent scholarly work has investigated interactions between, PB, CT, and schizotypy (Denovan et al., 2018; Dagnall et al., 2022b).

Schizotypy is a multidimensional psychopathological construct (Lenzenweger, 2015), which within non-clinical populations theorists regard as a personality dimension ranging from psychological health to schizophrenia (Barrantes-Vidal et al., 2015). In this context, schizotypy designates the extent to which attenuated features of psychotic states occur within healthy individuals (Claridge, 1997). The advantage of this operationalization is that it recognizes that elevated levels of schizotypy exist within general samples without progressing to full spectrum symptoms (Dembinska-Krajewska and Rybakowski, 2014).

Schizotypy comprises positive, negative, and disorganized feature clusters, which map on to factorial models of schizophrenia (Cicero and Kerns, 2010). Positive (productive psychotic-like) symptoms include bizarre perceptions (i.e., hallucinations proneness), thought content disruption (i.e., odd beliefs, magical ideation, and delusion propensity), and suspiciousness/paranoia. Negative (i.e., deficit/restriction) symptoms comprise reduced emotional affect (e.g., flattening, disinterest in external world, and anhedonia). Disorganization symptoms encompass disrupted cognitions and actions. Specifically, thought (structure and expression) and behavior, ranging from mild to formal thought disorder and grossly disorganized actions. These characteristics collectively and at the dimensional level are important because they interact with SUAs. For example, are associated with variations in cognitive performance (Denovan et al., 2018).

Noting that schizotypy can qualify the effects of PB, investigators have combined PB and schizotypy using latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a form of mixture modeling that assumes the presence of unobserved (latent) subgroups and probabilistically specifies profiles/class membership using participant responses (i.e., distinct patterns across indicators). The advantage of LPA is that the technique identifies believer subgroups based on multiple variables. This approach has advanced understanding of SUAs by demonstrating that believers are not homogeneous. Instead, belief is heterogeneous, and conviction varies as a function of level of other cognitive-perceptual such as concurrent level of psychopathology (e.g., schizoptypy, Dagnall et al., 2024; manic-depressive experience, Dagnall et al., 2022a) qualify beliefs (Drinkwater et al., 2024).

In terms of wellbeing, this paper focused on meaning in life because the construct is strongly related to psychological and physical health (Czekierda et al., 2017). Specifically, meaning in life is robustly associated with reduced suffering, and better relationships (Steger, 2017). Meaning in life is “the extent to which people comprehend, make sense of, or see significance in their lives, accompanied by the degree to which they perceive themselves to have a purpose, mission, or overarching aim” (Steger, 2009, p. 682). This includes feeling that existence matters and is significant (i.e., has value) (Steger, 2012). Correspondingly, positive psychological theories regard meaning in life as integral to flourishing (i.e., happiness, growth, and optimizing potential) (Diener and Seligman, 2004; Ryff and Singer, 1998) and life satisfaction (Steger, 2017). Concomitantly, individuals with greater meaning in life express greater positivity about themselves and report higher self-esteem, self-acceptance, and positive self-image (Steger et al., 2008).

Researchers regularly assess the construct using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (Steger et al., 2006), which comprises presence (sense of life as meaningful) and search (drive toward finding meaning). Studies report that these dimensions link divergently with health outcomes. Presence affiliates with positive factors (e.g., life satisfaction), and is inversely related to negative features (e.g., depression) (Steger et al., 2006). Search is associated with reduced wellbeing and negative affect (e.g., sadness and rumination) (Dakin et al., 2021). Though search and presence are independent orthogonal factors, fulfilled search can positively reinforce presence offsetting negative outcomes linked to Search (Newman et al., 2018), whereas unresolved search relates negatively to presence (Russo-Netzer and Icekson, 2023). Moreover, Barnett et al. (2019) found that presence buffered against negative outcomes (psychologist distress, burnout and negative affect) through higher self-esteem. This indicated the vital role that positive affect plays in meaning in life.

Additionally, studies report that creativity enhances meaning in life. Creativity refers to the generation of something novel and useful (Plucker et al., 2004). The positive relationship between the constructs stems from the fact that creativity enables individuals to attain core attributes of meaning of life (i.e., purpose, significance, and coherence) (Kaufman, 2018). Drawing on this interaction, Kaufman (2018) proposed a temporal model where past, present, and future pathways to creativity foster meaning of life. This contends that the past promotes deeper life understanding; the present engages individuals with life and reminds them of enjoyment and connections, and the future provides a sense of legacy and lasting contribution. Regarding self-esteem, González Moreno and Molero Jurado (2023) found that higher levels of creativity were associated with increased self-esteem, suggesting that nurturing creativity increases emotional wellbeing. Additionally, Nemeržitski and Heinla (2020) reported that teachers with higher creative self-efficacy possessed greater self-esteem, which reinforced their creative teaching practices. Added to this, creativity demonstrates a complex relationship with schizotypy. Jacquet et al. (2020) established that positive schizotypy features (e.g., cognitive-perceptual aberrations) aligned with greater creativity than negative and disorganized schizotypy characteristics (e.g., anhedonia, disorganization of thought). This relationship between cognitive-perceptual features and creativity may explain how schizotypy can link with positive wellbeing, such as life meaning.

The present paper used LPA to identify belief subgroups based on PB, CT, and schizotypy scores (baseline). Then employed sequential mediation to assess whether conceptually related wellbeing factors (creativity and self-esteem) mediated the relationship between belief and meaning in life. The researchers selected these factors because they were positively associated and related to meaning in life. The advantage of sequential mediation was that it allowed the authors to examine temporal and causal relationships and capture the directionality of effects over time. This was not possible using a traditional cross-sectional design, which only assesses variables at a single point. Since this study was exploratory, the authors did not state precise hypotheses. Nevertheless, they anticipated that meaning in life scores would vary as a function of subgroup membership and that creativity and self-esteem would mediate the belief subgroup-meaning in life relationship.

The sample comprised 647 participants (Mage = 49.9, SD = 11.5): 353 males (Mage = 50.3, SD = 10.9), 291 females (Mage = 49.5, SD = 12.2), one trans (age = 49), and two non-binary (Mage = 37.5, SD = 2.1). The researchers recruited participants through Bilendi, an acknowledged supplier of quality data (Kees et al., 2017; Fladerer and Braun, 2020). The researchers asked Bilendi to recruit a representative, gender balanced, UK-based sample (minimum age 18 years). All participants completed measures four times, 2 months apart (i.e., baseline, Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3).

The survey employed psychometrically attested self-report measures.

The RPBS (Tobacyk, 2004) assessed endorsement of supernatural phenomena (i.e., precognition, psi belief, superstition, traditional religious belief, spiritualism, witchcraft, and extraordinary life forms; see Dagnall et al., 2010). The RBPS contains 26 items presented as statements (e.g., “Black cats can bring bad luck”). Participants record their responses on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1= strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree). Consistent with Irwin (2009), the researchers recoded responses (0–6). Hence, total scores ranged from 0 to 156, with higher scores indicating greater paranormal belief.

The GCB-5 (Kay and Slovic, 2023) is a short, unidimensional form of the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS, Brotherton et al., 2013). Both measures assess the tendency to endorse generic conspiracist ideation. The GCB-5 comprises the highest loading items from each of GCBS factors: government malfeasance, extraterrestrial cover-up, malevolent global conspiracies, personal wellbeing, and control of information. Researchers developed the GCB-5 for use in lengthy test batteries to facilitate participant engagement and completion. Within the GCB measures items appear as statements and participants respond via 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = definitely not true to 5 = definitely true). Total GCB-5 scores range from 5 to 25. Higher totals reflect greater endorsement of general conspiracist notions.

The SPQ-B (Raine and Benishay, 1995) assesses incidence of normal variability and abnormal degrees of schizotypy using 22 items (e.g., “People sometimes find me aloof and distant”). Participants answer using a dichotomous scale (0 = No and 1 = Yes). The SPQ-B has three subscales, Cognitive-Perceptual Deficits (CP), 8 items; Interpersonal Deficits, 8 items; and Disorganization, 5 items. These correspond with the major symptoms of schizophrenia. CP assesses positive aspects (i.e., odd beliefs and magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, paranoid ideation). Interpersonal appraises negative features (i.e., social anxiety, constricted affect, and paranoia). Disorganized evaluates presence of thought disorder and bizarre behavior. In addition to subscale totals, the SPQ-B produces a summative score (0–22). Higher scores signify greater schizotypy.

The SSCS (Karwowski, 2012, 2014) appraised trait-like creative self-efficacy (6 items) and personal identity (5 items). Creative self-efficacy refers to an individual's confidence in their ability to produce creative outcomes (e.g., “I know I can efficiently solve even complicated problems?”). Creative personal identity is the perception that creativity is a central part of an individual's self (e.g., “Being a creative person is important to me”). The SSCS presents items as statements and participants record their responses on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = definitely not, 7 = definitely yes). Higher totals specify greater levels of creative self-efficacy and personal identity.

The RES (Rosenberg, 1965) evaluates global self-esteem (i.e., perceptions of self-worth and acceptance) using 10 statements (e.g., “I take a positive attitude toward myself”). Participants respond using a 4-point Likert type scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 4 = Strongly Agree). Scores range from 10 to 40 and higher scores designate greater self-esteem.

The MLQ (Steger et al., 2006) assessed presence of (5 items, “I understand my life's meaning”) and search (5 items, “I am seeking a purpose or mission for my life”) for purpose in life. Presence is the extent to which individuals believe their being has purpose. Search denotes the degree individuals strive to find or deepen life purpose. Participants indicated endorsement with a 7-point Likert type scale (1 = absolutely untrue to 7 = absolutely true). Subscales range from 5 to 35 and higher scores denote greater presence and search for meaning in life.

Instruments employed within this study have demonstrated robust psychometric integrity (i.e., reliability and validity): RPBS (Drinkwater et al., 2017), GCB-5 (Dagnall et al., 2023; Kay and Slovic, 2023); SPQ-B (Raine and Benishay, 1995); SCCS (Karwowski, 2012, 2014); RES (Rosenberg, 1965); and MLQ (Steger et al., 2006).

The online platform Qualtrics hosted the survey. Participants accessed the site by clicking on the weblink circulated by Bilendi. Prior to entering the survey, participants read the information sheet, which outlined the nature and purpose of the research project. Only participants who provided consent by ticking on the option progressed. The opening survey section consisted of a short demographic section requiring age, preferred gender, and occupation. Participants then progressed to the study scales. To lessen carry-over and order effects the presentation of measures varied across participants. The Qualtrics randomizer controlled this process. Survey instructions directed participants to advance at their own pace and consider items carefully. To counteract social desirability and evaluation apprehension, instructions also informed participants that there were no correct answers and answers should reflect individual inclinations (Krishnaveni and Deepa, 2013). To counter potential common method variance, individual scale instructions emphasized the separateness of sections and construct uniqueness (Spector, 2019). This procedure produces psychological distance between scales and encourages participants to focus on item content. On completion of the measures, the survey delivered the study debrief.

The Health and Education Research Ethics Committee at Manchester Metropolitan University provided ethical approval (Project ID, 47784).

The researchers performed statistical analysis using Mplus 8 (Muthén and Muthén, 2015). Data screening and assessment of correlations occurred prior to latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA identified believer subgroups based on Paranormal Belief (PB), Conspiracist Belief (CT), and schizotypy scores. To determine optimal subgroup number the investigators used a likelihood-based significance test. Specifically, the Lo-Mendel-Rubin Adjusted Likelihood Ratio test (LMR-A-LRT; Lo et al., 2001), which compares a k profile with a k-1 profile model. A significant p-value specifies a solution requiring additional profiles. Information criteria were Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1974), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978), and Sample-Size Adjusted BIC (ssaBIC; Sclove, 1987). Lower scores on these indicate superior fit.

Next, a path model employed profiles as predictors. This assessed relationships between belief and Meaning in Life (Presence and Search) over time. Within this model, Creativity and Self-Esteem acted as mediators with regards to the belief-Meaning in Life relationship.

Analyses assessed model fit using standard fit indices: Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI), Standardized Root-Mean-Square Residual (SRMR), and Root-Mean-Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Good values are CFI > 0.95, SRMR < 0.05, and RMSEA < 0.05 (Hu and Bentler, 1999). To assess mediation, analyses applied bootstrapping (1000 resamples) to compute 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (Preacher and Hayes, 2008).

Normality appraisal found acceptable skewness (i.e., between −2.0 and +2.0) (Brown, 2015) and kurtosis (i.e., between −7.0 and +7.0) (Hair et al., 2010). Associations between belief variables (used for LPA) were typical to large (except for Interpersonal with PB, r = 0.14) and below 0.8. The latter finding designated absence of multicollinearity (Tabachnick et al., 2013) (Table 1). Consistent with previous literature (e.g., Dagnall et al., 2022b; Denovan et al., 2020), the Cognitive-Perceptual schizotypy factor (vs. Interpersonal and Disorganized) was most strongly associated with PB and CT.

Table 1. Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations among paranormal belief, conspiracist belief, and schizotypy.

LPA identified two belief subgroups using a hierarchical approach. This started with one group and then assessed additional groups until a non-significant LMR-A-LRT occurred alongside minimal divergence in AIC, BIC and ssaBIC. The two-profile (vs. one-profile model solution) significantly improved fit (see Supplementary material). A three-profile solution produced a non-significant LMR-A-LRT concomitant with small decreases in AIC, BIC, and ssaBIC. Thus, further analyses adopted the two-profile model (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Pattern of scaled mean scores for Paranormal Belief, Conspiracist Belief, and schizotypy.

Profile 1, “Lower Belief Ideation” (65.1% of the sample), displayed lower scores across variables and vs. scale norms, whereas Profile 2, “Higher Belief Ideation” (34.9% of the sample) displayed higher scores across variables and vs. scale norms. Profile 1 (compared with Profile 2) means were PB (4.30 vs. 2.78), CT (3.60 vs. 2.59), Cognitive-Perceptual (0.65 vs.0.15), Interpersonal (0.71 vs. 0.41), and Disorganized (0.56 vs. 0.13).

Since only one high belief profile emerged, path analysis evaluated predictive relationships between Profile 2 (Higher Belief Ideation) and Meaning in Life (Presence, MLPresence; and Search, MLSearch). Creativity (Self-efficacy, CRSE; and Personal Identity, CRPI) and Self-Esteem assessed at Time 2 and Time 3, respectively, functioned as mediators. The initial model was saturated and reported perfect fit. Accordingly, analysis specified a model constraining non-significant predictive paths to zero (i.e., CRSE with both MLPres and MLSearch). This produced a model with good fit, χ2 (2, N = 647) = 3.94, p = 0.139, CFI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.01, RMSEA = 0.03 (95% CI of 0.01–0.09).

Path assessment revealed CRPI and Self-Esteem were positive predictors of MLPres (Figure 2). In addition, CRPI was a positive predictor of MLSearch, whereas Self-Esteem was a negative prognosticator. Vs. Profile 1, Profile 2 exerted a significant indirect effect on MLPresence via CRPI and Self-esteem (Table 2). Profile 2 positively predicted CRPI and negatively predicted Self-esteem; CRPI and Self-esteem positively predicted MLPresence. Profile 2 exerted a significant direct and indirect effect on MLSearch via CRPI and Self-esteem. CRPI positively predicted MLSearch, Self-esteem was a negative predictor. Sequentially, CRPI negatively predicted Self-esteem, and CRSE was a positive predictor, prior to Self-esteem predicting MLPresence (positively) and MLSearch (negatively).

CRSE, Creativity Self-efficacy; CRPI, Creativity Personal Identity; S-E, Self-esteem; MLPres, Meaning in Life Presence; MLSearch, Meaning in Life Search. Standardized regression weights between variables shown. Error not indicated but specified for all variables. All relationships aside from Profile 2 and MLPres were p < 0.05 (using Bootstrapping significance estimates, 1,000 resamples).

LPA identified two belief subgroups, high (Profile 2) vs. low (Profile 1) belief ideation. Selection of these labels reflected the tendencies of profile members to hold PBs, endorse CTs, and report higher levels of schizotypy, particularly Cognitive-Perceptual deficits. This outcome aligned with the delineation of CP in normal populations as thoughts and behavior that correspond, in an attenuated form, to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (i.e., odd beliefs and magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, paranoid ideation, and ideas of reference). This interpretation was consistent with previous research that reports the presence of these features in endorsers of scientifically unfounded assertions (SUA).

That stated, it is important to acknowledge that feature strength and constituency vary as a function of belief type. Illustratively, CT (vs. PB) is more strongly associated with paranoid ideation (Darwin et al., 2011; Greenburgh and Raihani, 2022) and PB is positively associated with presence of meaning in life, whereas CT is not related (Dagnall et al., 2024). Such differences explain why, although positively correlated, PB and CT shared only approximately 40% variance. In this context, focusing on subgroup commonality, Profile 2 reflected the generalized tendency to validate SUAs.

This paper employed LPA because the method is superior to traditional clustering techniques, which are deterministic (i.e., assign participants to groups without certainty of membership), inflexible (i.e., regard groups as discrete), and perform poorly when data fails to display a spherical or equally sized distribution of clusters. Furthermore, LPA uses indices that specify data fit and prescribe subgroup numbers. For these reasons, the subgroups identified in this study were statistically robust.

Path analysis revealed that Profile 2 (vs. Profile 1) were more likely to possess higher Creativity, lower Self-Esteem and higher Search for Meaning in Life (MLSearch) (i.e., strive to find/deepen life purpose). Moreover, Profile 2 were more likely to possess Presence of Life Meaning (MLPresence) (i.e., think their existence has purpose) due to Creative Personal Identity (CRPI) (i.e., regard creativity as a part of self) and Self-Esteem. These findings concur with previous investigations. Specifically, Bajaj and Lall (2018) who found sense of identity and higher self-esteem contributed to a greater life meaning. Explicitly, the notion that identity and self-esteem interconnect (Stets and Burke, 2014) and contribute to a greater meaning in life (Du et al., 2017). In addition, Profile 2 were more likely to MLSearch (as a function of CRPI) and less likely if they possessed higher Self-Esteem.

A caveat is that Profile 2 (vs. Profile 1) were less likely to possess Self-Esteem, but more likely to index CRPI alongside greater belief in the ability to produce creative solutions (CRSE). Profile 2 possession of higher CRSE was concomitant with higher MLPresence and less inclination to MLSearch due to the positive effect of Self-Esteem. However, CRPI conversely influenced Self-Esteem. These findings demonstrated that Profile 2 (vs. Profile 1) were more creative, but less likely to regard themselves positively. Higher CRPI associated with greater MLPresence and MLSearch. Contrarywise, Profile 2′s affiliation with greater CRSE associated with higher Self-Esteem, which predicted greater MLPresence and lower MLSearch. In terms of previous research, there is limited evidence collectively linking paranormal belief, conspiracy endorsement, and schizotypy to creativity and self-esteem.

However, it is possible that shared cognitive-perceptual features (e.g., magical thinking) between PB, CT, and schizotypy explain associations with higher creativity, which links positively with life meaning via self-esteem. Indeed, research demonstrates that magical thinking is associated with divergent thinking and creativity (Fisher et al., 2004). Moreover, creativity promotes self-esteem and life meaning (Kaufman, 2018; Nemeržitski and Heinla, 2020). Investigators need to undertake additional research to establish the generality of findings and to further explore the complex relationships outlined.

The broad belief classifications identified in the current article (Low 65% vs. High 35%) were consistent with the notion that verification of SUAs occurs frequently within general, non-clinical samples (PB, Dagnall et al., 2016 and CT, Pilch et al., 2023). This coheres with the notion that verification is a typical manifestation of flawed human cognition. Explicitly, the tendency to assume and ratify worldviews based on subjective (internally generated) data (Dagnall et al., 2015; Irwin et al., 2012a,b). In this context, the study of belief is important because beliefs potentially undermine real-world decision making (Bensley, 2023). For example, negatively influence health attitudes/choices and adaptive coping functioning (Denovan et al., 2024a,b). Acknowledging these concerns, ensuing academic work should design interventions that view SUAs holistically, rather than as distinct belief types. The present paper has limitations that merit consideration. Explicitly, while LPA produced statistically appropriate profiles, the identified subgroups lacked a theoretical foundation. This was understandable since the study was novel and exploratory. Also, though profiles were descriptive to the extent that they grouped individuals on the basis of high (vs. low) SUAs and schizotypy, this outcome provides evidence to support the notion that theorists should consider beliefs and allied factors in tandem rather than as isolated constructs (Mill et al., 1994; Lobato et al., 2014).

Additionally, because subgroups identified by LPA arise from cross-variable heterogeneity within particular samples, subsequent studies need to determine whether similar profiles reproduce in independent samples. Establishing subgroup robustness is methodologically and conceptually important. Specifically, it enables theoretical comparison across disparate participant groupings. This is necessary since the investigators drew the present sample from the general population where SUAs and schizotypy scores are typically low and lack variability. Accordingly, subsequent academic work needs to consider a broader range of SUAs and include greater participant diversity (i.e., recruit and compare respondents from general and clinical populations).

To establish equivalence follow-up studies could use crossvalidation methods (Donovan and Chung, 2015). These are statistical techniques such as progressive elaboration that evaluate stability and generalizability by repeating the analysis across different samples and/or data subsets. This iterative process ensures profile robustness across varied conditions and refines profiles by progressively adding detail. Crossvalidation via assessment of profile stability and fit avoids misspecification (Collins et al., 1994). Despite these limitations, the broad subgroupings identified within the current paper provide a sound basis for examining relationships between SUAs and subjective wellbeing.

A further potential limitation in this study arose from the use of self-report measures. Due to deficits in metacognitive awareness, self-report measures are susceptible to cognitive biases. Particularly the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999), which occurs when individuals misjudge their competence. This manifests as a mismatch between actual and perceived ability, whereby less proficient individuals overestimate this capacities and more able respondents underestimate their capabilities. In the context of this report, this was problematic with regards to self-efficacy, which Bandura (1997) defined as belief in one's ability to influence personal outcomes, because scores may have reflected perceived (rather than actual) competence. Hence, the illusion of self-efficacy could reinforce presence pf meaning in life in the absence of empirical support.

Self-esteem also influences this process. When based on an inaccurate perceived self-efficacy, strong self-esteem can create a false sense of existential significance. Conversely, low self-esteem may weaken perception of purpose, particularly when personal failures contradict expectations. Additionally, the Dunning-Kruger effect may influence creativity scores. This raises concerns about the accuracy of self-reported creative efficacy and its alignment with objective measures of creative performance. Future research should explore how metacognitive insight influences responses on the Short Scale of Creative Self and whether external, objective validation aligns with self-reported creative efficacy/confidence.
