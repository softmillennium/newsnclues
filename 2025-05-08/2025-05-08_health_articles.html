                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The research identified enolase 2 (ENO2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme, as a significant factor associated with lymphatic metastasis in HNSCC. HNSCC is an aggressive cancer with a relatively low 5-year overall survival rate. Cervical lymph node metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related death in HNSCC patients, and effective therapies for metastatic HNSCC are currently lacking. The research team, through the integration of tumor databases, public datasets, and clinical relevance analysis, found that high ENO2 expression was positively correlated with lymph node (LN) metastasis in HNSCC. Further studies revealed that ENO2-mediated HNSCC metastasis was associated with M2 macrophage polarization. ENO2 regulated M2 macrophage polarization through its metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Moreover, PEP-mediated polarized macrophages enhanced the EMT and migration of HNSCC cells. The cytokine TGF-β released by polarized macrophages interacted with its receptor TGFβR1 on tumor cells, promoting EMT and migration, which may lead to tumor metastasis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of ENO2 with POMHEX effectively reversed M2 macrophage polarization and inhibited HNSCC lymphatic metastasis in mouse models. This finding suggests that POMHEX could be a potential therapeutic approach for managing HNSCC metastasis. This study elucidated the role of ENO2 in modulating macrophage polarization and contributing to HNSCC metastasis. It also revealed the mechanism by which ENO2-derived PEP regulates histone modification and macrophage polarization. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into HNSCC lymphatic metastasis and offer potential therapeutic targets for metastatic HNSCC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers are zeroing in on the Achilles' heel of pathogens that cause Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. The efforts of a research team from Bochum and Würzburg give hope for new treatment approaches for dangerous tropical diseases. "Some of these proteins contain components that are specific to parasites and differ significantly from those of the host cells," explains Professor Ralf Erdmann from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. "They are considered a potential Achilles' heel in the development of new drugs," says Ralf Erdmann. He and his colleagues Dr. Vishal Kalel and Dr. Chetan Krishna from the Faculty of Medicine at Ruhr University Bochum, in collaboration with Hirak Das of the research group led by Professor Bettina Warscheid at the University of Würzburg, have succeeded in compiling a high-precision inventory of the membrane proteins of these glycosomes. In their study, they have identified the protein components of the glycosome membrane in detail for the first time, including numerous previously unknown components, some of which are parasite-specific. Using state-of-the-art subcellular proteomics, 28 glycosome membrane proteins were identified with a high degree of reliability. "Using this technique, we also detected proteins that are associated with glycosome biogenesis, interorganelle communication and protein quality control," lists Bettina Warscheid. "A particular highlight has been the discovery of TbPEX15, a membrane anchor for an essential protein import complex - a promising target for the development of new drugs, as it differs significantly from its counterpart in humans." The findings provide an important basis for the development of new therapies for diseases that affect over 12 million people worldwide, including Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. "In addition, these findings deepen our understanding of parasite biology, open up new avenues for targeted treatment strategies against poorly understood tropical diseases and provide a valuable resource for biomedical research into glycosome biology," concludes Ralf Erdmann.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite concerns over air pollution spikes, this decades-long Danish study finds that repeated PM2.5 peaks are not linked to increased cardiovascular risk, highlighting the greater importance of chronic exposure. The role of long-term PM2.5 peaks in cardiovascular risk: an AIRCARD substudy. In a recent study published in the Journal of Cardiology, researchers examined the relationship between exposure to peak levels of particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with air pollution being a modifiable risk factor. PM2.5 is particularly harmful as it can enter the bloodstream, aggravate existing cardiovascular conditions, and contribute to stroke and myocardial infarction. Recent data suggest that air pollution is now the second largest mortality risk factor. While previous studies have focused on acute spikes in pollution or chronic accumulated exposure preceding a cardiovascular event, the impact of recurrent high pollution peaks is unclear. It is important to note that the cohort included only older men from Denmark, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied to other populations such as women, younger individuals, or people living in areas with much higher pollution. The team integrated individual-level data with national registries, which provided information on sociodemographics, diagnosis codes, hospitalizations, and mortality outcomes. Next, the researchers modeled PM2.5 levels at participants' residential addresses between 1979 and 2019 using the Danish integrated air pollution modeling system. This system estimates air pollution levels by incorporating contributions from street-level pollution, regional background, and local background. The Operational Street Pollution Model was used to calculate street-level PM2.5. The modeling system provided hourly concentrations of PM2.5 for 1979–2019, which were aggregated into monthly mean levels. Further, road traffic noise was calculated at the most exposed side of the building and averaged across weekends and weekdays. The primary outcome was a composite MACE endpoint, including non-fatal stroke, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization, peripheral revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality. Cox proportional hazards models examined the associations between chronic PM2.5 peak exposures and MACEs. Models were progressively adjusted to adjust for confounders. One model was adjusted for age and the year of inclusion. Another model was additionally adjusted for smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and family CVD history. Because exposure was estimated at each person's residential address, the results may not fully account for time spent away from home, such as at work or while traveling, which could affect individual exposure levels. Baseline characteristics stratified by CVD event occurrence revealed that subjects who had a CVD event were slightly older and had a higher BMI than those who did not. Moreover, this group had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and current smoking, as well as higher exposure to PM2.5 peaks. The CVD event group also experienced a higher burden of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, with a higher minimum peak magnitude, median number of peaks, and average peak magnitude. The fully adjusted model revealed no significant increase in MACE risk associated with elevated PM2.5 peak exposure. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the findings across different periods before an event and different PM2.5 peak definitions. In analyses applying alternative peak thresholds, the hazard ratio was close to unity, supporting no relationship between cardiovascular events and PM2.5 peak exposure. Even when using more sensitive definitions for peaks or focusing on the time windows immediately before a cardiovascular event, the study found no statistically significant associations. The authors also note that while short-term acute PM2.5 exposure (such as in the hours or days before a cardiovascular event) has previously been linked to increased risk, this study specifically investigated whether repeated monthly PM2.5 peaks over decades contribute to risk. Their results suggest that these long-term peaks do not add to cardiovascular risk once other factors are accounted for. Nevertheless, elevated long-term exposure to PM2.5 peaks did not significantly increase MACE risk. This points to the possibility that chronic, sustained exposure to PM2.5, rather than occasional peaks, may play a more important role in cardiovascular risk, at least in settings with relatively low overall pollution, such as Denmark. Further studies are required to assess these associations in different populations and higher pollution contexts to fully delineate the cardiovascular impact of air pollution. Expanding research to populations with higher average air pollution and including women and younger people may help clarify whether these findings hold true elsewhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian researchers reveal how your view of your partner's looks, and how you think they see you, can make or break relationship satisfaction. Mutual appreciation and reduced body criticism are key. Physical appearance and attractiveness play important roles in romantic relationships. Prior research has shown that satisfaction with one's partner's looks, including weight and body shape, positively relates to relationship satisfaction. Moreover, feeling that one's partner is attracted to them is associated with both partners' satisfaction with the relationship and self-image. Studies suggest that perceiving a partner as attractive may enhance commitment and marital satisfaction, with some findings pointing to stronger effects for men. In addition to attractiveness, how individuals perceive their partner's satisfaction with their appearance can influence relationship and sexual satisfaction. This perception may be shaped by assumed similarity (e.g., projecting one's satisfaction onto the partner) and actual accuracy in judgment. Furthermore, body-related comments – particularly criticism – can significantly affect body image and relationship quality. While this has been mostly studied in women, there is growing evidence that men are also negatively affected by partner body criticism. However, little is known about how such criticism influences one's partner's perception of their satisfaction with their appearance and, in turn, relationship quality. This study examined how factors related to appearance – specifically satisfaction with a partner's appearance, what someone perceives to be their partner's satisfaction with their appearance, and whether someone believes their partner views their appearance critically – are linked to the quality of relationships among heterosexual couples. The participants were French-speaking adults who had been in a relationship for at least six months. Each partner completed an online questionnaire independently. The sample was predominantly White, with an average age of about 44 years and an average relationship length of nearly 11 years. Measures included each person's satisfaction levels with their partner's appearance, what they perceived to be their partner's satisfaction levels with their (own) appearance, perceived levels of body criticism, and overall relationship quality, assessed via validated questionnaires. Notably, most of these measures were brief, relying on two-item scales, which the researchers acknowledge as a limitation. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling, and both direct and indirect effects were examined using bootstrapped confidence intervals. The study found moderate similarity between heterosexual romantic partners in how they perceived each other's appearance: partner appearance satisfaction and perceived levels of the partner's satisfaction with their appearance, and a lower similarity in perceived criticism related to one's appearance. Analysis confirmed that satisfaction with a partner's appearance and perceived partner satisfaction with one's appearance were positively linked to self-reported relationship quality for men and women. Additionally, body criticism was negatively associated with perceived levels of the partner's satisfaction and, indirectly, with relationship quality. Interestingly, on average, a woman's satisfaction with her partner's appearance also directly improved his satisfaction in the relationship, although the researchers note that this “partner effect” was modest and should be interpreted cautiously until confirmed by further studies. Supplementary analyses showed these associations remained stable after controlling for age and weight concerns. Researchers found evidence of two important indirect pathways: one from men's perception of body criticism from their partner to men's relationship quality via men's perceived partner satisfaction with their appearance, and another from men's satisfaction with their partner's appearance to the quality of women's relationships through women's perceived partner satisfaction. The authors suggest that the observed links may be bidirectional; for example, people who feel more satisfied in their relationship may also perceive their partner's appearance more positively. The study highlighted how satisfaction with one's partner's appearance and the absence of body criticism from their partner play important roles in perceived relationship quality. Assumed similarity (believing a partner feels similarly) and accuracy (correctly perceiving a partner's feelings) both contributed to these dynamics. The study design using both partners' responses was a key strength, allowing for the exploration of partner effects. However, the study relied on self-reports and very brief measures, and its cross-sectional nature prevents conclusions about causality. The sample was also limited to mostly White heterosexual couples, reducing generalizability. Future research should use longitudinal designs and include more diverse participants. Findings suggest that promoting open, balanced conversations about appearance could support healthier relationships, as long as appearance is just one of many appreciated partner qualities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that causes lower oxygen levels during sleep, is linked to degeneration of brain regions associated with memory through damage to the brain's small blood vessels, according to a study published May 7, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study does not prove that sleep apnea causes this degeneration; it only shows an association. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when throat muscles relax during sleep, blocking the airway, causing a person to wake up repeatedly to breathe. This disrupted sleep pattern can lower oxygen levels, which in turn can damage small blood vessels in the brain. REM sleep is the stage when most dreams occur and is associated with numerous critical functions in sleep including memory consolidation and processing of emotional experiences. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that increases with age, and low oxygen levels during sleep can harm the ability of our brain and body to function properly. Our study found that low oxygen levels from obstructive sleep apnea, especially during REM sleep, may be linked to cognitive decline due to damage to the small blood vessels in the brain and the downstream impact of this damage on parts of the brain associated with memory." Bryce A. Mander, PhD, study author, University of California Irvine The study included 37 people with an average age of 73 who did not have cognitive impairment. Of the group, 24 people had obstructive sleep apnea. Researchers found that lower oxygen levels during REM sleep were associated with higher levels of white matter hyperintensities in the brain. White matter hyperintensities are bright spots that appear on brain scans which are thought to reflect damaged white matter tissue. This damage can be caused by injury to small blood vessels in the brain. Minimum blood oxygen saturation levels during sleep and the total time spent asleep below a blood oxygen level of 90% predicted the amount of total white matter hyperintensities in the brain. Having a blood oxygen level of 90% or lower is cause for concern. They found having more white matter hyperintensities was linked to decreased volume as well as reduced thickness in these areas. Researchers found that deficits in sleep-dependent memory were linked to reduced thickness of the entorhinal cortex. "Taken together, our findings may partially explain how obstructive sleep apnea contributes to cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease through the degeneration of brain regions that support memory consolidation during sleep," said Mander.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study co-led by Indiana University School of Medicine researchers presents a potential new strategy to prevent or slow the progression of Type 1 diabetes by targeting an inflammation-related protein known to drive the disease. The findings, recently published in eBioMedicine, may help inform clinical trials of a drug that is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for psoriasis as a treatment for Type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The loss of these cells leads to high blood sugar levels and requires ongoing insulin therapy and careful monitoring to avoid severe health complications. In laboratory studies using human cells and mouse models, the researchers found that applying a molecular method to block inflammation signaling through the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) protein reduced harmful inflammation in the pancreas. A medication that inhibits TYK2 is already approved for the treatment of psoriasis, an autoimmune condition that causes skin inflammation. Our study showed that targeting TYK2 could be a powerful way to protect insulin-producing beta cells while calming inflammation in the immune system at the same time. This finding is exciting because there is already a drug on the market that does this for psoriasis, which could help us move more quickly toward testing it for Type 1 diabetes." Past genetic studies have already shown that people with naturally lower TYK2 activity are less likely to develop Type 1 diabetes, further supporting the group's approach for future treatments using this TYK2 inhibitor approach. "The next step is to initiate translational studies to evaluate the impact of TYK2 inhibition alone or in combination with other already approved drugs in individuals at-risk or with recent onset Type 1 diabetes." The Evans-Molina lab partnered on this study with Decio Eizirik, MD, PhD, a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles Center for Diabetes Research and other international collaborators. The research team hopes their findings will support future clinical trials to safely assess the efficacy of a new drug or drug combination in humans.

The buildup of amyloid plaques can be detected decades before symptoms appear. These plaques can be visualized and quantified by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Before the scan, participants completed surveys measuring anxiety, depression, memory concerns and motivation for lifestyle adjustments. They conducted the same surveys six months after learning their results. Results from the study show that participants who don't have amyloid buildup experienced significant emotional improvements: They reported much lower levels of depression, anxiety and memory complaints. However, their motivation to maintain lifestyle improvements also declined. Conversely, participants with amyloid presence didn't show increased depression or memory complaints but did experience a decrease in anxiety and motivation for lifestyle adjustments. The findings suggest that disclosing amyloid presence does not negatively affect participants, and simply knowing the results seems to decrease negative feelings overall." Michal Schnaider Beeri, Director, Herbert and Jacqueline Krieger Klein Alzheimer's Research Center at the Rutgers Brain Health Institute This study provides new insight into how individuals emotionally respond to learning their amyloid status, an underexplored topic, the researchers said. It also involves disclosing amyloid status to cognitively healthy individuals, a practice that wasn't common in previous studies. "The results highlight how easily people lose motivation to make lifestyle changes aimed at maintaining cognitive health," said Shekhtman. "These findings hold even greater significance in an era moving toward preventive Alzheimer's Disease therapies," said Lesman-Segev. "When such treatments become available, cognitively normal individuals will likely undergo screening with Alzheimer's biomarkers to qualify for targeted therapies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome has increased dramatically, investigators assessed the risk of age-related cardiovascular diseases in this population. Down syndrome was associated with 4.41-times higher risk of ischemic stroke and a 5.14-times higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke. (Ischemic strokes occur due to blocked blood flow to the brain, whereas hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding in or around the brain.) The overall risk of heart attack was similar in people with Down syndrome and other individuals but was increased in young people with Down syndrome. Our results show that individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk of some age-related cardiovascular outcomes, and indicate, in line with results from previous studies, that their cardiovascular risk factor profile differs from the general population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study reveals that certain caffeine metabolites in urine are linked to diabetic retinopathy risk in men, offering a promising path toward noninvasive biomarkers for early screening and disease prevention. Study: The association between urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites and diabetic retinopathy in individuals with diabetes: NHANES 2009–2014. High-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) assays revealed that excessive urinary levels of 1-MU, 1,7-DMU, 1,3,7-TMU, caffeine, and AAMU may indicate increased DR risk in US males. Future prospective studies are needed to validate these findings, but they may represent a crucial step in understanding diabetic indicators. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular diabetes complication that is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in adults over 50. The condition affected an estimated 103 million adults worldwide in 2020, and the number is expected to increase to approximately 160 million by 2045. While modern anti-DR interventions (intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation) have proven effective, they are invasive and costly, underscoring the need for improved screening and detection methods to reduce disease incidence. Caffeine, a secondary plant metabolite found in coffee, tea, and soft drinks, is the most widely consumed active pharmacologic substance globally. Research suggests caffeine intake may help mitigate cardiovascular and diabetes risks, but findings are conflicting. Understanding associations between caffeine, its metabolites, and DR may support future screening strategies. This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), focusing on participants who had complete sociodemographic, medical, and urine sample data. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), urine creatinine, smoking status, alcohol use, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and total energy intake. DR was also self-reported following medical consultation. Urine samples were analyzed using HPLC–ESI–MS/MS for caffeine and 14 metabolites (15 total substances). Baseline characteristics were compared using Rao-Scott Pearson χ² tests and t-tests. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) for DR associations. Of 50,974 NHANES participants, 514 were included in the final analysis. After adjusting for covariates, ln-transformed 1-MU and AAMU levels were associated with increased DR risk. Researchers noted that metabolite intercorrelation may confound these findings. For instance, 1,3,7-TMU's association may be driven by its strong correlations with 1-MU and caffeine. As a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported data, the findings indicate correlation, not causation. Nonetheless, caffeine metabolites may serve as useful biomarkers in DR risk screening. This study highlights caffeine metabolites as potential indicators of DR risk, especially in US males. While prospective studies are needed to confirm these results, urine-based metabolite analysis may aid early DR detection and preventive care strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dried Gapal, a staple in Burkina Faso, packs energy and essential minerals, but new research shows its phytic acid levels could be holding back key nutrients like zinc. Study: Nutritional composition of dried Gapal, a highly nutritious food based on fermented cereal and milk. Researchers at the Research Institute for Applied and Technological Sciences, Burkina Faso, recently analyzed the nutritional composition of dried Gapal, a fermented milk-cereal mixture widely consumed in Burkina Faso. Gapal is a traditional food among the Fulani people in Burkina Faso. It is a mixture of fermented milk and cereals, and is available in dried or yogurt-like form. Millet paste and milk are primarily used for the production of Gapal, with the addition of baobab pulp, spices, and sugar. Pearl millet, commonly used for Gapal production, contains high amounts of minerals, including calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, and potassium. The lactic acid bacteria-based fermentation process enriches gapal nutritionally and improves its flavor, texture, digestibility, and shelf life. However, some millet components, such as phytates, can reduce the bioavailability of micronutrients by reducing their biodegradability. Food processing methods, including germination, fermentation, and hulling, can remove these components. During the combined fermentation of milk and millet dough, lactose is converted into lactic acid, which produces volatile molecules, which in turn increase the taste and nutritional value of Gapal. Despite its high nutritional quality and increasing usage in major cities in Burkina Faso, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the proximate composition and nutritional properties of this indigenous food. For the first time, researchers at the Research Institute for Applied and Technological Sciences comprehensively analyzed the nutritional composition of Gapal to develop a database for future research. They purchased Gapal samples from five major cities in Burkina Faso. They assessed the protein, lipid, carbohydrate, free amino acid, mineral, and phytic acid content of these samples using standard methods. The researchers found considerable variations in nutritional composition between Gapal samples collected from five major cities. There was notable variability in nutrient content not only between cities but also among different producers within the same city, reflecting the lack of process standardization. Among minerals, the samples contained potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, and manganese. These levels varied considerably across the different samples. Only proline and lysine were consistently detected in all Gapal samples; other free amino acids, including some essential amino acids, were found sporadically and at low levels. The tested samples exhibited significant variations in moisture content, pH, and acidity. The moisture content of these samples was higher than that reported for other Gapal-like food products, such as kishk and tarhana, which might impact their storage. The study also determined the molar ratios of phytate to key minerals, such as zinc, iron, and calcium, in order to estimate bioavailability. The phytate: zinc (Phy :Zn) molar ratio in dried Gapal samples often exceeded 15, a threshold above which zinc bioavailability is considered significantly reduced by the World Health Organization. In contrast, the phytate: iron and phytate: calcium ratios were lower, suggesting that iron and calcium in dried Gapal might be more bioavailable than zinc. According to the study findings, Gapal contains high levels of carbohydrates, which can be attributed to its millet content. The pH and acidity of dried Gapal are similar to those of similar food products such as kishk and tarhana, although Gapal has a slightly lower lactic acid content, which may be due to differences in fermentation and drying time. The production process of kishk and tarhana includes 5-day fermentation, followed by 3-day drying. In contrast, Gapal production consists of a combined drying and fermentation process lasting 3 to 5 days. A slightly lower lactic acid content observed in dried Gapal might also be attributed to its shorter fermentation and drying duration and the smaller quantity of milk added during production. Dried Gapal has been detected to have a lower protein and lipid level compared to similar millet-based foods. Proteins in Gapal come from both milk and millet, and the observed reduction in protein content might be due to production-related loss, which can be improved by increasing the fermentation process. Only proline and lysine, free amino acids, have been detected in all Gapal samples; other essential amino acids such as valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine were detected only sporadically and at low levels. A low milk content in dried Gapal (approximately 20%) might limit the availability of free amino acids. However, as researchers mentioned, the digestion of Gapal could facilitate the release of other, more abundant amino acids. High levels of vital minerals have been detected in tested samples. However, the bioavailability of these minerals could be compromised by the high phytic acid content of dried Gapal. Millet is the primary source of phytic acid in Gapal, and existing evidence indicates that the phytic acid content of millet can be reduced through hulling (a process of removing the outer husk of millet) and fermentation processes. The authors also note several limitations of their study. They were not able to determine the vitamin content or the total amino acid content of Gapal. Additionally, the study was limited in its geographic scope and sample size, suggesting that further research should include more towns and a greater number of samples. The authors recommend that future studies focus on standardizing manufacturing processes and assessing the sensory and sanitary qualities of Gapal for a more complete nutritional evaluation.
