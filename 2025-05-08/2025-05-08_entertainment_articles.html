                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prevost appears to have been an active user of Twitter, now known as X, since 2011. In 2015, Prevost tweeted an article critical of then-candidate Trump's ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù ‚Äúanti-immigrant rhetoric.‚Äù In a recent February 2025 post, which has gone viral since Prevost's elevation, he wrote that Vice President J.D. ‚ÄúJesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,‚Äù Prevost wrote. In his most recent post before entering Conclave, Prevost criticized Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for making light of the deportation and detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. ‚ÄúWOKE MARXIST POPE,‚Äù wrote Laura Loomer ‚Äî a far-right 9/11 conspiracy theorist who is close enough to Trump to advise him on national security staffing decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Andrew Walker has played lots of cool roles in his tenure as one of Hallmark's biggest stars, from pilot to firefighter to hockey pro. But nothing quite compares to his latest role as a real-life dolphin rescuer. On May 6, 2025, Walker and his wife Cassandra Troy leaped into action when they spotted an animal in distress near the Vancouver home where they're staying. The couple shared an Instagram video of their epic adventure, working with trained rescuers to get the injured dolphin to safety. Despite the sad outcome, Walker told EntertainmentNow the rescue was an ‚Äúincredible experience‚Äù and Troy wrote in her post that they are so ‚Äúgrateful for the people doing this work every day.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome birders noticed a fin going back and forth in the shallow water,‚Äù Walker told EntertainmentNow on May 8, noting that the group found ‚Äúa dolphin with scratch marks on her back, by herself, which is not normal for dolphins.‚Äù Once the rescuers arrived, Walker said, they ‚Äúpropped the dolphin into a carrying tarp with handles.‚Äù Amazed that dolphins can weigh 250 pounds, he told EntertainmentNow, ‚Äúthey needed extra hands to take turns‚Äù holding and carrying the tarp. ‚ÄúSince our house has direct access to the water and street, they used our backyard and driveway to carry her through,‚Äù Walker said. The male dolphin, whom rescuers nicknamed Pickles, was then transported to VAMMR for ‚Äústabilization and emergency care,‚Äù per the organization, which responds to more than 300 marine mammal emergencies every year. The nonprofit is Canada's only dedicated marine mammal rescue facility and aims to eventually release each animal it cares for back into the ocean. An Instagram video Hynes posted showed him walking along the muddy shoreline with a scissors and kneeling down to help the scared and stuck bird. Despite it flapping its wings in fear, Hynes gained its trust as he gently cut away fishing line wrapped around the bird's webbed foot. Meanwhile, Walker and Hynes' Hallmark pal Jonathan Bennett also saved a bird at his California home in late February. Fans and friends have been thrilled by all three Hallmark stars' wildlife rescues, including one who wrote on the dolphin post, ‚ÄúHow beautiful the Walkers are heroes üê¨‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warning labels on tobacco products, alcohol, and potentially even social media all originate from the surgeon general's office. Surgeon generals often first serve as high-ranking doctors within the United States military, but President Donald Trump is continuing to expand his roster of unconventional hires by tapping a woo-woo wellness influencer to fill the position. ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce that Dr. Casey Means, will be nominated as our next Surgeon General of the United States of America,‚Äù Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. Here's everything you need to know about the woman who will potentially be America's next top doctor: Means is a prominent influencer within the ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù (MAHA) movement championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ‚Äî whom she advises. Means is probably best known for her 2024 book Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, which she co-wrote with her brother. Before her foray into literary pop-medicine, Means co-founded Levels, a startup that sold wearable glucose monitors and facilitated blood tests to help users track their metabolic health through a subscription-based app. Means has appeared on massively popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience ‚Äî where she suggested there may be a link between vaccines and developmental disorders ‚Äî and The Tucker Carlson Show. In one post, means recounted how in an effort to find love in her mid-thirties, she created a shrine where she prayed to her ancestors for guidance, performed ‚Äúfull moon‚Äù ceremonies, did mushrooms, and literally spoke to trees on solo hikes. In another blog post, she admitted that she converses with ChatGPT to discuss ways to stop a ‚Äútotal global ecosystem collapse with human health as one piece of collateral damage.‚Äù Other posts advertise videos on ‚ÄúTHREE FOODS WORSE THAN COCAINE.‚Äù You get the idea. Means has an MD from Stanford University, and was on track to become an otolaryngological surgeon before quitting her residency in order to pursue studies in ‚Äúfunctional medicine‚Äù ‚Äî a form of alternative medicine that claims to prioritize treating the root cause of disease over the symptoms. Functional medicine has been accused of using excessive testing and analysis on patients where a standard diagnostic matrix would suffice, and of veering towards pseudoscientific practices that can be harmful to a patient's health. Trump's Assault on Veterans Is Already Taking a Toll Voice of America Will Be Fed OAN's Far-Right Coverage, Says Trump Admin How aligned is Casey Means and RFK Jr. on issues like vaccines? Means has a friendly relationship with HHS secretary and known anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and was openly supportive of his nomination for the position. ‚ÄúThere is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children,‚Äù she wrote as part of an October ‚Äúwish list‚Äù for the presidency. Means and her brother, Calley Means, have been very public about their relationship with Kenendy, supporting both his failed presidential candidacy and his current position as HHS secretary. It's no surprise, given that much of their messaging around processed foods, Covid-19, mental illness, and the general state of public health in America overlap significantly with Kennedy's views. Last year, Calley Means claimed to have had a vision of Kennedy and Trump standing side by side together while praying for Kennedy during a campaign event, and reportedly became heavily involved in the Trump 2024 presidential transition project. During an Oval Office press gaggle on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he actually doesn't know Means at all.

Christopher Nolan may make cinema history yet again with his Universal adaptation of ‚ÄúThe Odyssey.‚Äù One of the film‚Äòs stunt performers, James Newman, said during the ‚ÄúAction for Everyone‚Äù podcast, as reported by Screenrant, that the feature is going to be ‚Äúan epic of all epics‚Äù and is auteur Nolan ‚Äúat his best.‚Äù The film was announced in December 2024 as Nolan's 13th feature. The ensemble cast includes a slew of reunions for Nolan in addition to working again with Damon, including Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Elliot Page, and Benny Safdie. Tom Holland, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, and John Leguizamo also star.

That means that the battle sequences are even more bloody, and the locations are even more daring places to shoot. ‚ÄúThe coordinator came to us with scout pictures of locations, and it's just all over Europe because Odysseus' journey is crazy, it's like 10 years long. They found locations and Nolan would go like, ‚ÄòOK, this cave, has anyone ever filmed here before?' [Nolan] is like, ‚ÄòOK, great, we're going to film here.' One location, which Newman believed to be Odysseus' home in the film, is a two kilometer hike on an incline to even reach. All the rumors about Tom being physically able are so true. He should get every physical role possible,‚Äù Newman said. As for Damon's Odysseus, Newman continued, ‚ÄúMatt definitely wanted to be more efficient because that's the character. So he isn't going to do flashy things.‚Äù Actor Leguizamo said during MSNBC's ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù that Nolan still works like an independent filmmaker despite having a massive budget. ‚ÄúHe's like an indie filmmaker but with crazy money.‚Äù We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White smoke billowing from the Sistine Chapel on Thursday signaled that a conclave of cardinals have selected a new pope: Robert Prevost of the United States. He is the first American Pope in history and will go by Leo XIV. CNN reports that Prevost did missionary work in Peru and led a Vatican office for vetting bishops. The largest group of cardinals in history, 133 total, had sequestered themselves in the iconic Vatican City chapel to determine Pope Francis' successor, following his death last month after a 12-year papacy. The New York Times reports that the conclave itself lasted a little more than 24 hours; previous elections have stretched out two or three days. New Pope Elected: Robert Prevost Named First American Pontiff in History People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Pope Francis, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires in 1936, died on April 21, a couple of months after he was hospitalized with bronchitis. Pope Francis had struggled with respiratory issues for most of his life following a battle with pneumonia when he was a young man. Pushing a more progressive agenda than his predecessors, Pope Francis preached understanding and humanity. His final message to the public was, ‚ÄúThere can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression.‚Äù His papacy was marked by what people viewed as liberal stances toward LGBTQ+ community, climate change, capitalism, and divorce, though others criticized his comments about women's roles in society and a homophobic slur he made last year.

Rozek, now 70, had no filmmaking background, only a passion for the arts and to find people willing to help him make movies. Ironically, the current fate of Rozek's film ties directly into what it's about. Rozek, through Huppert, interrogates the purpose of plots and stories in films, considering them distractions from the medium's ability to reflect reality back at us. and ‚ÄòTootsie' at the Oscars ‚Äî Today, It's Still a Great Movie ‚ÄòGlengarry Glen Ross,' ‚ÄòFifty Shades,' and ‚ÄòFear' Director James Foley Dead at 71 Rozek sees the hostile indifference towards‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù as an injustice summed up by a line Huppert says in the film: ‚ÄúThey never let you have any of it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI've not had a conventional life,‚Äù Rozek told IndieWire. He grew up in New Jersey in the 1960s before studying English at Vanderbilt University, where he began writing articles for The Village Voice and Rolling Stone. He spent time in public relations before he walked away from office jobs to pursue freelance writing full-time, with over 2,000 articles to his name, and even ran his own independent publication in the 1990s called Rozek's. Rozek remembers traveling to New York City as a teenager to watch movies, although filmmaking wasn't a career choice he had in mind. A purchase of a DVD player in the 2000s rekindled his interest in international film through The Criterion Collection, and after a difficult 10-year period of his life, he knew he reached a point where he had something to say: ‚ÄúI needed to go through those 10 years to learn what life was all about, to live in poverty, to be under severe duress for a long time, so you really find out who you are and what you want to do. In 2011, while living in Boise, Idaho, without a computer, he wrote his first screenplay at the public library and deployed a simple, persistent strategy: write as many scripts as he could and only send them to European producers, a choice he made ‚Äúsomewhat under the illusion that European cinema was much freer and artistic than American cinema.‚Äù Rozek applied the same tenacity from his career as a freelance journalist, claiming to have sent over 20,000 emails to producers. He got a response back from Philippe Carcassonne, a French producer who's worked with directors like Beno√Æt Jacquot and Florian Zeller (Carcassonne received an Oscar nomination for Zeller's ‚ÄúThe Father‚Äù). Before he even received a response from producers to his script, Rozek got a hold of Rowlands' home phone number and called her up himself to see if she'd be interested. Rozek sent the script to Carcassonne, who expressed interest in producing it, but the experience of trying to get Rowlands soured him on finding an actress through representation. Rozek asked if Carcassonne knew anyone he could hand his script to directly. The radical nature of a one-character, direct-address feature meant even someone as connected as Carcassonne had difficulty finding funds for several years. A budget of around $350,000 was eventually secured, and ‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù filmed over three days, with Rozek remotely directing from home due to travel restrictions amid the ongoing pandemic. The short timeline meant some aspects of the script, like Huppert delivering a monologue in a town square, were scrapped in favor of only using one location. ‚ÄúWhat matters to me is my script and a great actor,‚Äù he said assuredly. Production wrapped over Thanksgiving weekend of 2022, and Rozek locked his cut by Christmas. And while Rozek offers nothing but praise and respect for Huppert in what he calls her ‚ÄúBrechtian‚Äù performance, she has not spoken publicly about ‚ÄúMarianne.‚Äù When I asked him why she hadn't done anything to promote the film, his response was succinct: ‚ÄúI don't want to speak for Isabelle Huppert.‚Äù (Her representatives did not respond to request for comment.) Since the premiere, and with no prospects of ‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù screening at festivals or securing a release, Rozek is now a lone crusader for his film, and he isn't afraid to make as much noise as he can to get anyone's attention. His attempts to drum up interest for the film through ‚Äúguerrilla marketing‚Äù had limited results. He turned to social media, repeatedly calling out the film industry and media on his X, formerly Twitter, account for ‚Äúsuppressing‚Äù the film, a confrontational strategy he won't speak to me about (‚Äúit's self-evident,‚Äù he said). The way Rozek sees it, given Huppert's star power and his film's low budget, the industry's aversion to ‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù is another sign of their lack of creativity: ‚ÄúYou can't make a profit with that? Rozek explained how it all linked into ‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù and his ongoing fight to get it seen: ‚ÄúYou've got an industry that is taking away your humanity, calling you eyeballs and butts in seats, running a diet of unreality toward you with no other chance of consuming anything else. When a film like mine appears, and they basically exterminate it, you got to get mad, man.‚Äù While Rozek continues to wonder why, in his eyes, people ‚Äúhate‚Äù his film, he remains optimistic about its future as the film slowly gains admirers. One of those admirers includes a self-described ‚Äúdistribution veteran‚Äù who said Rozek's debut was ‚Äúalready suggesting a major auteurist stamp and flying in the face of conventional wisdom.‚Äù They will help Rozek independently distribute ‚ÄúMarianne‚Äù across theaters in America and is currently looking for venues to screen the film. It's a move that ties back to Cassavetes, who independently released his films, and Rozek hopes the film will connect with audiences willing to engage with its ideas. He has other scripts he hopes to make, and mentions a film manifesto he's working on that relates to his ideas in ‚ÄúMarianne.‚Äù He summed up his aspirations with a declaration one wouldn't necessarily expect from a filmmaker starting out in their 70s: ‚ÄúMy goal in doing what I'm doing is to be known before I die as one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived.‚Äù We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 24-year-old ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù contestant Josh King was cut from season 23 on May 5, 2025, host Ryan Seacrest revealed the singer's heartwarming connection to his charitable work. King has been lauded for trying to sacrifice his spot in the top seven so 16-year-old Mattie Pruitt could advance, and it turns out those kinds of acts of kindness are common from the Charlotte, North Carolina, native. In an Instagram video posted on May 7, Seacrest's charitable foundation shared that long before auditioning for ‚ÄúAmerican Idol,‚Äù King was regularly volunteering at Charlotte's Levine Children's Hospital in its Seacrest Studios facility, a multimedia broadcast center that opened in 2013 to allow celebrity guests and young patients perform, interact and create fun content for patients. Captioning the video, the Ryan Seacrest Foundation wrote, ‚ÄúJosh King may be saying goodbye to the @AmericanIdol stage, but his music journey is far from over üé§üí´ When he's not performing for millions, he's bringing music, laughter and light to patients at @LevineChildrens through ‚ÄòTunes at Two' in #SeacrestStudios. We can't wait to see where his talent takes him next‚Äù The Ryan Seacrest Foundation's social media video showed a conversation between Seacrest and King at his audition for ‚ÄúAmerican Idol,‚Äù which took place last fall but aired in early March. Seacrest, whose foundation has built similar studios at more than a dozen children's hospitals across the U.S., chimed in, ‚ÄúBut it gives them something to (help them) forget about what they're going through.‚Äù King called it a ‚Äúvery rewarding experience‚Äù and told Seacrest, ‚ÄúI enjoyed it so much, just being able to have that opportunity just to do something good for the community.‚Äù Telling King his generosity was ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù Seacrest said, ‚ÄúYou're making a lot of kids and staff happy.‚Äù The video of King, who has also been a volunteer piano player at Charlotte's Douglas International Airport for several years, was flooded with comments from fans who were touched by his acts of kindness. God knows his heart and has good things in store for him! King, who emotionally shared on ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù that he had few friends back home and cherished the friendships he made on the show, wrote on Instagram after his elimination, ‚ÄúThis show saved me, and I hope y'all understand just how much it means to me to be a part of it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe production and crew were also freaking amazing to work with,‚Äù he continued. It was awesome as a contestant knowing that they were behind us every step of the way, and I can never thank them enough for that.‚Äù</p>

Ed and Lorraine Warren have one final case to crack in the iconic ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù franchise. Related Stories ‚ÄòHenry Johnson' Star and Producer Evan Jonigkeit Doesn't Always Agree with David Mamet ‚Äî Their First Film Together Is Better for It Did the Success of ‚ÄòThe Substance' and ‚ÄòAnatomy of a Fall' Finally Teach Cannes a Lesson? Steve Coulter is returning as Father Gordon, with Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, K√≠la Lord Cassidy, Beau Gadsdon, John Brotherton, and Shannon Kook co-starring. Chaves directs from a screenplay by Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, with a story by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, James Wan. The film is based on characters created by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, and inspired by true events. Director Chaves told Entertainment Weekly that there was a discussion of including all of the prior ‚ÄúConjuring‚Äù villains for an ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame‚Äù-inspired final film. ‚ÄúI felt strongly that the biggest, most emotional story we could tell was the most personal story.‚Äù Producer Wan, who also directed the first two ‚ÄúConjuring‚Äù films, agreed that it was best to center the feature solely on Farmiga and Wilson's characters. ‚ÄúThe beating heart of this franchise is Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson playing Ed and Lorraine,‚Äù Wan said. I do think that's what people love about it. At least for me and [producer] Peter Safran, it's really about finding a way to tell the stories of these characters and to wrap them up in a way that feels respectful to where we started with them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe other three were about hauntings, and this one is about reckoning, in a way,‚Äù she said. Farmiga previously worked closely with the real-life Lorraine Warren before she died in 2019. Farmiga posted a tribute at the time saying that Lorraine Warren was a ‚Äúdear friend‚Äù who ‚Äútouched my life.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Last Rites‚Äù is executive produced by Michael Clear, Judson Scott, Natalia Safran, John Rickard, Hans Ritter, and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúApologies Mr Carpenter,‚Äù Usher commented Wednesday (May 7) on Carpenter's Instagram post in apparent tongue-in-cheek fashion alongside sweating and cherry emojis. The apology was made on the singer's photo carousel showing her night at the Met Gala, one of which included a screenshot of her father's reaction to Usher feeding his daughter a cherry. Weird,‚Äù David Carpenter texted Sabrina with the photo. ‚ÄúOkay last slide is CLASSIC dad text,‚Äù one person wrote. Usher had surprised the lucky attendees inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night with a performance alongside Stevie Wonder. It's unclear when exactly the singer went into his cherry trick with Carpenter, which has been a staple of the 46-year-old's shows since his Las Vegas residency. ‚ÄúIt started with strawberries in Vegas,‚Äù he explained on The Jennifer Hudson Show earlier this year. ‚ÄúSo, you know, I just figured we try all the fruits until we figured out which one works the best. But cherries were something that I felt was fun and just kind of active. Carpenter rocked a sleek maroon Louis Vuitton body suit at the Met Gala, and then hit some afterparties in a black Louis Vuitton suit and a fur coat alongside her ‚ÄúTaste‚Äù music video co-star Jenna Ortega and Chappell Roan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YouTube stars now reach as much people as legacy media ‚Äî and they're poaching some of the top players to grow even bigger. The section of plane is now a film set, where the popular video creator Dhar Mann uses it to shoot original scripted fare, all embracing his philosophy of trying to ‚Äúinspire, uplift, and bring a little more positivity into the world.‚Äù At any given moment some eight videos are shooting, keeping his staff of nearly 200 busy. ‚ÄúIn the early days, when we were shooting out of my apartment and we needed different film sets, my dining room was a restaurant, my bedroom was a patient room for a hospital, every single thing in my apartment was used for production sets,‚Äù Mann recalls, noting that his apartment furniture still furnishes some of the sets. It's a far cry from his current studio, which owns a fleet of cars (including multiple police cars), not to mention that section of airplane. We use the same equipment, we have the same types of resources that the same production companies are doing on TV, well now you're seeing that on YouTube,‚Äù he says, adding that his company produces content at what he estimates to be 1/100th the cost of a traditional production. A producer instructs actors wearing white lab coats and safety goggles to react to something taking place offscreen (a giant ‚Äúelephant toothpaste‚Äù experiment is involved). Inside his studio building, Chow's K-pop inspired color palette of pinks, purples and blues flow into every room and set, from a locker-filled hallway that mimics a high school, to bedrooms and bathrooms that ‚Äî bright colors notwithstanding ‚Äî would be familiar to any teenager. I would not say that the earlier episodes are something that you could see on quote, unquote, real television,‚Äù says Chow, in a conference room (it also doubles as a conference room set) inside his building. ‚ÄúBut now, because of this space, because of the cameras we have, because of the level of storytelling and the detail that we put in our writing, I can definitely say that what we're making now is something that you could have seen as a Disney Channel Original Movie back in the day. The level of quality storytelling, detail, world building, is all there.‚Äù Chow and Mann are part of a new universe of professionalized creators springing up across Los Angeles and around the country, leveraging the reach of their social audiences and the monetization afforded by YouTube to build proper studio businesses. A new studio system being built next to the old one. Both Chow and Mann say that there has been substantial investor interest in their respective businesses, affirming a trend across the sector: Sports creators Dude Perfect raised $100 million in an investment round last year, and MrBeast is seeking to raise $200 million at a $5 billion valuation for his business. I built this amazing YouTube channel, but how could I have some sort of exit event, which allows me to live my life, buy my house, send my kid through college, but also allows me to not lose what I've built,‚Äù Mann says. ‚ÄúThey want to make more money while still being in control of their business creatively, and not have some media company that has never run a YouTube channel take over and may not understand how digital content works.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think everyone has come to recognize that our creators are truly next-gen media companies,‚Äù says Brian Albert, a senior YouTube's sales executive. ‚ÄúYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said that creators are the startups of Hollywood, and today, a lot of these startups are starting to look more and more like studios,‚Äù said Samir Chaudry on stage, as marketers from companies like Uber and Shopify nodded along. And increasingly, just as in traditional Hollywood, these studios are beginning to flourish outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. By now it's well known that MrBeast has turned Greenville North Carolina into a veritable company town, where his over-the-top unscripted concepts come to life; but in Birmingham Alabama, Kinigra Deon is building a scripted entertainment studio of her own. And in the sprawling city of Frisco, Texas, just north of Dallas, the sports creators Dude Perfect have built an 80,000 square foot headquarters, including an indoor turf football field (with uprights), a massive basketball court (with motorized nets for elaborate trick shots), a gaming center, gym and offices (with a hidden slide behind a bookshelf to ensure easy access to the first floor). The dudes are also constructing a permanent set for their YouTube variety show Overtime. During a recent visit to the facility, with YouTube executives, marketers and local officials exploring the space (many with their kids in tow), the Dudes used a device to blast giant smoke rings above attendees, and gave tours. ‚ÄúI think people's expectation of a YouTube channel can be very different when stepping into this building,‚Äù says Coby Cotton, one of the members of Dude Perfect, in a conference room located just steps from the basketball court and putting green. ‚ÄúThis is part one, but that's I think a huge component as well, where others will be able to film and produce content,‚Äù says Andrew Yaffe, Dude Perfect's CEO. ‚ÄúBecause we're in Dallas where every major athlete and celebrity comes through at some point in a given calendar year for a concert or competition, we hope that Dude Perfect will be a place that they will want to stop by just for fun, maybe bring their kids, shoot a piece of content, thinking of it the way they might already think about a late night show,‚Äù he says. On the tour of his Burbank facility, Mann noted how many of his crew members joined from places like Disney and Lionsgate, and that his company's CEO Sean Atkins was previously the president of MTV. As traditional media tries to survive the tumult impacting its business models, creator studios are becoming in many ways the hot place for media veterans to land. ‚ÄúWe have a casting director who used to work for Nickelodeon, she was the casting director for The Thundermans,‚Äù Chow says. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes we get pushback from people who are not that open-minded. Atkins, the CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, was one of those people, having left traditional media at MTV and Discovery to serve as the president of the creator-focused firm JellySmack before joining Mann's company. ‚ÄúI think the thing that makes these creators different is they were born in a world where they had to do everything. He says that last year, he received an offer to sell his company, but turned it down, betting on himself, and the future of creator-driven content sparked by YouTube, which has paid more than $70 billion out to those uploading videos to its platform. This is the most amazing career that I could ever dream of.‚Äù Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Christopher Frost said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter that he would "fiercely defend" Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, who was also named as a defendant in the suit. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Smokey Robinson has denied the ‚Äúvile, false‚Äù allegations of sexual assault after four women filed a lawsuit against the Motown singer Tuesday.


	In a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, affirmed that he was ‚Äúresponding on behalf of our clients Smokey and Frances Robinson,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe evidence will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon ‚Äî $50 million dollars, to be exact.‚Äù 




	‚ÄúThrough this process we have seen the bizarre theatrics of yesterday's news conference, as the plaintiffs' attorneys outlined vile, false allegations against Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, trying to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create,‚Äù Frost said in a statement Wednesday.

	Frost added that he would ‚Äúfiercely defend‚Äù Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, who was also named as a defendant in the suit, ‚Äúagainst these false allegations.‚Äù He additionally shared his plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and address ‚Äúnumerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies and relationships between the plaintiffs and others.‚Äù


	According to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on May 6, four anonymous women accused Robinson of raping them, with the causes of action including negligence, sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment and a hostile work environment, among other allegations including failure to pay them minimum page. 


	Robinson's wife, Frances, is also named in the suit, with the women alleging that she ‚Äúfailed to take the appropriate corrective action to prevent Defendant Robinson's deviant misconduct despite having full knowledge of his prior acts of sexual misconduct,‚Äù stating Robinson had settled claims with other women.
