And yet, this may have been one of the quieter days in Trump's second term so far - that extraordinary meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy was only a week ago. For context: White landowners still own three quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, while only 4% is owned by black people. Just before he wrapped up his remarks at the crypto summit a few minutes ago, Donald Trump signed yet another executive order. Appearing alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, he officially created a task force to prepare for the World Cup next year, which will be held in North America. As a result of Trump's order, Maxar Technologies, an aerospace company providing satellite imagery, has disabled access for Kyiv.</p>

"In recent days, Syria has witnessed a dangerous escalation of violence, brutality, and killings, resulting in attacks on innocent civilians, including women and children," the joint statement said. "The Christian churches, while strongly condemning any act that threatens civil peace, denounce and condemn the massacres targeting innocent civilians, and call for an immediate end to these horrific acts, which stand in stark opposition to all human and moral values," the statement said. Assad, himself an Alawite who sought to present himself as a protector of Syria's minorities, was ousted on December 8 in a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has since been appointed Syria's interim president. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</p>

The Vatican cited doctors as saying that the pontiff has remained stable, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days. The pontiff was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after a week-long battle with bronchitis.

The men, held since Thursday, collected their riot gear and left along a dirt road, escorted by local residents, AFP saw. Petro's government is proposing an ambitious crop substitution program to combat the drug trafficking economy, a strategy that locals have denounced as a campaign of "forced eradication" of coca crops.

Former UK defence secretary suggests Ukraine can still win the war if it continues holding off Russian forces Ben Wallace, the former UK defence secretary, has said Donald Trump’s decision to suspend US intelligence sharing with Kyiv is “suffocating” Ukrainian hope of holding out against Russian aggression. On Friday, the day after intelligence sharing ceased, Russia carried out massive ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine. Overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine on Saturday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozen more, including five children. Wallace suggested that Ukraine could still win the war if it continued holding off Russian forces.</p>

Over time, this will have a fundamental impact on Ukraine's ability to defend itself - and Trump's Democratic opponents say it's now beyond question that he is aligned with Russia. Zelensky refused Trump's demand for an "explicit public apology", instead penning a letter to the US president and calling their White House showdown "regrettable". Meanwhile, Zelensky urged EU leaders to support a limited truce at sea and in the air – an idea backed by French President Emmanuel Macron. But far bigger questions are now being asked about how Europe protects itself from what EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen calls a "clear and present danger". But the debate has begun, and Poland's Donald Tusk says clearly it would be safer "if we have our own nuclear arsenal".</p>

The final will be played July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. He gave Trump a personalized game ball and unveiled an elaborate trophy that will go to the winner of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, which will pit top soccer clubs against each other this summer ahead of next year’s matchup of national teams.

The United Russia party in the northern Murmansk region posted photos on social media showing officials smiling as they visited bereaved mothers with gifts of flowers and boxed meat grinders for International Women's Day on Saturday, which is widely celebrated in Russia. Russia is often accused of throwing its frontline soldiers into a "meat grinder" with scant regard for their lives. Russia has rarely given any figures for its losses in Ukraine and the true toll is unknown, but independent media put it at many tens of thousands. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and around 380,000 wounded. Media reports based on Western sources have given estimated Ukrainian military death tolls ranging from 50,000 to 100,000.</p>

A Pakistani man has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the administrator of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said Saturday. Mushtaq Ahmed was shot dead on Thursday evening in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province that borders Afghanistan, which has a history of bloody sectarian violence. A man named only as Ashfaq has been charged with his murder, according to police documents seen by AFP and a local police official. He said that both parties had arranged to meet and reconcile but alleges that Ashfaq turned up with a gun and opened fire, killing his brother.

But increasingly, runners such as Marco Arop, the 2023 world champion at 800 meters from Canada, whom Woods coaches, are also turning to “bicarb” for an edge. The benefits of “bicarb” have been known for decades, said Steve Magness, a coach and former elite runner who has written multiple books about performance. Fisher had heard so many “horror stories” of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea from using bicarbonate that he waited until this winter, after the all-important Olympics cycle, to test out a “bicarb” mixture in training. American Yared Nuguse, who broke the indoor mile record on Feb. 8, only for Norwegian rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen to reset it five days later, has said he doesn’t use bicarbonate because of its taste. They are powered by cutting-edge advancements Roger Bannister could only have dreamed of when he was chasing the first sub-4-minute mile — along with a basic household item, too.</p>

Zelensky said that Russia had struck Dobropillia, waited until rescuers arrived and then "deliberately" targeted them as well. "I'm finding it more difficult frankly to deal with Ukraine and they don't have the cards," Trump said on Friday. Zelensky is due to land in Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The meeting is a day before Ukrainian officials are expected to hold fresh talks with their US counterparts on Tuesday there. On Saturday, Russia said it had retaken three villages in its Kursk region previously captured by Ukraine.</p>

Sudan researcher Hamid Khalafallah said the desert UAE is interested in natural resources it lacks, including minerals and arable land. But in January, Washington accused the RSF of genocide for targeting ethnic groups with mass killings and gang rapes. Daglo's private finances are run from the UAE, Krieg said, adding that he had become "co-dependent" on Abu Dhabi. "Both internationally and within Africa, there is an increasing perception of the Emirates as a destabilising actor," he told AFP.</p>

A Syria war monitor reported on Saturday that more than 300 Alawite civilians have been killed in recent days by the security forces and their allies, as authorities clash with militants loyal to the former government of Bashar al-Assad. They are now facing their fiercest attacks yet by members of the Assad clan's Alawite minority and have launched a major counter-operation in the ethnic group's Mediterranean heartland triggered by deadly clashes on Thursday. In an address on Friday, Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa urged the insurgents to "lay down your weapons and surrender before it's too late".

The talks also involved specifics like the number of Palestinian prisoners that would be released from Israeli jails in exchange for Alexander - a point that Israel had not agreed to. Earlier, Netanyahu was dismissive of the idea that the US will hold direct talks with Hamas, but now that it is actually happening, he and his advisors are concerned, a source told Axios. "These talks went nowhere because what Hamas wanted was a ceasefire and prisoners, and it was in Israel's hands, not ours," the former Biden adviser said, adding that such direct talks would only aggravate the matter further. He initially suggested the direct talks with Hamas but that did not happen initially.On Wednesday evening, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account a new public ultimatum for Hamas to release the remaining hostages. He also said that in the event of Hamas not taking a "reasonable" approach, "there is going to be some action taken" by Israel.</p>

On Friday, Trump signed more executive orders at the White House before he convened a first-ever cryptocurrency summit with industry leaders. Trump urged congressional Republicans on Saturday to support and vote for the short-term government funding bill released earlier by House GOP leaders. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday limiting who is eligible to benefit from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the White House said, with a focus of barring those who work for nonprofit organizations engaging in "lawbreaking activities." President Donald Trump on Friday night announced he was naming Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, a month after he terminated its chair and several members. The reserve will be made up of bitcoin obtained via criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.</p>

President Donald Trump on Saturday urged congressional Republicans to support and vote for the short-term government funding bill. Notably, there are funding add-ons to the bill, known as "anomalies," including a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and a hike in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation operation. Democrats are not on board with the proposal, meaning Republicans need near-unanimous support. House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., slammed the GOP proposal in a statement released Saturday. "I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people," DeLauro wrote.</p>

“Visitors may wander at will across 8.4 million acres of superlative natural beauty,” the park’s website says. Over 1,600 species of plants — more than any other US national park — have been identified on this land that spans temperate rainforest to a dry ponderosa pine ecosystem. There are fewer mammal species here — only 18 — than on the mainland because animals must cross at least 14 miles of Lake Superior. Bush Key closes every year from February to September so that sooty terns and brown noddies can breed there undisturbed. A wide variety of rock types — including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary — are displayed within its walls.</p>

The U.S. is facing a dangerous gap in its ability to access nuclear fuel and stares down a potential supply chain shortage in enriched uranium — which is vital for America's energy and national security. The U.S. relies almost entirely on foreign exports, including from Russia, for its nuclear fuel needs — a factor that has put the U.S. in even greater jeopardy after Washington agreed to cut all uranium imports from Russia by 2028. "The whole world is dependent on Russia," Dan Leistikow, Vice President of Corporate Communications with American nuclear power company Centrus, told FOX Business. Unless we start building centrifuges in America quickly, the potential for a shortfall is real," said Leistikow. Under the Biden administration in 2024, Congress allocated $3.4 billion to expand U.S. low-enriched uranium capabilities, and in December six American companies were selected as the final contenders for the Trump administration to then choose from — including American Centrifuge Operating, LLC, which Centrus already works with to install and operate centrifuges.</p>

“Before even a movie is hatched, sometimes we’re having discussions about, can you imagine what this could be? First up was a look a look at new Star Wars entries, with Mandoloian filmmaker Jon Favreau joining imagineers in introducing Austin to the BDX droids and an animatronic droidsmith that will be seen walking around the Disney parks. You realize that there is a lot of technology, but at its heart are these people who are passionate about storytelling,” said Faverau, who shouted out the SXSW film festival where his feature Chef premiered in 2014 before leaving the stage. Said Docter, “We ask ourselves: ‘Is this somewhere I want to go if they build it at Disneyland?’” Doctor’s movie Monsters Inc. is the inspiration for a new rollercoaster modeled on the film’s “door vault” sequence where characters cling to suspended closet doors. It will be Disney’s first suspended roller coaster, with animatics getting oohs and aahs from the audience.</p>

"We can't keep passing on costs to our guests," Ferrara's president, Ernest Lepore, told ABC News. But small businesses, unlike grocery shoppers, are tied to the market wholesale price, making these surging costs particularly devastating. "The biggest difference of late is just that it has been more lethal and really devastated our nation's egg supply." Consequently, those small businesses that rely on eggs, like Ferrara Bakery and Square Diner, are forced to make difficult decisions. "This is not our customer's fault, but I don't know how long we're going to last without charging extra."</p>

This shift in control has led to increased skepticism, with critics fearing that the very nature of Bitcoin is being altered by government intervention. Industry figures had hoped for substantial policy declarations that would support crypto businesses and ease the regulatory burdens many face. NFT trader Clemente expressed his frustration, saying, “That was the most embarrassing thing I’ve ever witnessed. This suggests that traders, who had anticipated positive regulatory news or a bullish stance from Trump, were left disappointed by the lack of concrete policy changes. However, if the current trend of weak sentiment persists, Bitcoin could see further declines, with a possible drop to $84,000.</p>

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, continuing his administration's embrace of the cryptocurrency industry. The Digital Asset Stockpile also will come from assets seized in court proceedings. Sacks, a prominent tech investor, posted on X recently that he sold all of his cryptocurrency prior to Trump taking office. President Joe Biden's administration clashed with the volatile cryptocurrency industry over regulations, and brought enforcement actions against some crypto companies. “While there may be short-term volatility, over the long term a bitcoin reserve like this will serve as an important and stable store of value,” Lummis wrote in a letter published in The Wall Street Journal.</p>

You're reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. The famous investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS -1.41%) just did something that crypto investors need to know about. They aren't about to take any chances on frontier assets that could be easily supplanted by others, or regulated out of existence. Other cryptos that soon may have ETFs approved, like XRP, could easily be next on the shopping list for those same financial institutions. Instead, consider Goldman Sachs' move as a sign that there aren't too many remaining catalysts related to institutional acceptance of these coins.</p>

Meanwhile, with sub-second block times and near-zero fees, Solana enjoys growing mainstream popularity, which is evident in surging wallet downloads amid the TRUMP launch. Many L2s are designed to fit the native network and cannot support real-time applications such as decentralized gaming or cross-border payments. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade also does not fully resolve its fundamental scaling challenges, highlighting the urgency for enhanced scalability and stability. Data centers like Hut 8 and Coin Scientific are prioritizing AI workloads, which can generate up to 25 times more revenue than Bitcoin (BTC) mining.

“The aggressive push for deregulation, combined with opaque and unaccountable political contributions, has not only raised red flags among regulators but also eroded investor confidence and public trust in the long-term viability of these companies.” Such moves followed the departure on inauguration day, 20 January, of Gary Gensler, confirmed as SEC chair under Joe Biden but whom Trump had vowed to remove. “Crypto money played such an important role in the election,” Bruce Freed, CPA president, said. “Take a look at some of the candidates who went down where there was heavy crypto spending.

Bitcoin’s notoriously volatile again, shedding $10,000 in a single day as its price tumbled from $93,000 to $83,000.

US President Donald Trump has placed cryptocurrency at the center of his economic strategy, marking a major policy shift for the US blockchain industry, according to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek. Marszalek credited Trump with reversing policies like Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which allegedly led to crypto and tech firms being denied banking services under the Biden administration. Marszalek said ongoing dialogue with key regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could see “landmark legislation” pass. “The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph. While Trump has previously highlighted his intentions to bolster crypto innovation in the US, issuing regulatory frameworks takes time and setting the “right regulatory tone” will be crucial for the administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum — a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.</p>

Proponents argue that bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an inflation-proof value store outside the global financial system. “A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Proponents say a crypto strategic reserve could help financial stability by diversifying US national reserves beyond traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies. The likes of bitcoin are still viewed by many institutional investors with suspicion due to their price volatility and decentralisation. Other critics accused Trump of favoritism toward a highly speculative investment, without providing clear strategic benefits for the nation.</p>

While this was seen as a positive step, it wasn’t the major market-moving news many had anticipated. The White House summit, led by David Sacks, was highly anticipated after Trump’s promise to establish a crypto reserve that would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Earlier in the week, Trump’s posts on Truth Social triggered a massive rally, with some major cryptocurrencies surging up to 60 percent. However, on Friday, Sacks clarified that Trump’s mention of those five assets was just an example and not a firm commitment. At the summit, industry leaders praised Trump’s more open approach to crypto, seeing it as a shift from years of regulatory crackdowns focused on security and consumer protection.</p>

While both X and Y chromosomes are used in men, it has long been considered that only one X chromosome is in use the female body, with the other widely believed to be vacant. However, researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) believe they may have possibly debunked that theory. “In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men,” said the senior author of the paper, Dr Dena Dubal - a professor of neurology and chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease at UCSF. One of the genes, called PLP1, helps with myelin production - which is like insulation for brain cells, improving their communication. “We immediately thought this might explain how women’s brains remain resilient in typical aging, because men wouldn’t have this extra X,” said Margaret Gadek, first author of the paper and a graduate student of UCSF.</p>

We were looking at the long-term viability of operating a plant on solid fossil fuel. The big draw towards these pellets, which are made by industrial plants in Green Bay and Appleton, includes the fact that they have a similar output as coal, but not all plants can utilize it. But that’s kind of the thing is, we have these assets here. A second energy source is in the works as well, transforming industrial sludge waste into clean, burnable pellets.</p>

The Capitol City of St. Paul is preparing for a massive month. "It really is a shot in the arm to kind of get out of the winter doldrums and hit March at a dead sprint." Spencer said March is typically one of the slowest months for hospitality – and this year's surge could be a boon for bars, restaurants and hotels. "If you look at the bar/restaurant industry for example, March is not a good time generally speaking, but for us, this is our big boost, and from here, we really roll," Spencer said. Born and raised in Metro Detroit, Adam loves all things Michigan, but is thrilled to now call Minnesota home.</p>

Amber Whiting was a successful girls basketball high school coach in Idaho and had great connections to the AAU circuit when she was hired by BYU three seasons ago to replace Jeff Judkins. Whiting proved to be a good recruiter and her team in 2024-25 was led by Big 12 Freshman of the Year Delaney Gibb as well as sophomore Amari Whiting, Amber’s daughter who committed to Oregon before her mother took the BYU job. Of the team’s 14 league losses, nine were by single digits including two in overtime. The news release indicated associate head coach Lee Cummard will take over on an interim basis. Two freshmen from Idaho, Brinley Cannon and Kambree Barber, played key roles off the bench.</p>

Wagner, 34, led Washington with 132 tackles last season, a performance that earned him second-team All-Pro honors and his 10th Pro Bowl selection. I'm told Tommy DeVito will sign his exclusive rights free agent (ERFA) tender at some point this weekend, per sources. He played only three games during the 2024 season after suffering a partially torn right triceps, which required season-ending surgery.</p>

A rematch of one of this season's more thrilling Big Ten regular-season games is upon us Saturday as Ohio State faces Indiana on the road, seeking to avenge its home loss to the Hoosiers from mid-January. This time around, even more is at stake for the Hoosiers, whose NCAA Tournament hopes have been resurrected in recent weeks. 10 seed in Jerry Palm's latest bracket after wins in three of its last four and four of its last six, which has included victories over Michigan State, Purdue and Penn State. Ohio State likely enters this one highly motivated as well after grinding out a double-overtime win earlier in the week vs. Nebraska. It enters Saturday having won three of its last four, and I suspect it will be ready to make a statement in the regular-season finale with a chance to help solidify its NCAA Tournament résumé.</p>

SportsLine's Nick Stellini has evaluated the latest MLB future odds and found three longshots of 22-1 higher he loves. If both can saddle up every fifth day and pitch well, Boston's in great shape. He's also a third baseman, and Rafael Devers is already entrenched there, despite Bregman being the far superior defender. This was a team crying out for star power, and the brain trust simply didn't provide it. What I'm counting on here is Arizona snatching a Wild Card berth and then riding its pitching to the World Series.</p>

Ismaila Sarr's winning goal secured another important three points for the Eagles as they continue their run of good form. The victory over Ipswich means it's the Eagles fourth in a row and they have lost just one of their previous 13 matches. Sarr is having an excellent season for Palace and has now scored seven goals and registered three assists in 28 league games. Sarr then copied Jean-Philippe Mateta's trademark celebration by wheeling away and kicking the corner flag, to shouts of 'boom' from the Selhurst Park crowd.

Defending Bundesliga champions Bayer 04 Leverkusen found themselves unexpectedly upset by struggling SV Werder Bremen in a Saturday afternoon fixture. Xabi Alonso’s Werkself inability to make up ground in a title race already out of their grasp wasn’t the worst news, however. With noticeable concern plaguing his face, Xabi simply insisted that he had no information on Wirtz when speaking to Sky Germany after the full-time whistle. We had a decent spell in the second half, but overall it wasn’t good enough.” Wirtz might also miss out on representing Germany during the forthcoming international break.</p>

Sweet Sixteen: Liverpool's Lead in Premier League Grows to 16 Points as Ailing Man City Loses Again Liverpool's players have nine games left but surely won't need all of them to seal the title. City is in fourth place, at least for overnight, and has a fight on its hands just to finish in the top five, which should be enough to qualify for the Champions League this season. “The manager, his head was going for us but it's something you need sometimes," Salah said of Slot's halftime reaction. Southampton stayed 13 points from safety and looks destined for an immediate return to the Championship.</p>

In the NFL, one big move from a team can have a trickle-down effect, impacting the moves of other teams or players. Darnold, who sits atop Pete Prisco's Top 100 free agents for 2025, will officially become a free agent when the new league year begins on Wednesday, March 12 and teams can then begin to put in their offers. Teams can still try to lock up a verbal agreement with players as early as Monday, March 10 when the legal tampering period begins. 10 in the 2024 NFL Draft, so won't feel as much pressure as quarterback-needy teams to bring the checkbook out to sign a veteran.

But that's the label the Tar Heels took into both games with Duke in 2023 and both games against Duke in 2025. Even more of an indicator of just how differently these rivals are operating right now is the fact that Duke is a 9.5-point favorite on the road against a North Carolina team that's 1-10 in Quadrant 1 opportunities. At this risk of piling on, I'm compelled to highlight that every team in the SEC -- all 16 of them, even last-place South Carolina -- is better in the NET than every ACC team North Carolina has topped in this winning streak.

A Saturday morning tweet from Ian Rapoport of NFL Media says that quarterback Aaron Rodgers is “considering the Giants with the Vikings as a dark horse.” And J.J. McCarthy wouldn’t be thrilled about having his opportunity to become the starter delayed by a season. Maybe Rodgers can do for the Vikings what Favre couldn’t. If, at the end of the day, they can get Rodgers for whatever they’d budgeted to pay Darnold, maybe it makes sense.

Pete Carroll moved from Seattle to Las Vegas, and Geno Smith is moving with him, too. And based on how he's played in recent years, Smith still has some good football left him. Like most older quarterbacks, Smith can only truly have success at this stage of his career if he has a strong supporting cast around him. Either way, the Seahawks have decided to change course after enjoying moderate success with Smith under center.

Ultimately, it was not surprising that Fox wanted a change of scenery, especially considering that he wanted Brown to remain as coach and didn't appreciate how the organization handled the coaching change.

I’m just waiting for the experts to weigh in," said Cole, who noted he was getting second opinions. Cole allowed six earned runs in 2 2/3 innings of work against the Minnesota Twins, throwing 54 pitches and averaging 95.7 mph with his four-seam fastball. “In the game there was a lot of good stuff happening the other day, but as I got home I just continued to get more and more sore," Cole said. More broadly, they lost Juan Soto to the New York Mets in the winter and attempted to make up for it with a large swath of moves, including an eight-year, $218 million deal for starting pitcher Max Fried. Without Cole or Gil, New York would be poised to enter the 2025 season with a rotation along the lines of Fried, Clarke Schmidt, Carlos Rodón, Marcus Stroman (whom they're probably happy with not trading now) and something like Will Warren or non-roster invitee Carlos Carrasco.</p>

She described the situation as a result of insurance companies making medical decisions rather than doctors, and condemned UnitedHealthcare as “white-collar criminals.” Karen pledged to fight for health care reform in her daughter’s name for the rest of her life. I refer to UHC as ‘those white collar criminals’ whenever discussing them and vowed to fight for reform for the rest of my life,” Karen told Shelby. Karen’s letter is just one of many Mangione has received since his arrest in December. In a recent public statement, Mangione expressed gratitude for the support he has garnered, stating, “I am overwhelmed by – and grateful for – everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support.

If I, with all the resources and knowledge at my disposal, cannot cut through this red tape, what hope does any other American have? Patients suffering from cancer, chronic conditions or rare diseases are caught in a system that seems to value PBM corporate profits over human lives. The FTC’s latest report, released in January 2025, highlighted how PBMs added significant markups on specialty generics, inflating costs for cancer, HIV and other life-saving drugs. Even while under federal investigation, the FTC report shows how these middlemen generated $7.3 billion in revenue from 2017 to 2022 by steering patients toward their own pharmacies, reimbursing themselves at higher rates than independent competitors, and engaging in predatory practices like spread pricing.Yet despite growing evidence and bipartisan calls for reform, Congress failed to act at the end of 2024. President Donald Trump has made eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government a cornerstone of his administration’s agenda.</p>

Banners that read “Our health is at stake” and “European standard of care” were held by thousands of people who gathered in central Budapest on Saturday to demand additional money for Hungary’s long-neglected public health system. “It is a terrible thing that you have to weigh whether or not it is worth taking your elderly relative to the hospital with a minor problem, because she could end up dying there,” she stated. Sandor, a general practitioner who also chose not to provide his full name, bemoaned the pervasive lack of medical personnel.

While independence has taken centre stage in Greenland's election debate after renewed U.S. interest in the island, healthcare has long been a core issue, with vast distances and shortage of staff making it costly and difficult to give Greenlanders access to the care they need. "I have lost a lot of my own friends and family to cancer because they get diagnosed too late," Hansen said. It's like a death sentence for me because my own mother died of cancer," he said. Hansen spent three months in Copenhagen for his first treatment, and returned to Denmark for two further periods of two months respectively to receive treatment after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in October. "Also, the economy will have to be much stronger than it is today before we can even talk about independence."</p>

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Caesars Entertainment's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

This criticism was not limited to fans and social media users; a few Maulanas also weighed in, deeming Shami's actions inappropriate. The debate escalated into discussions about whether it was essential for Shami to fast during a high-intensity cricket match. Some critics even suggested that he should fast regardless of his professional commitments.</p>

Ranya confessed that she was a part of this smuggling network, which operates across borders and involves multiple women. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had previously acted on a tip-off, leading to Ranya’s arrest as she was returning from Dubai.
