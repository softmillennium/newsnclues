Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is continuing his battle against the health care industry from behind bars. In a series of emotional letters, Mangione has connected with supporters, including a mother named Karen, whose personal struggles with the health care system have deeply resonated with him.

Karen, who is fighting to afford her daughter’s medical care, wrote to Mangione after seeing his perp walk in December. The letter was shared by Ashley Shelby on her Substack, Bartleby on Trial, which covers Mangione’s case.

Driven by an unexplainable force, she felt compelled to reach out. In her letter, Karen recounted her difficult experiences with UnitedHealthcare, alleging the insurer denied coverage for her daughter’s life-threatening condition, even after she was hospitalised for 60 days in 2024. She described the situation as a result of insurance companies making medical decisions rather than doctors, and condemned UnitedHealthcare as “white-collar criminals.” Karen pledged to fight for health care reform in her daughter’s name for the rest of her life.

“What she and I went through as a result of insurance calling the shots rather than the doctors is a horrible story for another time. She is improving, but hardly close to her old self. I refer to UHC as ‘those white collar criminals’ whenever discussing them and vowed to fight for reform for the rest of my life,” Karen told Shelby.

“Your letter is the first to make me tear up. I am so, so sorry for what you and your daughter so senselessly had to endure,” Mangione wrote in response to the anonymous mother, identified only as Karen. He agreed to keep a photograph of Karen and her daughter, along with a print of Jesus she referenced, on his prison cell wall.

“Your daughter is blessed to have a mother who loves her so much and fights for her so relentlessly,” Mangione added.

Karen’s letter is just one of many Mangione has received since his arrest in December. In a recent public statement, Mangione expressed gratitude for the support he has garnered, stating, “I am overwhelmed by – and grateful for – everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. While I can’t reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive.”

Mangione is currently being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center on first-degree murder charges, in addition to federal terrorism charges. Prosecutors allege that the shooting of Thompson was a symbolic attack on the health care system, which Mangione had described in his manifesto as "parasitic." Despite the charges, Mangione has pleaded not guilty, and his case continues to draw national attention.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the need for the Trump administration to domesticate drug production within American borders. 

Why is it so hard to get the medications your doctor prescribes? Why do patients and families spend countless hours fighting for standard-of-care treatments? Why do potentially life-saving drugs get delayed for weeks or months? 

That these questions are too often asked can be blamed on one of the least understood problems in healthcare today: the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). These powerful middlemen – not your doctor – increasingly decide which medicines you get, how much you pay for them, and where you get them.

My role as CEO of the Pontchartrain Cancer Center has given me a front-row seat to the systemic dysfunction PBMs perpetuate. 

PBMs were originally created to lower drug costs and streamline access to medications. (iStock)

My 19-year-old daughter recently faced a medical condition that required a standard-of-care treatment prescribed by her doctor. Even with my professional expertise, her doctor and I spent countless hours fighting with a PBM to get her medication approved. It was finally approved in February, but it still took 10 long weeks before she was able to access it.

HERE'S HOW TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CHINA COULD IMPACT DRUG PRICING AND OTHER HEALTHCARE COSTS

Every step of the way, we encountered a system where no one wanted to take responsibility; one person after another passed the problem along like a game of hot potato. The psychological toll of this ordeal – on her, on our family and on her medical team – is beyond words. If I, with all the resources and knowledge at my disposal, cannot cut through this red tape, what hope does any other American have?

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Millions of patients across the country face similar barriers: forced to endure denials, delays, and disruptions to care because of the increasing PBM stranglehold on medicine. 

These are not just administrative inconveniences; they are life-threatening obstacles. Patients suffering from cancer, chronic conditions or rare diseases are caught in a system that seems to value PBM corporate profits over human lives.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE HEALTHCARE PRICES 'TRANSPARENT'

PBMs were originally created to lower drug costs and streamline access to medications. Over time, however, they have transformed into entities that manipulate the system to maximize profits at the expense of patients. 

Making matters worse is the vertical integration that has allowed PBMs to dominate every aspect of the prescription drug supply chain. Today, the largest PBMs – Caremark Rx, LLC (CVS), Express Scripts, Inc. (ESI), and OptumRx, Inc. (OptumRx) – don’t just manage drug benefits. They also own the pharmacies that fill prescriptions and the insurers that pay for them. 

This means they have a financial incentive to prioritize their own profits at every step: steering patients to their own pharmacies, limiting access to competing medications and driving up out-of-pocket costs. With nearly 80 percent of prescription drugs controlled by just these three PBMs, their decisions shape the healthcare experiences of virtually every American. This vertical integration consolidates power in ways that simply harm patients.

HOW TRUMP CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR PATIENTSThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently exposed how the big three PBMs have rigged the drug supply chain to inflate costs and pad their profits. The FTC’s latest report, released in January 2025, highlighted how PBMs added significant markups on specialty generics, inflating costs for cancer, HIV and other life-saving drugs. 

Even while under federal investigation, the FTC report shows how these middlemen generated $7.3 billion in revenue from 2017 to 2022 by steering patients toward their own pharmacies, reimbursing themselves at higher rates than independent competitors, and engaging in predatory practices like spread pricing.Yet despite growing evidence and bipartisan calls for reform, Congress failed to act at the end of 2024. This missed opportunity is more than disappointing – it’s dangerous. Patients cannot wait while lawmakers play politics.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES HAVE SURGED ALMOST 40% OVER THE PAST DECADE

Congress must take immediate action to pass meaningful PBM reform. The House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health recently held a hearing to discuss PBM-driven price inflation, barriers to care, and market consolidation. The testimony reinforced what patients and healthcare professionals already know: PBMs are driving up costs and limiting access, not lowering them. 

These reforms have broad bipartisan support and represent real solutions. Patients deserve more than vague commitments; they deserve action.

President Donald Trump has made eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government a cornerstone of his administration’s agenda. PBM reform is a clear extension of that mission – these middlemen have exploited inefficiencies for too long, and it’s time to restore transparency, fairness, and patient-first policies to the system.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONCongress must pass meaningful PBM reform – not tomorrow but today. For my daughter and for the countless patients I’ve fought for over the years, this isn’t an abstract policy debate. It’s real, it’s urgent and it’s deeply personal.

It is time to put patients before profits and politics. Congress missed a crucial opportunity in 2024. Let’s make 2025 the year we finally stop these life-threatening PBMs and restore humanity to healthcare. For my daughter and for our loved ones, we cannot afford to wait any longer.

Greenland Candidate Campaigns for Better Healthcare After Beating Cancer in Denmark

By Tom Little

NUUK (Reuters) -As Greenland's general election approaches, a candidate campaigns for access to better healthcare on the vast island, recounting his personal journey of beating cancer after having to travel to Denmark from a remote town to undergo treatment.

"It's always about the budget ... I want to have the human before the economy or the budget," Justus Hansen, 57, a candidate for Greenland's centre-right Demokraatit party said.

While independence has taken centre stage in Greenland's election debate after renewed U.S. interest in the island, healthcare has long been a core issue, with vast distances and shortage of staff making it costly and difficult to give Greenlanders access to the care they need.

Hansen said he went to the hospital in his hometown of Tasiilaq on the eastern coast of Greenland, after feeling exhausted.

He was sent home after an initial consultation, he said, and when he returned after a week's time, he insisted on having his blood sample taken, which revealed a high level of infection.

"I have lost a lot of my own friends and family to cancer because they get diagnosed too late," Hansen said.

He was eventually sent to Nuuk from Tasiilaq - a journey across the ice cap of more than 680 kilometres (423 miles), involving travel by plane and helicopter - as the capital is the only place where Greenlanders can get a CT scan.

MORE:  

There, in January last year, he was diagnosed with renal cancer. "I felt terrified. It's like a death sentence for me because my own mother died of cancer," he said.

Hansen said he had to wait six weeks in Greenland after being diagnosed with cancer before he could go to Denmark for treatment.

Hansen spent three months in Copenhagen for his first treatment, and returned to Denmark for two further periods of two months respectively to receive treatment after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in October.

Now, free of cancer, his experiences have fuelled his campaign for more doctors in Greenland's regional hospitals, improved healthcare in remote areas, and the installation of CT scanners in every regional hospital.

While Hansen feels strongly about Greenland becoming independent, he is cautious about a swift transition.

"We have to have more educated people," he said. "Also, the economy will have to be much stronger than it is today before we can even talk about independence."
