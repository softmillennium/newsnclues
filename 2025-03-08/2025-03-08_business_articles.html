The Disney execs talk to THR after a cameo-packed panel at SXSW Saturday that included appearances from the 'Iron Man' actor, Marvel's Kevin Feige, Pixar's Pete Docter, Jon Favreau and more.



		By Alex Weprin, Mia Galuppo 

	March 8, 2025 11:33am	




	Robert Downey Jr. isn’t quite done with Tony Stark just yet.


	The actor hung up the Iron Man superhero suit in Avengers: Endgame, and he is poised to return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the evil Dr. Doom for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.



	But first, there’s a theme park ride to launch.


	At D23 last year, Disney announced that the actor would reprise his role as Tony Stark for a new ride coming to Avengers Campus in Disneyland: Stark Flight Lab. On Saturday, Downey Jr. surprised a crowd of nearly 2,000 in Austin, Texas to preview a pair of upcoming Marvel-themed rides coming to Avengers Campus in Disneyland. And yes, he will be reprising his role as Tony Stark.

	“It’s been 17 years of being associated of an iconic superhero, but it is the message he represents that I am grateful for,” Downey Jr. told the crowd. “Tony opened my eyes wider to the power technology has to impact the world for good and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my days.”

	Downey Jr. was the surprise guest at the Disney panel at SXSW Saturday, fronted by Disney Experiences chairman Josh D’Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. The pair of execs were joined in cameo appearances by a veritable who’s who of Disney A-listers, including Marvel’s Kevin Feige, Pixar’s Pete Docter, The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau, andDisney Imagineering chief Bruce Vaughn.


	The purpose? To demonstrate Disney’s prowess at taking characters from the screen and bringing them to life at the company’s theme parks and experiences around the world. 


	“For us, it all starts with great storytelling, and that’s beginning, the middle and the end for us with each of our brands,” says Bergman in a joint interview alongside D’Amaro with The Hollywood Reporter, conducted ahead of the panel. “And we’re fortunate because obviously we have Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucasfilm and Avatar. So we’re also able to, with great stories, build great worlds.”


	“This goes back to Walt when he envisioned what this company ultimately was going to be,” says D’Amaro. “He had storytelling and content in the middle and all of these businesses surrounding it, such that we could stay with the consumer, wherever they were, literally in the world.”

	











	Bergman and D’Amaro each play a pivotal role on Disney’s IP flywheel. The Disney film studios, which Bergman oversees, develop the characters and franchises and build the worlds. D’Amaro’s team, which includes Disney Imagineering, turns those characters and worlds into real tangible experiences building the emotional connection to Disney that helps define the company.


	At the SXSW panel, the creatives (along with a few BDX droids, the Mandalorian and Grogu from Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge) joined the chairmen on stage to explain how they work to take the characters they create for the screen and develop them for Disney’s experiences, be it a theme park land or attraction, or a cruise ship spinoff.


	“Our filmmakers like Kevin Feige or Pete Docter, they’re huge, huge parks fans as well,” Bergman says. “So as they are developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe and what it has in it, or our animated titles, whether it be Pixar or Disney, Frozen and Zootopia: As they’re envisioning their films, they get the story, and then they’re able to expand the world. It’s a great extension of what we do.”


	“Before even a movie is hatched, sometimes we’re having discussions about, can you imagine what this could be? And of course, then the rest of the team is going to take the lead on that,” D’Amaro adds. “From a parks and experiences standpoint, Alan and his team invite us in very early in the process, sometimes before there’s even a script. So the Imagineers will be talking to a Pete, talking to a Kevin on imagining what these spaces might look like in physical form and now in the future in digital form as well [in Disney’s upcoming Epic Games world in development].

	











	“That’s why when you walk into a Cars land, or you walk into Star Wars: Galaxy’s edge, or a Guardians of the Galaxy, you feel the same thing that you feel when you’re in the theater watching that movie for the first time,” D’Amaro continues.


	And they used the SXSW stage to unveil a number of announcements coming to Disney’s parks.


	First up was a look a look at new Star Wars entries, with Mandoloian filmmaker Jon Favreau joining imagineers in introducing Austin to the BDX droids and an animatronic droidsmith that will be seen walking around the Disney parks. And Disney will bring a brand new mission to Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run that is inspired by Favreau’s upcoming Star Wars feature, The Mandalorian & Grogu, a ride which will debut the same weekend as the film over Memorial Day weekend 2026.


	“As much as I like going in to the park where I feel like a kid, I love seeing backstage. You realize that there is a lot of technology, but at its heart are these people who are passionate about storytelling,” said Faverau, who shouted out the SXSW film festival where his feature Chef premiered in 2014 before leaving the stage.


	After Star Wars, Disney took the Austin audience to the world of Pixar, with chief creative officer Pete Docter saying that the Disney parks are frequently in the thoughts of its animators. Said Docter, “We ask ourselves: ‘Is this somewhere I want to go if they build it at Disneyland?’” Doctor’s movie Monsters Inc. is the inspiration for a new rollercoaster modeled on the film’s “door vault” sequence where characters cling to suspended closet doors. It will be Disney’s first suspended roller coaster, with animatics getting oohs and aahs from the audience. Additionally, a new ride inspired by Cars at Magic Kingdom will be a recreation of an off-road rally race filled with new “race car personalities” created by Pixar.

	











	“The Cars franchise is so, so powerful, clearly evergreen, something that we’ve had a lot of success with in Disney California Adventure,” D’Amaro says. “So we see a great opportunity at Walt Disney World building another Cars themed area. And while technology may not be in the forefront of the consumers mind, the technology that we will use to translate what Pete and the team have created to an off road rally race is going to be phenomenal in terms of the how the car moves, how it reacts to the terrain, how it makes you feel you are out in in the wilderness, really experiencing what the cars would would experience.”


	Closing out the presentation was Marvel head Kevin Feige who brought out the surprise guest, Robert Downey Jr. who elicited the biggest audience reaction of the panel.


	Disney is doubling the size of the Avengers campus at the Disneyland Anaheim park. The new ride Stark Flight Lab will take guests inside Tony Stark’s technology workshop where guests will sit inside a “gyrokinetic pod” where guests will sit rolling along a track and will be picked up by lines of robotic articulating arms. 


	Downey, who has been working directly with Disney imagineers on the new attraction, said: “What I didn’t know was how stealth and exclusive Walt Disney Imagineering HQ was. You want to talk about a closed set? It’s the Area 51 of fun!”


	They also announced that the Fantastic Four characters will appear at Tomorrowland.


	Perhaps no franchise defines Disney’s approach than Pirates of the Caribbean. The franchise traces its origins to Disneyland and Walt Disney himself, before becoming a film franchise which in turn led to new elements being added to the original rides, namely Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow. The Disney flywheel in full effect.

	











	“[Pirates is] a parks IP that goes over into the studios, and these guys make incredible content from that, and that cycle has repeated itself as well,” D’Amaro says.


	“One of the greatest rides that you have at any of the parks is in Shanghai, that Pirates ride,” Bergman continued, recalling how he took Pirates of the Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer to preview it early on in development. “We were actually at [Imagineering] sitting in one of these little rolling chairs, looking at cardboard, no joke, really early on.”


	“And you were like, ‘I hope you guys can pull this off,” D’Amaro replied.


	“It blew away our expectations, it’s so amazing,” Bergman said. “Look, we’re going to be making another Pirates movie. So it’s just great. It really is great.”

As the US president warns of a ‘a little short-term interruption’, businesses are struggling to make decisions amid heightened uncertainty

Donald Trump declared there to be “no room left” for a deal with Canada and Mexico this week, launching a trade war against his nation’s closest allies that he presented as an effort to protect America’s soul.

Then he pulled back. It wasn’t his first feint and retreat. It probably won’t be the last.

A day after imposing steep tariffs on his country’s neighbors, the US president announced a month-long reprieve for carmakers. The following day, tariffs were also suspended on almost all goods from Canada and Mexico.

Tariffs on China, levied at a 10% rate in February and doubled to 20% on Tuesday, remain in place. Trump and his aides are now trailing a fresh wave of tariffs in early April as “the big one”, with myriad markets – including the European Union – and industries in their sights.

Each abrupt and erratic jerk and jolt on policy in Washington reverberates around the world, with firms in the US and far beyond trying to keep track of developments from one day to the next – and figure out what they mean.

The architects of Trumponomics insist it will pave the way for a greater, more prosperous future. But firms are struggling to make out the economic landscape now, let alone what might happen next.

“When you have such a high level of uncertainty, and have a set of policies that seem to impact every part of the economy ... it leads to businesses essentially being frozen,” said Sameera Fazili, former deputy director of the national economic council (NEC) under Joe Biden. “They’re not able to make investments. They’re not able to make plans. They’re not able to make hiring decisions.

“Because they don’t know where these policies are going to head. These policies are going to have such an impact on their bottom line.”

In the four short months since his election victory last November, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in February; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; briefly imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; revoked those tariffs on most goods; and threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in April.

For companies attempting to navigate North America – from car manufacturers to juice makers – the world shifted, and shifted back, at a dizzying pace in a matter of days. “I don’t know how they navigate it,” said Fazili. “You can’t run a business with one-month cliffs around you all the time.”

“This is not a moment to celebrate,” Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said after Thursday’s latest delay. “The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll.

“We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People’s livelihoods are at stake.”

As a campaigner, Trump’s great political skill is his ability to use rhetoric – often brash, crude and even false – to bend perception of reality.

The president’s rhetoric can leave listeners with the impression that tariffs will revitalize America’s industrial heartlands, and fill up the federal government’s coffers with trillions of dollars from other countries, with only a minor impact on US consumers.

“The countries and companies that have been ripping us aren’t particularly happy with what I’m doing,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. Sure, tariffs might bring about “a little short-term interruption” in the US economy, he conceded, but “I don’t think it’s going to be big”.

But the reality of tariffs is trickier. Tariffs are generally paid by importers, for starters – in this case, US companies buying goods from overseas – not exporters, who sell the products, or the countries where they are based. Many of these US firms quickly made plain this week that they would pass on these higher costs to their customers.

While Trump has used the threat of tariffs to encourage overseas firms to relocate their factories to the US, such longer-term investments are harder for executives to plan when they do not know which duties will be in place next week.

Seven weeks into his second term, as many Americans grapple with the cost of living after years of higher inflation, Trump continues to blame Joe Biden. “We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” he said during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night.

The US economy is not in a state of catastrophe, having shown remarkable resilience in the years following the end of the pandemic. The biggest issue has been inflation, which surged to its highest level in a generation three years ago, but has since fallen dramatically from this peak.

Presidents typically “move on quickly, or don’t criticize their predecessors by name”, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “Here’s another norm that Trump has exploded. Trump has no limits and his base lets him get away with anything. So expect it to continue.”

But should prices rise as a direct result of Trump’s decisions – as many economists and business leaders have warned – it will grow more challenging to blame Biden for day-to-day affordability challenges.

On the campaign trail last year, Trump repeatedly pledged to “rapidly” bring down prices from “day one” of his second administration. “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,” he declared on the eve of November’s election.

Only after winning did he acknowledge how difficult this would be. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up,” he told Time a few weeks his victory. “You know, it’s very hard.”

It is one thing to play down higher prices and bills as “a little short-term interruption” when they’re a risk. Should they become reality, such rhetoric is less likely to wash.

“Once you’re in charge, you’re in charge,” said Fazili. “And if there’s a problem in the economy, people look to you to fix it.”</p>
