 The leaders of Syria's three main Christian churches issued a joint statement Saturday condemning ""massacres targeting innocent civilians"", following reports of mass killings of Alawite civilians by the security forces. 

 Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said ""532 Alawite civilians were killed in the coastal regions of Syria and the Latakia mountains by security forces and allied groups"". 

 ""In recent days, Syria has witnessed a dangerous escalation of violence, brutality, and killings, resulting in attacks on innocent civilians, including women and children,"" the joint statement said. 

 It was signed by the patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic Churches. 

 The reported killings on the Mediterranean coast the heartland of the Alawite religious minority was gripped by fighting between the country's new security forces and gunmen loyal to toppled president Bashar al-Assad. 

 Though the majority of Syria's Christians fled during the civil war that erupted in 2011, the city of Latakia, which has been hard hit by the latest violence, is home to a small Christian community. 

 ""The Christian churches, while strongly condemning any act that threatens civil peace, denounce and condemn the massacres targeting innocent civilians, and call for an immediate end to these horrific acts, which stand in stark opposition to all human and moral values,"" the statement said. 

 ""The churches also call for the swift creation of conditions conducive to achieving national reconciliation among the Syrian people."" 

 They urged a ""transition to a state that... lays the foundation for a society based on equal citizenship and genuine partnership, free from the logic of vengeance and exclusion"". 

 The spiritual leader of Syria's Druze minority, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri, also called for an end to the violence. 

 ""The flames that burn under sectarian slogans will burn all of Syria and its people,"" he said in a statement. 

 Assad, himself an Alawite who sought to present himself as a protector of Syria's minorities, was ousted on December 8 in a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. 

 The group's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has since been appointed Syria's interim president. 

 The new authorities have repeatedly promised an inclusive transition that protects the rights of religious minorities. 

 The Alawite heartland has nonetheless been gripped by fear of reprisals for the Assad family's brutal rule.

 Twenty-eight police officers and one soldier held hostage in southwest Colombia were released Saturday, according to an AFP team on the ground. 

 Around noon on Saturday, residents of the community of La Hacienda in the department of Cauca told the detainees that they were free to go. 

 The men, held since Thursday, collected their riot gear and left along a dirt road, escorted by local residents, AFP saw. 

 They headed toward the nearby town of El Plateado, where a commission from the state Ombudsman's Office was waiting for them. 

 The soldiers were detained Thursday after a day of clashes between residents and security forces, part of a government military operation aimed at ending drug-related violence in a region with one of the highest concentrations of coca crops in Colombia. 

 The government said the officers were being held by a dissident FARC guerrilla group. 

 As he left La Hacienda, Major Nilson Bedoya, the soldier in the group, said that throughout the ordeal he couldn't help but think of his family. 

 ""My family, my wife, my son, who are waiting for me at home,"" he said in an agitated voice, as he carried his gear on his shoulder. 

 Earlier Saturday, Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez in an interview with W Radio threatened to use ""the legitimate force of the state"" to have the troops released. 

 Sanchez and other representatives of the government of leftist President Gustavo Petro will meet Saturday with residents of the departmental capital, Popayan, to listen to the locals. 

 Officials said that on Thursday, guerillas and members of the public confronted and overwhelmed security services who were trying to reestablish state control in two municipalities. 

 Government images showed gangs pelting a flaming armored vehicle with rocks, and riot police detonating smoke grenades amid a running gun battle. 

 Petro blamed a FARC renegade faction known as the Central General Staff , accusing it of ""using the civilian population"" to attack troops. 

 The kidnappings were a major embarrassment and a stern challenge for Colombia's government, which is struggling with its worst unrest in a decade involving spasms of violence in several parts of the country. 

 Since October, Bogota has been trying to retake control of parts of Cauca from the EMC. 

 Petro's government is proposing an ambitious crop substitution program to combat the drug trafficking economy, a strategy that locals have denounced as a campaign of ""forced eradication"" of coca crops. 

 ""We will continue to work for these lands so that people can have a better future,"" said Bedoya, the soldier. ""The peasants were sold the idea that we are their enemies, but we are their best allies,"" he added.

When Grant Fisher stepped off the track at Boston University on Feb. 14, it wasn’t entirely a shock that the American distance runner had just broken the world record for the indoor 5,000 meters. 

For one thing, he was in great shape. Only six days earlier, Fisher, 27, who was coming off a breakout season in which he earned two silver medals at the Paris Olympics, had also broken the world record at 3,000 meters in New York City. Larger trends were also at play: He was running on one of the fastest tracks in the world, wearing Nike spikes whose carbon plates and advanced foams helped return energy with every stride. 

Yet in Boston, when Fisher was asked about the factors that had led to his pair of world records, he acknowledged one so surprisingly simple that it’s probably in your kitchen. 

He’d recently begun taking baking soda.  

“I think it makes an impact, and if that impact is 1%, that would be massive,” Fisher told reporters. “It’s probably more like 0.1%, if there is one. And if it is just mental, then I’ll take that, too.”

Fisher is among the many professional runners in recent years to embrace baking soda — known within the sport by its scientific name, sodium bicarbonate, or simply “bicarb” — as a legal means of running faster times than ever. The use of a bicarbonate “system” sold by Maurten, a Swedish company, has become so widespread that at track and field’s world championships in 2023, two-thirds of all medalists from 800 to 10,000 meters were using it. At the Olympics last summer, more than two-thirds of all running medalists were using it — “and in some cases, all the finalists were using it,” the company told NBC News. 

In an eight-day span in February, seven of the sport’s world records in races ranging from the 1,500 meters to the road half-marathon were smashed. The rapid-fire rewriting of professional running’s record book can be traced to many reasons, from high-tech advancements leading to faster shoes and tracks, quicker recovery and better coaching. 

The combination has convinced Chris Woods, the head track coach at Mississippi State University, that not only “a lot of world records are in jeopardy here in the very near future” but that even times that once appeared unthinkable could now be possible, such as the record of 4:07 in the women’s mile.

“In my lifetime, in your lifetime, I do believe we’ll see a woman break 4 minutes,” Woods said.

But increasingly, runners such as Marco Arop, the 2023 world champion at 800 meters from Canada, whom Woods coaches, are also turning to “bicarb” for an edge.

Intense periods of exercise create a build-up of hydrogen ions in muscles, leading to acidity that can increase fatigue and create the “burning” sensation felt during hard exercise. As a base, sodium bicarbonate acts as a “buffer” that counters the acidity. Taking sodium bicarbonate doesn’t run afoul of World Anti-Doping Agency rules; in fact, even World Athletics, track and field’s global governing body, has described it as an “established performance supplement.” 

The benefits of “bicarb” have been known for decades, said Steve Magness, a coach and former elite runner who has written multiple books about performance. But athletes have been wary of it for just as long for an often unpleasant reason: The odds of a performance boost had to be weighed against the risk of race-wrecking gastrointestinal distress. 

“It didn’t work very well because there was a high percentage of people that just couldn’t even line up for the race or the time trial because it just tore apart your stomach,” Magness said.  

Fisher had heard so many “horror stories” of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea from using bicarbonate that he waited until this winter, after the all-important Olympics cycle, to test out a “bicarb” mixture in training. His stomach handled it fine, he said. And that may have been because in recent years, bicarb has hit a turning point.  

Maurten, the Swedish company, has found a way to encase small tablets of bicarbonate into a gooey, soup-like hydrogel that guides them through the stomach and into the intestine, where the bicarbonate is dissolved and absorbed with less potential nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, according to the company. Side effects of taking sodium include water retention and weight gain, and regularly increasing sodium intake may lead to an increase in blood pressure, the company says. 

Maurten’s credibility was boosted when famed marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge used its products to set multiple world records. Other Maurten users include Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic champion at 800 meters.   

Beyond the hydrogel, however, bicarb may have become more palatable for elite runners recently for another reason. Just as the Paris Olympics began, a study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology upended a long-held belief that sodium bicarbonate was most effective as a buffer in shorter competitions, lasting up to around 10 minutes.  

When researchers at Edge Hill University in the United Kingdom gave Maurten’s bicarbonate product to male cyclists during a much longer, 40-kilometer time trial — nearly the length of a marathon — they measured a 1.4% boost in the cyclists’ performance, with minimal stomach issues. In practice, it meant cyclists using the bicarbonate were nearly 1 minute faster over about an hour of riding, said Eli Spencer Shannon, a Ph.D. candidate who led the study.

“I would classify that as small but meaningful,” Shannon said. 

The findings, Shannon said, should spark more research. Bicarb isn’t “one size fits all,” he said, because each person’s stomach distress can vary and because baking soda’s effectiveness as a buffer depends on how hard an athlete can push; harder exercise produces more hydrogen ions in the muscle that the bicarbonate can then remove. 

Still, Shannon was surprised by some of his study’s findings, such as that the riders using bicarbonate also were able to go faster without a change in their heart rate or the maximum amount of oxygen they were able to use during exercise, known as VO₂. 

“What that’s saying is that you’re able to sort of work harder but have less cardiovascular strain and have a better performance improvement in comparison to a placebo, which was really interesting,” Shannon said. “That suggests increased [muscle] contractility, which has never been seen, at this duration and at this intensity.”

Not all of track’s recent world-record holders incorporate baking soda as a new tool in their training. American Yared Nuguse, who broke the indoor mile record on Feb. 8, only for Norwegian rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen to reset it five days later, has said he doesn’t use bicarbonate because of its taste. But some of the world’s fastest have taken note. 

Two days before last summer’s Olympic semifinal in the men’s 800 meters, Arop, a former basketball player who became the world champion at 800 meters for Canada, turned to Woods in France with less a question than a statement. He was set on trying bicarb. The 800 meters was in the middle of one of the fastest years in the sport’s history, and Arop knew several of his competitors had used it with success.

“This is the pinnacle of our sport, and I don’t think he wanted to leave anything to chance,” Woods said. “And if there was a way to give a 1% advantage, that’s what he was going to do. That’s what he believed. And the results we were pretty happy with.” 

Woods didn’t know much about bicarb until Arop raised the topic in France, but he said he now believes there are scientific benefits. 

“Is there a mental component to it? I would say absolutely,” he said. “But I don’t think this is a placebo.”

Arop went on to earn the silver medal in the fourth-fastest time in 800 meters history, edged from the gold by just one one-hundredth of a second by Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyonyi — who also was using Maurten’s bicarbonate in Paris, according to the company. The 800-meter world record, set in 2012, could be the next to go down, with Wanyonyi just two-tenths of a second behind. After the race, Arop said he believed his last-minute addition of sodium bicarbonate had “definitely played a factor” in his personal-best time. 

“Everybody else is using it, and it’s been working wonders,” Arop said in August.

Not everybody uses it. Bicarbonate is just one factor of many that have sparked what Woods called “the golden era of track and field when it comes to running fast times,” a boom he likened to the NBA in the 1980s, when the talent of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, coupled with better technology and rules changes, boosted its popularity. 

A “shoe war,” as Magness said, has broken out in a race to develop shoes that return the most energy using bulky yet light foams and carbon-fiber plates. Under athletes’ feet, the physics of indoor tracks are also fueling faster times. The indoor track at Boston University, in particular, has become a destination because its wide, banked corners help runners ricochet around turns, and its above-ground frame made of wood and plywood can return energy like a mini-trampoline more than an outdoor track, where a rubber surface is poured over a concrete base. 

When Magness was running two decades ago, an information gap left him to wonder how East African competitors were training. Social media and the internet have opened access to other training methods and better coaching that don’t burn out young runners and created a bigger pool of strong runners, Magness said. Those young athletes are watching peers run faster than ever and believing confidently they can, too. 

They are powered by cutting-edge advancements Roger Bannister could only have dreamed of when he was chasing the first sub-4-minute mile — along with a basic household item, too.

“What the last couple years have done is kind of shift that mindset of, like, here’s the past and here’s what we were able to do,” Magness said. “But now the game has changed.”

Among robots, a front flip is significantly more difficult than a backflip.

Chinese robotics company Zhongqing Robotics, also known as EngineAI, has officially entered the humanoid robotics scene by releasing a video showcasing what it claims is the world's first humanoid robot front flip. 

Robot backflips are becoming commonplace, but a front flip is significantly more difficult than a backflip, as any gymnast can attest.

The challenge for robots attempting a front flip lies in maintaining balance and control throughout the rotation.

Unlike humans, robots rely on precise sensor data and motor control to execute complex movements. During a front flip, the robot must rapidly shift its weight, adjust its center of gravity and coordinate the movements of its limbs to ensure a smooth and controlled landing. 

EngineAI has overcome a significant challenge in robotics by programming its PM01 to gather enough force to spin in the forward direction while calculating the correct angular velocity and torque.

It is still an impressive feat because the field of robotics, particularly humanoid, general-purpose robots, is advancing at an incredible rate. Ten years ago, this kind of stuff simply did not exist. Now, you can buy your very own open-source PM01 robot for 13,700, according to EngineAI's website.

Its specs aren't bad, with five degrees of freedom in each arm and six per leg, totaling 23 degrees of freedom in body movement. The robot also features 221 lb-ft of torque (300 Nm), which seems like quite a punch when the little guy is only 4.5 ft tall and weighs 88 lb. EngineAI's general-purpose humanoid robot nails a front flip and walks off like a champ with one of the most human-like gaits seen to date, which is also quite impressive.

President Donald Trump creates a task force to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which will bring the globe’s premier soccer tournament to North America at a time when Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs have ratcheted up tensions across the continent.

President Donald Trump has created a task force to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which will bring the globe’s premier soccer tournament to North America at a time when his on-again, off-again tariffs have ratcheted up tensions across the continent. 

“I think it’s going to make it more exciting,” Trump said Friday of playing the World Cup amid sharp rhetoric between leaders of the host nations. “Tension’s a good thing.”

The task force, which Trump will chair, will coordinate the federal government’s security and planning for the tournament, which is expected to draw millions of tourists to the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

“It’s a great honor for our country to have it,” Trump said of the World Cup after meeting with officials from FIFA, the international soccer governing body. He said he’d like to attend multiple games. 

Preparations are ramping up across the continent alongside tensions between the United States and its neighbors as Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs before backing off, spooking markets and leading to fears of a trade war and economic downturn. He also speaks pejoratively of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and muses about Canada becoming a U.S. state, which has boosted national pride north of the border. 

For 2026, the World Cup will expand to 48 teams playing 104 matches, the first time that the tournament will be played across three countries. Seventy-eight of 104 matches will be played in the U.S., with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada, and as many as six matches a day. The final will be played July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the task force will ensure that each of the visitors who will travel from around the world “feels safe, feels happy and feels that we are doing something special.”




“So we’re here to create and to make the best show on the planet ever,” Infantino said. He gave Trump a personalized game ball and unveiled an elaborate trophy that will go to the winner of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, which will pit top soccer clubs against each other this summer ahead of next year’s matchup of national teams.

Trump later brought Infantino to show off the trophy at the start of a White House cryptocurrency summit. The United States, where soccer has grown in popularity but remains a niche sport, represents a major growth area for soccer, he said. 

Infantino likened producing the World Cup to holding three Super Bowls daily for a month, a dizzying security and logistical challenge for the host governments. 

The Trump administration will face a second test on the global sports stage in 2028, when the summer Olympics will be held in California, the first time the Games will have been in the U.S. since Salt Lake City hosted in 2002.

This story has been corrected to reflect that the 2026 World Cup will be the first to be played across three countries.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,"Ukraine Trump: What US, Russia and Europe are thinking ahead of fresh Ukraine talks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05m907r39qo,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 15:47:01 GMT","

It's been another turbulent week in global politics.

The world digested the extraordinary exchange between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian leader visited European allies, who have sprung into action to beef up their defences. Russian bombs hit Ukraine.

But what are these major players thinking ahead of fresh US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia next week?

Five BBC correspondents have analysed the week's events.

Tom Bateman, State Department correspondent, Washington DC

After Donald Trump and JD Vance's humiliating attack on Zelensky, the US president on Monday suspended military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine.

Over time, this will have a fundamental impact on Ukraine's ability to defend itself - and Trump's Democratic opponents say it's now beyond question that he is aligned with Russia.

The administration has been plain that it sees the move as pressure on Zelensky to sign the president's minerals deal and cede to a quick ceasefire.

Trump's envoy Gen Keith Kellogg characterised the withdrawal of US military support as ""like hitting a mule in the face with a [plank of wood]... You got their attention and it's very significant... and it's then up to them to do [what the president wants].""

After all the arm-twisting, the week ends with a more conciliatory tone from some of Trump's top foreign policy team who will meet with the Ukrainians next week in Saudi Arabia.

There was a rare moment of criticism for Moscow by Trump on Friday as he threatened sanctions, even though it is already heavily sanctioned, to try to deter its intensifying bombardment of Ukraine.

But other than that this is an administration that has repeatedly reprimanded its supposed ally but refrained from any such criticism of its adversary.

On Thursday I asked the US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce for her reaction to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ruling out the presence of European peacekeepers in Ukraine. He had called it a ""hostile aim"" by the West over which there was ""no room for compromise"".

Ms Bruce declined to respond, saying it wasn't for her to comment on the remarks of foreign leaders or ministers, even though she had just repeated Trump's label of Zelensky as ""not ready for peace"".

Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring Russia editor

Until Trump's sanctions threat, this was another week when all the pressure seemed to be on Kyiv, giving Russia little reason to tame its appetite.

The suspension of American military aid and intelligence is one of the worst setbacks for Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, and a huge boost to Russia's chances.

The deadly attacks across Ukraine which have followed suggest that Moscow is happy to continue with business as usual in the war.

It still insists that the original objectives of the ""special military operation"" must be achieved and more Ukrainian land captured.

It has also rejected efforts by Ukraine supporters to relieve this pressure on Kyiv, through a truce or a peacekeeping force.

French President Emmanuel Macron's remarks this week that Trump's America may no longer be ""on our side"" are music to Russian President Vladimir Putin's ears, too.

It's a situation in which Putin can sit back and enjoy the spectacle of cracks appearing in the Western alliance. It's a situation that he's been working to achieve for years, if not decades.

And he has achieved it not because of shots fired on the battlefield, but because of a breathtaking U-turn by Ukraine's biggest ally.

Next Tuesday, Ukrainian and US representatives are sitting down for talks in Saudi Arabia. Russia will be watching closely, but feeling confident.

Myroslava Petsa, BBC Ukraine and Daniel Wittenberg, BBC World Service

It's been a bruising, emotional, and relentless week for the embattled Ukrainian president, as he fought to keep Western military support intact while reiterating his commitment to peace.

The fallout from his spectacular Oval Office clash with Trump was compounded in Kyiv after the US suspended military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

""There's a scent of betrayal in the air,"" one source close to the Ukrainian government said. ""The whole country feels it – including the president and his team.""

Zelensky refused Trump's demand for an ""explicit public apology"", instead penning a letter to the US president and calling their White House showdown ""regrettable"".

To counter the damage, Zelensky was on the road again, seeking to shore up European support in Brussels. But while he secured public displays of solidarity, he didn't get the firm military commitments he was hoping for.

Meanwhile, Zelensky urged EU leaders to support a limited truce at sea and in the air – an idea backed by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Ukrainian and US delegations will hold talks in Saudi Arabia next week, but the path to peace remains uncertain.

Despite the setbacks, a source close to the president's team insisted he remains defiant: ""Three years ago, he could have been killed, but he decided to stay in Kyiv. The more pressure he's under, the tougher he gets.""

Paul Kirby, Europe digital editor

There have been so many European summits it has been hard to keep up. And more are to come.

Europe's leaders have suddenly realised the security umbrella they have relied on since World War Two may no longer be there, and proposals are flashing by at warp speed in European terms.

There is a broad consensus Europe needs to help Ukraine. France and the UK are offering ""a coalition of the willing"" on the ground if a peace deal can be found.

Russia hates the idea but Macron will bring together army chiefs on Tuesday to work on a plan.

But far bigger questions are now being asked about how Europe protects itself from what EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen calls a ""clear and present danger"".

""We have to be ready"" if the US is not there to help, says Macron. The EU is now talking about a multi-billion euro plan for beefing up defences.

And Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has raised the possibility of France and the UK extending their nuclear deterrent across Europe.

Macron has been receptive to that, although France's nuclear umbrella would stretch only so far and final decisions would be made in Paris.

That goes to the heart of Europe's defence problem.

Without the US, can individual European countries pool their resources and rely on each other?

For smaller states such as Lithuania there is no choice.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right hand man and the US official leading the talks about the secret negotiation between US and the Hamas for hostages had a contentious call on Tuesday, two sources tell Axios.

In February when US officials ran the idea of engaging with Hamas directly, Israeli officials advised them against it, and it came to be known through other channels that the US was moving ahead and doing it anyway.

Netanyahu has said that Israel has made its opinion clear to the US, however, his closest confidant Ron Dermer was not very restrained during the call with Adam Boehler, the US hostage envoy.

The call took place a few hours after Boehler met with Khalil al-Hayya in Doha, one of Hamas' most senior political officials and the head of its negotiating team. Prior to this, Boehler's negotiations began with lower-level Hamas officials in Doha.

The talks revolved around bringing home the bodies of four deceased American hostages and Edan Alexander, a 21 year old American hostage.

This deal was expected to be the precursor for a broader deal involving a long term truce, release of the remaining hostages, a safe passage out of Gaza for Hamas leaders and finally the end of the war.

The talks also involved specifics like the number of Palestinian prisoners that would be released from Israeli jails in exchange for Alexander - a point that Israel had not agreed to.

Earlier, Netanyahu was dismissive of the idea that the US will hold direct talks with Hamas, but now that it is actually happening, he and his advisors are concerned, a source told Axios.

The call between Boehler and Dermer was ""difficult"" as Dermer objected to Boehler making such proposals with the consent of Israel.

The direct talks with Hamas were requested by three American hostage families during the Biden administration, in order to get a separate deal to free their loved ones. However, the Biden administration thought that this would legitimise Hamas, which the US considers a terror group.

""These talks went nowhere because what Hamas wanted was a ceasefire and prisoners, and it was in Israel's hands, not ours,"" the former Biden adviser said, adding that such direct talks would only aggravate the matter further.

However, when the Trump administration came to power, Steve Witkoff joined in to negotiate a Gaza deal when the Biden administration was in its final days. He initially suggested the direct talks with Hamas but that did not happen initially.On Wednesday evening, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account a new public ultimatum for Hamas to release the remaining hostages. ""This is your last warning!"" he wrote on Truth Social.

Witkoff is set to travel again next week and said that Alexander's release is the top priority right now as he is injured. He also added that such a deal would only help Hamas as it would ""get them a lot of political capital"". He also said that in the event of Hamas not taking a ""reasonable"" approach, ""there is going to be some action taken"" by Israel. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire, Scotland, was vandalised on Saturday by some activists following his recent statement on Gaza.

The resort, owned by Trump, was targeted overnight by 'Palestine Action' a group of demonstrators. They painted three-metre-high letters reading “Gaza Is Not For Sale"" on the lawn.

The protestors also defaced the prestigious greens, including the course’s most renowned hole, which has hosted the Open Championships, PA Media reported.

A red spray paint was used to deface the elite clubhouse at the 800-acre resort, on Friday night. Palestine Action described it as a “direct response to the US administration’s stated intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza”.

The action came in response to Trump’s recent statement on the Gaza issue, including plans to ""clean out the whole thing."" The US President's remarks have sparked widespread condemnation.

The row intensified last week when Trump posted a satirical AI-generated video on his Truth Social platform. The video showed an AI-generated Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shirtless and drinking at a fictional ‘Trump Gaza’ resort.

The video also parodies the Las Vegas Strip with the Gaza Strip.

Trump later posted a threatening message to Gaza’s two million residents on Truth Social, writing: ""To the People of Gaza: A beautiful future awaits, but not if you hold hostages. If you do, you are dead.""

The Trump administration recently signed off on the shipment of 40,000 bombs to Israel

A spokesperson from Palestine Action said, “Palestine Action rejects Donald Trump’s treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes. To make that clear, we have shown him that his property is not safe from acts of resistance.""

“We will continue to take action against US-Israeli colonialism in the Palestinian homeland,"" he added.

A spokesperson for Trump Turnberry condemned the vandalism as a “childish, criminal act” but assured that it would not affect the resort’s operations.

        People around the world joined forces to march against patriarchal societies, the gender gap and violence against women in rallies in cities across the world.
    

Hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities around the world on March 8th to mark International Women's Day.

Tens of thousands of people gathered on the streets of Madrid, rallying in defence of women’s rights and advocating for an anti-racist, feminist agenda.

The march, organised by the feminist network 8M Commission, saw participants braving the rain whilst chanting against gender inequality and racism. 

The Spanish government reported 25,000 participants against 20,000 in 2024, although organisers claimed the number was closer to 80,000. 

In Rome, the demonstration focused on fighting gender violence and closing the gender gap. The city hosted the largest demonstration in Italy, however Italians were marching in 60 cities across the country to raise awareness about violence against women. The slogan of the demonstration, “Not One Less,” echoed the ongoing fight against femicide and gender-based violence. 

While in Istanbul, Turkey, thousands more took to the streets to also protest against gender violence and the growing pressure on women in society. The rally in Istanbul's Kadikoy district was marked by speeches, music, and dance, celebrating women’s strengths whilst also highlighting the urgent need for societal change. However, a heavy police presence, including officers in riot gear and water cannon trucks, tightly controlled the demonstration.

The Turkish government declared 2025 the ""Year of the Family,"" a move that many protesters criticised, seeing it as an attempt to further confine women to traditional roles of marriage and motherhood. The government's decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention in 2021, which was designed to protect women from domestic violence, has also been a source of anger among activists. The We Will Stop Femicides Platform reported that 394 women were killed by men in Turkey in 2024.

Yaz Gulgun, a 52-year-old pensioner, spoke out against the rising rates of femicide in the country, calling for better legal protections and a more supportive police force. She said 

“There is bullying at work, pressure from husbands and fathers at home and pressure from patriarchal society. We demand that this pressure be reduced even further.”

While Selvi Alkancelik, a 58-year-old demonstrator, pushed on the desire for women to be free from the restrictions imposed by a patriarchal society, saying “Let women be free. I want them to go somewhere without asking permission from her husband, to go anywhere without fear when she returns home at night, to go anywhere freely without fear. I want freedom for all women in the world."" 

Despite a ban on public demonstrations by The Beyoğlu district governor, in Taksim Square, many women plan to gather later in the evening for a Feminist Night March, pushing back against restrictions on their right to protest. Authorities blocked off areas of Istanbul and closed metro stations to prevent these gatherings, citing concerns over public order.

Watch: Trump says tariffs tension will make World Cup 'more exciting'

US President Donald Trump says the political and economic tensions between the United States and its 2026 World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico will be good for the tournament.

Trump has imposed tariffs - taxes charged on goods imported from other countries - on the United States' two neighbours.

Asked how he saw the World Cup playing out, given the current trade situation between the three nations, Trump said: ""I think it's going to make it more exciting. 

""Tension's a good thing, I think it makes it much more exciting.""

At the start of the week, Trump confirmed that he was moving forward with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.

In the days that followed, the Trump administration announced that it would be temporarily sparing carmakers from the import levies.

The next day, the president signed an executive order that placed a number of other exemptions on various goods.

Four big things Trump and his team took on this week

Trump was speaking alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino at the signing of an executive order to establish a taskforce that will oversee preparations for the tournament. 

Trump will chair the task force, which will ""co-ordinate with federal agencies in planning, organising and executing"" the tournament.

Forty-eight teams will compete in the expanded World Cup in 2026.

Eleven of the 16 host cities are in the United States, with Toronto and Vancouver in Canada also set to stage matches, as will Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey in Mexico.

Azteca Stadium in Mexico City will host the opening match on 11 June with the final being played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on 19 July.

The United States will also host the 2025 Club World Cup in June and July.

 Women will overthrow the Islamic system established in Iran after the 1979 revolution even if the authorities survive a military conflict, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi said in a message Saturday marking international women's day. 

 Mohammadi, 52, who won the 2023 Nobel prize in recognition of her years-long fight for human rights in Iran, is currently on temporary release from a prison term for health reasons. Her lawyers fear she could be sent back to prison any time. 

 Even behind bars, she was a strong supporter of the 2022-2023 protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. 

 An Iranian-Kurdish woman, Amini, 22, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women. 

 The protests shook Iranian authorities and remain a rallying cause even after petering out in the face of a fierce crackdown. 

 ""Women have risen up against the Islamic republic in such a way that the regime no longer has the power to suppress them,"" said Mohammadi in the Persian video message from Iran published on her social media channels. 

 As usual, she was not wearing the headscarf that is obligatory for women in Iran. 

 ""I am convinced that if the Islamic republic survives any war it will not survive resistance from women,"" she said, in apparent reference to the risk of armed conflict between Iran and Israel or the United States. 

 ""The glass vessel that holds the life of the Islamic republic will be smashed by women,"" she said. 

 Mohammadi charged that Iranian women had been subjected to ""gender apartheid"" since the inception of the Islamic republic. 

 ""I hope women will continue to lead the struggle against religious tyranny,"" whose defeat will be ""our day of victory"". 

 Her release in December from Evin prison marked the first time Mohammadi, who spent much of the past decade behind bars, has been free since her arrest in November 2021. 

 She also paid tribute to three women Sharifeh Mohammadi, Verisheh Moradi and Pakhshan Azizi who have been sentenced to death by Iran on charges of ""rebellion"". Mohammadi said the verdicts were ""revenge"" for their support of the protests.

Former UK defence secretary suggests Ukraine can still win the war if it continues holding off Russian forces

Ben Wallace, the former UK defence secretary, has said Donald Trump’s decision to suspend US intelligence sharing with Kyiv is “suffocating” Ukrainian hope of holding out against Russian aggression.

Last Friday, the US president, along with the vice-president, JD Vance, berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in full view of the media, telling the Ukrainian president that he was “gambling with world war three” and to come back to the White House “when he is ready for peace”.

In the week since, the US stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv that had previously given advance warnings of attacks and Brussels agreed to a huge increase in defence spending.

On Friday, the day after intelligence sharing ceased, Russia carried out massive ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine. Soon after the aerial attacks, Trump said Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody would do”.

Overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine on Saturday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozen more, including five children.

Wallace, who was the defence secretary when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, said on Saturday that Trump was diminishing the hope of Ukraine with his actions.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Hope is the most important thing in this type of conflict and, at the moment, Donald Trump is suffocating the hope that Putin can be either fought to a standstill or indeed brought to the table.”

He added: “Hope is always the key for both morale and a military campaign. When this started three years ago, I remember gathering the military officials in my then department, and saying on day one, we have to give the Ukrainians hope.

“If a Russian truck has a puncture, we need to let people know. If the Russians have a small defeat, we need to let the Ukrainian people know.”

Wallace suggested that Ukraine could still win the war if it continued holding off Russian forces. He said: “If Ukraine continues to resist for 18 months, the Russian economy will collapse. Its inflation rate’s at 23%, it’s spending 40% of its money [on defence], it’s finding it incredibly hard to replace its equipment. It can use North Koreans like cannon fodder, but fundamentally, it is not in a good place.

“Ukraine is not trying to invade Russia and go all the way to Moscow. Ukraine is trying to defend its sovereignty and its land and there is hope for them. If we were to all step up, either substitute what the Americans have taken away, or indeed show proper European resolve, and in that I include the United Kingdom, that we ain’t going anywhere.”

Leaders in Europe have convened in the past week in response to Washington’s change in stance on the war. Keir Starmer said Europe is “at a crossroads in history” and confirmed that the UK and France would lead a “coalition of the willing” to help end the fighting.

On Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that “the only imperial power that I see today in Europe is Russia” and called Vladimir Putin “an imperialist who seeks to rewrite history” after the Russian president appeared to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte.

Wallace said: “I’ve seen good leadership from both Keir Starmer and President Macron on this and they should both be congratulated.

“What I’m hoping they’re all doing right now behind the scenes is working out what the Americans have switched off, and finding European sources, or even further afield, to replace it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A Syria war monitor reported on Saturday that more than 300 Alawite civilians have been killed in recent days by the security forces and their allies, as authorities clash with militants loyal to the former government of Bashar al-Assad.

Restoring security has been one of the most complex tasks for Syria's new authorities, installed after Islamist-led forces ousted Assad in a lightning offensive in December.

They are now facing their fiercest attacks yet by members of the Assad clan's Alawite minority and have launched a major counter-operation in the ethnic group's Mediterranean heartland triggered by deadly clashes on Thursday.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Saturday that ""311 Alawite civilians were killed in the coastal region... by security forces and allied groups"" since then.

The Observatory indicated they were killed in ""executions"" carried out by security personnel or pro-government fighters and accompanied by ""looting of homes and properties"".

The civilian deaths bring the overall total count to 524 people, including 93 members of the new government's security forces and 120 pro-Assad fighters.

State news agency SANA reported early Saturday that ""deposed regime remnants"" had launched an attack on the national hospital in the coastal city of Latakia, adding ""the general security forces are repelling the attack"".

In an address on Friday, Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa urged the insurgents to ""lay down your weapons and surrender before it's too late"".

Western powers and Syria's neighbours have emphasised the need for unity in the new Syria, which is seeking funds for reconstructing a nation ravaged by years of civil war under Assad.

The Britain-based Observatory has reported multiple ""massacres"" in recent days, with women and children among the dead.

""The vast majority of the victims were summarily executed by elements affiliated to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior,"" the rights group said on Friday.

The Observatory and activists released footage showing dozens of bodies in civilian clothing piled outside a house, with blood stains nearby and women wailing.

Other videos appeared to show men in military garb shooting people at close range.

AFP could not independently verify the images.

 Pope Francis is responding well to treatment for pneumonia after three weeks in hospital, the Vatican said Saturday, adding that the 88-year-old was showing ""a gradual, slight improvement"". 

 The Argentine pontiff has been in Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14, and has suffered a series of respiratory crises, but for several days now his condition has been described as ""stable"". 

 ""The Holy Father's clinical condition in recent days has remained stable and, consequently, testifies to a good response to treatment. There is therefore a gradual, slight improvement"", the Vatican said. 

 Though Francis does not have a fever, his doctors want to see the same positive results ""in the coming days"" before giving a prognosis, the evening medical bulletin said. 

 The pope prayed Saturday morning in the chapel belonging to the special papal suite on the hospital's 10th floor, while in the afternoon he alternated rest with work, it said. 

 Francis has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from colon surgery in 2021 to a hernia operation in 2023, but this is the longest and most serious hospitalisation of his papacy. 

 On Thursday the Vatican released an audio message the first time the world had heard Francis's voice since he went into hospital. 

 ""I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square. I accompany you from here,"" said Francis, taking laboured breaths every couple of words.

 Catholics have been gathering nightly in St Peter's Square to pray for Francis, or leave flowers, candles or cards for him outside the Gemelli. 

 ""I hope that his lungs can go back to normal, his voice too,"" said one believer, Arnoldo Mosca Mondadori. 

 But ""even this voice gives us so much hope, it is huge for us. Even a thread of voice can give our heart and soul so much hope"", he said. 

 The pope continues to switch between an oxygen mask at night and a cannula a plastic tube tucking into the nostrils delivering high-flow oxygen during the day. 

 He has been doing bits of work when possible. 

 On Saturday, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin read aloud a message on the pope's behalf during a mass in St Peter's Basilica. 

 The pope had worked on the message from hospital just a few days ago, on March 5, the Vatican said.

 During previous hospitalisations, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer. 

 But he has missed the last three. 

 The Vatican press office said Saturday that it was ""quite probable"" the Angelus would be delivered this Sunday ""in the same way"" as in previous weeks, when it was published as a letter released at noon. 

 He will be missed by Catholics used to seeing him appear at his window at the Vatican every Sunday. 

 ""I was at the Vatican, a silence in my heart, like when someone goes to his or her parents' house and they are not there,"" Maria Julieta Marquez Garcia from Mexico told AFP. 

 ""We are all praying"", she said.

Pope Francis health update: In the recent update on Pope Francis' health, the Vatican on Saturday said that the 88-year-old pontiff is responding well to the treatment for double pneumonia and has shown a ""gradual, slight improvement"". Doctors, however, have indicated that he is not out of danger yet.

Pope has been suffering a chronic lung disease and double pneumonia, a condition that has battered his long health. The Vatican cited doctors as saying that the pontiff has remained stable, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days.

The doctors said that such stability ""as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy"". According to the Associated Press, this was the first time that the doctors reported that the Pope was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection.

The pontiff was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after a week-long battle with bronchitis. According to the Vatican, as the Pope entered the fourth week of being hospitalised, he worked and rested during the day on Saturday.

“In order to record these initial improvements in the coming days as well, his doctors have prudently maintained the prognosis as guarded,” the statement said.

In the Pope's absence, the Vatican's every day operations have been continuing, with Cardinal Pietro Parolin celebrating Mass for an anti-abortion group in St. Peter's Basilica. Parolin also delivered a message from the Pope at the start of the Mass, saying that there was need to protect life, from birth to natural death.

In his message, dated March 5, Francis sought to provide women with alternatives to abortion and encouraged the faithful to promote anti-abortion activities not just for the unborn, but “for the elderly, no longer independent or the incurably ill.”

Notably, the pontiff has not been seen in public since entering hospital. Pope Francis had suffered four attacks of breathlessness since February 22 and the last was on March 3, caused by a significant accumulation of mucus in his lungs, suggesting he did not have the muscle strength to expel the secretions.

The Taliban regime on Saturday issued a message asserting that the rights of women are protected under Islamic laws, “which are different from the Western society.”

The Afghan government's remarks came despite the ongoing global criticism of their gender-related policies.

The Taliban's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid released a statement on his official X account, without specifically mentioning International Women's Day, which is celebrated on March 8.

“In accordance with Islamic law and the culture and traditions of Afghan society, the fundamental rights of Afghan women have been secured. However, it should not be forgotten that the rights of Afghan women are being discussed within an Islamic and Afghan society, which has clear differences from Western societies and their culture,” said Mujahid.

Notably, the Taliban have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, most employment, and many public spaces ever since they assumed control of Afghanistan in 2021.

Last August, Afghanistan's vice and virtue ministry published laws that ban women's voices and bare faces outside the home.

The remarks follow the United Nations' fresh call for the Taliban to lift these bans.

“The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,” said Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. “We remain committed to investing in their resilience and leadership, as they are key to Afghanistan's future.”

The United Nations, on the other hand, has continued to pressure the Taliban to reverse these restrictive measures.

Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, said the world could not accept a future for Afghan women that would never be tolerated elsewhere.

“Our response to their erasure is a test of our commitment to women and girls everywhere,” said Davidian. “We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it - because they do.”

The Taliban’s refusal to recognise women’s rights has left the regime isolated from the international community and also not received formal recognition as a legitimate government by the West.

The restrictions have been particularly felt in Afghanistan’s media sector. The Afghanistan Journalists Support Organisation said 893 women were currently employed in the media sector. That's a drop from 2,756 who were working before 2021, according to Reporters Without Borders.

Earlier on Friday, UNESCO hosted a high-level conference in Paris on women and girls in Afghanistan.

Participants included Hamida Aman, the founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, Fawzia Khoofi, a parliamentarian from the former Western-backed government, and rights experts including Richard Bennett, who is barred from entering Afghanistan.

A Pakistani man has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the administrator of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said Saturday.

Mushtaq Ahmed was shot dead on Thursday evening in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province that borders Afghanistan, which has a history of bloody sectarian violence.

A man named only as Ashfaq has been charged with his murder, according to police documents seen by AFP and a local police official.

Mushtaq allegedly kicked Ashfaq out of the WhatsApp group following an argument, according to a statement by Mushtaq's brother seen by AFP.

He said that both parties had arranged to meet and reconcile but alleges that Ashfaq turned up with a gun and opened fire, killing his brother.

Ashfaq was angry ""in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,"" according to his statement.

The availability of firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and sometimes weak law enforcement contribute to the frequency of such incidents.

American adult star Whitney Wright, whose real name is Brittni Rayne Whittington, has already faced criticism for promoting propaganda for Iran's government after posting about her recent trip to the Islamic Republic. Despite the risks of being arrested or facing a death sentence due to her profession, Wright has now shared new photos from her visit to several Afghan cities. In one of the images, she is seen holding an AK-47 rifle, implying that she was travelling under the protection of the Taliban.

These images of the social media post have sparked outrage; under Taliban-imposed restrictions, Afghan women are banned from travelling more than 72 kilometres alone without a male guardian. The Taliban has also prohibited women from entering parks, restaurants, and gyms.

Wazhma Tokhi, an Afghan women's rights and education activist, called this situation ""fundamentally hypocritical"".

""Afghan women are imprisoned in their own homeland, while foreign visitors - no matter their background - are treated with hospitality,"" she added.

 Local officials from Russia's ruling party have caused controversy by presenting mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine with gifts of meat grinders, an appliance widely used to describe Russia's brutal tactics on the front line. 

 The United Russia party in the northern Murmansk region posted photos on social media showing officials smiling as they visited bereaved mothers with gifts of flowers and boxed meat grinders for International Women's Day on Saturday, which is widely celebrated in Russia. 

 The post included a message thanking the ""dear mums"" for their ""strength of spirit and the love you put into bringing up your sons"". It said the gifts were the initiative of the women's wing of the party. 

 Some online commentators called the gesture as ""shameful"" and ""inappropriate"". 

 Russia is often accused of throwing its frontline soldiers into a ""meat grinder"" with scant regard for their lives. 

 The Russian word for meat grinder, myasorubka, has the same double meaning as in English. 

 It refers to a tactic in which small groups of soldiers are sent into attack, one after another, in waves, risking heavy losses, with the aim of eventually wearing out and overpowering Ukrainian troops. 

 The party's local branch in the town of Polyarniye Zori defended itself against the online backlash, saying critics were making ""callous and provocative interpretations"" of its gifts. 

 Mayor Maxim Chengayev, who took part in the handover of gifts, said that meat grinders were not originally intended to be included but ""one woman asked for it, and we of course could not say no,"" United Russia said. 

 The local party later posted a video in which one of the soldiers' mothers awkwardly thanked the party for the gifts and confirmed that she had asked for a meat grinder because she needed one. 

 Russia has rarely given any figures for its losses in Ukraine and the true toll is unknown, but independent media put it at many tens of thousands. 

 The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC's Russian service said last month they had identified the names of some 91,000 Russian soldiers killed, but added the actual toll was likely to be ""considerably higher"". 

 At the end of 2024, then-US defense secretary Lloyd Austin spoke of 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded. 

 Ukraine has also suffered heavy losses, whose full extent is unclear. 

 President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and around 380,000 wounded. Media reports based on Western sources have given estimated Ukrainian military death tolls ranging from 50,000 to 100,000.

 March 8 - Authorities in two Russian regions have blocked the Telegram messenger because of concerns that the app could be used by enemies, a regional digital development minister was quoted as saying by the TASS state news agency on Saturday. 

 Dagestan and Chechnya are mainly Muslim regions in southern Russia where intelligence services have registered an increase in militant Islamist activity. 

 ""It is often used by enemies, an example of which is the riots at the Makhachkala airport,"" said Yuri Gamzatov, Dagestan's digital development minister, adding that the decision to block the messenger had been made at the federal level. 

 Gamzatov was referring to an anti-Israel riot in Dagestan in October 2023, when hundreds of protesters stormed an airport to try to attack passengers arriving on a plane from the Jewish state. No passengers were injured, and authorities have prosecuted several people over the incident. 

 News of the plane's arrival had spread on local Telegram channels, where users posted calls for antisemitic violence. Telegram condemned the attack and said it would block the channels. 

 Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the blocks in Russia. 

 Based in Dubai and founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov, the messenger has nearly 1 billion users and is used widely in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. 

 Moscow tried but failed to block Telegram in 2018 and has in the past demanded the platform hand over user data. Durov is under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime on the app. 

 Gamzatov, the minister in Dagestan, said Telegram could be unblocked in the future, but encouraged users to switch to other messengers in the meantime.

 Russia on Saturday said its troops had retaken three villages seized by Ukraine in its Kursk border region in a fresh setback for Kyiv as the prospect of peace negotiations appeared to be increasing. 

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday called for more sanctions against Russia as overnight strikes killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more. 

 The war is at a critical juncture, days ahead of talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators aimed at securing a truce in the three-year-long war. 

 Washington has suspended crucial US military aid and access to satellite imagery and intelligence sharing after President Donald Trump and Zelensky had a public falling-out in the Oval Office last week. 

 Ukraine still controls some 400 square kilometres in the Kursk region after launching a cross-border offensive last August and Zelensky sees this as a possible bargaining chip in peace talks. 

 But Ukraine's troops in Kursk have seen their position worsen in recent weeks with Russia's army encroaching. 

 Russia's defence ministry on Saturday announced the recapture of three more villages: Viktorovka, Nikolayevka and Staraya Sorochina. 

 According to DeepState, an online military tracker linked to the Ukrainian army, the Russian move followed a ""breach"" in Ukrainian defence lines near the town of Sudzha, which is under Kyiv's control. 

 Russia appears to have cut off the logistics route needed by Ukraine to supply its troops in the town. 

 The Ukrainian army has not commented on the latest claim, but Russia has already taken back more than two-thirds of its territory initially seized by Kyiv.

 Peace negotiations remain a distant prospect with Kyiv and Moscow making starkly opposed demands. But Trump's return to the White House has brought this prospect nearer. 

 The American president has radically shifted the US position, reaching out to Russian President Vladimir Putin while criticising Zelensky. 

 Trump has said it may be ""easier"" to work with Moscow than Kyiv on efforts to end the three-year-long war. 

 Senior US and Ukrainian officials are set to meet for talks on the war in Jeddah on Tuesday. Zelensky will also visit on Monday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 

 US envoy Steve Witkoff said he would speak to the Ukrainian negotiators about an ""initial ceasefire"" with Russia and a ""framework"" for a longer agreement. 

 Trump says he wants to end the war as soon as possible, but Ukraine fears being forced to make heavy territorial concessions to Moscow. 

 Kyiv's troops are also struggling on the eastern front, although an AFP analysis of US-based Institute for the Study of War data showed Moscow's advance had slowed in February. 

 Trump on Friday threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia over its bombardment of Ukraine. 

 Zelensky also called for allies to ""increase sanctions against Russia"" after heavy overnight bombardment in the east and northeast. 

 A Russian assault hit the centre of Dobropillia in the eastern Donetsk region late on Friday, killing 11 people and wounding 30, according to the emergency services. 

 Separately, three people were killed and seven others wounded in a drone attack early on Saturday in the town of Bogodukhiv, the military head of the eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said. 

 Russia fired two missiles and 145 drones at Bogodukhiv, Ukraine's air force said.

 The latest air raids came after EU leaders, shaken by the prospect of US disengagement, agreed to boost the bloc's defences. 

 Putin ""has no interest in peace"", the European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Saturday, adding that ""we must step up our military support"". 

 In Dobropillia, AFP saw charred residential buildings, flattened market stalls and evidence of cluster bomb damage. 

 Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour ""lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket"". 

 ""It was shocking, I don't have the words to describe it,"" Kostenko told AFP. 

 Moscow's defence ministry on Saturday said its air defence systems destroyed 31 Ukrainian drones over the past night. 

 A Ukrainian drone attack also targeted Russia's Kirishi oil refinery and falling debris caused damage to a reservoir, the governor of the northwestern Leningrad region, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said. 

 A civilian was wounded by a drone attack in Belgorod district near the Ukraine border, local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday slammed what he described as bullying tactics a day after US President Donald Trump threatened military action against Iran.

""Some bully governments -- I really don't know of any more appropriate term for some foreign figures and leaders than the word bullying -- insist on negotiations. Their negotiations are not aimed at solving problems, they aim at domination,"" AFP quoted Khamenei as saying during a meeting with country's officials. 

The Iranian leader's remark comes hours after Tehran's mission to the United Nations said that it received no letter from Trump.

""We have not received such a letter so far,"" said a spokesman for Iran's embassy to the UN after Tehran's foreign minister told AFP Friday that the country would not negotiate so long as the United States applies “maximum pressure.”

ALSO READ: Russia offers to mediate between US and Iran in nuclear program talks

On Friday, Trump said he wrote a letter to Iran's leadership, urging the country to negotiate a new nuclear deal.

“I’ve written them a letter saying I hope you negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing for them,” Trump told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo in an interview.

Trump said that while he isn’t ruling out a military intervention, he would “rather negotiate a deal.”

“I’m not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,” the US president said.

Later Friday in the Oval Office, Trump said the situation with Iran was “down to final strokes” and suggested a deadline for striking a deal or military action was rapidly approaching.

“We have a situation with Iran that something’s going to happen very soon,” Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying.

“Hopefully we can have a peace deal. I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal,"" he added.

 Johannesburg, Four radio stations catering to the Indian community in South Africa received the 'Special Recognition Award' for significantly contributing to restore and grow the Indian culture and heritage through their body of work. 

 Southside FM catering to the South Indian community; Eastwave FM, the first Indian community radio station; Hindvani, run by Hindi Shiksha Sangh of South Africa, and Lotus FM, a South African national radio station were among the awardees on Friday at the start of the three-day Indian Film Festival South Africa 25 here. 

 Radio stations catering to the Indian community in South Africa have an important role to play in not just maintaining cultural heritage but also through encouraging fostering of unity locally and globally, said the organisers. 

 The awards were given by the High Commission of India to media houses and individuals who have significantly contributed to restore and grow the Indian culture and heritage in India and South Africa through their body of work coinciding with the Indian Film Festival South Africa 25 . 

 IFFSA is being hosted by the High Commission of India and the Consulate General of India with Zee Entertainment Africa. 

 “This recognition is not just a celebration of our work, but a testament to the power of culture, storytelling and shared experiences in bringing people together around the world, using the platform of radio as a medium,” said Tansen Nepaul, Station Manager of Southside FM. 

 Southside FM caters to the South Indian community in the country, largely descended from the first indentured labourers who arrived in South Africa from 1860 onwards. 

 Vikash Maharagh, who founded the Eastwave FM 92.2 FM over three decades ago, said the award was very special because the High Commission had taken the time and effort to acknowledge their role in helping preserve culture. “We don’t just exist in a vacuum. A lot of the content that we provide is indeed from your country and we just try to preserve it by adding in our own South African context.” 

 Naresh Amichand and Simi Sharma accepted the award for Hindvani on behalf of the Hindi Shiksha Sangh of South Africa. 

 “This a great recognition of the work that we have done solely with volunteers for the past 27 years to propagate the Hindi language through our love for the mother tongue and the fusion of Indo-South African music that we present on our airwaves,” Sharma said. 

 Presenter Varshan Sookun, while accepting the award on behalf of Lotus FM, highlighted the task of the station: “As the only national Indian radio station in South Africa, we have a special responsibility of celebrating our shared history with India.” 

 Others who received the award for cultural promotion were Zee TV CEO Somnath Malakar, Avalon Group CEO AB Moosa, actress Tarina Patel, and internationally-renowned musician Wouter Kellerman.

Russia has rarely given any figures for its losses and the true toll in the Ukraine war remains unknown.

 Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of complicity in genocide in a filing at the International Court of Justice, putting the spotlight on the oil-rich monarchy's alleged involvement in a devastating civil war. 

 The UAE has long been accused by Sudan and others of supporting the Rapid Support Forces , which have been fighting the regular army for nearly two years an allegation the Gulf state denies. 

 How is the UAE involved in Sudan, and what ties does it have to the RSF?

 One of Africa's largest countries, Sudan has a wealth of natural resources including vast agricultural lands, gas and gold, of which it is the continent's third-largest producer. 

 It neighbours Libya, where Abu Dhabi backs the rebel authorities, and has a coastline on the Red Sea a crucial maritime route for oil shipping. 

 In 2021, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power in a coup alongside his deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, known as Hemeti. 

 Two years later fighting erupted between the two generals, with powers including the UAE, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia accused of supporting one side or the other. 

 ""The primary goal for the UAE in Sudan has been about political influence in a strategically very important country,"" said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security specialist at King's College London. 

 Emirati state-affiliated companies look at Sudan as a hub for investment in resources, minerals and trade more generally, he said. 

 Sudan researcher Hamid Khalafallah said the desert UAE is interested in natural resources it lacks, including minerals and arable land. 

 From Libya to Somalia, ""we see a pattern of the UAE working with paramilitaries"" to exploit the continent's resources, he said. 

 Development group Swissaid estimated in a report last year that in 2022, 66.5 percent of African gold exports to the UAE had been smuggled out. 

 The UAE, a major hub for the gold trade, is the world's top buyer of the precious metal from Sudan, a sector largely controlled by Daglo. 

 But Federico Donelli, a professor of international relations at Italy's University of Trieste, said it would be ""too simplistic"" to say the UAE's interests were all about gold. 

 Abu Dhabi is also seeking to counter Saudi influence in Sudan and prevent the spread of political Islam, which it sees as a threat to its security, he said.

 Gulf ties to Sudan's military stem from cooperation in Yemen, after Khartoum joined the Saudi-led coalition fighting a civil war there in 2015. 

 Burhan led the Sudanese who fought under the Saudis, while Daglo's RSF were deployed with soldiers from the UAE, Donelli earlier told the Nordic Africa Institute. 

 Rifts have since emerged between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, traditionally close allies. UAE support for Daglo, though denied by the Emiratis, serves ""to challenge Saudi objectives"", Donelli said. 

 The relationship is also ideological, with the RSF willing to contain the Muslim Brotherhood political movement, which is outlawed by the UAE and other Arab states, Krieg said. 

 This sets the RSF apart from the army, which has been linked with remnants of the Islamist regime of former dictator Omar al-Bashir. 

 Both sides have faced claims of war crimes during Sudan's bitter conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million. 

 But in January, Washington accused the RSF of genocide for targeting ethnic groups with mass killings and gang rapes. 

 Also in January, two US lawmakers said the UAE had broken its promises to stop providing military aid to the RSF. 

 Daglo's private finances are run from the UAE, Krieg said, adding that he had become ""co-dependent"" on Abu Dhabi. 

 The RSF has received crucial support from the UAE, including arms deliveries through neighbouring Chad, diplomats, analysts and human rights groups say. 

 The UAE denies the allegations.

 Sudan filed its case against the UAE at the ICJ, the top UN court in The Hague, on Thursday, claiming complicity in genocide over Abu Dhabi's alleged support for the RSF. 

 The UAE dismissed the case as a ""publicity stunt"" and said it would try to have it thrown out. 

 ICJ rulings are legally binding, but the court has no power to enforce them. 

 Donelli said the case was likely to cause reputational damage to the UAE. 

 ""Both internationally and within Africa, there is an increasing perception of the Emirates as a destabilising actor,"" he told AFP. 

 But ""the financial and political prominence that the UAE has gained over the past decade will likely shield it from any serious repercussions"".

A tense situation unfolded in London when a man climbed the iconic Palace of Westminster, the UK parliament building while holding a Palestinian flag. Local media reported that he shouted, “Free Palestine.”

Emergency services were called to the scene as the man perched several metres above the ground on the iconic Elizabeth Tower, home to Big Ben. He was seen standing barefoot on a ledge of the historic tower, Reuters reported.

Photos from the scene showed crowds of onlookers behind a police cordon, as nearby streets were closed for safety.

Soon after the incident was reported, people gathered in the street to support the protestor who climbed the side of the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known by the name of the clock's bell “Big Ben.”

The man’s actions brought traffic and footfall in the area to a standstill, as at least nine emergency service vehicles lined Bridge Street in central London and crowds looked on from beyond a police cordon.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said they were alerted to the incident at Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) at 0724 GMT.

“Officers are at the scene working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. They are being assisted by the London Fire Brigade and the London Ambulance Service,” the spokesperson said.

While the man’s motivations remain unclear, the sight of the Palestinian flag draped from the tower immediately drew the attention of the people.

Bridge Street, which is at the north end of Westminster Bridge, is closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident, police told PA Media.

It is understood one exit of Westminster Tube station is closed, but there is no disruption to Tube services and passengers can use other exits.

“Firefighters are responding alongside the Metropolitan Police Service to reports of a person scaling the Palace of Westminster,"" a spokesman for the London Fire Brigade (LFB).

Crews from Lambeth, Chelsea, Soho and Islington fire stations have been deployed, LFB added.

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday called for more sanctions against Russia as overnight strikes killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, days ahead of talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators aimed at securing a truce. 

 A Russian assault hit the centre of Dobropillia in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region late on Friday, killing 11 people and wounding 30, according to the emergency services. 

 Separately, three people were killed and seven others wounded in a drone attack early on Saturday in the city of Bogodukhiv, the military head of the eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said. 

 Russia fired two missiles and 145 drones at Bogodukhiv, Ukraine's air force said. 

 The overnight air raids came after US President Donald Trump threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia but said it may be ""easier"" to work with Moscow than Kyiv on efforts to end the three-year-long war. 

 ""Such strikes show that Russia's goals are unchanged. Therefore, it is very important to continue to do everything to protect life, strengthen our air defence, and increase sanctions against Russia,"" Zelensky wrote on the Telegram social media channel. 

 In Dobropillia, AFP saw charred residential buildings, flattened market stalls and evidence of cluster bomb damage. 

 Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour ""lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket"". 

 ""It was shocking, I don't have the words to describe it,"" Kostenko told AFP. 

 Zelensky said that Russia had struck Dobropillia, waited until rescuers arrived and then ""deliberately"" targeted them as well. 

 ""This is a despicable and inhumane tactic of intimidation that the Russians often use,"" he said.

 US and Ukrainian negotiators are due to meet in Saudi Arabia next week with bilateral relations frayed. 

 Trump publicly berated Zelensky during a White House meeting and suspended US aid to Kyiv in a stated bid to encourage diplomacy. 

 ""I'm finding it more difficult frankly to deal with Ukraine and they don't have the cards,"" Trump said on Friday. ""It may be easier dealing with Russia."" 

 The remarks followed Trump on Friday threatening new sanctions and tariffs on Russia over its bombardments of Ukraine. 

 ""To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,"" he added. 

 Zelensky is due to land in Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 

 The meeting is a day before Ukrainian officials are expected to hold fresh talks with their US counterparts on Tuesday there. 

 On Saturday, Russia said it had retaken three villages in its Kursk region previously captured by Ukraine. 

 The Russian defence ministry announced the recapture of Viktorovka, Nikolayevka and Staraya Sorochina. 

 Ukrainian soldiers launched an offensive in Kursk last summer but Russia has wrested back control of more than two-thirds of the territory captured by Kyiv. 

 Moscow's defence ministry on Saturday said its air defence systems destroyed 31 Ukrainian drones over the past night. 

 A Ukrainian drone attack also targeted Russia's Kirishi oil refinery, with air defence forces shooting down one drone on approach and another over the facility, Leningrad governor Aleksandr Drozdenko said, adding that the ""external structure of one of the reservoirs was damaged by falling debris"". 

 A civilian was wounded by a drone attack in Belgorod district near the Ukraine border, local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram.

 Russia's defence ministry confirmed on Friday that it had carried out ""precision"" strikes on energy facilities. 

 The Ukrainian air force said it had deployed French Mirage fighter jets delivered to Ukraine last month for the first time to repel the aerial onslaught. 

 Ukrainian energy facilities in the Black Sea region of Odesa and the central Poltava region were damaged. 

 The latest air raids came after EU leaders, shaken by the prospect of US disengagement, agreed to boost the bloc's defences.

Police in Toronto are searching for three male suspects after at least 12 people were injured in a pub shooting in the Canadian city.

None of the injuries were life-threatening, police posted on X, saying six of those injured had gunshot wounds.

Toronto Police added that the victims are aged between their 20s and mid-50s.

""One male was armed with what appears to be an assault rifle, the other two males were armed with handguns, and they walked into the bar, they produced their guns and they opened fire indiscriminately on the people sitting inside,"" said Superintendent Paul MacIntyre of the Toronto Police Service.

The update comes hours after Toronto police said it was searching for one suspect in relation to the shooting.

The force added that the suspect was ""wearing a black balaclava"" and was seen ""fleeing in [a] silver car"".

Police were called to reports of a shooting at the Piper Arms pub in Scarborough, a district of Toronto, at around 10.39pm local time.

The motive was not immediately clear, according to Superintendent MacIntyre, who said the shooting was ""a brazen and reckless act of violence that's really shaken our community and the city itself"".

Officers are urging people to avoid the scene at Progress Ave and Corporate Drive.

Armed police and several ambulances and fire engines are in the area as the hunt for the suspects continues.

Toronto paramedics told Canada's CP24 Media it was a ""dynamic situation"" and the injuries ranged from minor to critical. Supt MacIntyre called the victims ""extremely lucky"".

Olivia Chow, mayor of Toronto, said: ""I am deeply troubled to hear reports of a shooting at a pub in Scarborough.

""I have spoken to (Toronto Police Chief Myron) Demkiw and he has assured me all necessary resources have been deployed. This is an early and ongoing investigation - police will provide further details.

GOP leaders say the bill was closely coordinated with the White House.

House Republican leaders on Saturday unveiled a GOP-led stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, that will fund the government at current levels through the end of September.

The 99-page bill moderately increases defense spending by about $6 billion more than fiscal 2024 levels, while non-defense spending is about $13 billion lower than fiscal 2024 levels, according to GOP leaders. There is an additional $6 billion for veterans' healthcare.

The measure leaves out emergency funding for disasters and community project funding.

President Donald Trump on Saturday urged congressional Republicans to support and vote for the short-term government funding bill.

""All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week. Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's 'financial house' in order,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Trump said Republicans must ""remain united,"" adding that Democrats will ""do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can't let that happen.""

Notably, there are funding add-ons to the bill, known as ""anomalies,"" including a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and a hike in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation operation.

GOP leaders say the bill was closely coordinated with the White House. Funding levels in the bill are below those previously set as part of that 2023 bipartisan funding deal.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is plowing ahead with this GOP plan and is set to hold a vote in the House on Tuesday without the backing of Democrats.

However, getting this Republican plan passed through both chambers will be a real challenge with the March 14 deadline less than a week away.

Democrats are not on board with the proposal, meaning Republicans need near-unanimous support. Johnson has little room for error with his slim 218-214 majority and can only afford to lose one defection if all members are voting and present.

House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., slammed the GOP proposal in a statement released Saturday.

""I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people,"" DeLauro wrote.

""By essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire,"" she added.

Jack Otter and the ‘Barron’s Roundtable’ panelists discuss what factors are propelling the revival of nuclear energy in the United States.

The U.S. is facing a dangerous gap in its ability to access nuclear fuel and stares down a potential supply chain shortage in enriched uranium — which is vital for America's energy and national security. 

The U.S. relies almost entirely on foreign exports, including from Russia, for its nuclear fuel needs — a factor that has put the U.S. in even greater jeopardy after Washington agreed to cut all uranium imports from Russia by 2028. 

But there’s a glaring problem with this move — there is not enough enriched uranium in the world to make up for the amount of exports the U.S. relies on from Russia, as well as the import cuts made by the European Union following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

TRUMP SENDS LETTER TO IRAN ON NUCLEAR PROGRAM: 'MAKE A DEAL' OR FACE US 'MILITARILY'

""The whole world is dependent on Russia,"" Dan Leistikow, Vice President of Corporate Communications with American nuclear power company Centrus, told FOX Business.

Leistikow explained that even under the most aggressive timetable to reboot U.S. production of its nuclear energy, it is estimated to take between six and seven years to replace what is imported from Russia — potentially leaving up to a four-year gap where there could be major nuclear fuel shortages. 

Enriched uranium is used in various vital sectors in the U.S., including as a fuel source for advanced reactors, energy security, providing fuel for the Navy's nuclear needs, as well as maintaining the U.S.' nuclear deterrence.

While there are three major producers operating commercial enrichment plants in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., the U.S., and Russia, the U.S. only supplies 5% of its domestic needs, according to the World Nuclear Association. 

As of 2022, Russia accounted for nearly half of the world’s global enrichment capacity, including 20% of the U.S. market, according to information shared by Centrus with FOX Business.

Under the Urenco consortium, which comprises Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., a little more than a third of the global enrichment capacity is accounted for — which the U.S. heavily imports from and accounts for 60%-80% of its consumption needs. 

CLEAN TECH, AI BOOM STRAINING US ENERGY SUPPLY

Despite the fact that the U.S. invented the technology and led the world in domestic uranium mining in 1980 during the height of the Cold War, Russia now has the world's largest uranium enrichment complex.

""Over the last few decades, America slowly lost its leadership in uranium enrichment and now America’s nuclear fuel requirements are in jeopardy. Unless we start building centrifuges in America quickly, the potential for a shortfall is real,"" said Leistikow.

But Leistikow said there is a solution, and one that needs to be immediately pursued to ensure the U.S. doesn’t see drastic supply chain shortages in just three years’ time.

""Scaling up the Ohio enrichment plant that President Trump launched in his first term is the fastest option to meet our energy security and national security needs — and it ensures that American tax dollars stay in the United States,"" he said.

Under the Biden administration in 2024, Congress allocated $3.4 billion to expand U.S. low-enriched uranium capabilities, and in December six American companies were selected as the final contenders for the Trump administration to then choose from — including American Centrifuge Operating, LLC, which Centrus already works with to install and operate centrifuges.

""Ultimately, the choice the Department of Energy faces is between importing centrifuges manufactured in Europe, or relying on cutting-edge U.S. centrifuge technology built by American workers,""  Leistikow said. ""Centrus is committed to the American option.""

The president signed an order limiting who can benefit from the program.

President Donald Trump is defending his decision to pause some tariffs to Canada and Mexico for another month -- a notable reversal after imposing historic levies on the key U.S. trading partners earlier this week, causing markets to tumble.

On Friday, Trump signed more executive orders at the White House before he convened a first-ever cryptocurrency summit with industry leaders.

Trump urged congressional Republicans on Saturday to support and vote for the short-term government funding bill released earlier by House GOP leaders.





""All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week. Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country’s 'financial house' in order,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday limiting who is eligible to benefit from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the White House said, with a focus of barring those who work for nonprofit organizations engaging in ""lawbreaking activities.""

""A lot of these people work for NGO organizations, for nonprofit organizations, that engage in illegal or what we would consider to be improper activities,"" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. ""For example, illegal immigration or foreign terrorist organizations or otherwise lawbreaking activities.""





The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, signed into law in 2007 by then-President George W. Bush, forgives the remaining balance for eligible borrowers after 10 years of payments while working full time in the federal, state or local government, including the military, or for a nonprofit.

-ABC News' Fritz Farrow

President Donald Trump on Friday night announced he was naming Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, a month after he terminated its chair and several members.





""I am thrilled to announce that Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo will be joining our Kennedy Center Board - This completes our selection,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform. “We look forward to restoring the Center to Greatness, and ushering in America’s Golden Age. Together, we will Make the Arts Great Again!”

Several performers have stepped down from the board, like Shonda Rhimes, or canceled their scheduled appearances at the center, citing Trump's takeover. The producer of Broadway hit ""Hamilton"" announced on Wednesday the play's 2026 run at the Kennedy Center was canceled.

President Donald Trump held a crypto summit at the White House on Friday where he trumpeted his executive order that aims to create a strategic bitcoin reserve he called a ""digital Fort Knox.""

""Last year, I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet, and we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise as you know around the table,"" Trump said.





The reserve will be made up of bitcoin obtained via criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

“From this day on, America will follow the rule that every bitcoin knows very well: Never sell your bitcoin,” Trump added, after criticizing the administration of former President Joe Biden. ""And that's a little phrase that they have. I don't know if that's right or not. Who the hell knows?”

Trump vowed that the treasury and commerce departments will pursue additional avenues to acquire bitcoin ""provided it's done at no cost to the taxpayers. We don't want any cost to the taxpayers.""

By Marnie Hunter, CNN

(CNN) — Timed entry, long lines of cars at the gates and trails crowded with people angling for the best photos ops. Visitors aren’t likely to find any such hurdles at the least visited of the United States’ national parks.

Visitation numbers hit a new record for 2024, with the National Park Service’s more than 400 sites welcoming a whopping 331.9 million recreation visits.

The 63 headliners — the sites with “national park” in the name — accounted for 28% of all the visits. But some are way more packed than others. And with the recent slashing of about 1,000 park jobs, some parks may soon feel the strain of crowds acutely.

While Zion National Park in Utah and the Grand Canyon in Arizona are managing summer crowds, these 15 spots — five of which are in Alaska — will see a small fraction of the millions of visitors crowding the most popular parks.

Some are very remote and lack much of the infrastructure of the blockbuster spots, but there’s no shortage of vast, spectacular wilderness to explore.

Here are the 15 least visited US parks for 2024:

1. Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve, Alaska


 11,907 recreation visits

With no roads, no trails, no cell service and no established campsites, this massive expanse is a true wilderness experience. The park and preserve has six designated Wild Rivers.

“Visitors may wander at will across 8.4 million acres of superlative natural beauty,” the park’s website says. Visitors must be self-sufficient, flexible and “able to execute self-extraction and communication, should an emergency situation arise.” Arrive prepared.

2. North Cascades National Park, Washington


16,485 recreation visits

Peaks crowned by more than 300 glaciers tower over this alpine landscape that sees a fraction of the visitors of Washington’s other national parks — Mount Rainier and Olympic. While the park itself is sparsely visited, two bordering National Recreation Areas — Ross Lake and Lake Chelan — mean visitation to the combined three-unit North Cascades complex is much higher.  Over 1,600 species of plants — more than any other US national park — have been identified on this land that spans temperate rainforest to a dry ponderosa pine ecosystem. North Cascades has more than 400 miles of trails.

3. Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska


17,233 recreation visits

There are no roads, campgrounds or entrance gates for this 1.8 million-acre expanse’s human visitors. Half a million caribou migrate through this park, crossing the Kobuk River and Onion Portage, according to the National Park Service. An 8,000-year tradition of hunting caribou here continues today.

4. Lake Clark National Park & Preserve, Alaska


18,505 recreation visits

Stretching across more than 4 million acres, this national park and preserve is home to three designated Wild Rivers and two National Natural Landmark volcanoes. The land holds 10,000 years of human history and preserves the ancestral homelands of the Dena’ina people.

5. National Park of American Samoa


22,567 recreation visits

Most parkgoers will need a passport to visit this spot in a remote part of the South Pacific. Hawaiian Airlines offers direct flights to American Samoa from Honolulu. The park has units on three islands and stretches across 13,500 acres, some 4,000 of which are marine acres that are mostly coral reefs.

6. Isle Royale National Park, Michigan


28,806 recreation visits

An isolated archipelago in Lake Superior, Isle Royale boasts 165 miles of trails and more than 30 campgrounds. It’s open from mid-April through the end of October. Ferry and seaplane service typically runs from mid-May through the end of September, according to NPS.

There are fewer mammal species here — only 18 — than on the mainland because animals must cross at least 14 miles of Lake Superior. Wolves and moose are among the notable animal residents.

7. Katmai National Park & Preserve, Alaska


36,230 recreation visits

Katmai is an important habitat for thousands of brown bears. One of the world’s premier bear-viewing spots, according to the Park Service, Katmai is home to an estimated 2,200 brown bears. Brooks Camp along the Brooks River is one of the most popular viewing spots to observe bears feasting on salmon.

8. Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve, Alaska


81,670 recreation visits

America’s largest national park, Wrangell-St. Elias encompasses 13.2 million acres — or about the size of Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park and Switzerland combined, the Park Service says. Most of the park is backcountry, and visitor services are limited. There are some maintained trails in the frontcountry Nabesna and McCarthy areas.

9. Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida


84,873 recreation visits

About 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Key West, Dry Tortugas is mostly open water with seven small islands. Garden Key is home to one of the nation’s largest 19th-century forts, Fort Jefferson. The park is accessible by boat or plane and is host to nearly 300 species of birds. Bush Key closes every year from February to September so that sooty terns and brown noddies can breed there undisturbed.

10. Great Basin National Park, Nevada


152,068 recreation visits

Mountain peaks meet hot desert valleys here. Great Basin National Park is home to 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, ancient bristlecone pines, about 40 caves and a wide array of plants and animals. The elevation ranges from 5,000 to 13,000 feet with hiking trails for all levels.

11. Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota


199,030 recreation visits

Billed as a park of “water, islands and horizons,” Voyageurs covers 218,055 acres — 84,000 of which is water. There are more than 500 islands and four large lakes, plus more than two dozen smaller lakes in the park, which is best experienced by boat. Voyageurs shares its northern boundary with Canada, and lucky visitors may even see the northern lights.

12. Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas


226,134 recreation visits

This park boasts the four highest peaks in Texas and the world’s most extensive Permian fossil reef. Guadalupe Mountains Wilderness has more than 80 miles of trail including a hike in the Salt Basin Dunes that rise 100 feet from the desert floor.

13. Congaree National Park, South Carolina


 242,049 recreation visits

Congaree National Park’s landscape is “defined by the presence of both flood and flame,” the Park Service says.

Floodwaters from the Congaree and Wateree rivers regularly cover the park’s old-growth bottomland hardwood forest, and the upland pine forest depends on wildfires to clear out competing vegetation. Canoeing and kayaking are popular ways to explore the park. There’s a 15-mile marked canoe trail.

14. Channel Islands National Park, California


262,581 recreation visits

Stretching over five islands and the surrounding ocean, Channel Islands National Park offer opportunities to hike, snorkel, kayak, birdwatch and more. The National Park Service strongly recommends sea kayaking with an authorized guide.

Anemones, sea stars, urchins, barnacles, periwinkles and other marine creatures inhabit the park’s tide pools — some of the best in Southern California. There is one established campground on each island; reservations are required. Backcountry camping is allowed on two islands.

15. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado


335,862 recreation visits

The canyon, sculpted over two million years by the Gunnison River and other natural forces, measures 2,722 feet (829 meters) at its greatest depth. A wide variety of rock types — including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary — are displayed within its walls. The wilderness of the inner canyon requires a permit to enter.  Nearly 60 mammal species and 174 bird species call the Black Canyon home.

As the US president warns of a ‘a little short-term interruption’, businesses are struggling to make decisions amid heightened uncertainty

Donald Trump declared there to be “no room left” for a deal with Canada and Mexico this week, launching a trade war against his nation’s closest allies that he presented as an effort to protect America’s soul.

Then he pulled back. It wasn’t his first feint and retreat. It probably won’t be the last.

A day after imposing steep tariffs on his country’s neighbors, the US president announced a month-long reprieve for carmakers. The following day, tariffs were also suspended on almost all goods from Canada and Mexico.

Tariffs on China, levied at a 10% rate in February and doubled to 20% on Tuesday, remain in place. Trump and his aides are now trailing a fresh wave of tariffs in early April as “the big one”, with myriad markets – including the European Union – and industries in their sights.

Each abrupt and erratic jerk and jolt on policy in Washington reverberates around the world, with firms in the US and far beyond trying to keep track of developments from one day to the next – and figure out what they mean.

The architects of Trumponomics insist it will pave the way for a greater, more prosperous future. But firms are struggling to make out the economic landscape now, let alone what might happen next.

“When you have such a high level of uncertainty, and have a set of policies that seem to impact every part of the economy ... it leads to businesses essentially being frozen,” said Sameera Fazili, former deputy director of the national economic council (NEC) under Joe Biden. “They’re not able to make investments. They’re not able to make plans. They’re not able to make hiring decisions.

“Because they don’t know where these policies are going to head. These policies are going to have such an impact on their bottom line.”

In the four short months since his election victory last November, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in February; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; briefly imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; revoked those tariffs on most goods; and threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in April.

For companies attempting to navigate North America – from car manufacturers to juice makers – the world shifted, and shifted back, at a dizzying pace in a matter of days. “I don’t know how they navigate it,” said Fazili. “You can’t run a business with one-month cliffs around you all the time.”

“This is not a moment to celebrate,” Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said after Thursday’s latest delay. “The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll.

“We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People’s livelihoods are at stake.”

As a campaigner, Trump’s great political skill is his ability to use rhetoric – often brash, crude and even false – to bend perception of reality.

The president’s rhetoric can leave listeners with the impression that tariffs will revitalize America’s industrial heartlands, and fill up the federal government’s coffers with trillions of dollars from other countries, with only a minor impact on US consumers.

“The countries and companies that have been ripping us aren’t particularly happy with what I’m doing,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. Sure, tariffs might bring about “a little short-term interruption” in the US economy, he conceded, but “I don’t think it’s going to be big”.

But the reality of tariffs is trickier. Tariffs are generally paid by importers, for starters – in this case, US companies buying goods from overseas – not exporters, who sell the products, or the countries where they are based. Many of these US firms quickly made plain this week that they would pass on these higher costs to their customers.

While Trump has used the threat of tariffs to encourage overseas firms to relocate their factories to the US, such longer-term investments are harder for executives to plan when they do not know which duties will be in place next week.

Seven weeks into his second term, as many Americans grapple with the cost of living after years of higher inflation, Trump continues to blame Joe Biden. “We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” he said during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night.

The US economy is not in a state of catastrophe, having shown remarkable resilience in the years following the end of the pandemic. The biggest issue has been inflation, which surged to its highest level in a generation three years ago, but has since fallen dramatically from this peak.

Presidents typically “move on quickly, or don’t criticize their predecessors by name”, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “Here’s another norm that Trump has exploded. Trump has no limits and his base lets him get away with anything. So expect it to continue.”

But should prices rise as a direct result of Trump’s decisions – as many economists and business leaders have warned – it will grow more challenging to blame Biden for day-to-day affordability challenges.

On the campaign trail last year, Trump repeatedly pledged to “rapidly” bring down prices from “day one” of his second administration. “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,” he declared on the eve of November’s election.

Only after winning did he acknowledge how difficult this would be. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up,” he told Time a few weeks his victory. “You know, it’s very hard.”

It is one thing to play down higher prices and bills as “a little short-term interruption” when they’re a risk. Should they become reality, such rhetoric is less likely to wash.

“Once you’re in charge, you’re in charge,” said Fazili. “And if there’s a problem in the economy, people look to you to fix it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Is this the happiest business in Seattle?,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/is-this-the-happiest-business-in-seattle/,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

He was working some job he doesn’t even remember, it wasn’t great, every day felt like a slog.

Then Ben Holmes talked with his grandfather. The thing about the family business, his grandfather told him, is all of our customers are happy.

“You’re dealing with people when good things have happened, so you have great customers, happy customers,” Monty Holmes Sr. told his grandson. 

That was about 15 years ago.

Ben Holmes, 38, now runs the family business, the third generation of his family to run Athletic Awards, a trophy shop in South Lake Union. 

They are, Holmes is fond of saying, in the happiness business. Everyone who calls or visits is celebrating something.

Athletic Awards sells trophies to rec leagues and to the Seahawks. They sell participation ribbons and state championship trophies.

In business since 1949 (and in its current form and location since 1983), the company’s customers map the shifting trends of our civic and social lives. 

In the early days, bowling helped sustain the business. Ben’s dad, Monty Holmes, would set up shop at a bowling alley for a week, to get contacts and trophy orders from every league at the alley.

But bowling trophies have waned as the alleys have disappeared. The Seattle region used to have more than 40 bowling alleys. Now there are 10 or so; only three in the city.

What’s replaced bowling? Well, they’re selling more soccer trophies than they did 40 years ago. And they’re selling a lot, a lot, more fantasy football trophies.

“Tons more fantasy football,” Holmes says. “That’s definitely been a growth in the last 10 years.”

The company offers thousands of variations of trophies, plaques, cups, ribbons, pins, medals, championship belts. Would you like that in metal or plastic? Glass or crystal? Wood or leather? Engraved or sand blasted? Embroidered or screen printed?

You want a trophy with a baseball or basketball figurine? Child’s play. How about body building, badminton, bridge or ballet? They’ve got you covered. Those are just the B’s. If you need darts, diving or dominoes trophies, you’re also in good hands.

They sell personalized T-shirts, key chains, pint glasses, lanyards, buttons, mouse pads and stress balls. Corporate swag is also a growth industry and Amazon, right next door, is a good customer.

But don’t knock those commemorative handouts, that employee-of-the-month award.

“We’ve all done something, and we were really, really proud of it, and nobody noticed, right?” Holmes said. “Or maybe somebody noticed, but nobody said anything. And you know, it kind of takes the wind out of your sails a little bit.”

“This business is literally about acknowledging and recognizing that someone — or a team of people, a group, a company, whatever — did something well. And, you know, it’s really a blessing to get to hear about these amazing things that people do.”

The company’s showroom is a bit like a local history museum. Athletic Awards made the key to the city for the Seattle mayor’s office. They designed the patch worn by Seattle police. They made a plaque presented to Ronald Reagan when he spoke to the University of Washington College Republicans.

Here’s a 1960s modernist trophy of the Space Needle. Except the proportions are wrong, there’s too much latticework, and everything just looks a little … off. Monty Sr. designed the trophy in 1961, a year before the Space Needle opened. He made the trophy just by looking out the window and trying to copy the construction in progress.

“This is the award that helped put Athletic Awards on the map,” a sign in the showroom says. “Bowling league sales more than doubled in 1961.”

The showroom is also a physical anachronism in its South Lake Union neighborhood of glass and steel, tech workers and research scientists. A couple decades ago, Athletic Awards’ neighbors were parking lots and warehouses. Now its neighbors are UW Medicine, the Allen Institute, Google, Meta and, everywhere, all around, Amazon. All occupy gleaming, sleek, new(ish) midrise construction.

Athletic Awards sticks out like a cow in a courtroom — what’s that guy doing here? In a sea of staid, it leans into folk.

A one-story, mustard-yellow chunk of cinder block and stucco, it’s festooned with hand-painted murals celebrating celebrations.

The murals, painted by John Rozich, a longtime local chalkboard and mural artist (“Good friend of my dad,” Ben says) show trophies of Seattle’s past — the Steve Largent Award, the Golden Apple Award. They are remarkable in their specificity, their esoterica. Here, on the building’s east side, is a giant mural of J. Michael Kelly’s trophy for winning 2019 Seafair in the U-12 Graham Trucking hydro. On the building’s west side is a trophy for the Bruce R. Kennedy, Ivar Haglund, Deanna Oppenheimer 2016 Laureate Junior Achievement Puget Sound Business Hall of Fame. Mustn’t forget that one.

Crowning it all is a massive bronzed goblet, the self-proclaimed “world’s largest trophy cup.” Sheet metal wrapped around a wooden armature, it was handmade by Monty Sr. and Monty Holmes back in the days when promotion was more about grabbing eyeballs on the street and less about search engine optimization.

It took a crane to get the thing up on the roof.

Is it really the world’s largest trophy cup? No, Holmes says quickly. They called the folks at Guinness to come check it out, but the powers that be said it doesn’t count because it wasn’t actually awarded to anyone.

As the neighborhood has evolved, so has the business. Holmes’ dad and grandfather used to use the warehouse behind the shop to restore and resell cars, bringing in cash when business was slow. They used to co-opt the parking lot across the street to sell Christmas trees every holiday season.

Now, Holmes speaks glowingly about the businesses that have replaced those warehouses and parking lots.

“It’s just so cool, when something good happens, somebody picks up the phone and calls you, right?” Holmes said. “As the city has had so much amazing success and has changed over the years, you know, we’ve been able to be a part of it.”

Ten women from the NBCUniversal creative team tease new details about the major theme park launch in Orlando on May 22.

	“I don’t think that there is anything quite comparable,” says Anisha Vyas, assistant director of projects, Universal Creative, while discussing the latest Wizarding World attraction at the soon-to-open Universal Epic Universe. “It’s all so cohesive, yet different than anything we’ve done before.”


	Vyas was speaking to the ride experience for Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, a new immersive attraction for Universal Orlando Resorts. But she just as easily could have been talking about the entirety of the new park, situated on a 750-acre site and featuring five worlds — The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic, How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk, Dark Universe, Super Nintendo World, and Celestial Park. All will feature notable innovations and advancements for the theme park industry, from architecture to attraction tech to hospitality.

	“To put it in perspective, this is pretty much a small city when you have portions that are open just for the public and portions that are not,” says Gabriela Lander, director of architecture and engineering design at Universal Creative. “There are over 100 venues. I can tell you there are small towns that don’t have 100 houses.”

	The immersive and innovative experience is made possible by a broad, multidisciplinary team, from engineers and architects to composers and costume designers. “While the scale of what we’re building is bigger than we’ve ever done before, the entire project’s scope is also so much larger, and so our teams are much bigger to support that,” says Vyas. At Universal Creative, those teams are made up of and led by many women, something Kim Gritzer, creative director at Universal Creative, says “is rare in the industry.” 


	“In my whole career, this is the highest number of female leaders that we’ve had across technical, creative, construction, and architecture,” notes Vyas. Adds Katy Pacitti, an industry veteran and assistant director, executive producer for Isle of Berk, “I’ve seen the progression. For years, in meetings, I’d be the only woman at the table.” 


	For some in Universal Creative, like Maggie Baker, senior manager of costume and wardrobe design, their Epic team is majority-women. Others say they feature women within the larger mix, like Gina Scheraldi, show director for Celestial Park, who has gotten to work on the larger Epic project with her mentor. 

	











	“On this, we’ve had an incredible support system made up of women and really everybody working towards making sure that Victoria [Frankenstein] was the best original character we could deliver,” says Frances Franceschi, production designer on the Dark Universe’s Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment. “The way everybody got behind that narrative, it feels really empowering.” 


	“It’s a safe environment for me to be authentic, to be myself, to express who I am, and how I am a woman — a Latina, a mother of two, a wife, a daughter,” says Lander. “It’s not just that I have support, but I have the space to grow and involve who I am.”


	“I think it shows, personally, with a better product,” adds Pacitti of Universal Creative’s inclusive team. “And I love mentoring the younger women, making sure they find their voices.”


	Ten women from the Universal Creative team who helped shape Epic Universe tease new details about how they built aspects of four worlds for the newest theme park in the Universal Destinations & Experiences portfolio. 


	“Out of the four [major IP] worlds, we’re the largest,” Pacitti tells The Hollywood Reporter. “If you take away the big rides, you can fit two of the other worlds in this one. Part of that is because you have two bodies of water.”


	Based on DreamWorks Animation’s billion-dollar franchise, Isle of Berk’s architecture from the mountain to cliffs and buildings offers parkgoers something that “feels lived in, active and kinetic,” says Pacitti. A collaborative effort between Universal Creative and the studio, Isle of Berk not only recreates but expands the How to Train Your Dragon franchise, “an animated world that doesn’t need anything real” like infrastructure that can sustain 5,000 guests an hour or hurricane force winds.


	The process has involved infusing things both additive and familiar. “We use so much of [the film’s] amazing soundtrack music, but we have things that are new,” says Camille Coladonato, the senior media producer responsible for Isle of Berk and Celestial Park. “What would be more authentic and immersive than a Viking band?” It also meant “expanding some of the stuff that DreamWorks maybe designed, and we don’t see,” says Pacitti. That includes one element inspired by a drawing featuring one of the franchise’s leading women, Astrid.  

	











	“There are no shops in Berk, but we happen to have all of DreamWorks’ assets. Our How to Treat Your Dragon sweet shop was not really seen in the films, but it’s something that DreamWorks developed, so we’re taking that,” says Pacitti. “We have these benches [based on] blue sky drawings for the third film. There was this tiny, tiny, low-res [image] of Astrid sitting on a bench that was carved to look like a Natter [Dragon]. We took that and said let’s just make them, so we have not only the Natter, we have a Gronkle, a sheep.”


	The appearance of dragons goes beyond benches, with Pacitti teasing static creatures, dragon tails that swing, Scuttleclaw, and the sheep as simple animated figures. There’s also the “massive and beautiful” head of Valka’s Stormcutter Cloudjumper in his home, a full-scale Grump in the Forge who breathes fire, and a breathing Snow Wraith. Since the world has started internal dry-runs, character appearances for Toothless and his babies, the Night Lights, have been popular. There are also the large flying dragon drones. 


	“[The Night Lights] aren’t pets, and they aren’t circus animals, so we want to make sure they seem very organic and natural. We’ve set it up to be a little more fun and playful, really capitalizing on the fact that they are babies that they, from what we’ve seen of them in How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming and the end of the third film, are little bit mischievous,” says Pacitti. “With the drones, it’s more about if you live in a place with dragons, they just exist, so it’s not a show thing. It’s more of I’m in Berk, so of course a dragon is flying overhead.” 

	











	Berk is as much about training and flying dragons as it is about a sea-faring people in an 8th Century Viking village. It’s a place where you have to “work for your fun,” says Pacitti, with experiences like the Viking Training camp, a play area for children as little as toddlers. There’s also Hiccup’s Wing Gliders among the world’s six attractions, a coaster that originally circumnavigated the world but now cuts through it. “When you’re standing there and the coaster comes through and goes underneath the bridge, it just activates the world,” says Pacitti. “When it skims the lagoon, the water sprays, and you go through the fog, it’s really quite dynamic.”


	“We’re going to bring to life one of the first original lead female characters with this iconic [Classic Monsters] IP. That feels surreal,” says Franceschi. “And it feels good to know women had a hand in developing every aspect of Victoria from her creative conception to the physical delivery of the final character.” Created for the Dark Universe’s dark ride, Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, Dr. Victoria Frankenstein — like much of the world — is based on a philosophy of making what’s old new. A descendent of Victor Frankenstein, Victoria attempts to capture and experiment on some of horror’s most famous creatures. 


	Pulling from the original Henry Frankenstein lore, alongside monster books and movies, parkgoers will traverse the manor, where they’ll be able to see individual creatures — a mix of moving, static, image, and media-based — alongside her logbooks and chalkboards full of research in the queue. Once in the catacombs, riders will board Victoria’s navigation system, an old contraption that she has made new with the help of Igor. 


	The ride system, says Franceschi, is one parkgoers are mostly familiar with, but it’s been upgraded along with the themed ride vehicles. “Our movement is very dynamic. You’re at a constant speed, but you would not realize that because of how the [attraction] rotates,” the production designer explains. 

	











	While the system may be more recognizable, the ride’s central attraction is ultimately its characters, the life-size animatronic monsters, which push boundaries in the medium. “It’s one thing from a creative perspective to say, ‘I want people to see Frankenstein walk.’ It’s another thing to execute and deliver that,” Franceschi notes. “And historically, animatronics are quite large because of their robotic functions and motors. But we have an impressive scale. We did not need them all to be nine feet tall. So some are five, four, seven feet. But each monster is its own unique character, so we developed technology that worked for the size of that monster. ”


	“People will definitely get to see their favorites,” teased Baker, who worked on evolving the looks of the monsters in the ride and the larger world beyond their 1930s styles. “And they are more modern, a little bit more fashion forward.” 


	The way guests interact with characters and the ride environment based on special effects and where in the vehicle they sit will also heavily shape their attraction experience. “If we have one of our figures that is around fire, we want to make sure that you feel the heat. We have a figure that has an explosion around him, and we want you to feel that. It’s about how the environment and our monsters react to where our guests are in the vehicle and how close they get,” the production designer says. “The ride’s show environments are so expansive and immersive that every seat in the vehicle will naturally give guests a slightly different perspective of the experience.”


	As a dark ride, lighting throughout the attraction — and the world — will help electrify the experience. Inside, the ride experience will see lighting “as its own character,” adding suspense and creating dramatic character and environmental reveals. Outside, effects will work as a visual cue that Dr. Victoria is conducting experiments within the Frankenstein Manor as world lighting flickers, pulsates, and eventually accumulates at the structure’s top spire. 

	











	Upon leaving the attraction, guests have access to character meet-and-greets, the Curse of the Werewolf coaster, and multiple monster and macabre-themed dining options. The Burning Blade — which will feature an actual flaming windmill — shares a lycan theme with the ride, while Das Stakehaus, the world’s vampire-themed restaurant, will be among its most immersive, down to its cutlery.


	“When I say we’re immersing you, it’s from the cutlery and plateware to the napkins,” says Sueann Cotanche, vice president of food and beverage at Epic Universe. The cutlery in our universe is black, the plateware is very dark and very worn, and the napkins are not your typical white. They’re red.”  


	Created in collaboration with Warner Bros. and The Blair Partnership, Universal Epic Universe’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter extension, Ministry of Magic, will deliver an entirely new experience with Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, an attraction with Dolores Umbridge and her former house-elf Higgledy at its center. Actress Imelda Staunton reprised her role for the ride more than a decade after the franchise’s end, recording her performance at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden. 

	











	“In the costuming, we had a designer [from] the film, so when he did the fitting with her, she just immediately [transformed],” recalls Gritzer of the process. “As we were filming, we gave her the dialog and we rehearsed, but there were things that she did add, and she was very involved in the staging of things.” 


	A return for characters like Ron, Harry, and Hermoine that may rely on very advanced visual effects within the attraction, Battle at the Ministry will debut Higgledy, first as a “beautiful” animated figure in an intimate moment in Umbridge’s office during the ride queue experience, says Gritzer. She will then appear as part of the adventure multiple times, in “many different forms and many different ways, helping us and Harry, Ron, and Hermione bring Umbridge to justice,” says Vyas. “We’ve done a beautiful job of bringing to life every character in totally different ways.”


	The larger experience of the built-to-scale queue will transport parkgoers from the world’s 1920s Parisian theme — where a magical beasts show Le Cirque Arcanus and Butterbeer crêpes are served up — to the 1990s and the expansive Ministry of Magic by way of the Métro-Floo system. 


	“There are fireplaces in a line, and you are sent through the Floo and experience a burst — we’ll just call it green smoke for now — then you step through a bit of a tunnel, have that experience again, and you are transported to the Ministry,” says Vyas. “There are a lot of different spaces and easter eggs, and a lot of really fun in your face gags that happen in that queue.” 


	The queue will also allow guests to explore aspects of the Ministry of Magic that have may or may not have appeared on screen, like the Magical Archives, in a way that’s more aesthetically sophisticated than the more rustic Diagon Alley, Hogsmead, and Hogwarts Castle attractions, says Gritzer. “Some spaces in the ministry are meant to be guest-facing, like the Hall of Ministers, commemorated in magical portraits and all having a conversation about the trial and their perspective on Umbrage, [including] Pius Thickness,” says Gritzer. “We have Millicent Bagnold, and she was minister in the ‘80s. She’s this completely fierce Joan Collins-like character.”

	











	Other areas are more canonically restricted, but “we get an inside view going through the Auror headquarters. We get to see how the Aurors connect things and catch Death Eaters. We also get a glimpse into Umbridge’s office, which is a very ridiculously pink place full of cats,” teases Gritzer. Adds Vyas, “You’ll see things from the films that you’ve seen before, but there’s definitely aspects of both architecture and even Fantastic Beasts that are new.”


	The queue is only half the experience, however. “What you’re experiencing [on the ride] — no one’s been in a ministry lift shaft before,” Gritzer says of the attraction’s car. “In the films, you see how the lifts go all over the place, and that’s what we do.” Using many of the same designers as Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure — an attraction both Vyas and Gritzer worked on — the Epic experience serves as a blend of nostalgia and adventure that will uniquely expand the universe-building of the Harry Potter universe films and parks.  


	“Typically, we try to do one or two cool new things to always push the envelope [on attractions]. This attraction has taken it to another level where literally every system has something new,” says Vyas. “It’s a brand new ride system, there’s a lot of really cool show elements that have never been done before, and infrastructure-wise, there’s a lot we haven’t tried before. I think in many of our main scenes, people won’t know how we did it, or they’ll have an idea, but they won’t really understand how that just happened in front of me.”


	“Celestial Park is the home of the Chronos, which opens portals all across time and connects every part of Epic Universe. But it is also about personal connection. It is a place where our guests — or our adventurers — can meet and share their stories from the day,” says Scheraldi, show director.

	











	Celestial shares many designers that worked on Islands of Adventure’s Port of Entry, and balances nostalgia and modernity through World Fair designs and a larger 1850s to 1930s aesthetic. Inhabited by Celestians, these people are out of space and time, donning a range of wardrobe and costuming colors, prints and textures that find “where classic art can meet the freedom of space and the freedom of travel,” says Baker. “We were looking to create a world that had a timelessness, without necessarily looking futuristic, and nothing makes something look more modern than being a little too sleek or smooth.”


	Supported by 40 hours of musical content (14 of which is original) and 16 background music zones, the world acts as a series of sensorily connected experiences. Lagoons (featuring over 200 fountain jets across them), fountains, and water shows are surrounded by seating, from unique benches with architectural and sculptural features to striking views at full service restaurants like The Atlantic, inspired by a Victorian aquarium and featuring mechanical fish that swim around diners. 


	That’s alongside a plethora of gardens, as well as Luna’s Court of the Moon and Apollo’s Court of the Sun, which all represent distinctive musical, color, foliage, and material themes driven by a sense of mystery, adventure, and travel. These two characters will help anchor the park, as will the Chronos’ opening gate and the Helios Grand Hotel, a six-to-seven-year project and the theme park and resort’s first in-park hotel. “We worked closely with Celestial Park to be an extension of their story,” says Jessica Iaconis, assistant director, architecture and engineering. “We’re a different book in the same series, if you will, so there’s a lot of connection between us.” 


	Its lobby and restaurant level as well as the rooftop Bar Helios (180 feet in the air, accented by a sundial-like cartouche and a printed star map on the bar’s acoustical ceiling) are open to all park guests, with the Mediterranean-themed accommodations internally and externally mirroring Celestial Park’s cosmic nature. Within the hotel, color schemes go from sunset colors of yellows and oranges on the first floor to deep blues as floors climb before eventually turning black and gold at the rooftop. And at the top of Helios, you can view Celestial Park’s subtly shifting hardscape and landscaping, which not only goes from a cool to warm palette as guests move from the Chronos towards the hotel, but shifts in color choices and type of plants based on the portal you’re walking toward. 

	











	Like the land and hardscape, the music will also begin to shift as guests move away from around, away from the courts — Luna with its more string and woodwings music profile, Apollo more brass and percussion — towards restaurants or each portal, where it’s “getting arranged differently or becoming more simplified,” says Coladonato. That approach to blending will spill over into the visual experience of the portals themselves, with their curved LED screens visually referencing the energy of Celestial Park edging on one side, the respective world on the other, and in between “gorgeous nebulas” that mix the world’s energies, like the lightning and “inky mysterious darkness” of the Dark Universe portal, she adds. 


	“Celestial Park is going to be one of the most technically advanced theme parks of all time, and one of the ways that we show that is that the whole world is interconnected between our lighting and our fountain systems,” explains Scheraldi, noting that, separately, coordinated fountain shows will take place in the world throughout the day. “We show that energy shift from day to night, so we will have an event moment where the world shifts over that will utilize our full lighting package and our fountains, as well as original music.”


	One million individual points of light will help make that day-to-night show possible, in a moment that will affect even the attractions. Dualing coaster Stardust Racers will operate without a lit track at night to create a stronger feeling of a shooting comet while flipping its soundtrack from the daytime’s brassy sound that imbues adventure and going to the races with a celestial, synthy nighttime energy. Riders will be able to experience that separate sound at night, and a demarcation in the music during the “celestial spin” inversion, which flips one coaster train over the other, allowing riders to look up and down at each. 

	











	According to Coladonato, riders of the Constellation Carousel will garner an even stronger feeling of being “caught in the Milky Way” at night as well, as the round table attraction rises six feet into the air and independently rotates forwards and in reverse through three smaller ride tables featuring illuminated vehicles modeled after the constellations moving to one of the attraction’s seven different compositions. “The amazing technology of that ride, and what we’re able to do with our individual ride vehicles is something wholly unique,” says Coladonato. “The gambit of genres and styles on this ride are is going to shock everyone.”

Egg prices have doubled since January 2024 due to the avian flu.

For the last 130 years, four generations of Ernest Lepore's family have baked the pastries – cream puffs, cannoli, sfogliatelle – that have come to define Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood, withstanding wars, economic downturns and drastic changes to the neighborhood that his family calls home.

But with the soaring cost of eggs – a staple ingredient in nearly half their products – it's becoming increasingly difficult for Ferrara Bakery to avoid raising their prices.

""We can't keep passing on costs to our guests,"" Ferrara's president, Ernest Lepore, told ABC News. ""As you move closer to Easter, eggs are just growing exponentially in price. I can't do anything about it.""

Egg prices have skyrocketed over the last year, reaching historic highs, and wholesale shoppers like small businesses were paying over $8 for a dozen eggs last week. According to the latest USDA report, released Friday, the national average wholesale price has dropped slightly to $6.85 per dozen.

However, many grocery stores sell their eggs at a loss to get customers in the door, bringing the average retail price of a dozen eggs to just under $5. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average price of a dozen eggs at the grocery store reached a record high of $4.95 in January 2025. More, the USDA predicted that prices might increase 40 percent this year, and experts are warning that those prices might stay high even if the supply of eggs in the U.S. rebounds.

But small businesses, unlike grocery shoppers, are tied to the market wholesale price, making these surging costs particularly devastating.

Theodore Karounos, owner of Square Diner in New York's downtown neighborhood of Tribeca, said that translates into tens of thousands of dollars in additional yearly costs for him.

""If things hold up at this price, and we stay as busy as we were last year, I'll pay $70,000 more for eggs than I did last year,"" he told ABC News. ""I can't just absorb that hit for the next nine months.""

The exorbitant costs are a result of a nationwide shock to supply, brought about by a ravaging outbreak of the avian flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 166 million commercial poultry birds have been affected since 2022, when the outbreak began. But the last few months have been especially devastating.

""In just four months, we've lost 52 million layers and pullets within our nation's egg supply, which is vastly different than any other outbreak that we've seen in the past."" Karyn Rispoli, managing editor of Expana, a firm that surveys and tracks the price of eggs, told ABC News. ""The biggest difference of late is just that it has been more lethal and really devastated our nation's egg supply.""

The avian flu has wreaked havoc on poultry flocks across the country. As a result, Rispoli says that the nation's supply of egg-laying hens is at nearly a ten-year low. Once one chicken is infected, farmers are forced to cull the remainder, after which comes the challenge of repopulating their flocks.

But even as the U.S. faces an egg shortage, demand for the commodity remains relatively constant, creating a perfect storm for egg prices to soar. Consequently, those small businesses that rely on eggs, like Ferrara Bakery and Square Diner, are forced to make difficult decisions.

Unlike larger restaurant chains like Denny's and Waffle House, which have adjusted to the surging costs by adding an egg surcharge to their menu item prices, smaller businesses are less inclined to follow suit, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Bruce Sacerdote.

""In the case of a restaurant, they aren't necessarily able to pass on the full price increase. We're not talking about a simple commodity where the markets clear immediately and you just have to pass on the full price increase,"" he told ABC News. ""Restaurants may be taking a hit to their margins in order to not pass on the full price increase.""

At Tom's Restaurant on New York City's Upper West Side – famous as the setting for the fictional Monk's Café in the TV series ""Seinfeld"" – the soaring cost of eggs means that co-owner John Ieromonahos is spending an additional $2,000 a week to pay for eggs to continue supplying the restaurant, where approximately 70 percent of their business is breakfast.

""Of course, we don't want to charge extra to customers,"" Ieromonahos said. ""This is not our customer's fault, but I don't know how long we're going to last without charging extra.""

At The Hungarian Pastry Shop in Manhattan, owner Philip Binioris told ABC News that he's trying his best not to pass the higher cost of eggs on to consumers, though he, too, isn't sure how long he can absorb the increasingly prohibitive cost.

""It's frustrating. I would like to not raise our prices. I think that we have fair prices, and I like to be able to keep them stable,"" he said. ""I'm just kind of waiting to see how bad this gets before I make a decision on how I'm going to change prices. It's tight.""

While consumers, small businesses and their customers continue to shell out more for eggs amid the avian flu outbreak, the nation's largest producer and distributor of eggs has reported soaring profits.

Cal-Maine Foods, according to SEC filings, saw an over three-fold increase in their gross profits in their fiscal year 2023, at the dawn of the bird flu outbreak. And according to their most recent filing, their gross profits are up 342% through the second quarter of their fiscal year 2025 versus the previous fiscal year.

Rispoli also told ABC News that grocery shoppers could see increased prices even when the egg supply does begin to recover, as grocery stores may seek to recoup lost earnings. She said that happened when egg prices soared at the beginning of the current avian flu outbreak.

""In the aftermath of that, as the market corrected and came down substantially, retailers were then holding shelf prices higher to try and recapture some of the margin that they had previously forfeited,"" she said.

Back at Ferrara in Little Italy, Lepore is searching everywhere to find other ways to save money so he doesn't have to increase their prices. He recently upgraded his building's cooling system and improved his refrigerators, saving money on electricity in the long term. He also is taking a lesson from his grandparents, who kept the business going through the Great Depression, by baking smaller batches of goods in order to more easily keep product fresh and avoid waste.

""Eggs are determining production,"" he said. ""As we are going into Easter, I am going to be baking at the last minute not to waste an egg, because there can't be any left over.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news,MPU on the Leading Edge of Electrical Supply Technology,https://www.seehafernews.com/2025/03/08/mpu-on-the-leading-edge-of-electrical-supply-technology/,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 15:03:15 GMT","

Manitowoc Public Utilities is on the leading edge of the future of the electrical supply industry.

Not only has MPU been able to keep their rates among the lowest in the state, the local utility has also been able to adapt to change and become a driving force for bio-renewable fuel in the country.

General Manager Troy Adams took over his role in 2020 at a time when MPU was reevaluating the coal-based power plant and how to extend its life.

“We had the coal pile downtown. We were looking at rates. We were looking at the long-term viability of operating a plant on solid fossil fuel. And there was an end. It was coming,” he recalled. “We were going to have to shut the plant down based on that business model.”

But, instead of shutting the plant down and building a new one, the leadership team at MPU turned to their employees for ideas on how to repurpose the plant and keep the reliability they have become well known for.

Adams tells SeehaferNews.com that they had several very creative ideas come to light, including the expanded use of a fuel they had been sprinkling in with the coal since the 1990s.

“It is clean industrial waste,” he explained. “So, the company in Green Bay, and there’s one in Appleton, that makes it for us, had gone through the process of working with the EPA and are working with the Wisconsin DNR to get this classified as a renewable fuel.”

The big draw towards these pellets, which are made by industrial plants in Green Bay and Appleton, includes the fact that they have a similar output as coal, but not all plants can utilize it.

MPU’s power plant is different.

“Older power plants would run it through, and a lot of fuel would blow out with the ash. It was it was inefficient, but then you’d also have all that waste,” Adams noted. “Ours is designed to keep the fuel circulating until it is completely used up, so you get maximum output.”

Not only did the use of this fuel extend the life of the power plant, the move also has had a major impact on the environment.

“If this wasn’t going into the power plant, it would be going into the landfill and becomes methane, which is actually worse for the environment,” Adams revealed. “We actually have a 55% reduction in greenhouse gases by turning it into fuel and running it through our power plant.”

From a reliability standpoint, MPU is able to stockpile a large quantity of these pellets, which gives Manitowoc a unique goal for the future.

“If the Wisconsin grid drops, we could disconnect from the grid and still provide power here,” Adams said. “We’re not there. We’re working towards that. But that’s kind of the thing is, we have these assets here. The community paid for them. Let’s position so that we could do that if we wanted to.”

This transition, formally known as the Refuel Renewable Project, has put MPU on the forefront of the renewable energy industry, and they have drawn a lot of attention.

“We’ve gone and presented at a number of conferences on this, and now people are calling and asking,” Adams said. “We’ve had we’ve had people come and tour the facilities a few times over the last couple of years. Are others going to try and replicate this? I don’t know. Maybe.”

Adams joked that MPU is “boxing outside of our weight class” with this project, which he said puts them on par with some other major cities in the U.S.

“L.A. is also a municipal utility. The San Antonio is a municipal utility. We feel like we’re kind of in the same level from an innovative standpoint as some of these much bigger utilities,” he proclaimed.

A second energy source is in the works as well, transforming industrial sludge waste into clean, burnable pellets.

There is still quite a ways to go behind the scenes before this pellet, which has a higher BTU than the ones being used now, would be put into use.

Additional details on the project and everything else going on at Manitowoc Public Utilities can be found at MPU.org.

A team of scientists in the US may have discovered the reason why women live longer than men, and it could be down to one specific gene revitalising the female brain.

That gene is something we're all born with, the X chromosome - of course, men are born with X and Y chromosomes, while females have two Xs.

Advert

While both X and Y chromosomes are used in men, it has long been considered that only one X chromosome is in use the female body, with the other widely believed to be vacant.

However, researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) believe they may have possibly debunked that theory.

That 'vacant' chromosome settles into the corner of a cell known as the 'Barr body', where it cannot express many genes, but following tests on lab mice it may not be as redundant as first thought.

Researchers discovered that in older female mice (about 65 in human years), this silent X chromosome starts to wake up and express certain genes that help the brain stay strong and function better.

Advert

“In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men,” said the senior author of the paper, Dr Dena Dubal - a professor of neurology and chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease at UCSF.

""These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline.”

Incredibly, the group of scientists found that around 20 genes on the silent X, which are linked to brain development and memory, became active in the brains of these older mice.

Advert

“Aging had awakened the sleeping X,” Dubal added.

One of the genes, called PLP1, helps with myelin production - which is like insulation for brain cells, improving their communication.

When they tested the effect of PLP1 in both male and female mice, boosting it improved memory and learning abilities in both.

Advert

The researchers believe this might be why women’s brains show fewer signs of aging compared to men’s, as the second X could offer an extra layer of protection.

“We immediately thought this might explain how women’s brains remain resilient in typical aging, because men wouldn’t have this extra X,” said Margaret Gadek, first author of the paper and a graduate student of UCSF.

Dubal added: ""Cognition is one of our biggest biomedical problems, but things are changeable in the aging brain, and the X chromosome clearly can teach us what’s possible.

""Are there interventions that can amplify genes like PLP1 from the X chromosome to slow the decline – for both women and men – as we age?""

In today’s hyper-connected world, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. As technology advances, so do the tactics of cybercriminals, making it essential to stay informed about the latest threats and trends. This article explores the current state of cybersecurity, emerging threats, and best practices to protect against cyberattacks.

The evolving landscape of cybersecurity is a dynamic and rapidly changing field, driven by advancements in technology, the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, and the growing reliance on digital systems across all sectors.

One of the key drivers of change in cybersecurity is the constant evolution of cyber threats, Outdated threats such as malware, phishing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks have been joined by more advanced attacks, including ransomware, supply chain attacks, and state-sponsored cyber espionage. The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and automation by cybercriminals has further complicated the threat landscape, making it more challenging for organisations to defend against attacks.

Cybersecurity professionals are leveraging on advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, and behavioural analytics. These tools help in detecting anomalies, predicting potential threats, and automating responses to incidents. Zero-trust architectures, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, and cloud security solutions are becoming essential components of modern cybersecurity strategies.

Regulatory and Compliance Challenges Governments and regulatory bodies all over the world are implementing strict cybersecurity regulations to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure. Compliance with frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines has become a priority for organisations. Adhering to these regulations requires continuous monitoring, risk assessments, and the implementation of robust security controls. Additionally, new data privacy laws and industry-specific compliance requirements continue to emerge, requiring organisations to stay updated and ensure compliance.

Despite technological advancements, human error remains one of the most significant vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Social engineering attacks, weak password management, and lack of security awareness contribute to data breaches and security incidents. Organisations must invest in cybersecurity training and awareness programs to mitigate human-related risks and foster a security-conscious culture. Encouraging the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing strong password policies can also significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats stemming from human error.

As the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, organisations must adopt a proactive approach to security. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing and blockchain have the potential to reshape cybersecurity strategies. Quantum computing, while offering significant advancements in computational power, also poses risks to traditional encryption methods, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant cryptography. Blockchain technology, with its decentralised and immutable nature, offers promising applications in enhancing data integrity and securing transactions. Additionally, cybersecurity professionals must stay ahead of the curve by continuously updating their skills and knowledge.

In conclusion, cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, driven by technological advancements and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. Organisations must adopt a proactive approach by leveraging AI-driven security solutions, implementing the Zero Trust model, and strengthening their cybersecurity awareness programs. As cyber threats grow more complex, staying ahead of the curve requires a combination of innovative technologies, regulatory compliance, and continuous vigilance.

WhatsApp has started testing two new features on recent beta versions of the messaging app on Android. The Meta-owned chat service has added a new widget that makes it easier for users to access its Meta AI chatbot, without having to open the app. Meanwhile, a new AI-generated group icon feature is available to some beta testers, and users can use Meta AI to create and set group photos using prompts. These features are eventually expected to make their way to all users on WhatsApp for iOS and Android.

After updating to WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.6.10 (via feature tracker WABetaInfo), some beta testers will see a new option that allows them to generate images using Meta AI. After tapping on the pencil icon while viewing a group's existing icon, users will be presented with a fifth option titled Create AI Image.

Gadgets 360 was able to confirm that the feature is available on the latest beta version of WhatsApp for Android. After tapping on Create AI Image, users will see a Meta AI prompt screen. Beta testers can enter a prompt and wait for the chatbot to generate multiple images, then swipe through the options to pick a new group icon.

Meanwhile, the more recent WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.6.14 update that rolled out to testers a couple of days ago introduced a new widget that can be added to the home screen. This is essentially a shortcut that allows users to quickly access the Meta AI chatbot, without first having to open WhatsApp.

While WABetaInfo's screenshot shows a much larger widget that has three selectable buttons — Ask Meta AI, Camera, and Voice — Gadgets 360 was only able to add a slimmer version of the widget, which shows the Ask Meta AI button after installing WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.6.14.

Tapping the Ask Meta AI button takes users to a chat with the Meta AI chatbot in WhatsApp, and users can either type in a query or use the Camera and Voice buttons for photo based or audio prompts. Users on the stable channel will need to open WhatsApp and select the Meta AI floating action button (FAB) to access the Meta AI chatbot, until the new widget is rolled out to all users.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,US rise of cryptocurrency and fall of regulation pose ‘profound risks’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/crypto-deregulation-trump,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:01:00 GMT","

Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for corporate disclosure, warns of fallout from Trump’s efforts

A new report warns of “profound risks” in American politics as cryptocurrency companies increase their political spending and Donald Trump oversees regulatory retreat while promising to create a “crypto strategic reserve”.

The situation “illustrate[s] the profound risks that unchecked corporate political spending presents, particularly within the volatile and often unpredictable cryptocurrency industry”, reads the report, from the Center for Political Accountability (CPA), a non-profit that advocates for corporate political disclosure.

“The aggressive push for deregulation, combined with opaque and unaccountable political contributions, has not only raised red flags among regulators but also eroded investor confidence and public trust in the long-term viability of these companies.”

In the CPA’s definition, cryptocurrency, “often shortened to ‘crypto’, is a monetary technology that emerged in the early 2010s … meant to circumvent traditional central authorities like banks to allow decentralized, peer-to-peer transactions, recorded in heavily encrypted digital ledgers”.

The new report notes that “some public companies active in these fields have begun engaging in substantial political spending at both the national and state level – to the tune of more than $134m during the 2024 election alone”.

After the election, the CPA notes, the crypto companies Kraken and Coinbase were among “a number of … public companies making $1m donations to the Trump Inaugural Fund”. With Trump in power, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped lawsuits against both Kraken, which it formerly alleged to be an “unregistered securities exchange”, and Coinbase.

Such moves followed the departure on inauguration day, 20 January, of Gary Gensler, confirmed as SEC chair under Joe Biden but whom Trump had vowed to remove. Caroline Crenshaw, a commissioner confirmed in Trump’s first term but like Gensler opposed by crypto interests, was set to serve a second four-year term but is now to be replaced.

“Crypto money played such an important role in the election,” Bruce Freed, CPA president, said. “Take a look at some of the candidates who went down where there was heavy crypto spending.

“Take a look at the case of [the progressive representative and crypto skeptic] Katie Porter in the [US Senate] primary in California. Adam Schiff [a more crypto-friendly Democrat] benefited from that. You had the heavy crypto spending against Sherrod Brown [an incumbent Democrat, defeated in Ohio by the crypto-friendly Republican Bernie Moreno], because he was chair of the Senate banking committee [and a crypto skeptic].

“And then you take a look at the SEC, and you take a look at oversight and regulation of crypto, and some of the enforcement actions that were brought under Gary Gensler against crypto now have been dropped. So you can see a very significant impact in a short period of time, of crypto money.”

Ben Schaffzin, CPA assistant director of research and primary report author, said crypto companies “far and away blew every other industry out the water in terms of outside spending” in 2024. “We haven’t seen something like that before … and now we’re seeing the Trump administration move very quickly around their idea of this ‘crypto strategic reserve’,” Schaffzin said.

This month, Trump, who has launched his own crypto ventures, wrote on his social media platform that using taxpayer money to create “a US Crypto Reserve” would “elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration”, amid a push to “make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World”.

On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order to establish the reserve. On Friday, he held a White House “cryptocurrency summit”, followed by a reception hosted by Coinbase.

Schaffzin and fellow report author Jeanne Hanna, CPA vice-president of research, note Trump’s appointment of David Sacks, a South African entrepreneur and crypto investor, as “crypto czar”.

Sacks “has reportedly divested his personal crypto holdings”, the authors write, but “it remains to be seen if [he] will divest from his investment firm as well, of which he remains a partner and [which] stands to profit from the coins mentioned in the executive order if purchased in large numbers by the US government.

“This specter of impropriety does nothing to assuage concerns about the pay-to-play nature of cryptocurrency.”

Asked whether the outlook on crypto would have been less concerning had Kamala Harris become president, Hanna said: “This spending was incredibly bipartisan … [but] like a lot of things over the last six weeks [since Trump took power], I think the pace of what’s unfolded in the crypto industry has been accelerated by some of the executive appointments Trump has made in this space. But I think maybe the overall regulatory environment through Congress possibly wouldn’t have been dramatically different under Harris compared to Trump.”

Freed said: “With Trump, you have a much more transactional approach to politics and policymaking, and I think that’s very, very significant on [crypto]. When you see the money that poured in, for instance, against Sherrod Brown, you see basically crypto wanting to free itself from any oversight and regulation.

“There clearly was tremendous interest in what happens at the SEC … crypto clearly did not want to be encumbered in any way by oversight or regulation.”

To illustrate the dangers of crypto in politics, the CPA report cites recent events in Argentina, where Javier Milei – like Trump, a rightwing populist president – promoted “a scam coin called $Libra that lost all of its value, nearly $4.6bn in mere hours.

“While President Milei quickly deleted his endorsement of the token after the fact, his political opposition has filed over 100 fraud complaints with the government, prompting a judge to open an investigation” amid calls for Milei to be impeached.

“This scandal has only served to further highlight the systemic risks surrounding crypto,” the CPA authors write.

Schaffzin said Argentina should stand as a warning to Trump’s administration, adding: “Preaching this stuff from the top, from an executive that really doesn’t understand the mechanisms of crypto and how risky it is to ordinary consumers who don’t know the pitfalls in this product, is extremely dangerous.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, continuing his administration's embrace of the cryptocurrency industry.

The announcement came on the eve of a Crypto Summit Trump is scheduled to host Friday at the White House with industry leaders.

""Just as it is in our country's interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity,"" the order states.

The bitcoin in the reserve will come from assets held by the U.S. Department of Treasury that were seized in court proceedings or paid in civil penalties to executive agencies.

David Sacks, the White House czar for cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, posted on X that the U.S. has roughly 200,000 Bitcoin but ""there has never been a complete audit."" He added that the order requires ""a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.""

Sacks called the Reserve ""a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency."" The executive order describes Bitcoin as ""digital gold.""

The Digital Asset Stockpile also will come from assets seized in court proceedings.

The executive order directs the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to work on ""strategies"" for acquiring additional bitcoin that are ""budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.""

Trump signed an executive order in January creating the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and charged it with investigating the creation of the Stockpile.""

In a pair of social media posts Sunday, Trump mentioned five different cryptocurrencies that would be included in the stockpile, causing their values to spike.

Trump promoted cryptocurrencies on the campaign trail, telling a crowd gathered in Nashville in July for the Bitcoin Conference that he wanted to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world.” He has promised favorable regulation of the industry, which supported his campaign.

Trump also has a financial stake in the industry, launching a pair of cryptocurrency tokens and owning 60% of the crypto platform World Liberty Financial.

Sacks, a prominent tech investor, posted on X recently that he sold all of his cryptocurrency prior to Trump taking office.

President Joe Biden's administration clashed with the volatile cryptocurrency industry over regulations, and brought enforcement actions against some crypto companies.

Trump is ushering in a more friendly approach to the industry. He has suggested a bitcoin reserve would keep the U.S. at the forefront on cryptocurrency.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, filed legislation aimed at creating a bitcoin reserve. While acknowledging concerns about its volatility, she said it could help pay down the national debt and boost the U.S. dollar.

“While there may be short-term volatility, over the long term a bitcoin reserve like this will serve as an important and stable store of value,” Lummis wrote in a letter published in The Wall Street Journal.

Written by Nik Martin

Bitcoin is often touted as an alternative to the US dollar, the world’s reserve currency, as only a limited number of coins will ever be produced. Proponents argue that bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an inflation-proof value store outside the global financial system. Bitcoin is often compared to gold for a similar reason.

While central banks worldwide keep large reserves of the dollar and gold, until now, only one country — El Salvador — has created a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies, although several governments do hold them, mostly seized from criminal activities or to circumvent international sanctions.

On Thursday (March 6), US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic reserve of bitcoin, having previously said he wants the United States to be a leader in digital money.

Crypto advocates have responded euphorically to the plans, while skeptics argue it will expose US taxpayers to the huge price volatility of digital currencies.

As Trump welcomes the top crypto movers and shakers to the White House for a summit on Friday, DW explores what the president has in mind.

Under Trump’s order, the federal government will retain the nearly 200,000 bitcoin seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks.

“The US will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks wrote on X, referring to the location in Kentucky where most of the US gold reserves are kept.

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited.

Sacks added that over the last decade, Washington had sold off about 195,000 bitcoin for $366 million, which he said would be worth about $17 billion if still held.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

On Sunday, Trump named the five cryptocurrencies to be held in the reserves, namely bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.

“A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.”

Trump, who was once anti-crypto, is now a growing fan of alternative currencies and first mooted the idea of a strategic stockpile at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July.

US agencies hold 198.109 bitcoins, worth around $18.1 billion (€16.7 billion) as of Thursday, according to a tally by Arkham Intelligence.

Most of the holdings are the seized proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and hacking. The government also holds millions of dollars of seized ethereum, tether and other smaller digital coins.

A strategic reserve is a stockpile of vital resources kept by governments or large organisations to provide a safety net during hard times.

Examples include the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which helps ensure a regular supply of oil during crises, food reserves, including stockpiles of grain, to protect against hunger, and the stockpiling of vaccines by the US and European Union during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries also maintain monetary reserves, like foreign currencies or gold, to stabilize their economies and facilitate trade. The US government, for example, holds around 8,133 metric tonnes of gold, most of it at the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Increasingly, reserves of critical minerals needed for technology, the energy transition and defense are also being established.

Proponents say a crypto strategic reserve could help financial stability by diversifying US national reserves beyond traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies.

Such a stockpile would also help legitimise cryptocurrencies, encouraging more financial institutions to hold them. The likes of bitcoin are still viewed by many institutional investors with suspicion due to their price volatility and decentralisation.

But some analysts think the value of the stockpile could vanish in a market crash.

Others worried that if the government were to buy Bitcoin near its all-time high price of $109,000, it would be a costly endeavour, at a time when Trump is seeking billions of dollars in public sector cuts.

But Sacks insisted the use of the seized crypto assets “means it will not cost taxpayers a dime.”

Other critics accused Trump of favoritism toward a highly speculative investment, without providing clear strategic benefits for the nation.

Many of Trump’s backers are big crypto investors. Trump, himself, has a meme coin named after him.

Some observers pointed to the contradiction between creating a government stockpile of an asset that is deemed anti-establishment. Bitcoin was originally designed as a way to bypass government and central bank control.

Others were worried that if more governments began stockpiling the likes of bitcoin, they could potentially start to manipulate the crypto market, just as they do with gold and currencies.

The gold price last month reached a record high of $2,956, much of it down to large purchases by Poland, Turkey, India and China.

Trump now faces significant legal and political hurdles before the stockpile becomes a reality as the idea still lacks congressional support and as large amounts of the crypto seized by US authorities once had legitimate owners.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,"The future of Ethereum scaling lies in hardware, not software",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-of-ethereum-scaling,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 15:01:53 GMT","

 Ethereum’s future scaling relies on hardware acceleration, not just software solutions, to overcome bottlenecks and remain competitive. 

Opinion by: Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic

Running Ethereum today is like trying to play a modern game on a 1980s laptop — the outdated hardware would struggle to load, lag endlessly, and likely crash under the weight of new demands. Designed for a simpler blockchain era, Ethereum’s infrastructure can no longer keep up, processing just 10 to 62 transactions per second, far below the thousands needed for mainstream adoption. 

Meanwhile, with sub-second block times and near-zero fees, Solana enjoys growing mainstream popularity, which is evident in surging wallet downloads amid the TRUMP launch. Ethereum remains hindered by high gas fees and congestion, pushing users and developers to faster alternatives. 

Without addressing its scaling bottlenecks, Ethereum risks falling behind. While Ethereum’s layer-2 (L2) rollups have alleviated network congestion, they ultimately serve as stopgap measures that provide temporary relief. Software-first approaches are experiencing teething issues in interoperability and scalability, raising questions about Ethereum’s long-term sustainability and relevance. 

Many L2s are designed to fit the native network and cannot support real-time applications such as decentralized gaming or cross-border payments. Ethereum needs a fundamental shift if it wants to maintain its leadership in the blockchain space. The solution lies not in incremental software updates but in hardware acceleration. 

Vitalik Buterin’s Verge milestone envisions Ethereum achieving complete node verification on consumer-grade devices, a critical step toward the blockchain’s broader goals of accessibility and decentralization. Buterin has emphasized shifting from patchwork solutions to building a well-rounded computational infrastructure to realize this vision. Purpose-built hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), is key: It enhances transaction processing speeds, reduces latency, and optimizes energy use. It lays the groundwork for sustainable Ethereum scaling, ensuring the network grows without compromising its core principles.

Recent: Is Ethereum bottoming out at last? Analysts weigh in

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade also does not fully resolve its fundamental scaling challenges, highlighting the urgency for enhanced scalability and stability. The key optimizations introduced — account abstraction and enhanced validator operations — seek to refine Ethereum’s efficiency and user experience but do not significantly increase transaction throughput or reduce network latency. 

Ethereum risks falling behind without specialized hardware, weakening its position as a settlement layer for the blockchain community. Investing in hardware-native solutions will allow Ethereum to scale effectively while upholding its commitment to decentralization and supporting a growing user base.

The effect of hardware scaling solutions extends far beyond Ethereum itself. TradFi players are exploring blockchain-based cross-border payments, which demand real-time processing. With scalability issues inherited from the home layer, L2s alone cannot scale effectively to cater to the sheer TradFi demand. Cross-border transactions hit $190.1 trillion in 2023 and are only expected to grow in 2025, indicating one thing: Hardware acceleration is indispensable in incentivizing institutional adoption of blockchain. 

Beyond finance, hardware optimization enhances blockchain utility across industries, accelerating mainstream adoption. A noteworthy example is healthcare, where accelerated blockchain infrastructure could improve the security and privacy of patient data. For gaming industries that rely on dynamic interactions, blockchain networks can help deliver real-time responses to user actions. 

Blockchain isn’t operating in isolation; it competes with computationally intensive industries, such as AI, the buzzword of 2024. The rise of AI has reshaped industries, but it is also becoming a fierce competitor to blockchain for electricity and equipment. Data centers like Hut 8 and Coin Scientific are prioritizing AI workloads, which can generate up to 25 times more revenue than Bitcoin (BTC) mining. These moves highlight the growing pressure on blockchain networks to optimize resource efficiency or risk being sidelined in the race for computational dominance. 

Critics claim that Ethereum is “dying a slow death.” Once the home of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation, Ethereum’s scalability issues hinder its ability to compete with DeFAI. Ethereum must embrace purpose-built hardware to address its inefficient infrastructure, enable faster transactions, and reduce energy consumption. This way, Ethereum stands a chance to future-proof against AI developments and maintain its competitive edge for mainstream adoption. 

Ethereum has relied heavily on L2s to scale, but they remain temporary solutions that fail to meet the network’s fundamental operational demands. Hardware solutions are now non-negotiable for Ethereum to retain its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. From enabling seamless TradFi integrations to supporting real-time interactions in gaming and healthcare, purpose-built hardware resolves the root inefficiencies of Ethereum’s infrastructure. Without decisive investment in hardware acceleration, Ethereum risks stagnating while competitors rise. 

Ethereum doesn’t need another short-term patch. It requires a lasting solution. The next wave of blockchain adoption demands an infrastructure that can support it, which means investing in hardware now.

The White House Crypto Summit, despite high expectations fueled by Trump's pro-crypto stance, didn't deliver the anticipated major announcements.

Following the summit, major altcoins like XRP, ADA, and SOL experienced steeper declines than Bitcoin.

The summit highlighted plans for a U.S. strategic crypto reserve funded by seized Bitcoin, and a commitment to hold rather than sell seized bitcoin.

The White House Crypto Summit, hosted by President Donald Trump       Donald Trump   Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election   President       wrapped up without the groundbreaking announcements like many had anticipated, including more clarity on the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Instead of the market-boosting policies traders had anticipated, the summit delivered cautious steps toward regulation.

As expectations fell flat, the crypto market reacted swiftly. Bitcoin held relatively steady, but major altcoins like XRP, ADA, and SOL took a hit. Investors who had been gearing up for a bullish surge were left disappointed.

Altcoins suffered bigger losses than Bitcoin after the summit. Many traders were optimistic about Trump’s pro-crypto stance and hoped for a major policy shift, such as a government-backed crypto reserve featuring leading altcoins. Instead, the summit focused on plans for stablecoin legislation by August and a commitment to easing regulations.

While this was seen as a positive step, it wasn’t the major market-moving news many had anticipated.

One of the key takeaways was Trump’s executive order to create a US strategic reserve of Bitcoin and other digital assets. Crypto Czar David Sacks explained that the reserve would be funded using Bitcoin seized by the federal government through criminal or civil forfeiture.

However, this announcement disappointed some investors who had hoped for a broader plan to buy additional Bitcoin. The market reacted quickly, with Bitcoin’s price dropping to 86,394 dollars following the news.

The lack of a major crypto reserve initiative led to a wave of sell-offs in altcoins:

The White House summit, led by David Sacks, was highly anticipated after Trump’s promise to establish a crypto reserve that would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.

Earlier in the week, Trump’s posts on Truth Social triggered a massive rally, with some major cryptocurrencies surging up to 60 percent. However, on Friday, Sacks clarified that Trump’s mention of those five assets was just an example and not a firm commitment. This cooled expectations and contributed to the market downturn.

Despite the market’s negative reaction, the US government’s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin holdings could set an important precedent for other countries. This move may encourage global institutional adoption of cryptocurrency in the long run.

Trump also criticized previous government decisions to sell off seized Bitcoin, arguing that the US should never sell its holdings. At the summit, industry leaders praised Trump’s more open approach to crypto, seeing it as a shift from years of regulatory crackdowns focused on security and consumer protection.

While the short-term market reaction was negative, Trump’s evolving crypto policies could shape the future of the industry in the US and beyond.

 The White House Crypto Summit marked a “truly historic day at the White House,” according to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek. 

US President Donald Trump has placed cryptocurrency at the center of his economic strategy, marking a major policy shift for the US blockchain industry, according to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek.

Trump hosted a White House Crypto Summit on March 7, signaling that he intends to make crypto policy a national priority and make the US a global hub for blockchain innovation. 

The summit marked a “truly historic day at the White House,” Marszalek said in a March 8 X post.

Source: Kris|Crypto.com

Marszalek credited Trump with reversing policies like Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which allegedly led to crypto and tech firms being denied banking services under the Biden administration.

The difficulties of finding banking partners may indeed be a thing of the past for crypto firms after the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto just hours after Trump vowed to end the prolonged crackdown restricting crypto firms’ access to banking services

The crypto summit also comes as two major bills await congressional approval: the Stablecoin bill and the Market Structure bill, aiming to help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry.

Marszalek said ongoing dialogue with key regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could see “landmark legislation” pass. He added:

The CEO’s comments come a day after Trump signed an executive order on March 7, which outlined a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported.

While no direct BTC purchases were announced, the bill added that the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries could make “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, “provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Some analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.

“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

While Trump has previously highlighted his intentions to bolster crypto innovation in the US, issuing regulatory frameworks takes time and setting the “right regulatory tone” will be crucial for the administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum — a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Pete Carroll moved from Seattle to Las Vegas, and Geno Smith is moving with him, too. The Seahawks have traded the veteran quarterback to the Raiders in exchange for a 2025 third-round pick, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. 

Money was reportedly one of the mains reasons why the Seahawks dealt Smith. The two sides were roughly $10 million apart in negotiations, according to Sports Illustrated. Seattle was hoping to sign Smith to an extension that would pay him about $35 million annually, but Smith's camp was reportedly hoping for a deal that would pay him $45 million per season. Smith is currently entering the final year of his three-year, $75 million deal. He is the 19th highest-paid quarterback in terms of average annual salary, according to Over the Cap.

Seattle initially offered Smith and DK Metcalf to Las Vegas in exchange for pass rusher Maxx Crosby, but the Raiders shot that down, according to the SI report. The Raiders instead signed Crosby to an extension that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.  

Smith, 34, played under Carroll during the coach's final four years in Seattle. A 2013 second-round pick who began his career with the New York Jets, Smith spent the last three seasons as the Seahawks' starting quarterback. He went 28-24 as Seattle's starter that including helping lead the franchise to a playoff berth in 2022. Smith, who earned Pro Bowl nods in 2022 and in 2023, completed 70.4% of his passes last season.

In Smith, Carroll has a proven, veteran quarterback in tow as he begins his first season as the Raiders head coach. But while the Raiders have found their next quarterback, the Seahawks will have to find their new signal-caller. Seattle is also in the market for a receiver after releasing veteran Tyler Lockett. Metcalf has also requested a trade out of Seattle. 

Here's our instant trade grades for both teams. 

Carroll isn't interested in a long rebuild, so it makes perfect sense for him to go out and acquire a proven veteran who can bring some level of stability to Las Vegas. Having Smith on board gives the Raiders a chance at being competitive in 2025. And based on how he's played in recent years, Smith still has some good football left him. 

Smith is good, but he is coming off a season that saw him throw 15 interceptions, his highest total since his rookie season. He also isn't a long-term QB solution, so the Raiders should still look to acquire a young quarterback either this or next offseason. Las Vegas could still elect to draft a quarterback with the sixth overall pick in this year's draft, but now that they have Smith, they have the option to utilize that pick on another position. 

Like most older quarterbacks, Smith can only truly have success at this stage of his career if he has a strong supporting cast around him. That is not currently the case in Las Vegas, however, so the Raiders need to have a highly successful offseason if they want Smith to play up to his potential. 

Is Seattle embarking on a reboot or a rebuild? Either way, the Seahawks have decided to change course after enjoying moderate success with Smith under center. The issue is that the Seahawks have not only gotten rid of Smith, they've also parted ways with one of franchise's all-time greats (Lockett) and could possibly lose a two-time Pro Bowl receiver (Metcalf). 

On top of that, the Seahawks don't have a great alternative plan at quarterback. At this point, the team's starting quarterback is Sam Howell, who does have one year of starting experience under his belt after being the Commanders' starting QB for each of Washington's 17 games in 2023. Howell led the NFL in attempts that season, throwing 21 touchdowns and completing nearly 64% of his passes. But he also threw a league-high 21 interceptions and was sacked a league-high 65 times. 

Howell is an option, but like the Raiders, the Seahawks still need to due their due diligence at quarterback. Seattle has the 18th overall pick in the draft and could use that pick to select Ole Miss' Jaxson Dart, the third-ranked QB prospect in this year's draft. Seattle also can try to sign either Aaron Rodgers or Sam Darnold. There is also the possibility of trading for Falcons QB Kirk Cousins.

'The Five' panelists examine California Gov. Gavin Newsom shocking Democrats with his stance on transgender athletes in women's sports.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher praised the ""switch"" from Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who made headlines this week for speaking out against biological men competing in women's sports. 

On his new podcast ""This Is Gavin Newsom,"" Newsom found common ground with Turning Point USA founder and conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk on the subject of trans athletes. 

""The young man who's about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn't happen,"" Kirk said. ""You, as the governor, should step out and say no. Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?""

""Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,"" Newsom replied. ""I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.""

Maher welcomed Newsom's pivot on the hot-button issue.

""I do love this because I do think he's a great politician,"" Maher reacted on Friday during a panel discussion. ""I know 'He's slick.' Yeah, they said the same thing about Clinton. He's a great politician. He's really smart. You can talk great, chicks dig them, and I've always been saying if he would just tack to the center. Well, it happened this week."" 

Maher continued, ""He said ‘I had one meeting where people started going around the table with pronouns. And I said, What the hell? Why is this the biggest issue?’ Well, Gavin, like two weeks ago, it was the biggest issue for you, but I don't care! I don't care! You made the switch and I love it! That's what I'm saying. You made the switch and I love it!""

Maher went on to complain about how President Trump is perceived as the ""common sense"" candidate and then blasting Senate Democrats, who earlier in the week blocked a vote on a bill that would ban biological males from competing in women's sports despite the fact ""80% of the people"" favor the position. 

""It's such a mistake,"" Maher said.

Maher was amused to read in a report from Politico that Newsom's podcast was inspired by the HBO host. 

""I'm just telling the news. It's not that it's about me,"" Maher said with a giant grin as the audience applauded. ""'The provocative HBO ‘Real Time’ host who leans Democratic but has increasingly taken flak from progressives in recent years over his eagerness to criticize the party’s 'woke' left flank.' That's true. Hey- they wrote a sentence about me in the press and they got it completely right!""

During a recent episode of PFT Live, I said I was considering switching allegiances from the Vikings to the Eagles, if only to enjoy one Super Bowl win before heading to the Great Press Box in the Sky (which is also what they should call the press box in the Superdome). 

I was kidding, I think. If the move that is the subject of this specific blurb happens, I might not be.

A Saturday morning tweet from Ian Rapoport of NFL Media says that quarterback Aaron Rodgers is “considering the Giants with the Vikings as a dark horse.”

It’s another domino from the trade that will send, as of Wednesday, quarterback Geno Smith to the Raiders. If, as expected, the Seahawks sign Sam Darnold, the Vikings will need another veteran. Enter Rodgers, potentially.

Many (not me) are rooting for Rodgers to take the next step in the Brett Favre career arc. And J.J. McCarthy wouldn’t be thrilled about having his opportunity to become the starter delayed by a season.

Surely, Rodgers would sign with the Vikings only if he was installed as the starter. That could make things interesting, and awkward, if he and/or the team are struggling in the middle of the season and McCarthy is ready to go.

The Vikings welcomed Favre in 2009. He propelled the franchise to one of its best seasons since the most recent Minnesota Super Bowl appearance, 49 years ago. And the Vikings likely would have made it if Favre hadn’t gone full fool with the game on the line, throwing a pass across his body when the Vikings were in range for a potential game-winning field goal.

Maybe Rodgers has enough left to make a difference. Maybe the Vikings can take another failed former Jets quarterback and get to the playoffs, and potentially win a game or two. Maybe Rodgers can do for the Vikings what Favre couldn’t.

The less Rodgers wants financially, the more tempting the move will become. If, at the end of the day, they can get Rodgers for whatever they’d budgeted to pay Darnold, maybe it makes sense.

And when the Vikings host the Eagles this season, maybe it’ll make sense for me to wear by throwback Eagles hoodie.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

A few days before the 2025 NBA trade deadline, the Sacramento Kings sent long-time point guard De'Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs in a blockbuster three-team deal with the Chicago Bulls that brought back Zach LaVine. On Friday, Fox played in Sacramento for the first time since joining the Spurs. 

Ahead of that contest, Fox made some explosive comments about the trade in an interview with ESPN. Fox said that he ""really did"" want to play for the Kings for his entire career, but that all changed when the team decided to fire coach Mike Brown just after Christmas. 

""I was like, 'Yo, I've been here for going on my eighth year. If Mike gets fired, I'll be going on my fifth coach,'"" said Fox, who scored a team-high 16 points but shot 0-for-6 from 3-point range in the Kings' 127-109 win. ""And I told them, 'I'm not going to play for another coach. I'm going to play for another team.'""

Fox, who was drafted No. 5 overall in the 2017 draft, had played for Dave Joerger, Luke Walton, Alvin Gentry and Brown during his seven-plus seasons with the Kings. While Fox helped the team end its lengthy playoff drought during the 2023 season, his tenure with the club was plagued by dysfunction and mismanagement. 

Ultimately, it was not surprising that Fox wanted a change of scenery, especially considering that he wanted Brown to remain as coach and didn't appreciate how the organization handled the coaching change. 

""You fire the coach, and you don't do an interview?"" Fox said. ""So, all the blame was on me. Did it weigh on me? No. I don't give a f---. But the fact y'all are supposed to be protecting your player and y'all let that happen. ... I felt at the time the organization didn't have my back.""

Once Fox decided that he wanted a trade, he told the Kings that the Spurs were his preferred landing spot. In his conversation with ESPN, he pushed back against the idea that he had a list of destinations and explained why he wanted to control his future. 

""There was no f---ing list,"" Fox said. ""There was one team. I wanted to go to San Antonio. So, a lot of people are mad at me, saying I handcuffed the team by giving them a destination. Well, this is my career. If anybody else is in my position, you'd do the same thing. It's not my job to help build your team. I'm not about to just go where they want me to go. I wanted to have a destination.""

While the Spurs are not as good on the court as the Kings this season, that is expected to change in the coming years, assuming that Victor Wembanyama is able to make a full recovery from his deep vein thrombosis. From an organizational standpoint, the Spurs have been much more stable than the Kings, though Gregg Popovich's health situation after his stroke does raise some questions. 

Even with the Spurs' health concerns, it's easy to see why Fox wanted to return to Texas, where he played high school basketball. 

The nature of Fox's interview is really the only surprise with this entire situation. Players usually aren't this candid about what happened behind the scenes or how they feel. Whatever anyone might think about how Fox handled his exit from Sacramento, you certainly know where he stands.

PORTLAND, Maine — Maine leaders are responding to a federal ruling that found the state violated Title IX laws by allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's sports teams.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights issued a notice stating their agency found that the Maine Department of Education's policy denies student-athletes' equal opportunities. 

Some see the decision as a step toward fairness, but others fear it could lead to discrimination and exclusion. 

RELATED: Federal government says Maine violated Title IX over transgender athletes policy

Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, said the ruling feels like an unnecessary interference in a long-standing practice of inclusivity. 

""Trans kids, athletes have been playing sports here in Maine for decades—and it was absolutely fine,"" Drew said. 

She worries about how the decision could shape perceptions of gender and athletic ability. Others, however, see the ruling as a step toward protecting fairness in girls' sports. 

Maine lawmakers like Rep. Katrina Smith, a Republican, have already spoken out regarding the ruling on social media, saying the current policy has already caused harm. 

""The Mills administration’s policy of allowing biological boys in girls' sports has physically and mentally mistreated our young ladies,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. 

House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, R-Winter Harbor, pointed to the growing number of girls speaking out at the State House, saying their concerns need to be taken seriously. 

""In the past weeks, we've seen hundreds of girls from all corners of the state speak out on the unfairness,"" he said.

The ruling could have major consequences for Maine schools, particularly regarding federal funding. 

As the state determines how to respond, many Mainers remain deeply divided. Some feel that protecting fairness in sports is essential, while others worry that young transgender athletes will face increased scrutiny and discrimination. 

Drew hopes the conversation remains compassionate, whatever the outcome. 

""I think young people hear respected adults—the president of the United States—say just horrible things about transgender people,"" Drew added. ""That can be really hard to understand as a young person.""

The job was a big one.

Amber Whiting was a successful girls basketball high school coach in Idaho and had great connections to the AAU circuit when she was hired by BYU three seasons ago to replace Jeff Judkins. The Cougars were playing in the West Coast Conference at the time and in 2023 joined the powerful Big 12.

The results over that three-year period weren’t to either parties satisfaction.

Whiting and BYU have agreed to “part ways,” according to a news release from BYU Saturday morning. Anyone who has met Whiting would know how competitive she is and how she would have loved to get a fourth season in Provo, so anything with “mutual agreement” attached to it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Whiting proved to be a good recruiter and her team in 2024-25 was led by Big 12 Freshman of the Year Delaney Gibb as well as sophomore Amari Whiting, Amber’s daughter who committed to Oregon before her mother took the BYU job.

Coach Whiting never had a winning record in her three seasons. The Cougars were 13-17 in their final year in the WCC and posted identical 16-17 records in two seasons in the Big 12. However, BYU was 10-26 in Big 12 play and eliminated in the first round of the league tournament the past two seasons.

There were some highlights. Coach Whiting convinced Lauren Gustin to return for her senior season in 2023-24 and Gustin led the nation in rebounding, eventually breaking the school’s career record. The Cougars upset No. 18 Baylor last season and No. 20 Oklahoma State in February. But BYU struggled with the athleticism of Big 12 defenses, leading the league in turnovers this season (18.4 per game).

The Cougars never beat Utah during Whiting’s tenure (0-4) and ended the 2024-25 campaign losing seven of their final eight games. Of the team’s 14 league losses, nine were by single digits including two in overtime. 

The news release indicated associate head coach Lee Cummard will take over on an interim basis. Cummard was a grad assistant for Dave Rose on the men’s program for two seasons and a full-time assistant in 2018-19 before Rose retired. He joined Jeff Judkins and the women’s program the following season and stayed through Whiting’s time in Provo.

While there is bound to be some movement on the roster, retaining Gibb should be priority No. 1. Gibb won the Big 12 Freshman of the Week award 10 times and averaged 17.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game while making 77 3-pointers. Amari Whiting (10.3 ppg) is a two-year starter. The Cougars graduate Emma Calvert (12.6 ppg), Kemery Congdon (9.2 ppg), Kendra Gillispie, Lauren Davenport and walk-on Kylie Krebs. LMU transfer Marya Hudgins started seven games before an injury robbed her of the rest of her first season in Provo. Two freshmen from Idaho, Brinley Cannon and Kambree Barber, played key roles off the bench. New Zealand native Arielle Mackey-Williams, who started 24 games in 2022-23, has suffered two knee injuries and missed the past two seasons but indicated she was working to come back in 2025-26. 

BYU has already signed four-star guard Sydney Benally, the New Mexico Gatorade Player of the Year and Montana prep standout Braeden Gunlock from the Class of 2025. Miriam Traore, a 6-foot-3 post player and younger sister of current BYU men’s player Fousseyni Traore, joined the program in January and is rehabbing after a knee injury. Kailey Woolston, who averaged 13.3 points per game last season as a freshman, is serving a church mission in Maryland and is due to return next season.  

Here is the complete release from BYU:

“BYU women’s basketball head coach Amber Whiting announced Saturday that she will not be returning for the 2025-26 season as she and BYU have agreed to part ways.

Whiting took over the BYU women’s basketball program ahead of the 2022-23 season and served as head coach for the past three seasons. During Whiting’s time at the helm of the Cougar program she compiled an overall record of 45-51, including a 19-35 mark in conference matchups.

Leading BYU women’s basketball into the Big 12 Conference, her Cougar squad notched two ranked wins, knocking off the 18th-ranked Baylor Bears on Feb 10, 2024, and the No. 20 Oklahoma State Cowgirls on Feb. 15, 2025.

Under Whiting’s tutelage, four players earned conference honors, highlighted by the 2025 Big 12 Freshman of the Year, Delaney Gibb and the 2023 WCC Defensive Player of the Year and BYU all-time rebounding leader, Lauren Gustin. Whiting also coached the nation’s second-ranked three-point shooter in Kailey Woolston during the 2023-24 season.

Her Cougar squad made two trips to the postseason, the WNIT in 2023 and the newly formed WBIT in 2024.

With Whiting’s departure, BYU women’s basketball associate head coach Lee Cummard will now serve as interim head coach.”

Syracuse Crunch forward Maxim Groshev was suspended 10 games Friday by the American Hockey League for using what the AHL termed “racially insensitive language” toward an opponent.

The game in question occurred Saturday against Rochester.

Because Groshev already sat out one game, he will be eligible to return to play March 30. He also can appeal the remainder of his suspension after eight games if he takes part in the NHL’s Player Inclusion Coalition and makes what is deemed by AHL President and CEO Scott Howson as sufficient progress in the training program.

“The American Hockey League is committed to building a culture that is safe, inclusive, and free from abuse, harassment and all forms of unethical behavior or misconduct, and believes that individual inclusion learning is a key element of improving league-wide culture,” the league said in a statement.

The Tampa Bay Lightning selected Groshev in the third round of the 2020 draft. This is his second season with the Lightning’s top minor-league affiliate.

He has five goals and six assists in 46 games this season. Groshev registered 10 goals and 20 assists in 67 games last season.

He has yet to play a regular-season game for the Lightning.","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy was arrested on an assault charge Friday night in Texas, according to the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office jail record.

The 21-year-old Worthy was charged with assault of a family or house member and impeding the breathing or circulation, which is a third-degree felony assault charge that “is committed by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person’s throat or neck or by blocking the person’s nose or mouth.”

The offense is punishable with a sentence of two to 10 years of jail time and/or a fine not to exceed $10,000.

""We are aware of the allegation that led to Mr. Worthy's arrest. We are working with law enforcement in Williamson County to ensure they have the benefit of the totality of circumstances that led to this allegation.

""The complainant was recently asked to vacate Mr. Worthy's residence upon discovery of her infidelity. She has refused to do so and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy.

""We will continue to cooperate with the Williamson County authorities as we have full faith that their thorough investigation will support Mr. Worthy's innocence.""

The Chiefs drafted Worthy out of the University of Texas with their first-round draft pick in 2024. He caught 59 passes for 638 yards and six touchdowns during his rookie NFL season.

This is the second straight offseason a Chiefs player has found himself in legal trouble. In April 2024, wide receiver Rashee Rice was arrested for his involvement in a multi-car crash while racing a Lamborghini in northeast Dallas. He was also suspected of assaulting a photographer at a Dallas nightclub in May. However, Dallas police confirmed the accuser signed ""an affidavit of non-prosecution"" and chose not to pursue charges.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

MLB spring training 2025 is rolling, meaning MLB Opening Day is now right around the corner. The season will begin overseas again as the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs play a two-game series in Tokyo on March 18-19. League-wide Opening Day is then set for March 27. Now is the time to get 2025 World Series picks in before the action gets underway. The latest 2025 World Series odds list the Dodgers as the +240 favorites (risk $100 to win $240), followed by the Yankees (+800), Braves (+950) and Phillies (+1000). Fantasy baseball drafts are also going on the clock now. Get Fantasy baseball rankings form the model that has simulated the entire season 10,000 times only at SportsLine.

MLB futures can bring some huge returns, however, as teams such as longshots such as the Rangers (2023), Braves (2021) and Nationals (2019) have defied the odds in recent seasons to win it all. SportsLine's Nick Stellini has evaluated the latest MLB future odds and found three longshots of 22-1 higher he loves. See what he has to say about each pick below and then get the top sleepers, breakouts and busts for 2025 Fantasy baseball at SportsLine.

You have to give the Red Sox this - they're certainly interesting. Craig Breslow's acquisitions of Garrett Crochet and Walker Buehler fortified a rotation badly in need of stability, even if both come with some level of concern - how will Crochet hold up after his first season as a starter? And can Buehler be both healthy and effective? If both can saddle up every fifth day and pitch well, Boston's in great shape.

But given that the Red Sox seemingly always have to have some level of drama, Alex Bregman was inked to a contract right as spring training began. Bregman's resume speaks for itself - he's a great hitter, a multi-time All-Star, a Gold Glove-winner, a World Series champion. He's exactly the sort of player Boston needs. He's also a third baseman, and Rafael Devers is already entrenched there, despite Bregman being the far superior defender. It was assumed that Bregman would play second base, given Boston's gaping hole there and the face of the franchise already being penciled in at the hot corner. A few uncomfortable press conferences later, and we're not so sure. 

Regardless of where everyone lines up, the Red Sox should hit the ball extremely well and pitch better than they did last year. There's also reinforcements on the way, with Roman Anthony and Kristian Campbell - two of the top five prospects in baseball - knocking on the door. Campbell himself could fill the aforementioned gaping hole at the keystone in short order. There's no clear superpower in the American League this year, and if the bullpen solidifies (this will largely depend on Liam Hendriks being healthy and deadly), Boston will be a tough out in October. SportsLine's proven model was all over Adley Rutschman's disappointing 2024 season. See its top 2025 Fantasy baseball busts right here.

I've been critical of the Cubs for a few years now because of the seeming lack of urgency in the front office and ownership suite. This was a team crying out for star power, and the brain trust simply didn't provide it. That changed this winter with the acquisition of Kyle Tucker from the Astros. Tucker is one of the best players in the game, a standout on both sides of the ball. With his arrival and the imminent ascension of top prospect Matt Shaw, the Chicago lineup should be deeper than it has been in a long time. 

The pitching isn't quite where you'd like it to be, but that's why the Cubs are longshots and not favorites. Shota Imanaga and Justine Steele are quality front-line starters (assuming Steele stays fully healthy), but you'd like to see a bit more here. The bullpen has been improved by bringing Ryan Pressly and Ryan Braiser to Wrigleyville, but again, you'd like to see a little more. Chicago has the assets in the minor leagues to make a move for an arm or two mid-season, and should that come to pass, the Cubs will be dangerous. SportsLine's proven model nailed Willy Adames' huge season in 2025. See it top 2025 Fantasy baseball sleepers here. 

This team was just in the World Series two years ago, and a large chunk of that core remains in place. Of course, the big news in the desert is the arrival of Corbin Burnes, who unexpectedly signed in free agency to form a potent 1-2 punch with Zac Gallen atop the rotation. You'd like to see another big bat in place here - Josh Naylor, acquired from Cleveland this winter, is the closest thing resembling that sort of addition - but the offense should look much better if Corbin Carroll returns to the height of his powers and Ketel Marte keeps playing like a star. I'd also back Eduardo Rodriguez to pitch much better this year, and for Merrill Kelly to do the same now that he won't be dealing with a nagging injury. Former top prospect Brandon Pfaadt is also a prime candidate for a post-hype breakout.

What I'm counting on here is Arizona snatching a Wild Card berth and then riding its pitching to the World Series. They'll likely need to trade for another bat at the trade deadline, but the Snakes are capable of beating anyone once they get into the playoffs. They'll just have to actually make it first. Things went a bit haywire in the desert last year - the post-World Series hangover is real. The Diamondbacks should have a fresh start this season. Now, get Fantasy baseball rankings from the model that simulates the season 10,000 times right here.

Now that you've seen the top 2025 World Series longshots to bet, it's time to get ready for your Fantasy baseball drafts. Visit SportsLine now to see the top sleepers, breakouts and busts for 2025, all from the model that has simulated the season 10,000 times and nailed Willy Adames as a sleeper and Adley Rutschman as a bust in 2024.

Here are some of the sportsbooks to bet on MLB futures, along with the various MLB sportsbook promos they currently offer.

For all the incessant complaints associated with NIL, the transfer portal and college football's recruiting calendar, one thing's for certain — coaching at a Power Four university has its financial advantages. With increased revenue distribution comes enhanced resources, and it's never been more costly for those funding coaching contracts.

Texas A&M's gross miscalculation with Jimbo Fisher cost the Aggies a record-setting $76 million in buyout money, a figure many FBS schools would never be able to absorb. We're now seeing new hires on shorter leashes as a result, and for the already proven winners, handsome increases to keep them in tow.

College football's coaching contract financials ahead of the 2025 season vary greatly, but there are 10 deals that fall under our ""best"" and ""worst"" categories. Essentially, $10 million annually is the new benchmark for the top 5% of the sport with eight coaches set to exceed that number this fall.

Let's start with a few of college football's best contracts before diving into the ugly ones. These are all calculated agreements that include recent bumps during successful tenures for respective coaches. Most include not-so-insane buyouts just in case things go south in a hurry.

Kiffin has signed a contract extension with a pay increase twice since 2022, a smart move from the Rebels considering his rapid ascension and reinvigorated career of sorts coming after his coaching rehabilitation stint at FAU. Kiffin has hit 10 or more wins three times in five years, this coming after the program's numbers of 10-win seasons was just seven all-time when he was hired. He has a penchant for the portal in college football's new era and his acumen offensively makes Ole Miss an attractive destination.

Somehow, the Cyclones have been able to keep Campbell happy during his time in Ames. Last September, Campbell became the all-time winningest coach at Iowa State and helped the Cyclones reach 11 wins for the first time in program history. He signed an eight-year extension after he was courted by North Carolina and others, and for the most part, has done more with less during his tenure in terms of talent. Though terms of Campbell's new deal haven't yet been disclosed, he only made $4 million last season, which ranks outside of the top 50 nationally.

At $2.9 million last season, Key was on the bottom rung of ACC coaches before sporting another 7-5 season that included a win over then fourth-ranked Miami and an eight-overtime loss to eventual SEC champion Georgia. One of the haves in Atlanta made the call, and the Yellow Jackets stepped up to lock-in Key with a five-year extension. He has brought stability to the ACC program since Geoff Collins left it in ruins following Paul Johnson's successful tenure. Few teams nationally embody the personality of their  coach like the Yellow Jackets, and it shows on the field.

There were some who scoffed at the Buffaloes taking a chance on Coach Prime and nearly doubling the previous high-water mark of a Colorado coach, but the investment is already drawing returns. He hasn't left for another job and has three years remaining on a not-so-expansive deal compared to other high-end Power Four coaches. The Buffaloes nearly challenge for a Big 12 crown last fall. 

The Gamecocks boosted Beamer's salary to $8.1 million in January coming off the program's nine-win campaign, a number that still ranks in the middle of the 16-team SEC. Beamer has shot past the Gamecocks' preseason projected win total three times in his first four seasons and is recruiting at an all-time level in Columbia. Given his pay, this is a bargain for a coach who looks to be a South Carolina-lifer if the winning continues. He's not the type to sniff around at other vacancies should the Gamecocks obtain playoff breakthrough.

Not all contracts are winners, however. ""What have you done for me lately?"" is everything in college football, and a detached fan base leading into a season is one of the last things you want to see as someone who signs the checks. Sifting through current deals -- including a few recent updates -- here are five bad contracts ahead of the 2025 campaign ...

Convinced it was written in error earlier this spring, I refreshed my browser to make sure the headline was correct: Wisconsin extends Luke Fickell through the 2031 season. Come again? The coach who has failed to impress after landing the Big Ten job in 2022 following an impressive run at Cincinnati? The one-year extension is not unprecedented in Madison -- he was originally signed to a seven-year deal -- but it's ill-timed, to say the least. Badgers legend Barry Alvarez voiced his displeasure with the current state of affairs last month coming off the program's first losing campaign in 23 years.

Kentucky handed Stoops a big-time extension after a home loss to Vanderbilt in 2022, and there's been no return on that investment. The Wildcats have faded into irrelevancy since that new deal was signed, including 14 losses in their last 18 SEC games. Stoops has lost 10 of his last 12 home games against league competition, too. And then there's the Texas A&M fiasco two coaching cycles ago. This marriage seems to be deteriorating in the Bluegrass.

Thanks to 10 wins ahead of his first season in the SEC, Venables happily signed a six-year extension with the Sooners worth $51.6 million, a big win for CAA's Jimmy Sexton. Then, reality set in. Ravaged by injuries at wide receiver and marred by season-long struggles at the line of scrimmage, Oklahoma tumbled to its second 6-7 finish in three years under Venables last fall. Now, he will rely on mass transfer portal help to try to right the ship.

Cover your eyes, FSU fans. Norvell's restructured contract coming off 2024's two-win disaster runs through the 2031 season and his buyout is the largest in the ACC at $63 million. Norvell's new deal following FSU's conference title in 2023 put the Seminoles in a financial straight jacket for the foreseeable future, but who could've imagined last season's all-time fall from grace? Portal evaluations were home runs early, but last cycle left much to be desired from Norvell's staff.

Since winning 11 games in his first season with the Trojans in 2022, Riley is beginning to fade. A 4-5 finish against Big Ten competition last fall was tough to stomach, especially considering three road losses came to Minnesota, Maryland and Washington — programs that were not equipped with USC's talent, comparatively. Riley's buyout figure ahead of the 2025 season might make the decision-makers in Los Angeles a bit squeamish given its parameters. Unless Riley leaves for another vacancy in the next few years, the Trojans are on the hook for the long haul. Riley's buyout number is $90 million, second only to Georgia coach Kirby Smart ($118 million).

New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole underwent an MRI on his pitching elbow after allowing six runs in his most recent start. Cole and the Yankees have received the initial results of that MRI but are seeking out second opinions. Cole told reporters that he is ""concerned"" about his elbow. 

""I'm hoping for the best,"" Cole told Bryan Hoch on Saturday. ""In the game there was a lot of good stuff happening the other day, but as I got home I just continued to get more and more sore. Something wasn't right.""

The 34-year-old right-hander also dealt with elbow issues last spring -- a nerve issue, specifically, that delayed his first start of the 2024 regular season until June 19. Cole last season went on to make 17 starts, and over that span he pitched to a 121 ERA+ and a 3.41 K/BB ratio -- good results but hardly vintage Cole. In 2023, Cole won the AL Cy Young Award with a dominant campaign. At this point, the expectation has to be that Cole will miss time, but how much time is unknown at this juncture. 

The Yankees are also dealing with the loss of Cole's rotation-mate Luis Gil, who's sidelined until at least late May or early June with a lat strain. 

The Yankees are coming off a 2024 season in which they won both the American League East title and the pennant before falling to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. Aaron Boone's club is angling to win the division again in 2025 despite the loss of outfielder Juan Soto to the crosstown New York Mets in free agency. They did add a frontline starter in Max Fried this offseason, but injuries are already eating away at what was once an enviable rotation in the Bronx.

Germans Hold 1-2-3 Spots Midway Through 2-Man World Bobsled Championship, With US in Medal Hunt

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — Take the season's biggest races in the sliding sports of bobsled, skeleton and luge, meaning either the Olympics or the world championships, and there have been 59 instances of sliders from one place sweeping the podium.

Austria did it twice. Poland did it once.

The other 56 times, it was German sliders. That includes some instances of East German and West German sliders combining for those sweeps before the countries unified, but you get the idea.

Surprise! The Germans are poised to do it again in the two-man world bobsled championships at snowy, windy and blustery Lake Placid, with Francesco Friedrich, Johannes Lochner and Adam Ammour driving into the top three spots after the first two heats of this year's title race on Saturday.

Friedrich and Alexander Schüller lead in 1 minute, 49.75 seconds. Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer are 0.14 seconds back in second place, while Ammour and Benedikt Hertel are 0.33 seconds off the lead in third. The final two runs are Sunday.

“The third run,” Friedrich said, “is the decision.”

He knows better than anyone what it takes. Friedrich has won the world two-man title eight times in the last nine competitions, plus has two Olympic two-man gold medals in that span. He's the undisputed king of sliding, a winner of 105 World Cup, world championship and Olympic races in his career, and is two runs away from No. 106.

“We have to be good on every track of the world if we want to be world champions,"" Friedrich said. ""Lake Placid, I was here for the first time in 2012 and it’s a really tough track. I’ve had great rhythm and when you know how to take the rhythm it’s a very, very excellent track.”

Right on the German heels: Frank Del Duca and Charlie Volker of the U.S., a half-second back of Friedrich and only 0.17 seconds off a medal position.

Del Duca is bidding to be the first U.S. men's pilot to win a medal at worlds since the late Steve Holcomb drove to a four-man gold at St. Moritz in 2013.

“We put ourselves in contention and, you know, we're obviously hungry for more,"" Del Duca said. ""But when we look at how we executed, I think it was pretty solid. Definitely something to build off. And let’s see if we can chip away and snag a medal.”

The women's monobob competition starts later Saturday with the first two heats of that event.

Brad Marchand Plays for the Florida Panthers. It's a Move That the Panthers Never Saw Coming

Aleksander Barkov looked across the Florida Panthers' locker room on Saturday morning and noticed a new addition.

A nameplate over a locker — bearing the name Brad Marchand.

“Kind of weird, for now,” Barkov said.

A guy who always played like he hated Florida will soon be in uniform for Florida, after a stunning trade at the NHL's deadline Friday brought Marchand — who was captain of the Boston Bruins — to the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers. Marchand played 64 games against the Panthers including postseasons, fifth-most of all active players.

“He’s a winner,” Barkov said. “He won the Stanley Cup with Boston and every year he’s been part of really good teams. He has that experience of playing meaningful games. Everyone knows what kind of player and human he is, so excited to have him on our side — for once.”

At 36, Marchand is still highly effective. He had 21 goals and 26 assists in 61 games with the Bruins this season, and Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Marchand's acquisition — it only cost the Panthers a conditional draft pick — further addresses very specific needs that the team had going into the playoffs.

It needed a top-four defenseman and landed one last week by acquiring Seth Jones from Chicago. And it needed a penalty-killer; that's where Marchand comes in.

“I know that’s an unusual thing to say about Brad Marchand, but he was part of possibly the best tandem for years with Patrice Bergeron,” Maurice said. “He’s an elite penalty killer. Clearly, he’s a power-play guy, he’s an offensive guy, he’s physical, he’s got all the energy.”

Panthers forward A.J. Greer played with Marchand in Boston and said he can't wait to see his former-turned-current teammate again and greet him with a hug.

“Brad’s an amazing person,” Greer said. “Great player. He brings out the best in everyone, every day. He’s a competitor and whether it’s in practice or in games he always kind of seems to elevate everyone around him. We’re really excited to have him. I think he’s going to complement this group really well.”

And the moves to bring in Jones and now Marchand are yet another reminder that the Panthers are loading up in an effort for a second consecutive Stanley Cup.

“It’s awesome,” Barkov said. “Bringing in a guy like him is not an everyday thing. ... We’re all-in again. We want to win. We want to compete for another Cup. We added some amazing players here and amazing guys. So, we’re excited.”

Liverpool’s lead in the Premier League has grown to 16 points and Mohamed Salah’s lead in the Golden Boot contest is up to seven goals

Sweet Sixteen: Liverpool's Lead in Premier League Grows to 16 Points as Ailing Man City Loses Again

Liverpool's lead in the Premier League has grown to 16 points.

Mohamed Salah's lead in the Golden Boot contest is up to seven goals.

Both races are turning into a procession after Salah converted two second-half penalties for his 26th and 27th goals of the campaign to clinch a 3-1 win for Liverpool at home to last-placed Southampton on Saturday.

It seems a matter of when, not if, Liverpool secures its record-tying 20th English top-flight championship, even if Arsenal — way back in second place — has two games in hand. Liverpool's players have nine games left but surely won't need all of them to seal the title.

Maybe a more staggering statistic is that Manchester City, the winner of the last four titles, is now 23 points behind Liverpool after a 1-0 loss at third-placed Nottingham Forest, whose winner came from Callum Hudson-Odoi in the 83rd.

City is in fourth place, at least for overnight, and has a fight on its hands just to finish in the top five, which should be enough to qualify for the Champions League this season.

Erling Haaland had a quiet match and — stuck on 20 goals — is now struggling to be the league's top scorer for the third straight season.

Instead, it's Salah heading for the Golden Boot, which he won outright in 2017-18 and shared in the 2018-19 and 2021-22 seasons, and is now up to 184 goals in the Premier League — tied with Man City great Sergio Aguero at No. 5 on the all-time list.

“Sergio was a great player — he was a legend here in the league so I am happy about that and happy about the win,” Salah said.



  Liverpool not holding back ahead of PSG
 

The game against Southampton came in the middle of two matches in a six-day span against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League's last 16.

Liverpool holds a 1-0 lead after the first leg in Paris on Wednesday and manager Arne Slot opted against mass rotation ahead of the return match on Tuesday. Indeed, Salah played the whole match.

Darwin Nunez started the match after setting up Harvey Elliott's winner in the French capital and scored himself in the 51st minute, canceling out Will Smallbone's shock opener for Southampton in first-half stoppage time.

Nunez then was fouled for the first penalty slotted home by Salah in the 54th, before the Egypt star notched his second in the 88th after a handball.

“The manager, his head was going for us but it's something you need sometimes,"" Salah said of Slot's halftime reaction. ""Because the first half it was sloppy and we were slow ... but we are now more experienced and we can manage that situation like we did.”

Southampton stayed 13 points from safety and looks destined for an immediate return to the Championship.



  Forest on course for Champions League
 

Nottingham Forest’s improbable bid for Champions League qualification was strengthened by the win over City, whose goalkeeper Ederson Moraes was beaten at his near post by Hudson-Odoi’s shot in one of the few clear-cut chances in a tight game at the City Ground.

A few minutes earlier, Ederson had tipped a curling strike by Hudson-Odoi onto the post.

“I knew I'd get another chance and that one went in, so I'm buzzing,” Hudson-Odoi said.

Forest was battling relegation last season and finished the season 59 points behind City. Now it is four points ahead of the soon-to-be-deposed champions and has 10 games remaining as the club looks to get back into Europe’s top competition, which Forest famously won in 1979 and ’80 under Brian Clough.

City has steadied after a dreadful end to 2024 but has still lost three of its last five league games, to the current top three of Liverpool, Arsenal and now Forest.

“Every season the Premier League gets better and better,” Guardiola said. “We have 10 finals (to go).”



  Last-gasp winner for Brighton
 

Joao Pedro converted a penalty in the eighth minute of stoppage time to earn Brighton a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Fulham and lift his team to sixth place — level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea.

Crystal Palace beat Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Ismaila Sarr's 82nd-minute goal.

Later Saturday, Brentford hosts Aston Villa and Everton travels to Wolverhampton.

In the NFL, one big move from a team can have a trickle-down effect, impacting the moves of other teams or players. One example: The Seattle Seahawks traded veteran quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders Friday, with potentially changed the outlook for another signal-caller who had major question marks going into the offseason.

With Smith shipped to Vegas to rejoin his former head coach in Pete Carroll, Sam Darnold is not expected to return to the Minnesota Vikings, according to the NFL Network. 

""I don't know and no one around the league really knows who the frontrunner for Sam Darnold is,"" said CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones, who adds the former No. 3 overall pick has been the domino that everyone's been waiting to fall when it comes to quarterbacks. 

Darnold, who sits atop Pete Prisco's Top 100 free agents for 2025, will officially become a free agent when the new league year begins on Wednesday, March 12 and teams can then begin to put in their offers. Teams can still try to lock up a verbal agreement with players as early as Monday, March 10 when the legal tampering period begins.

Minnesota still has J.J. McCarthy, who they took at No. 10 in the 2024 NFL Draft, so won't feel as much pressure as quarterback-needy teams to bring the checkbook out to sign a veteran.

McCarthy suffered a season-ending knee injury during the preseason and is expected to be cleared to practice this spring, essentially making him the clear front-runner for the starting job if Darnold indeed leaves. The team is now shifting its focus to adding another member of its quarterback room, per To Pelissero. 

One option for Minnesota is re-signing Daniel Jones, who they added during the 2024 season after the former New York Giants QB was released from the team who drafted him. Jones is reportedly considering multiple opportunities for the 2025 season.

Darnold signed a one-year contract with the Vikings and had a career year in 2024. He finished the season with 4,319 passing yards, 39 touchdowns and a 66.2 completion percentage, all career highs. The 27-year-old helped lead the Vikings to a 14-3 record, but struggled when it mattered most, losing to the Detroit Lions in Week 18 and losing to the Los Angeles Rams in the wild-card round.

Ismaila Sarr's winning goal secured another important three points for the Eagles as they continue their run of good form.

The victory over Ipswich means it's the Eagles fourth in a row and they have lost just one of their previous 13 matches.

Sarr is having an excellent season for Palace and has now scored seven goals and registered three assists in 28 league games.

The Senegalese international was moved into a central striking role when Eddie Nketiah was withdrawn and his chipped winning goal was an excellent piece of skill.

Sarr then copied Jean-Philippe Mateta's trademark celebration by wheeling away and kicking the corner flag, to shouts of 'boom' from the Selhurst Park crowd.

The celebration has been seen many times in the last 12 months and Sarr did it in honour of Mateta who has been ruled out after having 25 stitches to a cut on his head following a challenge by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts.

""I did it for [Jean-Philippe Mateta]. He is my guy. He is a good guy. But he is doing good."" Sarr said.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The Detroit Red Wings season has taken an all-too-familiar turn toward the unfortunate, but one Detroit prospect is doing his best to provide optimism for the future in Hockeytown.

Axel Sandin-Pellikka (whom the Red Wings selected with the 17th pick in the 2023 NHL Draft) scored his 12th SHL goal of the season Saturday for Skellefteå, setting a new record for goals by a junior-aged (i.e. under-20) defenseman in league history.  The goal stood as the game-winner for Skellefteå, who scored a vital 2–1 win over league leaders Brynäs.

After the win, Sandin-Pellikka will be gearing up for a deep SHL playoff run, but for Red Wings fans, it's impossible not to look forward to his North American future.  As noted by Detroit general manager Steve Yzerman in his post-trade deadline remarks, it's possible Sandin-Pellikka could come to the United States for the end of the season once his SHL campaign wraps up.

More than likely, that would mean joining the Grand Rapids Griffins for the end of their season, though, depending on how the Red Wings playoff push progresses, perhaps he could also make an NHL cameo.

The more significant question is probably where Sandin-Pellikka will begin his '25-26 campaign, and once again, the likeliest answer to that question is Grand Rapids.  Sure, Sandin-Pellikka could play his way into a role with the Red Wings out of camp, but Yzerman has tended to exercise patience with his drafted prospects (especially so with defensemen), preferring to see them thrive with the Griffins before advancing to an NHL role.

Regardless of Sandin-Pellikka's precise timeline to Detroit, he's certainly providing excitement for the future at a time when Hockeytown could use a boost.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone, which puts the focus on free agency, which officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades.

The Las Vegas Raiders made one of the loudest moves of the week, reportedly trading for Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith. That's a move that will have significance for Minnesota Vikings QB Sam Darnold.

Here's everything you need to know as teams across the league continue to make moves this offseason.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

Marquis ""Hollywood"" Brown is returning to the Chiefs for another season. The six-year veteran receiver has agreed to a one-year contract with Kansas City, according to several reports. The deal could earn him up to $11 million.

Last season with the Chiefs, Brown was limited to two games (starting one) after dislocating his shoulder during the preseason and eventually undergoing surgery. He returned during Week 16 and notched nine receptions for 91 yards in total. In the postseason, he caught five passes (on 13 targets) for 50 yards.

Brown, 27, had his best season in 2021 with the Ravens, tallying 91 receptions for 1,008 yards and six TDs. For his career, he's totaled 322 catches for 3,735 yards and 28 scores with Baltimore, the Cardinals and Chiefs.

Gesicki, 29, caught 65 passes for 665 yards and two touchdowns last season, his first with the Cincinnati Bengals. He spent the 2023 season with the New England Patriots and his first five NFL seasons with the Miami Dolphins.

Tight end Mike Gesicki is re-signing with the Benglas on a three-year, $25.5 million deal, per sources.

Engram, 30, was limited to nine games last season due to hamstring and shoulder injuries. He caught 47 passes (on 64 targets) for 365 yards and one touchdown. The 2024-25 campaign was his third with the Jaguars after playing his first five NFL seasons with the Giants.

Additionally, the Jaguars released cornerback Ronald Darby on Thursday. Jacksonville now has $60 million in salary cap space, according to Spotrac.

The Commanders are bringing back leading tackler Bobby Wagner on a one-year contract, according to several reports. The deal could be worth up to $9.5 million with $8 million guaranteed, reports NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Wagner, 34, led Washington with 132 tackles last season, a performance that earned him second-team All-Pro honors and his 10th Pro Bowl selection. The Commanders had the fourth-ranked defense in the NFC, allowing an average of 327.9 yards per game.

The 2024-25 season was Wagner's first with the Commanders after 11 with the Seahawks (who drafted him in the second round in 2012) and one with the Rams. He's averaged 155 tackles during his 13-year NFL career with 2.9 sacks and eight tackles for loss.

A day after reports that the Jaguars planned to release Christian Kirk, they end up striking a deal to trade him to Houston for a reported 2026 7th-round draft pick.

DeVito, 26, has played 12 games in two seasons with the New York Giants. He has 1,358 passing yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions in his NFL career.

I'm told Tommy DeVito will sign his exclusive rights free agent (ERFA) tender at some point this weekend, per sources. So the Giants will officially have one quarterback on their roster as Joe Schoen has suggested when the NFL negotiating period of free agency begins Monday.

Hendrickson led the NFL with 17.5 sacks in 2024 and he's entering the final year of his contract.

He's a potentially huge trade chip for Cincinnati.

The Bengals have taken the rare step of granting All-Pro DE Trey Hendrickson permission to seek a trade. “It’s been an honor and privilege to represent Cincinnati over the last four years,” said Hendrickson, the NFL’s sack leader. “I love this city and organization.

Hargrave, 32, has played nine NFL seasons with the Steelers, Eagles and 49ers. He has 380 career tackles and 45.5 sacks.

He played only three games during the 2024 season after suffering a partially torn right triceps, which required season-ending surgery.

49ers have informed defensive tackle Javon Hargrave that he will be released on the first day of the league year next week, per source. Hargrave will be a free agent. pic.twitter.com/7d3LFBTrhq

This is the last Bubble Watch of the regular season. There are ten bubble games this Saturday and unlike last weekend, every game features a bubble team playing at home. And for a bonus, the Sunday bubble game is included here as well. In keeping with the theme, that bubble team is at home as well. 

For some of these teams, this is the last chance to make a positive impression. They don't know what they will get in the conference tournament. SEC teams figure they will see quality at some point. ACC teams?  Not so sure. They may only get to play one game. 

The list of teams on the bubble will get reevaluated once we see conference tournament brackets and the path to a conference title for each of them.

In one of the ""double bubble"" games Saturday, the Hoosiers are looking for a win in coach Mike Woodson's final home game and another quality win to pad their tournament résumé. They still have a bad record against Quad 1 teams, but no losses outside that group. 

For Ohio State, they just need wins. Good wins, bad wins, any wins. Actually, there is no such thing as a bad win for the Buckeyes. Still, at only 17-13 overall, they need to play above .500 from here on out. That is a lot easier if they win vs. Indiana. 

8 p.m. | SEC Network, fubo (Try for free)

The other ""double bubble"" game on the docket has both teams coming off wins. The Sooners beat Missouri last time out to move to 5-11 in Quad 1, but they also have a loss each in Quad 2 and 3. The Quad 2 loss came at home to the Longhorns. 

Texas looked dead in the water, biding its time until the season ended, and then suddenly, the Longhorns won at Mississippi State. They still have more work to do. Neither of these teams can play themselves in the field Saturday, but the Longhorns have more to do to get in due to four Quad 2 losses. 

vs. Vanderbilt, Noon | ESPNU, fubo (Try for free) 

The Bulldogs have won three straight including big wins over Florida and at fellow bubbler Texas. Vanderbilt is another chance to add a good win to the tournament profile. The Commodores have not been a great road team this season, but won at Texas A&M their last time away from home.    	          

vs. Mississippi State, Noon | SEC Network, fubo (Try for free)

Arkansas is one of at least three SEC teams that you never know what you're going to get. The Razorbacks lost at South Carolina and followed that up with a win at Vanderbilt. That is why they are on the bubble. A win against the Bulldogs takes some pressure off of their SEC Tournament performance, but like many of these bubble teams, their fate will not be decided this weekend.   

vs.  Georgia Tech, 2:15 p.m. | CW   

Wake Forest needs to beat the Yellow Jackets and pick-up at least one quality win in the ACC Tournament to have any shot at an NCAA Tournament selection. The Demon Deacons have already lost too many games to ACC also-rans.    	          

vs.  Providence, 4 p.m. | FS1, fubo (Try for free)  

Xavier has been hanging around the cut-line and a loss to Providence may make it harder to get back above it. The Musketeers will likely need a quality win in the Big East Tournament as well, but a loss to the Friars might mean they need to win out.    	          

vs. UCF, 5 p.m. | ESPN+  

The Mountaineers have had some big wins against the 14th toughest schedule this season, including victories against Iowa State, Arizona and at Kansas. They do not have a great record against better teams though, sitting at 6-11 vs. Quad 1. A win over UCF gives West Virginia some cushion heading into the Big 12 Tournament. 

vs. Duke, 6:30 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free)   

The Tar Heels have been waiting for this moment to arrive. They are just 1-10 in Quad 1 games. Their last attempt at win No. 2 resulted in a loss to Clemson. They have been handling the ACC punching bags for the last three weeks and now they get their shot at a quality opponent. Fail here and there is still hope in the ACC Tournament, but no guarantee they will get the games they need.    	          

vs. Houston, 10 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free)  

Baylor gets a great chance to ease some fears. A win over Houston might be enough to punch its ticket, assuming the Bears don't give it away in the Big 12 Tournament. If they lose, they can still get what they need without a Big 12 title.    	          

vs. Nevada, 10:30 p.m. | FS1, fubo (Try for free)  

The Aztecs just got swept by UNLV, which are their two worst losses of the season so far. A home loss to Nevada would be another one in Quad 3 and put San Diego State's tournament hopes in serious jeopardy.    	          

vs. Iowa, 12:30 p.m. | Fox, fubo (Try for free) 

A few weeks ago, the Cornhuskers looked like they were rallying to an NCAA Tournament berth. Then the wheels fell off and they lost five of their last six. The double OT loss to Ohio State last time out was a great effort that fell short. However, if Nebraska misses the field, it will be because of the home losses to Minnesota and Rutgers. This game is a must-win. 

Locks based on résumé: 28 | At-large bids in play: 9 | Automatic bids secured: 0 of 31              	          

Note – all references to NCAA Tournament selection records and trends based on NET rankings excludes the 2021 tournament. Due to shortened schedules and a relatively small number of nonconference games, those rankings are not reliable enough to be considered.

Former Illini standout Dave Abbott was the NCAA track and field’s first-ever two-time two-mile run champion.

Dave Abbott, NCAA track and field’s first-ever two-time two-mile run champion, was born on this date 123 years ago — March 8, 1902.

Born in Providence, R.I., Abbott did not compete as a distance runner in high school. He originally attended Purdue University, studying civil engineering. He captained the Boilermakers’ cross-country team and also ran track and field.

In the fall of 1927, Abbott transferred to the University of Illinois to join coach Harry Gill’s distance runners. He captained the Illini cross-country squad and led the 1927 squad to runner-up in the Big Ten meet. Abbott claimed the individual title in 1928, covering the five-mile course in a time of 26 minutes, 42 seconds.

His greatest success came as a two-miler, winning indoor individual conference championships in both 1928 (9:27.5) and 1929 (9:26.4). Abbott duplicated that same feat outdoors in the same seasons while leading his teammates to a pair of Big Ten team titles.

He continued his remarkable individual success at both the 1928 and 1929 NCAA championships, both held in Chicago. Abbott won a national two-mile title his junior year in a time of 9:28.8. As a team, Illinois placed second nationally outdoors in 1928. Abbott repeated his individual first-place finish as a senior in 1929, completing the eight-lap race in 9:30. Gill’s Illini finished third as a team.

Abbott competed in the 5,000-meter run at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, but did not advance beyond his preliminary heat.

He earned a landscape architecture degree from the University of Illinois and began his career with the Chicago Regional Planning Association. In 1934, Abbott became the landscape architect for the Illinois Division of Parks. His professional skills in landscape design, engineering and planning were important in the acquisition and development of the Illinois State Park System. He retired in 1971 after 38 years of state service.

Abbott spent his retirement years in South Brooksville, Fla. He died in 1987 at the age of 85.

The New York Yankees are holding their breath on Gerrit Cole.

The staff ace and former Cy Young Award winner underwent an MRI on his pitching elbow Friday due to discomfort he experienced after a rough spring training start on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Cole said he is ""concerned"" about what the MRI will show and that he expects to know the results in the next few days.

“I’ve still got some hope. I’m just waiting for the experts to weigh in,"" said Cole, who noted he was getting second opinions.

Cole allowed six earned runs in 2 2/3 innings of work against the Minnesota Twins, throwing 54 pitches and averaging 95.7 mph with his four-seam fastball.

“In the game there was a lot of good stuff happening the other day, but as I got home I just continued to get more and more sore,"" Cole said. ""Something wasn’t right.”

Cole was strong in his first spring training start on Feb. 28, striking out five and allowing three hits and one earned run in 3 1/3 innings.

This is the second straight season in which Cole experienced elbow issues in spring training. Last year, he was shut down with nerve inflammation in his elbow and didn't make his season debut until June 19. He went on to post a 3.41 ERA and helped lead the Yankees to the World Series, where they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Cole is also coming off an unusual offseason in which he opted out of his contract, then agreed to return on a four year, $144 million deal — the exact terms of the contract he opted out of.

It goes without saying losing Cole for a significant amount of time would be catastrophic for the Yankees. They already lost last year's Rookie of the Year Luis Gil for at least three months to a lat strain. More broadly, they lost Juan Soto to the New York Mets in the winter and attempted to make up for it with a large swath of moves, including an eight-year, $218 million deal for starting pitcher Max Fried. They also traded away starter Nestor Cortes in the Devin Williams deal.

Without Cole or Gil, New York would be poised to enter the 2025 season with a rotation along the lines of Fried, Clarke Schmidt, Carlos Rodón, Marcus Stroman (whom they're probably happy with not trading now) and something like Will Warren or non-roster invitee Carlos Carrasco.

It's an unenviable position for a team that began the spring with high expectations and a chip on its shoulder, so Cole's test results can't come back soon enough.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

A rematch of one of this season's more thrilling Big Ten regular-season games is upon us Saturday as Ohio State faces Indiana on the road, seeking to avenge its home loss to the Hoosiers from mid-January. This time around, even more is at stake for the Hoosiers, whose NCAA Tournament hopes have been resurrected in recent weeks. 

IU is a projected No. 10 seed in Jerry Palm's latest bracket after wins in three of its last four and four of its last six, which has included victories over Michigan State, Purdue and Penn State. A win Saturday would solidify its résumé entering postseason play. 

Ohio State likely enters this one highly motivated as well after grinding out a double-overtime win earlier in the week vs. Nebraska. The Buckeyes have stumbled the last month in conference play but have been largely a prickly thorn in the side of opponents on the road. It could serve as a good opportunity for them to play spoiler in Assembly Hall as they head into Big Ten tourney play.  

Date: Saturday, March 8 | Time: 3:45 p.m. ET Location: Assembly Hall -- Bloomington, Indiana TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free) Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)  

All odds via SportsLine consensus 

Indiana coach Mike Woodson -- even during a losing streak that spanned five games earlier this season -- said that despite the results, IU was playing fairly well. The results are now showing as much. It enters Saturday having won three of its last four, and I suspect it will be ready to make a statement in the regular-season finale with a chance to help solidify its NCAA Tournament résumé. As a narrow favorite, I like laying the points with the Hoosiers here. Pick: Indiana -1

Defending Bundesliga champions Bayer 04 Leverkusen found themselves unexpectedly upset by struggling SV Werder Bremen in a Saturday afternoon fixture. Xabi Alonso’s Werkself inability to make up ground in a title race already out of their grasp wasn’t the worst news, however. The loss of German phenom Florian Wirtz just 14 minutes after being subbed on to start the second half constituted a huge blow.

Wirtz left the BayArena on crutches after suffering an ankle injury. With noticeable concern plaguing his face, Xabi simply insisted that he had no information on Wirtz when speaking to Sky Germany after the full-time whistle. Later at the post match press conference, Xabi spoke on the scope of the loss.

“It just wasn’t good from us today,” Xabi noted. “It really hurts, especially with Flo [Wirtz] out. We have to forget this game as quickly as possible. We were far too hectic and never had control. Bremen’s first goal rattled us. We had a decent spell in the second half, but overall it wasn’t good enough.” 

Given the nature of the injury, Wirtz’s availability for the second leg of the Champions League fixture against Bayern can likely be scratched. Leverkusen already find themselves highly disadvantaged following Wednesday’s result. Wirtz might also miss out on representing Germany during the forthcoming international break.

Just before the Chicago Blackhawks took on the Utah Hockey Club on Friday night at the United Center, GM Kyle Davidson spoke at his post-trade deadline press conference.

He talked about a lot of hard hitting topics surrounding the organization. In addition to going over the moves that were made ahead of the deadline, there was some great insight on what his plans are for the future.

The Blackhawks took on Shea Weber’s cap hit so that they have no trouble reaching the floor and Davidson confirmed that this move won’t stop them from making more moves at any point.

“It doesn’t change anything that we will or won’t do in the summer.” Davidson said on the Weber money. “It doesn’t change any ambition from that standpoint. We still have over $30 million in cap space next year and not too many guys to resign. There is still a lot of opportunity should it become available to us.”

Not only does this give insight into the Weber move not hurting the Blackhawks, but it also implies that Kyle knows how rich the Blackhawks are this summer and wants to go shopping with some of that money.

Kyle Davidson wants Ryan Donato to remain a part of this team. He didn’t trade him because he didn’t get offered what he believes is proper value. Now, he’d like to strike a deal with his player. According to him, they have “exchanged ideas” when it comes to an extension.

“We value Ryan.” Davidson said.  “We love what he brings on the ice, off the ice. He’s a guy that never stops trying to get better. He took some very meaningful steps in trying to improve his game this summer which I believe is translating into a career year this year. That’s just a great example that you want in your organization.”

We’ve heard Connor Bedard and Pat Maroon amongst others praise Donato but hearing it from the GM like that speaks volumes about his character.

Kyle confirmed he is ready to move on from some picks and prospects for NHL-ready players. He said that it was “safe to say” that they will make more hockey trades going forward. That is important as they try to take another step in the rebuilding process which should include some winning.

There is a lot more work to do to make this team a contender again and the path won’t be pretty at times. However, Kyle and his staff have a plan. It’s on them to execute the plan in a way that works. The insight he gave on it during Friday’s presser made it seem like the plan is to be a winning team again soon.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the need for the Trump administration to domesticate drug production within American borders. 

Why is it so hard to get the medications your doctor prescribes? Why do patients and families spend countless hours fighting for standard-of-care treatments? Why do potentially life-saving drugs get delayed for weeks or months? 

That these questions are too often asked can be blamed on one of the least understood problems in healthcare today: the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). These powerful middlemen – not your doctor – increasingly decide which medicines you get, how much you pay for them, and where you get them.

My role as CEO of the Pontchartrain Cancer Center has given me a front-row seat to the systemic dysfunction PBMs perpetuate. 

PBMs were originally created to lower drug costs and streamline access to medications. (iStock)

My 19-year-old daughter recently faced a medical condition that required a standard-of-care treatment prescribed by her doctor. Even with my professional expertise, her doctor and I spent countless hours fighting with a PBM to get her medication approved. It was finally approved in February, but it still took 10 long weeks before she was able to access it.

HERE'S HOW TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CHINA COULD IMPACT DRUG PRICING AND OTHER HEALTHCARE COSTS

Every step of the way, we encountered a system where no one wanted to take responsibility; one person after another passed the problem along like a game of hot potato. The psychological toll of this ordeal – on her, on our family and on her medical team – is beyond words. If I, with all the resources and knowledge at my disposal, cannot cut through this red tape, what hope does any other American have?

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Millions of patients across the country face similar barriers: forced to endure denials, delays, and disruptions to care because of the increasing PBM stranglehold on medicine. 

These are not just administrative inconveniences; they are life-threatening obstacles. Patients suffering from cancer, chronic conditions or rare diseases are caught in a system that seems to value PBM corporate profits over human lives.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE HEALTHCARE PRICES 'TRANSPARENT'

PBMs were originally created to lower drug costs and streamline access to medications. Over time, however, they have transformed into entities that manipulate the system to maximize profits at the expense of patients. 

Making matters worse is the vertical integration that has allowed PBMs to dominate every aspect of the prescription drug supply chain. Today, the largest PBMs – Caremark Rx, LLC (CVS), Express Scripts, Inc. (ESI), and OptumRx, Inc. (OptumRx) – don’t just manage drug benefits. They also own the pharmacies that fill prescriptions and the insurers that pay for them. 

This means they have a financial incentive to prioritize their own profits at every step: steering patients to their own pharmacies, limiting access to competing medications and driving up out-of-pocket costs. With nearly 80 percent of prescription drugs controlled by just these three PBMs, their decisions shape the healthcare experiences of virtually every American. This vertical integration consolidates power in ways that simply harm patients.

HOW TRUMP CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR PATIENTSThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently exposed how the big three PBMs have rigged the drug supply chain to inflate costs and pad their profits. The FTC’s latest report, released in January 2025, highlighted how PBMs added significant markups on specialty generics, inflating costs for cancer, HIV and other life-saving drugs. 

Even while under federal investigation, the FTC report shows how these middlemen generated $7.3 billion in revenue from 2017 to 2022 by steering patients toward their own pharmacies, reimbursing themselves at higher rates than independent competitors, and engaging in predatory practices like spread pricing.Yet despite growing evidence and bipartisan calls for reform, Congress failed to act at the end of 2024. This missed opportunity is more than disappointing – it’s dangerous. Patients cannot wait while lawmakers play politics.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES HAVE SURGED ALMOST 40% OVER THE PAST DECADE

Congress must take immediate action to pass meaningful PBM reform. The House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health recently held a hearing to discuss PBM-driven price inflation, barriers to care, and market consolidation. The testimony reinforced what patients and healthcare professionals already know: PBMs are driving up costs and limiting access, not lowering them. 

These reforms have broad bipartisan support and represent real solutions. Patients deserve more than vague commitments; they deserve action.

President Donald Trump has made eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government a cornerstone of his administration’s agenda. PBM reform is a clear extension of that mission – these middlemen have exploited inefficiencies for too long, and it’s time to restore transparency, fairness, and patient-first policies to the system.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONCongress must pass meaningful PBM reform – not tomorrow but today. For my daughter and for the countless patients I’ve fought for over the years, this isn’t an abstract policy debate. It’s real, it’s urgent and it’s deeply personal.

It is time to put patients before profits and politics. Congress missed a crucial opportunity in 2024. Let’s make 2025 the year we finally stop these life-threatening PBMs and restore humanity to healthcare. For my daughter and for our loved ones, we cannot afford to wait any longer.

Greenland Candidate Campaigns for Better Healthcare After Beating Cancer in Denmark

By Tom Little

NUUK (Reuters) -As Greenland's general election approaches, a candidate campaigns for access to better healthcare on the vast island, recounting his personal journey of beating cancer after having to travel to Denmark from a remote town to undergo treatment.

""It's always about the budget ... I want to have the human before the economy or the budget,"" Justus Hansen, 57, a candidate for Greenland's centre-right Demokraatit party said.

While independence has taken centre stage in Greenland's election debate after renewed U.S. interest in the island, healthcare has long been a core issue, with vast distances and shortage of staff making it costly and difficult to give Greenlanders access to the care they need.

Hansen said he went to the hospital in his hometown of Tasiilaq on the eastern coast of Greenland, after feeling exhausted.

He was sent home after an initial consultation, he said, and when he returned after a week's time, he insisted on having his blood sample taken, which revealed a high level of infection.

""I have lost a lot of my own friends and family to cancer because they get diagnosed too late,"" Hansen said.

He was eventually sent to Nuuk from Tasiilaq - a journey across the ice cap of more than 680 kilometres (423 miles), involving travel by plane and helicopter - as the capital is the only place where Greenlanders can get a CT scan.

MORE:  

There, in January last year, he was diagnosed with renal cancer. ""I felt terrified. It's like a death sentence for me because my own mother died of cancer,"" he said.

Hansen said he had to wait six weeks in Greenland after being diagnosed with cancer before he could go to Denmark for treatment.

Hansen spent three months in Copenhagen for his first treatment, and returned to Denmark for two further periods of two months respectively to receive treatment after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in October.

Now, free of cancer, his experiences have fuelled his campaign for more doctors in Greenland's regional hospitals, improved healthcare in remote areas, and the installation of CT scanners in every regional hospital.

While Hansen feels strongly about Greenland becoming independent, he is cautious about a swift transition.

""We have to have more educated people,"" he said. ""Also, the economy will have to be much stronger than it is today before we can even talk about independence.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Thousands of Hungarians Rally for Better Healthcare,https://newscentral.africa/thousands-of-hungarians-rally-for-better-healthcare/,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 16:17:19 GMT","

Banners that read “Our health is at stake” and “European standard of care” were held by thousands of people who gathered in central Budapest on Saturday to demand additional money for Hungary’s long-neglected public health system.

Ahead of next year’s elections, nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been in office since 2010, is coming under increasing pressure to improve the quality of public services.

According to an AFP photographer, the demonstration in front of the parliament drew several thousand participants.

Fanni, a 27-year-old dentist who would not provide her last name, stated, “We need change,” and she expressed concern about her hospitalised grandmother.

“It is a terrible thing that you have to weigh whether or not it is worth taking your elderly relative to the hospital with a minor problem, because she could end up dying there,” she stated.

Sandor, a general practitioner who also chose not to provide his full name, bemoaned the pervasive lack of medical personnel.

“At the age of 77, I oversaw two general practitioner practices. “No one can take my place,” he told AFP.

More than a year after the surgery was postponed, Aniko Kertesz, a 58-year-old bank worker who also attended the protest, stated that her sister is still awaiting the removal of her uterus.

“When she was due to go to the hospital for the procedure, she was called just before and told there were too many surgeries scheduled,” she told AFP.

– Healthcare for all –

As one of the rally’s speakers exclaimed, “Healthcare belongs to all of us!” The audience erupted in cheers.

The rally’s organiser, the Hungarian Medical Chamber, has demanded increased financing and changes.

But the chamber was accused of acting like a “political actor” by Gergely Gulyas, Orban’s chief of staff.

He emphasised that the government would be amenable to talks and asserted that it had achieved “great strides” in healthcare in recent years, particularly in terms of increasing physician pay.

Based on the most recent Eurostat data, Hungary spent less than any other European Union nation on health in 2022, allocating just 4.4% of its GDP to this sector.

According to surveys, one of the main concerns of the Hungarian population is the quality of healthcare.

Last August, Orban’s chief opponent, opposition leader Peter Magyar, spent weeks touring hospitals in Hungary, exposing issues with the country’s healthcare system. He also participated in the protest on Saturday.

Two weeks ago, the judges’ union held an extraordinary march for judicial independence, drawing thousands of participants.

Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is continuing his battle against the health care industry from behind bars. In a series of emotional letters, Mangione has connected with supporters, including a mother named Karen, whose personal struggles with the health care system have deeply resonated with him.

Karen, who is fighting to afford her daughter’s medical care, wrote to Mangione after seeing his perp walk in December. The letter was shared by Ashley Shelby on her Substack, Bartleby on Trial, which covers Mangione’s case.

Driven by an unexplainable force, she felt compelled to reach out. In her letter, Karen recounted her difficult experiences with UnitedHealthcare, alleging the insurer denied coverage for her daughter’s life-threatening condition, even after she was hospitalised for 60 days in 2024. She described the situation as a result of insurance companies making medical decisions rather than doctors, and condemned UnitedHealthcare as “white-collar criminals.” Karen pledged to fight for health care reform in her daughter’s name for the rest of her life.

“What she and I went through as a result of insurance calling the shots rather than the doctors is a horrible story for another time. She is improving, but hardly close to her old self. I refer to UHC as ‘those white collar criminals’ whenever discussing them and vowed to fight for reform for the rest of my life,” Karen told Shelby.

“Your letter is the first to make me tear up. I am so, so sorry for what you and your daughter so senselessly had to endure,” Mangione wrote in response to the anonymous mother, identified only as Karen. He agreed to keep a photograph of Karen and her daughter, along with a print of Jesus she referenced, on his prison cell wall.

“Your daughter is blessed to have a mother who loves her so much and fights for her so relentlessly,” Mangione added.

Karen’s letter is just one of many Mangione has received since his arrest in December. In a recent public statement, Mangione expressed gratitude for the support he has garnered, stating, “I am overwhelmed by – and grateful for – everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. While I can’t reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive.”

Mangione is currently being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center on first-degree murder charges, in addition to federal terrorism charges. Prosecutors allege that the shooting of Thompson was a symbolic attack on the health care system, which Mangione had described in his manifesto as ""parasitic."" Despite the charges, Mangione has pleaded not guilty, and his case continues to draw national attention.

Bella Cruise is showing love to her younger sister.

The oldest daughter of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman took to Instagram to show support for Sunday Rose Urban, as she embarks on a modeling career.

On Friday, March 7, the oldest daughter of Keith Urban and Kidman shared a photo from a recent photoshoot with W Magazine on her Instagram account. The 16-year-old wore an animal print jacket slung over a black-and-white top. With a full face of makeup, Sunday glared into the camera.

In the caption of the post, she tagged the people who helped bring the vision to life, including styling, hair, and makeup personnel. Although Sunday shut the comments off on the post, Bella, 32, dropped a like on the photo.

Sunday only recently started posting to Instagram, with her very first upload coming in October 2024. The photo was snapped when she walked her very first runway show, debuting for Miu Miu in the line's spring/summer 2025 show at Paris' Fashion Week.

Sunday is just starting out in the modeling world. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that ran in December 2024, Kidman reacted to her daughter's runway debut.

""That's all driven by her,"" Kidman told the outlet when asked what it was like to watch her daughter walk in her first show. ""Me going, 'Oh no, I don't think so.' But Miuccia [Prada] just loved her and was like, 'No, I want her.' And Miuccia is so powerful as a woman. So that was a good match. I sat with Miuccia recently in Italy and said, 'My gosh, I've known you since I was about 23.' I've been in this industry for a while,"" she explained.

A post shared by instagram

Kidman went on to recall her early days in the industry and how she was helped early on in her career by female executive Sherry Lansing who really believed in her.

""Sherry Lansing is pretty much the first female executive I met when I came to America. She was right there at Paramount, and she was so powerful. She was a nurturer. She gave me so much attention and space and belief,"" Kidman said.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=entertainment+news,Is Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) A Risky Investment?,https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-czr/caesars-entertainment/news/is-caesars-entertainment-nasdaqczr-a-risky-investment-1,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 13:18:45 GMT","













Stock Analysis

 The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company.  As with many other companies Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) makes use of debt.  But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? 

 Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price.  In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. 

 Check out our latest analysis for Caesars Entertainment 

 As you can see below, Caesars Entertainment had US$12.1b of debt, at December 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail.    On the flip side, it has US$866.0m in cash leading to net debt of about US$11.3b.  

 Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Caesars Entertainment had liabilities of US$2.27b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$25.9b due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$866.0m in cash and US$470.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities total US$26.9b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  

 This deficit casts a shadow over the US$6.13b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals.   So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt.  At the end of the day, Caesars Entertainment would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.  

 We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). 

 While Caesars Entertainment's debt to EBITDA ratio (3.1) suggests that it uses some debt, its interest cover is very weak, at 0.96, suggesting high leverage.  It seems clear that the cost of borrowing money is negatively impacting returns for shareholders, of late.        Another concern for investors might be that Caesars Entertainment's EBIT fell 11% in the last year.   If that's the way things keep going handling the debt load will be like delivering hot coffees on a pogo stick.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Caesars Entertainment's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.  

 Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow.    In the last three years, Caesars Entertainment created free cash flow amounting to 4.3% of its EBIT, an uninspiring performance.  That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.   

 On the face of it, Caesars Entertainment's interest cover left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year.    And even its EBIT growth rate fails to inspire much confidence.      Taking into account all the aforementioned factors, it looks like Caesars Entertainment has too much debt.  That sort of riskiness is ok for some, but it certainly doesn't float our boat.      Given the risks around Caesars Entertainment's use of debt, the sensible thing to do is to  check if insiders have been unloading the stock. 

 When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.

Alec Baldwin has upset some fans after making a comment on his family's new reality show that isn't sitting right with some people.

The Baldwins have been living their best lives in a $16 million penthouse, but there's one problem that the Married to the Mob star pointed out on a recent episode of The Baldwins. ""We know it's too small,"" he said, according to Curbed.

Per the outlet, Baldwin, 66, purchased the 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom home in 2011, and has done a number of renovations to it. In 2012, for example, Baldwin's wife Hilaria dropped some $1.2 million on an apartment next door, allowing the couple to expand the home to a whopping 6,000 square feet of living space.

However, with seven kids — Carmen, 11, Rafael, 9, Leonardo, 8, Romeo, 6, Eduardo and Marilu, 4, and Ilaria, 2 — four dogs and four cats, the home just isn't quite large enough, says Baldwin.

The remark got quite the reaction from social media users, many of whom chastised Baldwin online. A post was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Trending Politics co-owner Collin Rugg, which opened the floor to some dialogue.

""We lived in a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, 4,650 sq foot home with eight kids. His problem is they are in an apartment. Our kids shared bedrooms. We had three acres and down a path was a creek where the kids played all the time. He chose to live there,"" one person wrote.

""Poor guy! Wish he could afford more,"" someone else said.

""Ah, the struggle is real, don't you see? Poor Alec Baldwin, forced to endure life in a mere 6,000-square-foot luxury fortress in one of the most expensive cities on Earth. How does he manage? The injustice! The suffering,"" a third comment read.

""Oh no how do they even survive,"" a fourth X user added.

The Baldwins airs on Sunday nights on TLC.

""Halfway to holding you in our arms,"" Duggar Seewald captioned an Instagram post on Friday, March 7. She included a picture of a recent sonogram.

Many fans took to the comments section of the post with congratulatory messages straight away. Quite a few people were surprised that the Seewalds are growing their family once again.

""Thats surprising, I thought your last boy was going to be your last but congrats anyway,"" one person wrote.

""I didn't even know you were expecting! Congratulations! I knew Jinger was pregnant,"" someone else added.

""Oh my gosh, I didn't even know you were pregnant again,"" a third fan said.

""Another baby I didn't even know,"" a fourth comment read.

In February 2021, Duggar Seewald shared that she'd lost a baby the year prior.

""After the heartbreaking loss of a baby last year, we're overjoyed to share that another little Seewald is on the way! The pregnancy is going smoothly, and both baby and Jessa are doing well. We are so grateful to God for the precious gift of a new life! The kids are delighted, and we can hardly wait to welcome this little one into our arms this summer,"" the Seewalds told Entertainment Tonight in a statement.

In 2022, Duggar Seewald announced that she had suffered a miscarriage.

""As soon as she started taking a look at the baby, I could tell there was some concern in her voice,"" she recalled of the ultrasound technician. ""She said, 'The sack looks good. The baby does not.'""

""Nothing could have prepared me for the weight of those words in that moment. At that moment I was just in complete shock. I didn't have words. I just immediately started crying,"" she added.

Bravo star Brandi Glanville has been suffering with a mysterious health issue that has caused major disfigurement to her face.

""I've been faking it. I'm [expletive] miserable,"" Glanville wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, March 6.

""My face is worse than ever. It's literally melted away. When drs at cedars put me on IV antibiotics & fungal medication I was getting better. I looked normal but I couldn't afford to stay on them. I was forced to see drs outside my insurance because the drs at Kaiser had no clue. I need my life to change. That is my real life health update,"" she added.

The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star has been to a few different doctors and has tried various treatments, but nothing has worked.

""Honestly, I have so many doctors and I've had so many tests. I did lab work for $10,000,"" Glanville told Entertainment Tonight in December 2024. ""They ran every test under the sun. They're like, 'It could be a parasite that's new.'""

""I've been on meds this whole year. I don't socialize. I don't go out and I'm just spending all of my money on trying to figure out what's wrong with me,"" she continued.

Glanville, who has two sons with ex-husband Eddie Cibrian, isn't quite sure what's going on with her face, which has completely changed over the course of eight months. When she first started noticing the issues, she thought she had a parasite.

A post shared by instagram

""We had food sitting out for hours on end and some of it was meat. Six months after I got back from Morocco, I started having this speaking thing and the swelling up thing. It started in July and we're still here trying to figure it out,"" she previously told ET.

Despite not feeling her best, Glanville shared some big news with her fans: She's recording new music.

""Surprise! I'm back in the studio recording something reeeeealy cool w @weareripyouth ""remedy"" ft you'rs truly and @hi_im_beks coming soon via @radikalrecords - AND were shooting the video this weekend - you're going to LOVE,"" she captioned an Instagram post on Wednesday, March 5.

Machine Gun Kelly is mourning the loss of his friend, Luke ""The Dingo"" Trembath, who died at the age of 38.

On Friday, March 7, MGK, whose real name is Colson Baker, posted a lengthy tribute to the snowboarder.

""Crazy...I didn't even cry this hard when my dad died,"" MGK wrote on Instagram. ""I've lost a lot of friends, but I've never lost a brother. We'll never get another Dingo on this planet. A true rockstar without ever needing to make a song, the most loyal, loud, charismatic, funny, and annoying human I've ever had the honor of knowing.""

Trembath's death was confirmed by Monster Energy, a company who had sponsored him, on Friday, February 28.

""His unparalleled passion and energy were infectious, lighting up everything he touched. We'll forever remember his iconic laugh, his love for racing suits, and his genuine ability to connect with everyone he met. Here's to you Dingo, you'll be deeply missed and forever remembered,"" read a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Trembath's cause of death has not been revealed.

MGK's Instagram post comes as he awaits the arrival of his child with his ex-fiancee, Megan Fox. He made mention of the baby in his Instagram tribute.

""I feel like your [sic] up there with my new child, dressed up in a hilarious costume making them laugh, getting ready to send them down. I couldn't ask for a more bittersweet birth blessing,"" MGK wrote.

A post shared by instagram

TMZ previously reported that Fox's due date is this month. The actress shares three sons, Noah, 12, Bodhi, 11, and Journey, 8, with ex-husband Brian Austin Green. Meanwhile, MGK is a father of one daughter, Casie, whom he welcomed in 2009 with his ex-girlfriend Emma Cannon.

Fox and MGK split in November 2024. Per TMZ, the two ended things over Thanksgiving weekend.

The Indian cricket team is just one step away from clinching the Champions Trophy, with the highly anticipated final match against New Zealand scheduled for tomorrow. In the lead-up to this crucial match, bowler Mohammed Shami has been making headlines. Recently, some Maulanas had criticized Shami for not fasting during Ramadan, which sparked significant backlash. Now, renowned lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar has stepped in to defend Shami, addressing the controversy and condemning the narrow-minded critics.

The controversy began when, during the semi-final match between India and Australia, Mohammed Shami was seen drinking water on the field. This moment quickly went viral, and some people on social media began criticizing Shami for not observing the fast during the holy month of Ramadan. This criticism was not limited to fans and social media users; a few Maulanas also weighed in, deeming Shami's actions inappropriate. The debate escalated into discussions about whether it was essential for Shami to fast during a high-intensity cricket match. Some critics even suggested that he should fast regardless of his professional commitments.

However, Javed Akhtar was quick to defend Shami, expressing his anger at the narrow-minded individuals who were questioning Shami's actions.

Akhtar shared a post on social media, stating, ""Shami saheb, don’t give a damn to those reactionary bigoted idiots who have any problem with your drinking water in a burning afternoon at a cricket field in Dubai. It is none of their business. You are one of the great Indian team players who are making us all proud. My best wishes to you and the whole team for the final.""



Javed Akhtar wasn't the only one defending Shami. Former cricketer Harbhajan Singh also came to Shami's rescue, emphasizing that it was not necessary to fast during matches. Harbhajan, while discussing the situation, stated, ""You are sitting at home, so it is easy for you to comment. But in my personal opinion, sports should be seen beyond religion. This is about the country, and here, we focus on our goal.""

The support for Shami from celebrities and former cricketers has highlighted the need to separate religious practices from professional commitments, especially during high-profile international events like the Champions Trophy. As the Indian team gears up for the final, it is clear that the focus is on the game and the collective pride of representing the country on the global stage.

In a recent development, Kannada actress Ranya Rao was arrested for her involvement in a gold smuggling operation after she was caught red-handed attempting to smuggle 14 kilograms of gold. During police interrogation, Ranya made several crucial revelations, including details about an international syndicate of women involved in gold smuggling.

Ranya confessed that she was a part of this smuggling network, which operates across borders and involves multiple women. This group is believed to be operating on an international scale, with some public servants also allegedly linked to the syndicate. The police are now on the lookout for other members involved in this illicit activity.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had previously acted on a tip-off, leading to Ranya’s arrest as she was returning from Dubai. During a subsequent search at her residence, law enforcement officials seized millions of rupees worth of jewelry. Following Ranya's statements, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now taken charge of the case. They are closely investigating the syndicate’s operations and are working to uncover other members involved in the international gold smuggling network.

Ranya Rao, a former Kannada film actress, has starred in several movies. Recently, her name has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Interestingly, Ranya's father is an IPS officer, though not her biological father, but a step-parent. This connection has only added to the complexity of the case, as Ranya now faces severe legal scrutiny.

Currently under police custody, Ranya is being interrogated to uncover further details about the smuggling ring. The CBI is intensifying its efforts to expose the full extent of this international women-led gold smuggling syndicate. Updates on the investigation are expected soon, as authorities continue to make headway in this high-profile case.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,'Tennis death awaits Novak Djokovic,https://www.tennis365.com/news/novak-djokovic-warned-tennis-death-awaits-recent-struggles,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 10:58:15 GMT","

Novak Djokovic has been warned that he cannot “cheat time” and avoid his “tennis death” by former ATP Tour star Dmitry Tursunov.

Djokovic has so far faced a mixed 2025 season, beating Carlos Alcaraz in a memorable Australian Open quarter-final victory before retiring injured against Alexander Zverev in the last four.

That was the fifth straight Grand Slam tournament not won by Djokovic, and 2024 proved to be the first season since 2017 that the Serbian did not lift at least one major title.

The Serbian was then beaten 7-6(4), 6-2 by Matteo Berrettini at the Qatar Open last month – his first, and to date only, match since his Australian Open exit.

Dealing with injury issues has proven a significant challenge for Djokovic over the past year, and things are unlikely to get any easier for the 24-time Grand Slam champion, with his 38th birthday looming in May.

Now, the former world No 1 has been warned that the end of his career could be coming sooner rather than later.

Speaking to SportKlub, former world No 20 Tursunov – a past coach of Emma Raducanu and Aryna Sabalenka, among others – claimed that Djokovic’s toughest “opponent” was now his body.

“His own body is now his greatest opponent,” said Tursunov. “No matter how he plans to cheat time, ‘tennis death’ will await him.

“Of course, he still has the motivation to play at the highest level, but in tennis, you lose the feeling of immortality much faster than in other sports. Previous achievements are quickly forgotten.”

Djokovic starts his Indian Wells campaign on Saturday against Botic van de Zandschulp, who progressed to round two after Nick Kyrgios retired injured in their opening-round match.

Van de Zandschulp famously defeated Alcaraz at the US Open in 2024, though Djokovic is still a significant favourite to win their second-round contest in the desert.

However, Tursunov believes the 37-year-old could struggle should he go on to face world No 3 and second seed Alcaraz in their projected quarter-final.

Djokovic defeated the Spaniard in their last two meetings, at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and 2025 Australian Open – though Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion in Indian Wells.

Tursunov added: “Djokovic is in a very difficult situation; his chances are slim if he faces Carlos Alcaraz.”

World No 7 Djokovic is the sixth seed in Indian Wells and is one of the most successful players in the tournament’s history, with a joint-record five men’s singles titles to his name.

However, the Serbian has not won the title since 2016 and did not play in the tournament between 2019 and 2024.

On his return last year, Djokovic defeated Aleksandar Vukic in his opening match before a shock loss to lucky loser Luca Nardi in the third round.

Alexander Zverev’s hopes of becoming the men’s world No. 1 suffered a blow on Friday as he crashed out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells in the second round following a shock defeat to Tallon Griekspoor.
    


            Zverev began the tournament as the top seed, in the absence of world No. 1 Jannik Sinner who is serving a three-month ban after testing positive for a banned substance, and he had a golden opportunity to close the gap to the Italian player in the ATP world rankings.
    


            But, despite winning the first set against Griekspoor, the world No. 2 eventually succumbed to a 4-6, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4) defeat in his opening game at the tournament.
    


            The possibility of becoming world No. 1 was on Zverev’s mind “in the beginning,” he told reporters after the game. “Now it’s less because I’m just playing terrible.”
    


            “I can sit here and have excuses but at the end of the day, I’m just not playing good tennis at the moment. It’s as simple as that,” the 27-year-old German said.
    


            After he won the first set, Zverev slumped to a 5-2 deficit in the second, then mounted a comeback to lead 6-5 but he conceded a break at the crucial moment and failed to serve out the match.
    


            Griekspoor pounced in the tiebreak, winning the set and gaining a foothold in the match when Zverev hit a routine forehand long.
    


            The match remained evenly poised during the third set until Griekspoor broke Zverev in the 11th game and had an opportunity to serve for the win at 6-5, but he let a remarkable 15-minute long game slip away from him as he failed to convert five match points.
    


            In the end, that was no matter for the world No. 43 who recovered in the tiebreak to seal the win on his sixth match point, falling to his knees immediately afterwards to celebrate one of the biggest wins in his career so far.
    


            “It was such a mental thing. I lost to (Zverev) five times last year and had absolute heartbreak at Roland Garros where I was up a double break in the fifth,” Griekspoor told reporters afterwards, per the ATP Tour.
    


            “I played so many battles against him and had chances but they all went his way. I am incredibly proud of myself from this performance and to get it over the line.”
    


            Elsewhere in the tournament, No. 4 seed Casper Ruud also succumbed to a shock defeat against the USA’s Marcos Giron.

The 22-year-old American player, ranked at a career-high of No. 12 in the world, is charming tennis and non-tennis fans alike

 Ben Shelton sees it all.


 Since his breakout performance at the 2023 US Open, where he became the youngest American man to make the semifinal since 1992, the 22-year-old tennis phenom has only attracted more eyes to his game. In the digital age, growing popularity translates to more Instagram followers — 853,000 for Shelton — and dreamy TikTok montages of him. 


 In short clips that have reached upward of four million views and 600,000 likes on TikTok, users are fawning over the rising star’s good looks and passionate on-court personality. He’s even picked up the attention of non-tennis fans. Under a 20-second video set to NLE Choppa’s “Self Esteem,” the top-liked comment said, “I should start watching tennis.”

 When asked if he’s seen the edits, Shelton tells PEOPLE ahead of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, “It’s hard not to see that.”


 He continues, “They are outrageous. Some of the people, the comments and the captions, they got issues. It’s pretty funny for me.”


 While the edits have popped up on his TikTok For You page, he and his friends also have an “ongoing joke” in which they send over videos to poke fun at him.

 His fellow players have noticed the hype. The hosts of tennis podcast Nothing Major, retired American tennis stars John Isner, Sam Querrey, Jack Sock and Steve Johnson, included Shelton in their men’s tennis “hottie” bracket. 


 In a 16-man fan-voted tournament of the sport’s sexiest heartthrobs, Shelton progressed to the second round, encountering eventual winner Matteo Berrettini. Then, he personally withdrew.


 “I didn't want no smoke with [Matteo],” he explains. “No, I think that all those guys in that draw are way better looking at me, so I'm not really sure why they picked me.”


 Lintao Zhang/Getty

 At the 2025 Australian Open, Shelton became the youngest American since Andy Roddick to reach the semifinal, losing to eventual champion and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. 


 During his quarterfinal press conference, the athlete made headlines for speaking out about the Australian media’s “disrespectful” treatment of players. 


 “[It’s] something I noticed at a few different tournaments with different people, the way that athletes got treated or talked about,” he says. “I thought that it was disrespectful at times, and that was something that I thought needed to be addressed. … I thought it was really poor in Australia this year.”


 Shelton kicks off his Indian Wells campaign on Saturday, March 8.

Old Dominion women’s tennis opened Sun Belt Conference play with a 5-2 win over App. State on Saturday afternoon.

NORFOLK, Va. – Old Dominion women’s tennis opened Sun Belt Conference play with a 5-2 win over App. State on Saturday afternoon.

No. 3 Marina Markina and Kira Matushkina opened doubles play for ODU with a win over Alexi Cleveland and Riley Collins (6-3), and while App. State’s Olwyn Ryan-Bovey and Maledi Manyube would down No.1 Sofia Johnson and Lidiia Rasskouskaia (6-4), No. 2 Ulyana Romanova and Victoria Matasova defeated Ruby Broadbent and Savannah Dada-Mascoll (7-5) to put the Monarchs on the board.

DAYTONA BEACH — After one year apart, both Five Star Conference tennis trophies went home with Spruce Creek Friday.

The Hawks swept the girls tournament for the third straight year, not dropping a single match at the Florida Tennis Center, and they snatched the boys crown back from Flagler Palm Coast after the Bulldogs earned it last season. 

“Obviously, the girls, a clear favorite, but they handled their business like they always do,” coach Jeremy Davies said. “Boys, I think it's a really good point for us in the season to play a tougher Flagler team than we did 10 days ago (due to injuries for the Bulldogs) and still win five of the seven finals. I thought that says a lot about our boys and their fight and their competitive nature. I think the outlook is really good moving forward.”

In the boys finals, Zane Ensminger (No. 1) , Raimey Miral (No. 2), Jenson Nord (No. 3) and Indigo Stout (No. 5) captured singles titles for Spruce Creek. Ensminger and Miral also won at No. 1 doubles.

“We just have a great group of guys who have been wanting this, especially after last year's tough loss to FPC,” Nord said. “We got to come back here and kind of beat them one more time. I know that made a lot of our guys very happy, very proud. We'll be able to enjoy this one.”

Despite missing its No. 1 singles standout, Andrew Shkotkin, because of an injury, Flagler Palm Coast finished as the boys runner-up. It met the Hawks in all seven of the finals and locked down two. Aaron Lieberman won at Line 4, and Alex Berenblit and Joshua Thorpe triumphed in No. 2 doubles.

In the girls finals, Spruce Creek faced opponents from Flagler Palm Coast, Seabreeze and New Smyrna Beach. 

Giselle Adekunle and Kayla Wheeler repeated as Five Star champions at Lines 1 and 2. As a freshman, Khloe Akopian claimed her first tournament title in No. 3 singles. And competing one slot higher than usual, seniors Campbell Bundza and Anna Upchuch prevailed at Lines 4 and 5.

“I’m really thankful we have such a great team,” Upchurch said. “Everyone on the team is super close, so we all cheer each other on and hope for the best for each other.”

Adekunle and Wheeler won the No. 1 doubles championship, and Akopian and Bundza did the same in No. 2 doubles.

“It’s exciting to play it again after not playing for a couple years,” said Bundza, who usually competes only in singles at Line 5. “I only played my first doubles with Anna my freshman year.”

New Smyrna Beach came in second in the girls standings. Following a district championship last year, the Barracudas advanced to the Five Star finals in all but No. 1 and No. 4 singles.

Seabreeze placed third on the boys and girls leaderboards.","{'href': 'https://www.news-journalonline.com', 'title': 'Daytona Beach News-Journal'}"

It was an impressive start to the season for the Hancock County boy’s tennis team, earning back-to-back 5-0 wins against Cloverport and Union County. In the season opener on Thursday, the duo of Lucas Anderson and Tyce Boling set the tone for the rest of the match. 

The Lady Hornets also won their opener against Cloverport 4-0, behind Ella Chappell and Kylie Bowlds winning their respective matches 8-2 and 8-1.

“It was a good start to the season,” Hancock County head coach Dan Hopkins said after the match. “They were a bit tight and everyone struggled with their serves. Ella was the start today.”

Yesterday against Union County, Anderson and Van Reska won their respective singles matches, while everything else was a forfeit. 

For the Lady Hornets, they lost a tight one 2-3. Chappell improved to 2-0 in singles and their top doubles team of Audree Morris and Bowlds emerged victorious.

“We’re feeling more comfortable with each match, especially serve and ground strokes,” Hopkins said. “They have been a little tight which is to be expected, but the schedule gets harder next week. Hopefully we will be more comfortable after the first two matches. I am happy Lucas and Ella have both started off 2-0.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Breakdown of Iga Swiatek's bagels by tennis category: Most have come at Grand Slam level,https://www.tennis365.com/facts-stats/iga-swiateks-6-0-scores-broken-down-by-tennis-category-wta-1000-level-no-2,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 16:27:19 GMT","

Iga Swiatek notched up yet another 6-0 set during her opening match of the Indian Wells Open and she now has 101 bagels in her short career at all levels.

The five-time Grand Slam winner rolled over former world No 4 Caroline Garcia, scoring a 6-2, 6-0 victory to set up a second-round clash against Dayana Yastremska.

That second-set 6-0 win was the Pole’s 28th at WTA 1000 level while she is now on seven bagels for the 2025 season and we are only in month three.

Asked after the match about her ability to produce one-sided sets, Swiatek said: “I mean, there are many reasons. I don’t know. It’s just, you know, that I’m solid no matter what the score is, and I don’t take, you know, next games for granted.

“If I’m leading even 4-0, I know that I should keep playing the same way and keep the same attitude to just win the match.

“But for sure, you know, the matches that I lose are usually much tighter, which means that it’s harder to win against me, I guess. But it doesn’t matter.

“I’m going to have matches, you know, that are huge battles and easy matches, but you can never expect and you can never just, I don’t know, try to predict. Doesn’t make sense.”

Swiatek has won five top-level matches 6-0, 6-0 and two at ITF level.

The world No 2 has played 107 Grand Slam singles matches and in 27 of those matches she won a set 6-0. If you are wondering about the “missing” two bagels, she won two matches 6-0, 6-0 with both of them coming on the clay at Roland Garros.

In total she has 14 bagels at the French Open, seven at the US Open, five at the Australian Open and three at Wimbledon.

The season-ending tournament is the most coveted trophy to lift on the WTA Tour after the Grand Slams and Swiatek won the title in Cancun 2023.

Unsurprisingly, that was the year she won three sets 6-0 with Marketa Vondrousova, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula on the receiving end.

She also scored one bagel in 2022 and one in 2024.

Iga Swiatek fires Indian Wells warning shot after emphatic start to title defence

Prize money and points on offer for Alcaraz, Djokovic, Sabalenka, Swiatek, Gauff at Indian Wells

Following her second-round win at Indian Wells, Swiatek is now 103–23 in terms of win-loss rate at WTA 1000 events with 10 titles and in 28 of those matches she notched up a 6-0 set.

Her first-ever 6-0, 6-0 win at WTA 1000 level came at the Italian Open in 2021 when she demolished former world No 1 Karolina Pliskova while she beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova by the same scoreline in the 2023 tournament.

But Indian Wells is her best tournament for bagels as she has dished out eight.

The 23-year-old has some 6-0 sets in Doha (before it became a permanent WTA 1000 event), San Diego and Bad Homberg, but she plays a lot more WTA 1000 events than 500 tournaments.

This tally is spread across Budapest, Lugano, Prague and Warsaw.

Team events include the United Cup and Billie Jean King Cup and she has won two sets by a 6-0 scoreline in the former category and four in the latter. In 2022 she beat Andreea Prisacariu 6-0, 6-0 in a Billie Jean King Cup qualifier.

The International Tennis Federation-organised events are a level below WTA tournaments and are used by young players to get accustomed to the professional game.

Swiatek claimed a couple of 6-0, 6-0 wins as a 17-year-old at the ITF Jackson tournament in 2018 while she also claimed bagels in ITF tournaments in Bergamo, Pelham, Charlottesville and Budapest while still a rising star.


                Swiatek dropped just two games as she started her Indian Wells title defence in style.             


                Besides being treated like royalty at the Tennis Paradise, players also earn top dollar for their efforts over the fortnight.            


                ""I love these tournaments, and I already proved myself that physically I can handle it.""

By Chris Oddo | @TheFanChild  | Saturday March 9, 2025

Indian Wells, California – Taylor Fritz wants to be a part of the groundswell that is happening around American men’s tennis. And he believes there is still much work to be done.



There are currently 10 Americans inside the ATP’s Top 10, but Fritz is the only one with a Grand Slam final and a Masters 1000 title to his name.

“I think it's great that we are kind of building the tennis,” he said earlier this week at Indian Wells. “We can help build the tennis culture in the U.S. I think that's something that I wanted to contribute to help my whole career. I think the women have been doing an incredible job of that for a long, long time, and I think the guys kind of need to step it up a little bit.

Fritz, who won the BNP Paribas Open title in 2022, will face Matteo Gigante of Italy in the second round on Saturday at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.

The 27-year-old says that an American man needs to win a major - something that has become commonplace for the American women - even without Serena Williams in the mix - title to really put a charge into the movement.

“I think it's going to take one of us winning a slam to really get that spike of young fans on the men's side of things,” he said. “I mean, it's great what we're currently doing. We have a great group. Like I said, the women have been carrying for a very, very long time.” How to Make Tennis Tournaments Fun

When it comes to attracting new fans, Fritz says the sport should be paying attention to the Australian Open playbook. Build an event around the tennis, so that less nuanced fans can have options that go beyond the tennis. In short, make it fun.

“I think the sport needs to evolve. I think it is evolving,” Fritz said. “I think that needs to get the younger audience a bit, but I think that's more like the tournaments making tournaments more just like a fun thing, even if you don't understand tennis.

“I think something like Australian Open does a great job of that. People just go there to have a great time. It's not necessarily so much about the tennis. You watch the tennis but there are a million of things to do while you're there.

“I think it's almost more like a social event. Those kinds of events are great for young fans to go and understand how much fun they can have at a tennis event and how much fun it is. And watching tennis live as well is a lot different too. I think you can start to appreciate it more.”

The 24-time Grand Slam winner retired from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev with a hamstring issue in January and then lost in the first round of the Qatar Open.

Djokovic - who could face Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals - has been joined by coach Andy Murray, with the partnership set to continue ""indefinitely"".

Jannik Sinner will miss Indian Wells after accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Alcaraz is the two-time reigning Indian Wells champion, having downed Daniil Medvedev in the final of the last two editions.

Iga Swiatek is the reigning women's champion, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Australian Open winner Madison Keys will aim to topple the Pole.

""The 'sunshine double' of Indian Wells and Miami is very tough for any player to pull off because it's totally opposite conditions - even though it's two hard-court tournaments,"" said former British No 1 Laura Robson.

""It's a really long stint - both events are 12 days - and it's just a massive change conditions-wise, to go from one to the other as Miami is so hot and humid, compared to being in the desert of Palm Springs.

""Indian Wells, in particular, I always struggled at because it's much slower than you think. It doesn't always favour the Brits, who in general prefer slightly faster conditions and a pacier hard court that plays more lively, because you get a bit more out of your shots.""

Expect a star-studded field on and off the court, with film stars including Zendaya, Tom Holland, Charlize Theron, Yvonne Orji, Ben Stiller and singer Gwen Stefani likely to be in attendance.

Stiller became the unwitting support act when Nick Kyrgios clashed with a fan at the event in 2022.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Carlos Alcaraz has a big flaw,https://www.tennis365.com/atp-tour/carlos-alcaraz-mcenroe-novak-djokovic-most-popular,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 17:42:19 GMT","

Patrick McEnroe has hailed Carlos Alcaraz as the shining star of men’s tennis, but he believes he has a wild side to his game that may need to be tamed.

McEnroe, who reached a career high ranking of No 28 and is the younger brother of Grand Slam legend John McEnroe, believes four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz may learn to dilute the fiery side of his game that occasionally costs him in the heat of battle on court.

At the age of 21, Alcaraz has already won two Wimbledon titles, as well as lifting the French Open and US Open titles, but he had a rawness to his game that is natural for a player of his tender years.

His defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp at last year’s US Open and his loss against Novak Djokovic a the Australian Open in January were examples of Alcaraz’s frustration getting the better of him, with McEnroe assessing how the youngster could improve his game as he spoke to Tennis365 in his role as joint-President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

“Alcaraz is electric and he is electrifying when he gets on a court and the only issue would be that he has, at times, hit his way out of a match by going for too much,” McEnroe told Tennis365 in an exclusive interview.

“He is so fun to watch because he can hit every shot, but that talent can hurt him when he is not having his best day.

“We have seen it a few times and last year’s US Open comes to mind as being a moment when he didn’t have answers when he was not hitting the winners he expects.

“That was the case against Djokovic at the Australian Open as well. He was clearly unnerved by Djokovic appearing to be injured and then getting back up and playing at such a high level again by the end.

“So he may need to reel it in sometimes because we can all see what he is capable of and he has shown that by winning four Grand Slams at the age of 21.

“If he does reel it in, then he might become more effective and consistent, but he may not be as much fun to watch. We all like to watch him and let’s not forget what he has already achieved.

“He has won four majors on all the different surfaces in tennis so I would not want to nitpick his game too much.”

McEnroe went on to suggest Alcaraz is in a league of his own in the popularity stakes among tennis fans, as he continues to steal the headlines away from world No 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam king Djokovic.

“He’s the most popular player in tennis right now. He’s not the world No 1, but he is an attraction and people want to see him,” he added.

“The way he plays the game, people look at him and say ‘wow’, I didn’t even know that shot was possible. People love to watch Alcaraz and we are lucky to have him in our sport.”

The International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) officially opened its Letters to Greatness booth at an event hosted by ITHF Presidents, Patrick McEnroe and Kim Clijsters.

McEnroe and Clijsters were joined by ITHF CEO, Dan Faber and upcoming 2025 Inductees, Bob and Mike Bryan, to kick off the event by recording their own Letters to Greatness – congratulatory messages to Maria Sharapova and the Bryan Brothers ahead of their formal induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this summer.

The Letters to Greatness booth will remain open throughout the remainder of the BNP Paribas Open, where tennis fans will have the chance to record or pen their own personal messages to the Class of 2025.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Danielle Collins launches her first line of tennis merchandise: “Play tennis. Cash checks. Repeat.”,https://en.as.com/other_sports/danielle-collins-launches-her-first-line-of-tennis-merchandise-play-tennis-cash-checks-repeat-n/,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 19:26:16 GMT","

The American tennis star has launched her own line of merchandise.

Danielle Collins continues to make headlines after her outspoken comments regarding the financial side of the sport. 

The American star’s staff were spotted at Indian Wells wearing what was later confirmed to be a new line of merchandise released by Collins.

During the match against compatriot Hailey Baptiste, members of Collins' entourage could be seen in bright orange t-shirts with the slogan ‘Play tennis. Cash checks. Repeat.’ on them.

This stunt comes after Collins' much-publicised comments on the modern world of sport, where she stated that her fans’ support had funded her upcoming “five-star vacation” thanks to the “big fat paycheck” she was to receive.

The world number 14 has since been quoted by tennis.com as saying, “I obviously made some bold statements and got a lot of conversation going around women’s tennis and just women being able to talk about money… For years, I’ve had so many fans reach out to me, saying, ‘Danielle, when are you going to do a merchandise drop? I finally got to thinking about it like, ‘Yeah, let’s f—ing go! We’re doing this, and now’s the time.’” 

In an Instagram post, Collins confirmed that part of proceeds will go to a women’s equity fund; the merchandise can be bought via a link on her social media page.

“Female athletes deal with a whole set of unique challenges that are different from what male athletes deal with,” she added. “That’s not political; that’s just a fact. I don’t think we’re in a society where it’s embraced for us to stick up for ourselves, or wear our hearts on our sleeves, or play with emotions. I still think that it’s frowned upon if we display feelings of being upset, or having a moment of passion on court. I think a lot of those expectations that are placed on us are super unhealthy and unfair.”

As well as the stunt, Collins also revealed that she would be gifting Serbian tennis legend Novak Djokovic some of her products: “We were able to play around with the design choices and messaging to come up with something that was really true to me and my personality. I haven’t seen Novak this tournament (Indian Wells) yet but I will definitely be gifting him some merch.”

A post shared by Danielle Collins (@danimalcollins)

On the controversy, Djokovic recently said that he ""loved her response"", adding that “I loved everything she said on the court and off the court. Big fan of Danielle Collins after that. I was before, but now, big fan. I love it. I don’t think I would be that polite, but then I know exactly the feeling. So, I think she was funny, smart.”

Donald Trump has accused Ukraine of being ""difficult to deal with"" as he attempts to force Kyiv to reach a peace deal with Moscow. The president also said he wants the war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine.

Friday 7 March 2025 23:15, UK

We're pausing our live coverage now after a day of more diplomacy done the Donald Trump way.

Kicking off with an unexpected news conference from the Oval Office - which he still managed to be more than an hour late to - Trump said he finds it easier dealing with Moscow.

It's ""difficult"" with Kyiv, he said, acknowledging his decisions to halt military aid and stop sharing intelligence have caused Russia to ""hit harder"".

But he insists he's determined to agree a peace deal - which he said won't come before security guarantees for Ukraine - and he made a rare public rebuke of Russia, warning he's considering further sanctions.

Meanwhile, he defended his use of tariffs in recent weeks, telling reporters there will always be ""changes and adjustments"" as he tried to explain why they appear to flicker between on again and off again every other day.

And yet, this may have been one of the quieter days in Trump's second term so far - that extraordinary meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy was only a week ago.

If you want more on some of the other big issues in and around his presidency, our US team took your questions in a live Q&A earlier today.

Catch up on that in the link below...

Donald Trump has had a fair bit to say on the Ukraine war again today, telling reporters he finds it more difficult dealing with Kyiv than with Moscow (see our 17:23 post).

That comes as European leaders continue to make plans in a bid to mitigate any impact on Ukraine as much as possible.

Sir Keir Starmer and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron are among those at the forefront of efforts on the continent, and they have spoken today to ""compare notes"" on their work for a lasting peace.

That's according to Downing Street, which said the pair have been leading efforts to form a ""coalition of the willing"" to protect Ukraine.

South Africa won't engage in ""megaphone diplomacy"" after Donald Trump cut all funding for the country.

The president had already signed an executive order to cut all US financial assistance last month, and today he announced all federal funding will now be halted.

Trump - along with ally and billionaire Elon Musk - has been critical of South Africa's land policy and genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.

""To go a step further, any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship,"" Trump wrote in a social media post.

This process will begin immediately, he said.

Spokesperson to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Vincent Magwenya, told Reuters news agency the country is ""not going to partake in a counterproductive megaphone diplomacy"".

For context: White landowners still own three quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, while only 4% is owned by black people.

According to the latest land audit in 2017, that's despite black people making up 80% of the population, while white people account for 8%.

Ramaphosa signed a law in January allowing the state to expropriate land ""in the public interest"", in some cases without compensating the owner, partly in an effort to redress this imbalance.

US assistance to South Africa came in at $323.4m last year, according to government data.

A tetchy exchange to bring you now from the White House.

Ahead of an order on a World Cup task force (see the post below) a reporter from our US partner network NBC News asked Donald Trump about reports of a clash between Elon Musk and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.

It's been said the pair disagreed at a Cabinet meeting over cuts overseen by Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to save hundreds of billions of dollars in the government budget.

Trump was not happy with the question.

""No one clashed, I was there, you're just a troublemaker - and you're not supposed to be asking that question because we're talking about the World Cup,"" he said.

""Elon gets along great with Marco, and they're both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.""

He then asked who the reporter is with, and when he responded ""NBC"" Trump replied: ""Oh, no wonder, that's enough.""

Just before he wrapped up his remarks at the crypto summit a few minutes ago, Donald Trump signed yet another executive order.

Appearing alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, he officially created a task force to prepare for the World Cup next year, which will be held in North America.

The tournament will be hosted across the US, Canada and Mexico, with millions of tourists expected on the continent.

""It's a great honour for our country to have it,"" Trump said of the World Cup, adding he'd like to attend multiple games.

Speaking now at the White House crypto event, Donald Trump says his administration will ""end the federal bureaucracy's war on crypto"".

He adds they will ""pave the way for groundbreaking innovations and institutional finance"".

""And we are ending operation choke point 2.0,"" he says.

Yesterday, he signed an order to form a strategic bitcoin reserve, which officials described as a ""digital Fort Knox for digital gold"".

This order also created a separate stockpile of digital assets.

As we mentioned in a post a little earlier, Donald Trump was expected to speak during the crypto summit at the White House (see 19:54).

He's now up for his second media appearance of the day. Watch in the live stream below, or stay with us for relevant updates.

Russia, according to Donald Trump, is ""bombing the hell out of Ukraine"" - and he acknowledged his pause in intelligence sharing is allowing Moscow to start ""hitting harder"".

As a result of Trump's order, Maxar Technologies, an aerospace company providing satellite imagery, has disabled access for Kyiv.

In a statement, the firm said it has contracts with the US government and dozens of allied nations, and ""each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data"".

""The US government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts in GEGD,"" Maxar said, referring to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery programme, which gives access to satellite imagery collected by the US.

Five words - all beginning with R - explain Donald Trump's view of the world.

That's according to former US deputy national security advisor Matt Pottinger, who spoke to us about the president's thinking - and how it's shaking up the world order.

The elite from the cryptocurrency industry are gathering at the White House to discuss Donald Trump's vision to make the US the ""crypto capital of the world"".

He's expected to speak tonight - we'll bring you the latest if and when he does - and he may well elaborate on an executive order he signed only yesterday.

That order was to form a strategic bitcoin reserve, which officials described as a ""digital Fort Knox for digital gold"".

Fort Knox, for those who aren't aware, is the country's traditional home of a large part of the country's gold reserves.

This order also created a separate stockpile of digital assets, which would address some of the concerns voiced by participants ahead of the summit about the prospect of creating a single multi-coin strategic reserve.

Two sets of rules

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick will be allowed to ""develop budget-neutral strategies for adding to that [bitcoin] reserve"".

Just as gold has been treated as a strategic asset held without worrying about price fluctuations, so too will the administration not worry about short-term movements in the price of bitcoin, according to officials.

But the rules are different for the digital asset stockpile, which will hold positions in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin - and the Treasury may not purchase additional holdings for this stockpile.

 TORONTO — A dozen people were injured in a shooting at an eastern Toronto pub in what police called a reckless act of violence by three men who entered the bar and fired randomly without warning. 

 Superintendent Paul MacIntyre of the Toronto Police Service said that authorities received numerous emergency calls reporting a shooting at the Piper Arms around 10:40 p.m. Friday. 

 A preliminary investigation determined that three males entered the pub and began shooting at customers, MacIntyre said during a news conference at the scene. There were no immediate arrests. 

 “One male was armed with what appears to be an assault rifle, the other two males were armed with handguns, and they walked into the bar, they produced their guns and they opened fire indiscriminately on the people sitting inside,” MacIntyre said, adding that there were no fatalities. 

 Police arrived at the scene and found 12 people suffering from various injuries. The victims were transported to local hospitals and six were confirmed to have gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening, MacIntyre said, calling the victims “extremely lucky.” The remaining six victims were hurt by flying and broken glass. 

 The motive wasn't immediately clear, MacIntyre said, calling the shooting “a brazen and reckless act of violence that’s really shaken our community and the city itself.” 

 MacIntyre said that he and other officers were “horrified” by what they saw on a security video. 

 “These guys just looked at the ground and opened fire,"" he said. 

 Shortly after the shooting, police said that a suspect wearing a black balaclava was seen fleeing in a silver car and was still at large after the shooting. People were being warned to stay away from the area. 

 Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said she had spoken to Police Chief Myron Demkiw and was told “all necessary resources” had been deployed. 

 “It is troubling because of the magnitude of the shootings and the number of people hurt, and I don’t want to speculate as to the why and how,” Chow told reporters Saturday morning at a news conference.

The Disney execs talk to THR after a cameo-packed panel at SXSW Saturday that included appearances from the 'Iron Man' actor, Marvel's Kevin Feige, Pixar's Pete Docter, Jon Favreau and more.



		By Alex Weprin, Mia Galuppo 

	March 8, 2025 11:33am	




	Robert Downey Jr. isn’t quite done with Tony Stark just yet.


	The actor hung up the Iron Man superhero suit in Avengers: Endgame, and he is poised to return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the evil Dr. Doom for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.



	But first, there’s a theme park ride to launch.


	At D23 last year, Disney announced that the actor would reprise his role as Tony Stark for a new ride coming to Avengers Campus in Disneyland: Stark Flight Lab. On Saturday, Downey Jr. surprised a crowd of nearly 2,000 in Austin, Texas to preview a pair of upcoming Marvel-themed rides coming to Avengers Campus in Disneyland. And yes, he will be reprising his role as Tony Stark.

	“It’s been 17 years of being associated of an iconic superhero, but it is the message he represents that I am grateful for,” Downey Jr. told the crowd. “Tony opened my eyes wider to the power technology has to impact the world for good and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my days.”

	Downey Jr. was the surprise guest at the Disney panel at SXSW Saturday, fronted by Disney Experiences chairman Josh D’Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. The pair of execs were joined in cameo appearances by a veritable who’s who of Disney A-listers, including Marvel’s Kevin Feige, Pixar’s Pete Docter, The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau, andDisney Imagineering chief Bruce Vaughn.


	The purpose? To demonstrate Disney’s prowess at taking characters from the screen and bringing them to life at the company’s theme parks and experiences around the world. 


	“For us, it all starts with great storytelling, and that’s beginning, the middle and the end for us with each of our brands,” says Bergman in a joint interview alongside D’Amaro with The Hollywood Reporter, conducted ahead of the panel. “And we’re fortunate because obviously we have Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucasfilm and Avatar. So we’re also able to, with great stories, build great worlds.”


	“This goes back to Walt when he envisioned what this company ultimately was going to be,” says D’Amaro. “He had storytelling and content in the middle and all of these businesses surrounding it, such that we could stay with the consumer, wherever they were, literally in the world.”

	











	Bergman and D’Amaro each play a pivotal role on Disney’s IP flywheel. The Disney film studios, which Bergman oversees, develop the characters and franchises and build the worlds. D’Amaro’s team, which includes Disney Imagineering, turns those characters and worlds into real tangible experiences building the emotional connection to Disney that helps define the company.


	At the SXSW panel, the creatives (along with a few BDX droids, the Mandalorian and Grogu from Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge) joined the chairmen on stage to explain how they work to take the characters they create for the screen and develop them for Disney’s experiences, be it a theme park land or attraction, or a cruise ship spinoff.


	“Our filmmakers like Kevin Feige or Pete Docter, they’re huge, huge parks fans as well,” Bergman says. “So as they are developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe and what it has in it, or our animated titles, whether it be Pixar or Disney, Frozen and Zootopia: As they’re envisioning their films, they get the story, and then they’re able to expand the world. It’s a great extension of what we do.”


	“Before even a movie is hatched, sometimes we’re having discussions about, can you imagine what this could be? And of course, then the rest of the team is going to take the lead on that,” D’Amaro adds. “From a parks and experiences standpoint, Alan and his team invite us in very early in the process, sometimes before there’s even a script. So the Imagineers will be talking to a Pete, talking to a Kevin on imagining what these spaces might look like in physical form and now in the future in digital form as well [in Disney’s upcoming Epic Games world in development].

	











	“That’s why when you walk into a Cars land, or you walk into Star Wars: Galaxy’s edge, or a Guardians of the Galaxy, you feel the same thing that you feel when you’re in the theater watching that movie for the first time,” D’Amaro continues.


	And they used the SXSW stage to unveil a number of announcements coming to Disney’s parks.


	First up was a look a look at new Star Wars entries, with Mandoloian filmmaker Jon Favreau joining imagineers in introducing Austin to the BDX droids and an animatronic droidsmith that will be seen walking around the Disney parks. And Disney will bring a brand new mission to Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run that is inspired by Favreau’s upcoming Star Wars feature, The Mandalorian & Grogu, a ride which will debut the same weekend as the film over Memorial Day weekend 2026.


	“As much as I like going in to the park where I feel like a kid, I love seeing backstage. You realize that there is a lot of technology, but at its heart are these people who are passionate about storytelling,” said Faverau, who shouted out the SXSW film festival where his feature Chef premiered in 2014 before leaving the stage.


	After Star Wars, Disney took the Austin audience to the world of Pixar, with chief creative officer Pete Docter saying that the Disney parks are frequently in the thoughts of its animators. Said Docter, “We ask ourselves: ‘Is this somewhere I want to go if they build it at Disneyland?’” Doctor’s movie Monsters Inc. is the inspiration for a new rollercoaster modeled on the film’s “door vault” sequence where characters cling to suspended closet doors. It will be Disney’s first suspended roller coaster, with animatics getting oohs and aahs from the audience. Additionally, a new ride inspired by Cars at Magic Kingdom will be a recreation of an off-road rally race filled with new “race car personalities” created by Pixar.

	











	“The Cars franchise is so, so powerful, clearly evergreen, something that we’ve had a lot of success with in Disney California Adventure,” D’Amaro says. “So we see a great opportunity at Walt Disney World building another Cars themed area. And while technology may not be in the forefront of the consumers mind, the technology that we will use to translate what Pete and the team have created to an off road rally race is going to be phenomenal in terms of the how the car moves, how it reacts to the terrain, how it makes you feel you are out in in the wilderness, really experiencing what the cars would would experience.”


	Closing out the presentation was Marvel head Kevin Feige who brought out the surprise guest, Robert Downey Jr. who elicited the biggest audience reaction of the panel.


	Disney is doubling the size of the Avengers campus at the Disneyland Anaheim park. The new ride Stark Flight Lab will take guests inside Tony Stark’s technology workshop where guests will sit inside a “gyrokinetic pod” where guests will sit rolling along a track and will be picked up by lines of robotic articulating arms. 


	Downey, who has been working directly with Disney imagineers on the new attraction, said: “What I didn’t know was how stealth and exclusive Walt Disney Imagineering HQ was. You want to talk about a closed set? It’s the Area 51 of fun!”


	They also announced that the Fantastic Four characters will appear at Tomorrowland.


	Perhaps no franchise defines Disney’s approach than Pirates of the Caribbean. The franchise traces its origins to Disneyland and Walt Disney himself, before becoming a film franchise which in turn led to new elements being added to the original rides, namely Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow. The Disney flywheel in full effect.

	











	“[Pirates is] a parks IP that goes over into the studios, and these guys make incredible content from that, and that cycle has repeated itself as well,” D’Amaro says.


	“One of the greatest rides that you have at any of the parks is in Shanghai, that Pirates ride,” Bergman continued, recalling how he took Pirates of the Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer to preview it early on in development. “We were actually at [Imagineering] sitting in one of these little rolling chairs, looking at cardboard, no joke, really early on.”


	“And you were like, ‘I hope you guys can pull this off,” D’Amaro replied.


	“It blew away our expectations, it’s so amazing,” Bergman said. “Look, we’re going to be making another Pirates movie. So it’s just great. It really is great.”

WhatsApp, the go to messaging platform for billions worldwide lets users leverage the power of AI without having to leave the app. Now, the developers are experimenting on a new Meta AI widget that will soon enable WhatsApp users to use the feature without even launching the app.

First spotted by WABetaInfo a few months ago, the widget is now available to a handful of WhatsApp users who are on the latest beta. As one would expect, the new Meta AI widget not only eliminates the need to open WhatsApp and navigate to the chat to ask questions but also allows users to upload images directly from the home screen and even acts as a shortcut to the AI chatbot’s voice mode.

In the screenshot above, you can see that WhatsApp’s new Meta AI widget is adjustable and can easily be resized to user preferences. However, this will only be available for users who already have access to Meta AI within WhatsApp.

Powered by the company’s Llama large language model, Meta AI in WhatsApp can answer questions like Gemini and ChatGPT, generate images and even be used in individual and group conversations. Since millions of users are already using Meta AI within WhatsApp, the new homescreen widget will only help increase the chatbot’s popularity.

Also, since Meta is gradually rolling out the new functionality, not every WhatsApp user may be able to see it at launch. In the last few weeks, WhatsApp has introduced a bunch of new features like 22 preset chat themes, tap reactions, selfie stickers and even shareable sticker packs to name a few.

Apple has followed a consistent design language since the launch of the iPhone 11 (in 2020). But as per the speculations, this may change with the iPhone 17 Pro launch. According to Apple tipster Jon Prosser, the upcoming Pro model will feature the following:

A massive camera island spanning the entire width of the phone

Additionally, the camera island is rumoured to be darker than the rest of the phone, giving it a dual-tone finish.

Apple might ditch the titanium frame found in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro in favour of an aluminium frame. The back panel is expected to feature a unique combination of aluminium and glass, creating a new premium look.

Rumours suggest that all four iPhone 17 models will sport an upgraded 24MP front camera, significantly improving selfie quality.

Key Points

The famous investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS -1.41%) just did something that crypto investors need to know about. The bank's action has significant implications for the future prices of Bitcoin (BTC -1.48%), Ethereum (ETH 2.18%), and perhaps also XRP (XRP -5.56%) in the future, assuming they repeat the move with another digital asset.

Here's what Goldman Sachs did and why it matters.

Per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in mid-February, Goldman Sachs recently bought large volumes of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold Bitcoin and Ethereum. It now owns at least $1.5 billion of Bitcoin-based ETF shares, making it a major holding. This kind of purchasing activity doesn't happen by accident, nor does it happen in a vacuum. Players like Goldman Sachs don't purchase assets that aren't fully within the mainstream. They aren't about to take any chances on frontier assets that could be easily supplanted by others, or regulated out of existence.

In other words, Bitcoin and Ethereum now have yet another major marker of institutional adoption and acceptance in hand. Other cryptos that soon may have ETFs approved, like XRP, could easily be next on the shopping list for those same financial institutions. And for an industry that long operated in a legal gray area, and which fought against critics for years on end, there aren't too many remaining endorsements of maturity that are left to attain.

Having big banks hold crypto ETFs is generally favorable for investors. Aside from being a mark of legitimacy for the underlying assets, those players don't tend to sell their coins at the first sign of trouble. They're biased toward long-term holding rather than impulsive trades, and toward accumulating more of assets that they think will be even more valuable in the future. For Bitcoin, given its supply dynamics, that could equate to significant sums of supply effectively being taken off the market by these institutional buyers.

For Ethereum, the picture is less clear. Goldman Sachs committed significantly less capital to it, likely due to its smaller size and the considerably higher risk associated with the chain. After all, to continue to gain in value, Bitcoin simply needs to continue becoming harder to mine over time, whereas Ethereum must continue to be an appealing place for crypto developers and investors to create and invest in new projects on its chain.

As bullish as it is for a major investment bank to be buying ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ethereum, don't go running to buy those coins merely as a result of someone else doing it at scale. Borrowing conviction from another investor seldom works. You need your own investment theses for these assets if you're going to have any hope of holding them for the years it'll take to use them as instruments of wealth-building.

Instead, consider Goldman Sachs' move as a sign that there aren't too many remaining catalysts related to institutional acceptance of these coins. That means if your investment thesis hinges solely on the adoption of these assets as the main driver of higher prices, you'll need to adapt your thinking to account for a world in which there aren't many major new users left to be onboarded. On the other hand, that could mean there's a bigger opportunity for generating value from the actual use of these coins or for their financial utility, rather than their use as speculative assets alone.

One final note: Someday, Goldman Sachs or other investment banks will sell some of their ETFs or their coins. There will be headlines written about it. Don't get scared out of your positions simply because institutional holders trimmed theirs. Focus on the long term and the drivers of higher prices. The reasons why those big banks make certain moves with their investments are often more important than the moves themselves. The right play could very well be different for you than it is for them.

The U.S. government’s increasing Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, combined with President Trump’s much-anticipated but underwhelming crypto summit, has fueled a new wave of debate among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and market analysts. The growing concern? The potential for Washington to wield significant influence over Bitcoin’s future, an asset originally designed for decentralization.



The U.S. government currently holds a massive 187,236 BTC, a number that remains high despite a reduction from the peak of over 240,000 BTC in 2023. These holdings, amassed mainly through asset seizures like those from the Silk Road and Bitfinex exchanges, have caused substantial market fluctuations in the past whenever the government decided to sell off any of its BTC stash.

According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, these holdings remain a volatile factor within the market, as their liquidation often leads to sharp price drops. The mere existence of such a large reserve in the hands of the government raises a fundamental question: Could the U.S. be shaping Bitcoin’s future?

Bitcoin was created as a decentralized digital asset, free from government control and regulation. However, the government’s increasing involvement in holding significant amounts of BTC suggests that Washington’s influence on the cryptocurrency could grow, especially if liquidation strategies change or if the reserves are used in broader economic or policy decisions.

This shift in control has led to increased skepticism, with critics fearing that the very nature of Bitcoin is being altered by government intervention. The potential for political factors to affect Bitcoin’s value raises serious concerns about the future of an asset that was once synonymous with financial independence and freedom from state control.

President Trump’s White House Crypto Summit, held recently, was heralded by many in the crypto industry as a pivotal event that could mark a shift in the U.S. government’s stance on digital currencies. Industry figures had hoped for substantial policy declarations that would support crypto businesses and ease the regulatory burdens many face. However, the summit left many disappointed.

Instead of unveiling clear regulatory strategies or introducing major reforms, the event was marked by vague promises, excessive praise for Trump, and a lack of concrete action. While some industry leaders showed support for Trump’s rhetoric on reducing federal regulation, others saw the summit as a missed opportunity to address critical issues facing the industry.

NFT trader Clemente expressed his frustration, saying, “That was the most embarrassing thing I’ve ever witnessed. Is everyone just worshipping Trump now?” He and other critics pointed out that Trump’s statements often appeared unprepared and overly simplistic, focusing more on generic praise for the cryptocurrency space rather than addressing the real challenges it faces.

Even economist Peter Schiff took to social media to denounce the summit, calling it “a disgrace” and “a blight on whatever legacy Trump leaves.” Schiff, a known critic of Bitcoin, argued that the summit’s lack of substance only furthered the perception that Trump was more focused on political theater than addressing the needs of the crypto community.

However, not everyone saw the summit in a negative light. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, for instance, praised Trump’s leadership, stating that the event had encouraged him to hire 1,000 new employees in the U.S. this year. Armstrong’s position reflects the divide within the crypto community — some see Trump as a figure who could bring much-needed regulatory clarity to the space, while others fear that cozying up to the establishment may compromise Bitcoin’s anti-government roots.

Despite the high expectations surrounding the summit, Bitcoin’s price action tells a different story. In the wake of Trump’s remarks, Bitcoin saw a notable dip, dropping to around $86,457 at the time of writing. Technical indicators also suggested weak market sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting at 42.50, a level that signals a lack of strong buying pressure.

The On-Balance Volume (OBV) metric, which tracks trading volume to assess market sentiment, remained negative, pointing to a decrease in demand for Bitcoin. This suggests that traders, who had anticipated positive regulatory news or a bullish stance from Trump, were left disappointed by the lack of concrete policy changes.

The market reaction has led some analysts to speculate about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects. The cryptocurrency could rebound if buying pressure intensifies, potentially pushing the price back toward the $88,000 mark. However, if the current trend of weak sentiment persists, Bitcoin could see further declines, with a possible drop to $84,000.

Adding an extra layer of uncertainty to the market is the potential for another round of Bitcoin liquidations by the U.S. government. Given the size of its holdings, even a small shift in the government’s strategy could lead to significant market volatility. The combination of government influence and market uncertainty has many wondering whether Bitcoin can remain the decentralized, anti-establishment asset it was originally envisioned to be.

The ongoing debate over the U.S. government’s influence on Bitcoin raises larger questions about the future of the cryptocurrency movement. Bitcoin’s creation was rooted in the desire to create a financial system free from government control, a decentralized network that could empower individuals worldwide.

But as the U.S. government continues to hold a significant portion of the global Bitcoin supply, and as figures like Trump gain influence within the crypto space, some are concerned that the very principles that Bitcoin was built upon are being compromised.

The crypto industry, once driven by the ideals of decentralization and independence from traditional financial systems, now faces the possibility of political capture. As industry leaders and policymakers jockey for influence, the question remains: Will Bitcoin continue to represent financial freedom, or will it become just another asset controlled by the state?

For now, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain. As the market continues to navigate these turbulent waters, both Bitcoin’s price and its core ethos hang in the balance.

The Capitol City of St. Paul is preparing for a massive month. 

As the Minnesota State Hockey Tournament comes to a close Saturday, Joe Spencer of the St. Paul Downtown Alliance said it's just the start of what he expects to be a busy month of events.

Spencer said the city could see nearly one million visitors in the month of March alone.

""We've got 67 concerts, 35 sporting events, 32 comedy shows, and two Broadway shows plus St. Patrick's Day, which of course is always a bonanza in downtown,""

Spencer said. ""It really is a shot in the arm to kind of get out of the winter doldrums and hit March at a dead sprint."" Spencer said March is typically one of the slowest months for hospitality – and this year's surge could be a boon for bars, restaurants and hotels.

""If you look at the bar/restaurant industry for example, March is not a good time generally speaking, but for us, this is our big boost, and from here, we really roll,"" Spencer said.

Spencer estimated the visitors could bring in tens of millions of dollars in economic impact.

Born and raised in Metro Detroit, Adam loves all things Michigan, but is thrilled to now call Minnesota home.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona’s home game against Osasuna has been postponed after the death of a member of Barcelona’s medical staff, the Spanish club said.

Fans were informed of the decision minutes before the game was scheduled to kick off Saturday night in Barcelona at Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.

Barcelona said in a statement that it was “deeply saddened to announce the passing of first-team doctor Carles Miñarro Garcia this evening.”

The club said it extended its “heartfelt condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time.”

Barcelona did not immediately provide any details on the cause of death, which local media reports said was due to medical reasons.

Osasuna said it agreed to the request by Barcelona to not play the match. The Spanish soccer federation confirmed that the decision was official.

Barcelona leads La Liga by one point over Atletico Madrid. 

The Osasuna game will be rescheduled.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,NBA MVP odds: Nikola Jokić's historic night gives Nuggets star big boost in race against Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/nba-mvp-odds-nikola-jokics-historic-night-gives-nuggets-star-big-boost-in-race-against-shai-gilgeous-alexander-150602484.html,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 15:11:22 GMT","

A historic night for Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokić also boosted his odds in the 2024-25 NBA MVP race.

Jokić posted a 30-20-20 game during a 149-141 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. It's a stat line that's never happened in NBA history and comes from a player who was questionable with an ankle injury entering the night.

Jokić's performance gave him a big bump in the odds for MVP, moving him up to +210 behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who is currently -285 via BetMGM.

— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) March 8, 2025

Jokić opened the season at +450 for the award and last week had moved to +350. Earlier this week, he was at +550, but his 30-20-20 performance will have people believing he can put up a strong final month of the season to claim his fourth MVP.

Gilgeous-Alexander was -1000 for MVP on the same day Jokić dropped to +550. The NBA scoring leader (32.8 points per game) is now -285 after Jokić's big move.

Jokić not only posted a new kind of triple-double, he also broke Wilt Chamberlain's record for most assists by a center, which previously sat at 21. The overall record is held by Scott Skiles with 30, set in 1990.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Lines wrapped around the corner at Dick’s House of Sport on Friday morning, as shoppers waited to get their first look at the newest anchor store at the Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek. 

Dick’s House of Sport, described as the “experiential retail” wing of Dick’s Sporting Goods, opens to shoppers this weekend. It is the first Dick’s House of Sport store in Ohio.

Danny Tipton, a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base retiree, was first in line at 10 p.m. the previous evening, adding that he’s on the hunt for some apparel. 





“I wanted to be the first one to enjoy Dick’s Sporting Goods,” he said. “I like the history of it, and I could use some thermal underwear.”

Others started joining him about 4 a.m., Tipton said, though adding that his 10-hour campout was “absolutely worth it.”



“I’ve met some good people,” he said.

The Beavercreek Dick’s House of Sport store is the 21st of its type nationwide, said Field Marketing Manager Kevin Troklus. It goes far beyond the typical Dick’s sporting goods store, with many extra features.









The over 100,000-square-foot facility includes a rock climbing wall, multiple golf bays with TrackMan simulators, and batting cages that can be used for baseball, softball, lacrosse and soccer.

The store also has a 17,000-square-foot outdoor turf field, where kids can try out cleats, shoes and equipment to determine if they fit well, or are suitable for their sport.

“We thought about what would make a store stand out from just a normal shopping experience, where an athlete could come in and try and test the product out, at no other place than House of Sport,” Troklus said.

Bellbrook resident Ben Forshee said he and his family came to the grand opening at the urging of his young daughter Pearl, who wants to play basketball.

“I think it’s awesome. All our kids are in sports. We walked around yesterday and it seems like they’ve got a much wider selection of stuff,” he said.





Opening weekend activities include giveaways for gift cards for adults, DSG soccer balls for children and entries for a cash prize.

Three high-profile current and former Ohio athletes were scheduled to be at the grand opening weekend:

* Chris Olave, NFL wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints and former Ohio State Buckeyes great, was set to sign autographs from 6-7:30 p.m. Friday;

* Cincinnati Bengals rising star running back Chase Brown will be there from noon-1:30 p.m. Saturday;

* Hall of Fame former Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench will appear from 12:30-2 p.m. Sunday.

Dick’s House of Sport currently operates stores in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Dick’s plans to have between 75 and 100 new concept locations by 2027.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Machine Gun Kelly is mourning the loss of his friend, Luke ""The Dingo"" Trembath, who died at the age of 38.

On Friday, March 7, MGK, whose real name is Colson Baker, posted a lengthy tribute to the snowboarder.

""Crazy...I didn't even cry this hard when my dad died,"" MGK wrote on Instagram. ""I've lost a lot of friends, but I've never lost a brother. We'll never get another Dingo on this planet. A true rockstar without ever needing to make a song, the most loyal, loud, charismatic, funny, and annoying human I've ever had the honor of knowing.""

Trembath's death was confirmed by Monster Energy, a company who had sponsored him, on Friday, February 28.

""His unparalleled passion and energy were infectious, lighting up everything he touched. We'll forever remember his iconic laugh, his love for racing suits, and his genuine ability to connect with everyone he met. Here's to you Dingo, you'll be deeply missed and forever remembered,"" read a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Trembath's cause of death has not been revealed.

MGK's Instagram post comes as he awaits the arrival of his child with his ex-fiancee, Megan Fox. He made mention of the baby in his Instagram tribute.

""I feel like your [sic] up there with my new child, dressed up in a hilarious costume making them laugh, getting ready to send them down. I couldn't ask for a more bittersweet birth blessing,"" MGK wrote.

A post shared by instagram

TMZ previously reported that Fox's due date is this month. The actress shares three sons, Noah, 12, Bodhi, 11, and Journey, 8, with ex-husband Brian Austin Green. Meanwhile, MGK is a father of one daughter, Casie, whom he welcomed in 2009 with his ex-girlfriend Emma Cannon.

Fox and MGK split in November 2024. Per TMZ, the two ended things over Thanksgiving weekend.

Women's Tennis
March 08, 2025


PHILADELPHIA— The University of Pennsylvania women's tennis team moved above the .500 mark on the season with a win over Fairleigh Dickinson earlier this afternoon.

The Quakers made quick work of the Knights this afternoon, taking the match handily. Despite Fairleigh Dickinson making the match difficult at times, the Red and Blue adapted and fought through some uncomfortable play to earn the win.

The doubles point was the first challenge of the day for Penn as Fairleigh Dickinson won the first doubles matchup between Alena Kubanova/Yelena Kim (FDU) and Maya Urata/Lara Stojanovski. Esha Velaga and Gavriella Smith cut the deficit with a win, Eileen Wang and Liza Tkachenko securing the doubles point with a win of their own.

In the singles portion of the dual match, Maya Urata doubled Penn's lead with a swift two-set victory over Katsiaryna Kostsina. Lara Stojanovski completed her match not long after, adding on for the Quakers. Esha Velaga secured the team win with her victory over Namie Isago, clearing the four-point threshold for the Red and Blue. Victories from Gavriella Smith, Liza Tkachenko, and Eileen Wang kept the sweep intact, finishing with a team score of 7-0.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,College basketball rankings: Duke aims for outright ACC title in rivalry game vs. North Carolina,https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-duke-aims-for-outright-acc-title-in-rivalry-game-vs-north-carolina/,"Sat, 08 Mar 2025 16:15:00 GMT","

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The second of two games scheduled annually between Duke and North Carolina will be played later Saturday inside the Dean Smith Center. It should be a fun scene. But the juice that used to accompany the matchup is undeniably lacking, in part because, for the fourth time in the past six meetings, North Carolina enters without a number next to its name.

Unranked UNC?

That doesn't even sound right, does it? But that's the label the Tar Heels took into both games with Duke in 2023 and both games against Duke in 2025. Even more of an indicator of just how differently these rivals are operating right now is the fact that Duke is a 9.5-point favorite on the road against a North Carolina team that's 1-10 in Quadrant 1 opportunities. 

Yes, the Tar Heels are riding a six-game winning streak -- and that's certainly better than the alternative. But the reason UNC remains on the wrong side of the bubble, according to CBS Sports bracket expert Jerry Palm, is because all six of those wins are against teams ranked 89th or worse in the NET. At this risk of piling on, I'm compelled to highlight that every team in the SEC -- all 16 of them, even last-place South Carolina -- is better in the NET than every ACC team North Carolina has topped in this winning streak.

That's crazy.

Bottom line: The ACC is down bad. Ten of the 18 members are worse than the worst team in the SEC, according to the NET. Nine of the 18 members are worse than the worst team in the Big 12, according to the NET. As of this moment, Palm is only projecting the ACC to receive three bids to the NCAA Tournament. The Mountain West could -- and probably should -- receive more.

Duke is No. 2 in Saturday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Auburn remains No. 1 for the 59th consecutive day. The Blue Devils can secure the first outright ACC title of Jon Scheyer's career with a win at North Carolina, or if Clemson and Louisville both lose, the latter of which seems unlikely. Tip is set for 6:30 pm ET.

Jack Draper sets up third-round tie against either Felix Auger-Aliassime or Jenson Brooksby at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells; watch tournament live on Sky Sports until March 16

Saturday 8 March 2025 20:40, UK

Jack Draper advanced to the third round of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells on Saturday as he cruised past wild card Joao Fonseca in straight sets.

Brazil's Fonseca had beaten Britain's Jacob Fearnley in the opening round but could not get beyond Draper as the 13th seed teed up a meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime or Jenson Brooksby.

Draper came through a tight first set before coasting to a 6-4 6-0 win after converting five of eight break points to his opponent's one of seven.

Jack Draper's highly anticipated clash with Joao Fonseca was bizarrely interrupted in the first set. The Brazilian teenager was serving at 4-4 30-15 when a loud alarm went off on the court, leaving both players baffled.

Fonseca waved his arms in disbelief as the umpire raced to report the incident. Commentators were also stunned, questioning whether it was a technical error or a sign of an emergency.

Draper had a huge test in his opening match in Indian Wells. As the 13th seed, he received a bye into the second round to meet Fonseca - the teenage sensation who has taken the tennis world by storm and recently won his first tour title in Buenos Aires.

The stands were packed on Court 4, with plenty of Brazilians in attendance to cheer on their man. The British No. 1 got an early break but Fonseca immediately got back on serve and there was little separating them.

As the teenage wildcard stepped up to serve in an important game at 4-4 30-15, an alarm started blaring across the court, stopping Fonseca in his tracks.

""Okay… That is not your television, it’s also not the audio feed from Indian Wells, it is something actually on the grounds,"" Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said.

""Incredibly loud by the looks of it, everyone sitting with their fingers in their ears,"" Naomi Broady replied.

Overend was concerned about the source of the noise, adding: ""Hopefully it’s a malfunction of something to do with the audio system rather than an emergency alert.""

Fonseca's fans used the brief interruption to spur him on, starting chants while the alarm continued to ring out. Chair umpire Tom Sweeney quickly alerted officials to the noise via his walkie-talkie, but the alarm stopped while he was speaking.

""We have a very, very loud alarm. It’s just stopped,"" he said as the crowd cheered when the noise finally ceased.

""Thank goodness. I don’t think anyone else could’ve listened to that for much longer. Could that slight interruption work in Jack Draper’s favour?"" Overend asked as Fonseca lost the first point after the delay.

The disruption seemed to throw him off, the world No. 80 didn't win another point in the game and was swiftly broken. Draper had some trouble serving for the set, saving three break-back points, but he took it 6-4 after 46 minutes.

The 13th seed continued his demolition job, racing through set two to secure a 6-4 6-0 victory as Fonseca failed to win another game after the alarm incident.

The Brit was playing his first match since losing in the championship match of the Qatar Open last month. Following his run to the final in Doha, he pulled out of the ATP 500 in Dubai to rest.

Meanwhile, Fonseca was seeking his second consecutive victory over a British player after beating Jacob Fearnley in round one.
