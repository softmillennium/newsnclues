Late Friday, the Trump administration announced that phones, computers and chips were exempted from new tariffs. Apple is among the most exposed companies to Trump's tariffs because the majority of its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks are manufactured in China and other Asian countries. Trump has called for Apple to make its products in the U.S. Most of Apple's critical imports were exempted from the tariffs, a move that Wall Street analysts said could save Apple billions in costs. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business," Trump said Monday in a briefing with reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Apple's CEO. Uncertainty about what the future holds helps explain Apple's relatively muted gain on Friday. Apple is the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company once again, edging out Microsoft. Apple fell below the $3 trillion mark on April 4, two days after Trump announced "reciprocal tariffs" that would place significant duties on China and countries where the company does manufacturing. The stock rallied last week after Trump announced his administration was dropping new tariff rates to 10% on imports from countries other than China, which would face tariffs as high as 145%. Analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Monday that the latest news from the White House brings Apple's "annualized tariff cost burden" to $7 billion, down from $44 billion as of Thursday.

The lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade alleges that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power to levy tariffs by claiming that trade deficits with other countries constitute an emergency. "Congress has not delegated any such power," the suit says. The Liberty Justice Center, which is representing the owner-operated companies, said Trump's so-called Liberation Day tariffs of at least 10% on imports from most countries, and higher rates for scores of other nations, are devastating small businesses across the country." "His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency," the suit says. "Nor do these trade deficits constitute an 'unusual and extraordinary threat." The other plaintiffs are MicroKits LLC in Virginia, which makes educational electronic kits and musical instruments, and Terry Precision Cycling, a Vermont-based brand of women's cycling apparel. Terry Cycling in 2026 expects to "face an estimated $1.2 million in tariff costs — an amount that is simply not survivable for a business of its size," the suit says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Monday he expects the effects of President Donald Trump's tariffs on prices to be "transitory," embracing a term that got the central bank in trouble during the last bout of inflation. "I can hear the howls already that this must be a mistake given what happened in 2021 and 2022. But just because it didn't work out once does not mean you should never think that way again," Waller said in remarks for a policy speech in St. Louis that compared his inflation view to the controversial "tush push" football play. Laying out two scenarios for what the duties eventually will look like, Waller said larger and longer-lasting tariffs would bring a larger inflation spike initially to a 4% to 5% range that eventually would ebb as growth slowed and unemployment increased. In the smaller-tariff scenario, inflation would hit around 3% and then fall off. Larger tariffs might force a cut to support growth, while smaller duties might allow a "good news" cut later this year, Waller added. "Yes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary, and 'temporary' is another word for transitory,'" he said. "Despite the fact that the last surge of inflation beginning in 2021 lasted longer than I and other policymakers initially expected, my best judgment is that higher inflation from tariffs will be temporary." The "transitory" term harkens back to the inflation spike in 2021 that Fed officials and many economists expected to ease after supply chain and demand factors related to the Covid-19 pandemic normalized. However, prices continued to rise, hitting their highest since the early 1980s and necessitating a series of dramatic rate hikes. While inflation has pulled back substantially since the Fed started raising in 2022, it remains above the central bank's 2% target. The Fed cut its benchmark borrowing rate by a full percentage point in late 2024 but has not cut further this year. A Trump appointee during the president's first term, Waller used a football analogy to explain his views on "transitory" inflation. He cited the Philadelphia Eagles' famed "tush push" play that the team has used to great effect on short-yardage and goal line situations. "You are the Philadelphia Eagles and it is fourth down and a few inches from the goal line. "Since it didn't work out the way you expected, does that mean that you shouldn't call for the tush push the next time you face a similar situation? Fed officials will need to "remain flexible" in deciding the future path. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit If China is going to lose some manufacturing as a result of President Trump's tariffs, the U.S. manufacturing sector won't be the main beneficiary, according to a new CNBC Supply Chain Survey. The Trump administration says a reshoring boom is coming, but most companies tell CNBC that the costs could as much as double to bring supply chains back and instead a new search for low-tariff regimes around the world will commence. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed (74%) said cost was the top reason for saying they would not be reshoring production, followed by the challenge of finding skilled labor (21%). Despite some recent high-profile announcements from the tech sector, including Nvidia's plans for a supercomputer plant in the U.S. and Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the country, most companies cite costs as prohibitive. The tech sector received a reprieve on Friday night from new tariffs on China and other global manufacturing nations, but the Trump administration is moving ahead with a national security investigation that targets critical technology for future tariffs. The majority of respondents taking the survey estimate that the price tag of building a new domestic supply chain would at least be double current costs (18%), and would likely be more than twice as expensive (47%). In addition to the tariffs, consumer demand and raw material prices, as well as the "current administration's inability to provide a consistent strategy," were cited as key supply chain concerns. A majority of respondents (61%) said they feel like the Trump Administration "is bullying corporate America." A total of 380 respondents from companies in the supply chain and business organizations were included in the survey, conducted from April 14-18. Among respondents indicating interest in reestablishing U.S. supply chain, they expect a process that would take many years, with 74% expecting a three-to-five-year timeline, if not longer: 41% said at least three to five years; 33% said longer than five years. If manufacturing is coming back to the U.S., automation will be a major component of the economic model, with 81% of respondents saying it will be used more than human workers. "The U.S. labor market is a concern when considering movement back to the U.S.," said Mark Baxa, CEO of supply chain trade group CSCMP. In the current environment, layoffs are an immediate concern, with respondents almost evenly split between those who are planning headcount reductions (47%) and those who say they do not have current layoff plans (53%). Right now, the most widespread reaction to the Trump tariffs is the cancellation of orders (89%) based on an expectation that consumers will pull back on spending, which 75% of respondents said they are forecasting. For products that are coming in under the new tariff rates, 61% of those who participated in the survey said they would raise prices. Survey respondents expect the hardest-hit products as a result of a pullback in consumer spending to be discretionary products (44%), furniture (19%), and luxury (19%). "As of now, we have seen a heavy cancellation or pause rate for freight originating from China, but are seeing increased volumes and front loading from other countries in Asia that had their reciprocal tariffs paused for 90 days," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "Supply chains that support millions of U.S. jobs, power U.S. manufacturers, and provide affordable choices for U.S. consumers are now experiencing early signs of damage due to these destructive tariffs," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Trump's National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more than 10 countries have made "amazing" trade deal offers to the United States and he "100%" guaranteed there is no recession coming. Multiple surveys taking the pulse of CEOs show widespread expectations that a recession may have already started or is soon to come. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that based on conversations he has had with CEOs across the economy, the U.S. is either very close to or already in a recession now. "Small consumer companies that started with an innovative idea do not have the capital to invest in building factories," said Bruce Kaminstein, member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella. "They were forced to go overseas because of a lack of production facilities here in the U.S. Factories in China welcomed our business and helped us bring our products to market," he said. This time of year is when retailers are ordering their back-to-school and holiday items, and while importers have been pulling back on orders from between 5% to 30%, according to the survey, the majority of respondents say the back-to-school and holiday orders specifically have not been affected. They're also suggesting that companies are preparing for a cautious consumer. There is a greater focus on lower-priced goods for the holidays (67%), and more promotional items (21%).

He said that by May 10, "married borrowers filing separate income tax returns or separated from their spouses will have spousal income counted for the purposes of calculating monthly payment amount under IDR plans." Bergeron wrote that the change is a "required consequence" of a federal court's block on former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan. This means that some student-loan borrowers could see their payments surge if their income-driven repayment plan payments are calculated based on spousal income since the combined income is higher than an individual borrower's income. It's unclear how the Trump administration will carry out this change, or if it will face additional legal challenges. Bergeron said there is not yet a timeline for when servicers will begin processing the backlog of the repayment plan applications. He added that borrowers seeking payment credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness can access the "buyback" program, which allows borrowers to buy back months that would complete their total 120 qualifying payments. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Have a tip or story to share?</p>

TikTok users in the US are being inundated with videos from Chinese influencers encouraging American buyers to overcome punitive Trump tariffs by buying direct from the “world's factory” — China.

Mostly filmed at Chinese factories purporting to supply top US brands from Lululemon Athletica Inc. to Nike Inc., the influencers aim to “expose” how the vast majority of consumer goods are made in the world's second-largest economy. Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don't you just contact us and buy from us? You won't believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags. </p>

XTX Markets founder Alex Gerko is bolstering his status as Britain's richest trader, leading a recent charge of self-made finance billionaires breaking into the nation's ultra-wealthy elite.

Gerko's net worth surged to a record $13.2 billion after the London-based firm reported a jump in 2024 revenue and earnings, more than doubling his fortune over the past two years, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's now the world's 164th-richest person, and the third-wealthiest in the UK.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the high-stakes race to dominate AI infrastructure, a tech giant has subtly shifted gears. Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022, there's been a mad dash to build as many artificial intelligence data centers as possible. For two years, there's been almost zero doubt in the tech industry about this AI expansion. It's been all very up and to the right. This is pretty shocking news for an AI industry that's been constantly kicking and screaming for more cloud capacity and more Nvidia graphics processing units. So it's worth reading closely what Walsh wrote about how things have changed. "In recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history," she wrote in a LinkedIn post. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects," Walsh added. She didn't share more details, but the TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias has found several recent examples of what he said was Microsoft backing off. This pullback on new capacity leasing was largely driven by Microsoft's decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads, Elias said. This is worrying because trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative-AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving. The reality is more nuanced than a simple pullback, though. Raimo Lenschow, a Barclays analyst, put the situation in context. In this AI "land grab," it's common for large cloud companies to sign and negotiate leases that they end up walking away from later, Lenschow said. "In other words, over the past few quarters, Microsoft has 'overspent' on land and buildings, but is now going back to a more normal cadence," Lenschow wrote in a recent note to investors. Microsoft still plans $80 billion in capital expenditures during its 2025 fiscal year and has guided for year-over-year growth in the next fiscal year. So the company probably isn't backing away from AI much but is becoming more strategic about where and how it invests. Pretraining is how models are created, and this requires loads of closely connected GPUs, along with state-of-the-art networking. Inference is how existing models are run to support services such as AI agents and Microsoft Copilot. Inference is less technically demanding but expected to be the larger market. With inference outpacing training, the focus is shifting toward scalable, cost-effective infrastructure that maximizes return on investment. For instance, at a recent AI conference in New York, the discussion was focused more on efficiency than attaining artificial general intelligence, a costly endeavor to make machines work better than humans. The AI startup Cohere said that its new Command A model needs only two GPUs to run. Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, echoed this in a recent podcast. While he acknowledged a slight slowdown in returns from massive pretraining runs, he said the company's compute consumption was still "unbelievable" — it's just shifting to different stages of the AI pipeline. Suleyman added that some of the canceled leases and projects were never finalized contracts but exploratory discussions — part of standard operating procedure in hyperscale cloud planning. This strategic pivot comes as OpenAI, Microsoft's close partner, has begun sourcing capacity from other cloud providers and even hinting at developing its own data centers. Microsoft, however, maintains a right of first refusal on new OpenAI capacity, signaling continued deep integration between the two companies. Microsoft is likely adjusting to changing market dynamics, not scaling back ambition. "Both of these hyperscalers are in the midst of a material year-over-year ramp in data center demand," Elias wrote, referring to Google and Meta. So Microsoft's pivot may be more a sign of maturity than retreat.</p>

Europe's family founders are emerging with much of their empires intact after bruising refinancing battles. Many of their creditors have had to take heavy writedowns.

Lenders to struggling private equity-owned companies have had a rough time of late, regularly getting whacked with heavy losses after fierce refinancing battles. But their compadres who binged in recent years on junk credit from Europe's tycoon business builders won't have much sympathy.

While buyout firms have had to keep at least one eye on future relations with the creditor community, individuals who've built their trouble-hit empires from scratch have been tougher adversaries, according to several market participants. In the words of one key lender to telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi, who asked to stay anonymous discussing a sensitive matter, these owners are ready to burn a business to the ground rather than give it up.</p>

The wreckage of a helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River is extracted from the water in Jersey City, New Jersey, on April 10.

The Federal Aviation Administration ordered New York Helicopter Charter Inc. to cease operations while it conducts a review of the tour operator's license and safety record following a deadly crash last week. 

The regulator's decision, announced on XBloomberg Terminal, came just hours after US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on it to revoke the company's license and expand safety inspections of other tour operators.</p>
