            Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was recovering in an intensive care unit on Monday after a tricky 12-hour surgery due to recurring intestinal issues since he was stabbed while campaigning in 2018.
    


            The 70-year-old conservative firebrand was awake and doing “very well” in the intensive care unit, where he will remain during a slow recovery, doctors at the DF Star Hospital told journalists. It was his fifth surgery since the 2018 stabbing.
    


            The former president was hospitalized on Friday after strong abdominal pains during an event with supporters in northeastern Brazil, forcing him to break off a regional tour aimed at drumming up support ahead of a trial before the Supreme Court.
    


            Bolsonaro was transferred to the nation's capital, Brasilia, where he lives, on Saturday night.
    


            The surgery was difficult due to Bolsonaro's prior surgeries and stab wound, but Sunday's procedure did not have unexpected complications and the result was satisfactory, doctors said, adding that hospital visits for now should be limited to family.

            Billionaire Ray Dalio says President Donald Trump's tariff war has helped push America close to a recession — or perhaps even “something worse.”
    


            “Right now, we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,” the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “And I'm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn't handled well.”
    


            Dalio, who correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis, is part of a growing chorus, including major Wall Street banks, worried that tariffs could hamstring the US economy, the world's largest.

            “If you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems, are very, very disruptive. How that's handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. Or it could be handled well,” he said.
    


            Dalio added that whether tariffs are implemented in a “stable” way or a “chaotic and disruptive way” makes “all the difference in the world.”
    


            But, so far, the way Trump has pursued his tariff plan — designed to reshore manufacturing to the US and boost jobs and tax revenue — has been “very disruptive,” Dalio said, adding the tariffs are “like throwing rocks into the production system.”
    


            Trump's tariff offensive on the world has triggered global market turmoil in recent weeks, raising fears of an economic downturn. Last week, Trump declared a 90-day pause on all “reciprocal” tariffs, except those imposed on China, which increased to at least 145%.
    


            Yet some Chinese electronic goods, including smartphones and computer monitors, will be exempt from that 145%, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted late Friday. Those goods are still, however, subject to a 20% levy imposed on China.
    


            A recession refers to a sustained decline in economic activity, often measured by two or more consecutive quarters of negative growth.
    


            Goldman Sachs economists expect a 45% chance of a recession in the US over the next 12 months. Before Trump announced the 90-day pause, they had forecast a recession as the “base case,” meaning it was highly likely to occur.
    


            “The prospect of a recession has increased, with growing indications that economic activity is slowing down around the world,” company CEO David Solomon told analysts on a Monday call.
    


            Current levels of uncertainty have “constrained” the ability of Goldman Sachs' clients to make important decisions, Solomon said. “Fears over the potentially escalating effects of the trade war have created material risks to the US and global economy,” he added.
    


            Dalio is worth $16 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

            It was a passion project that spanned around 15 years and cost over $1 million, but nearly two decades after technology entrepreneur Chris Willson purchased a cruise ship on Craigslist, the vessel has met its end.
    


            The 293-foot ship, which was towed from California city Stockton to nearby peninsula Mare Island in late 2024, has been completely demolished.
    


            Willson, who reluctantly sold the vessel, known as the Aurora, in October 2023, says he's devastated by the turn of events.
    


            “It's probably one of the saddest things that I've had to witness in this lifetime…” Willson tells CNN Travel.
    


            “It's hard to watch 15 years of hard work just go to complete waste.”
    


            Cruise historian Peter Knego, who has followed the ship for several decades, is one of the few people to have caught a glimpse of the Aurora after she was towed, and was able to witness some of the painstaking work involved in scrapping it earlier this year.
    


            “They're demolishing it with these cranes that go in and just grind up the steel,” Knego told CNN last month, pointing out that this is the “safest” method.
    


            “It's a really mean looking, horrible death for the ship.”
    


            That “horrible death” marks the final chapter in the eventful story of the “pocket” cruise ship, originally named Wappen von Hamburg, which was built by the Blohm and Voss shipyard in 1955 and went on to become the first significant passenger liner built by Germany after World War II.

            And while he no longer has any official connection to the vessel, Willson clearly feels a strong emotional tie to the Aurora after claiming to have plowed at least $1 million into the ship and spending nearly 15 years restoring it. He now rues parting company with it.
    


            “If I would have known it would have went this direction, I would have stuck it out,” admits Willson, who previously lived on board the vessel with his long-term partner Jin Li and had hoped to transform it into a museum.
    


            “But, I think it would have been sticking it out to my detriment.”
    


            His long association with the ship began around 17 years ago, when he came across the sale listing on the Craigslist classified advertisements website.
    


            After doing some digging into its history, Willson discovered that the vessel had appeared as the Spectre criminal organization headquarters in the 1963 James Bond movie “From Russia with Love.”
    


            “I started learning some of the history about it,” he says. “And came to find out that it was one of the most historic ships on the planet.”
    


            The vessel also served as a cruise ship for around two decades, which is around the time that Knego, whose fascination with ships began when he was a child, first came across it in California.
    


            “At the time, it was this boutique luxury cruise ship decorated with the owner's wife's antique collection from Asia,” recalls Knego, who has been sharing updates on the ship on his YouTube channel, Peter Knego's MidShipCinema.
    


            “So it was kind of a big deal, and I had my dad drive me down.”
    


            Knego says he didn't see the ship again for many years, until he came across it “anchored off of Long Beach” and had his friends “go circle her so I could take some pictures.”
    


            The ship went through many different owners, as well as names, before being moored in Vancouver.
    


            After a few false starts and even more ownership, and name changes, it was towed to Alameda, California in 2005.

            It stayed at the Alameda for several years, until it was relocated to the California Delta and listed for sale on Craigslist, where Willson came across it in 2008.
    


            Although he hasn't disclosed how much he paid for the ship, Willson previously told CNN that he was able to “work out a really good deal with the owner.”
    


            “I thought I would never see it again,” says Knego, who had spent years traveling the world documenting cruise ships by this point.
    


            “And then all of a sudden, the news came out on Craigslist that Chris Willson had bought the ship. And I was like, ‘Oh my god.' So I contacted Chris, and we became good friends.”
    


            Willson renamed the ship the Aurora after spending his first night on board and waking up “to one of the most brilliant sunrises I had ever seen.”
    


            “It was forming an Aurora type effect with the clouds and water,” he told CNN back in 2022.
    


            “I remember thinking at that time ‘Aurora' was a fitting name.”
    


            Willson arranged for the ship to be moved to the California river city of Rio Vista, and it remained there for a year, before he was offered a berth in San Francisco's Pier 38. However, this arrangement came to an end after around three years.
    


            In 2012, he had the ship transferred back to the California Delta, California's largest estuary, and moored the Aurora at Herman & Helen's Marina in Little Potato Slough, located around 14 miles from the city of Stockton in California's Central Valley.
    


            “We wanted it in fresh water and we wanted it in shallow water,” Willson explained to CNN previously. “So it was absolutely the best possible location that we could have put it.”
    


            Although Herman & Helen's Marina closed down a few years later, the Aurora remained at the site.
    


            However, Willson says he faced a lot of resistance from locals, who weren't exactly thrilled to have a huge decommissioned ship moored nearby.
    


            This apparent hostility only worsened when another large vessel, Canadian MineSweeper HMCS Chaleur, which was moored in the same area, sank in 2021.
    


            According to Willson, he received a “three-day notice to quit” on “several occasions,” but local authorities never actually “followed through with an eviction.”
    


            He goes on to explain that things came to a head when 1940s military tugboat Mazapeta, stationed near the Aurora, also sank, creating a “pollution issue,” and various local agencies became involved.
    


            By this stage, Willson conceded that “there was really no future for the Aurora” at that particular spot.
    


            While he considered moving the ship, and looked into various other locations, Willson learned that this would be a costly endeavour.
    


            “The ship was trapped in that channel,” he says. “There was no getting it out without dredging and that's something that the city would have to do… So there was absolutely no getting out of that situation.”
    


            As time went on and the pressure mounted, Willson felt more and more out of his depth and the situation began to take an emotional toll on him.
    


            Feeling dejected, he says he ultimately chose to sell the Aurora to an interested buyer who seemed just as passionate about saving the ship as he was.
    


            “I didn't see myself being able to fight that battle anymore,” he says, adding that selling the ship “destroyed” him.
    


            “It became far too in depth for me. And I decided for mental health reasons, just to kind of stay away… To move on and find another project and do something else with my life.”

            Willson stresses that he had every confidence that the unnamed individual was capable of keeping the Aurora going, and talked them through how to maintain the ship.
    


            When it comes to the general condition of the Aurora at the time of the sale, Willson explains that while “there were some holes” when he first bought it, they were “patched professionally” and he never had “any problems” afterward.
    


            He stresses that he was as shocked as anyone when it was announced that the ship was sinking around seven months later.
    


            “It has been determined the ship has suffered a hole and is taking on water and is currently leaking diesel fuel and oil into the Delta Waterway,” read a statement from the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office posted on X on May 22, 2024.
    


            The US Coast Guard would later confirm that the vessel had been refloated by contractors, noting that it “recently changed ownership.”
    


            Meanwhile, a statement shared by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Office of Spill Prevention and Response on June 28 indicated that contractors had “removed an estimated 21,675 gallons of oily water, 3,193 gallons of hazardous waste, and five 25-yard bins of debris” from the vessel.
    


            The City of Stockton later took over the operation.
    


            When contacted by CNN last year, Stockton Community Relations Officer Connie Cochran said that officials were “figuring out how to dispose of the vessel,” explaining that the size of the ship, along with its location, in an area that wasn't actually within the city limits, had complicated things.
    


            Cochran also indicated that there “was no clear ownership” for the Aurora when the situation occurred.
    


            Willson has shared the bill of sale and the transfer of ownership document filed with the Coast Guard Vessel documentation center. CNN has put in a Freedom of Information Act request to confirm the change of ownership for the vessel.
    


            CNN was unable to locate the most recent owner for comment.
    


            “It really hurts that I couldn't jump back in there and save it,” says Willson. “I had no ownership of it.”
    


            Cochran was unable to provide an estimate of the costs for the ongoing operation, which saw various contractors with specialist knowledge brought in, but said that the city was hoping to “recoup” some of it.
    


            In December, the US Coast Guard of Northern California announced that a dead ship tow had been undertaken to move the Aurora to Mare Island, where it would be painstakingly demolished.
    


            Knego estimates that the entire operation, including hiring tug boats to tow the ship and the dry docking, a process where a ship is brought to dry land so that the submerged portions of the hull can either be cleaned or inspected, would likely have cost between $10 to $20 million.
    


            “It's a poor city,” he says. “And for them to spend this huge amount of money… People will be angry…
    


            “And the irony is, the ship desperately needed to be dry docked. It hadn't been dry docked since 1978. Finally, the Aurora gets dry docked, just to be demolished.”
    


            Knego points out that the ship was perhaps worth “a couple hundred thousand dollars in a good market.”
    


            “The city of Stockton has a big loss on their hands,” he adds.
    


            Cochran has since confirmed to CNN that the Aurora is no more.
    


            “It was towed to Mare Island, and as of April 9, 2025, the destruction of the Aurora was complete except for the final disposal of a few key pieces and material,” Cochran told CNN via email.
    


            She went on to state that the city “is working with other government agencies to investigate and identify who was responsible for placing the Aurora in the waterway and allowing it to degrade.”
    


            “The city intends to take all appropriate legal action to recover the city's costs for the Aurora's removal and disposal from any responsible parties,” she added.
    


            “We do not, yet, have the final cost.”
    


            When questioned on the costs to the city of Stockton, Willson says he's frustrated that the authorities decided to scrap the ship.
    


            “It (scrapping the Aurora) was the most expensive way,” he adds.
    


            Reflecting on his decision to sell the Aurora nearly two years ago, Willson concedes that he would have done things differently if he'd known what would happen next.
    


            “Was I willing to go down with the ship?” he reflects. “I mean, I would have worked on that ship my entire life.

            “But once they threw a wrench in the works, that kind of ended it for me. I decided, no more.”
    


            While Willson was previously in contact with the most recent owner, he admits that he hasn't heard from him in a while.
    


            “All of this is a big mystery,” Knego says. “And needless to say, very disappointing…
    


            “I'm kind of sad, because after all these years… The ship turned 70 and it should be preserved. It's not such a big ship.
    


            “It would have been great if the Germans took her back to Hamburg and restored her.”
    


            To say things haven't turned out the way he hoped is something of an understatement, but Willson says he's hugely grateful to have been able to keep the Aurora “afloat” for so many years, describing his time with the ship as the happiest of his life.
    


            “I kept it safe for 15 years, and then I couldn't see any hope for me working on the project anymore,” he says. “So I passed it on to someone else.”
    


            He's been heavily criticized for seemingly abandoning the ship and leaving others to deal with the aftermath. But Willson feels that any anger towards him is misguided.
    


            “I don't think people should be mad at me,” he said. “I think that they should be mad that they allowed it into the Delta to begin with.
    


            “So that's kind of where I stand on that. I didn't bring the mess there. I just protected it.”
    


            Willson also points out that “nobody knew what that vessel was” until he bought it and removed several coats of paint to uncover its original name.
    


            “At least I showed that to people for 15 years,” he says, recounting the many happy hours he spent renovating the ship, with the help of volunteers.
    


            A cursory glance at the official Facebook page for the Aurora Restoration Project, which has over 13,000 followers, indicates just how much those who got involved appreciated the opportunity to step on board the historic ship.
    


            “I am just thankful that Chris and his devoted crew gave us a chance to see her one last time,” a user named Steve Young wrote. “I thought that she was toast years ago.”
    


            Another, Clay Byfield, added that he was “sad to see that the Aurora is being put to rest.”
    


            “But having the opportunity to meet you and some of the (at the time) crew will forever be cherished,” he said.
    


            Willson, who also ran a YouTube channel chronicling the progress of the project, believes that the ship would likely “have just sank without anybody not knowing what it was” if he hadn't bought it all those years ago.
    


            “I think that that's a happy thing,” he says.
    


            Willson is particularly frustrated that the end of the Aurora has come around the same time that plans are moving ahead for the SS United States, once the largest passenger ship built entirely in the US, to be intentionally sunk to form the world's largest artificial reef.
    


            “It just seems weird that they're going down at the almost exact same time.” he says, before adding that he feels that people “aren't so focused on history anymore.”
    


            “There were only three vintage liners left (in the US)… Now it's just going to be the Queen Mary (a retired ocean liner moored at Long Beach that's now a popular tourist attraction).”
    


            Knego is also hugely disappointed by the demise of these historic ships, noting that “only a handful” get saved.
    


            “It's just beautiful,” he says of the SS United States. “I mean, it's rusty and it looks like hell. But the bones of the ship are so spectacular.
    


            “And we can't find a home for this thing?… It sucks if you like ships.”
    


            Knego admits that he once had high hopes for the future of the Aurora, but sadly it wasn't to be.
    


            “It's heartbreaking,” he says, before noting that the saga of the vessel is a “great story.”
    


            And while Willson is still coming to terms with the reality that he couldn't save his beloved ship one final time, he maintains that he has absolutely no regrets about buying it.
    


            “I wouldn't trade the experience for anything,” he says. “There were so many almosts with that ship.
    


            “We almost had the right people involved in order to save that ship for many, many more generations.
    


            “But things fall through and we just kept waiting for the next one to happen. So I think it was worth it to take the chance.”

            Five people are missing and one person is dead after a boat capsized near St. Lucie Inlet, off the southeast coast of Florida, authorities said Sunday.
    


            Four people were rescued from the vessel, which was located 22 miles off Florida's coastline, Martin County Fire Rescue said on X.
    


            The United States Coast Guard is searching for five other people who are still missing.
    


            One person aboard the vessel said it capsized on Friday, the US Coast Guard Seventh District said on X. The Coast Guard began its rescue mission Sunday after a “good Samaritan reported the incident.”
    


            The four rescued survivors were transported by helicopter to Cleveland South Hospital in Stuart, Florida for further evaluation. One patient has serious injuries, Martin County Fire Rescue said.

            A man accused of breaking into and setting fire to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence while the governor's family slept admitted to “harboring hatred” for Shapiro, and said he would have beaten the governor with a hammer if they had encountered one another, court records allege.
    


            Shapiro, his wife Lori, their four children, two dogs and another family were forced to evacuate the state-owned Harrisburg residence, which was significantly damaged by the fire early Sunday, hours after the family hosted a Passover dinner, the governor said. No injuries were reported.
    


            Cody Balmer, 38, turned himself in to police and was being held on charges of attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism and other charges, authorities said. As of Monday morning, however, he was receiving treatment at a hospital following a “medical event not connected to this incident or his arrest,” police said.
    


            Investigators believe mental health issues may be a factor, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Officials were struck by how casual and relaxed the suspect was throughout the ordeal, the source said.
    


            Balmer admitted to setting the fire using homemade Molotov cocktails he fashioned from lawnmower gasoline and beer bottles, according to an affidavit filed by state police early Monday. Balmer knew it was possible the governor was home at the time, he said, and that people could have been hurt.
    


            The case is seemingly the latest instance of violence or threats against an American elected official. A prominent Democrat, the 51-year-old Shapiro was one of several candidates considered for former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her 2024 presidential bid. He has also been floated as a potential presidential candidate for 2028.
    


A surge in violent threats against politicians in recent years has included a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, in 2023 and two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, a Republican, last year.
    


            “This type of violence is not OK,” Shapiro said at a news conference Sunday, his voice rising. “We have to be better than this.”
    


            Here's what we know about the fire at Shapiro's home and the response by officials:
    


            It took Balmer about an hour to walk from his Harrisburg home to the governor's residence early Sunday, he told police in an interview outlined in Monday's affidavit.
    


            When he arrived, Balmer hopped the fence surrounding the residence, broke two windows with a hammer, threw an incendiary device through one of the broken windows – starting a fire – and climbed in through the other to enter the home, according to the affidavit, which cited footage captured by security cameras. Inside, Balmer threw a second incendiary device, causing more flames, the affidavit said.
    


            Balmer then kicked a dining room door down and fled the scene, according to the affidavit.
    


            Balmer was inside the governor's residence for less than one minute, and “actively evaded” troopers who were searching for him at the same time, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.
    


            “He clearly had a plan,” Bivens said. “He was very methodical in his approach.”
    


            The suspect was on the property for several minutes before the fires began, according to the source familiar with the investigation. A member of the governor's security team was seen on closed-circuit footage walking not far from him, the source said, but it's unclear whether the security officer was responding to a motion sensor or on a routine patrol of the compound.
    


            A caller to emergency services reported a “large fire on the first floor” of the governor's residence, adding they could “see fire out the windows,” according to audio from the Dauphin County Fire and EMS scanner obtained by CNN.
    


            Shapiro and his family woke up around 2 a.m. Sunday to loud bangs on the door from one of the state troopers assigned to their detail alerting them to the flames, Shapiro told reporters.
    


            Harrisburg Bureau of Fire responded around 2 a.m. and extinguished the flames, according to state police.
    


            A security review is now underway “to determine how we can ensure that we don't have a repeat situation like this,” Bivens said.
    


            Shapiro has praised law enforcement for its response. Despite that, the incident is seen by many within the Pennsylvania State Police as a failure, and some personnel could face discipline, according to the source familiar with the investigation.
    


            The governor's residence has 24/7 security, even when Shapiro is not home, the source said. The property also has numerous security cameras equipped with motion sensor technology that are supposed to be monitored. There have been numerous past instances where the motion sensors were tripped by squirrels and cats, the source said.
    


            When the fires began early Sunday, the security team assumed an intruder was at the residence, but the team's first priority was securing the governor and his family, the source noted. It appears the suspect did not have any contact with the governor's detail.
    


            After Balmer fled the scene, a woman who identified herself as his ex-partner called police to say Balmer had confessed he started the fire, according to the affidavit.
    


            Balmer then turned himself in to police headquarters, authorities said. Balmer told police he removed gasoline from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails, which he threw into the governor's home, the affid﻿avit said.
    


            In his interview with police, Balmer admitted to “harboring hatred” towards Shapiro, the affidavit said, without elaborating on reasons for those feelings. Balmer also said he knew it was possible Shapiro and others were home when the fire started, the document said.
    


            “Balmer was asked specifically what he would have done if Governor Shapiro found him inside of his residence, to which (Balmer) advised he would have beaten him with his hammer,” the affidavit reads.
    


            Balmer had expressed disdain for former President Joe Biden, also a Democrat, on social media multiple times since 2021. In one post that January, Balmer wrote in part, “Biden supporters shouldn't exist. Where were you his first run? Well aware of the trash he is.”
    


            In September 2021, Balmer posted a meme critical of the Biden administration's handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The meme shows Biden in a car with text that reads, “Get in, loser. We're leaving Afghanistan.” The next image shows Biden appearing to drive off, with text that says, “*Drives off without you*.”
    


            Balmer's arrest comes days before he is expected in court for a plea hearing in a separate case stemming from a 2023 simple assault charge, according to state court records. CNN has reached out to the attorney representing Balmer in that case.
    


            In another case, Balmer pleaded guilty in 2016 to forgery and theft by deception charges, court documents show.
    


            Balmer could also face federal charges in Sunday's incident, the Dauphin County district attorney said. The FBI's Philadelphia field office is assisting state police in its investigation, the agency told CNN in an email.
    


            The fire caused “significant fire damage” to the residence's piano room and the dining room, the affidavit said.
    


            Walls and ceilings are torched, with floors covered in ash and furniture destroyed, photos show. There are remnants of the Passover dinner the governor hosted Saturday – including a “Passover Crafts” sign.
    


            The Pennsylvania governor's residence is a 29,000 square foot Georgian-style building on the Susquehanna River, which has been home to eight governors and their families since it was completed in 1968, according to the Pennsylvania government.



            The residence's first floor houses both temporary and permanent art exhibits.
    


            In an emotional news conference Sunday, Shapiro said the fire was an attack not just on his family but on “the entire commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”
    


            He expressed gratitude for the messages of support and prayers he and his family have received, including from numerous politicians. Vice President JD Vance, a Republican, called the attack “really disgusting violence,” and US Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, described it as “truly appalling.”
    


            “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness we are choosing to see light,” Shapiro said, choking up.
    


            Still, Shapiro said he will not be “deterred” by the alleged attack. “If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was,” he said.
    


            The governor also highlighted his pride in his Jewish faith.
    


            “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community, who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: we celebrated our faith last night, proudly and in a few hours, we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover,” he said.
    


            “No one will deter me or my family, or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly.”

Follow:


            President Donald Trump is heading into another volatile week of his trade wars facing an urgent need to de-escalate the clash he ignited with China before it inflicts deep damage on the US economy.
    


            Chinese President Xi Jinping is so far declining US pressure to call his American counterpart to seek a “deal” after the United States imposed 145% tariffs on its superpower rival, setting off a long-feared direct confrontation.
    


            This leaves Trump repeatedly assuring Americans that his “great relationship” with the Chinese leader will head off a crisis but unable to initiate talks in a standoff that risks tanking stock markets again and imposing real hardships on Americans.
    


            Despite the uncertainty, Trump is putting on a show of relishing multiple fights he set off, and he lapped up a standing ovation as he took a seat cage-side at a UFC mixed martial arts event in Florida on Saturday night. The president, who styles himself as an ultimate political fighter, told reporters his reception was “somewhat legendary” and showed that “we're doing a good job.”
    


            But the president's conflict with China is a real-world showdown with far higher stakes.

Trump official says tariff exemptions on tech are temporary. Elizabeth Warren calls trade war ‘red light, green light' game



            The impasse is so serious because the US and Chinese economies are intricately entwined. The US relies on China for consumer electronics; rare earth minerals used in the manufacture of electric vehicles and for military applications and robotics; pharmaceuticals used in lifesaving medicines; and more basic staples of daily life, including clothing and shoes. US exports of produce like soybeans and sorghum to China are vital to the livelihoods of American farmers, but the tariffs imposed by both sides are so prohibitive that trade may effectively grind to a halt.
    


            Both sides could suffer terribly in a full-blown trade war, and US consumers could be hit by shortages and surging prices. But some experts believe that China, owing to its authoritarian system of government, would be willing to impose more pain on its populace to avoid losing what could be a defining struggle with the US.
    


            China imposed reciprocal 34% tariffs on all imports from the United States from April 10, including export controls on seven types of rare-earth minerals, such as samarium, gadolinium and terbium.
    


            Trump's capacity to play the long game was called into question when he suddenly paused reciprocal tariffs on dozens of nations last week for 90 days after bond market sell-offs began to hint at a developing financial crisis. That climbdown will have been carefully watched in Beijing. And in seeking to ease one sticky situation, Trump exacerbated another — lashing out at China with his 145% tariffs in an apparent effort to save face.
    


            As the chaos worsens, the White House added more confusion Friday night, exempting imports of Chinese-made smartphones and computers from the top tariff rate in an apparent acknowledgment that sky-high levies on those items could hammer the tech industry and US consumers.
    


            But on Sunday, the administration insisted that such products would still be subject to new tariffs at a lower level in the coming weeks, raising further questions about its apparently unplanned and knee-jerk stances, which have repeatedly scared markets.
    


            “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook' for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump wrote Sunday on Truth Social. “There was no Tariff ‘exception' announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.' The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” he went on.
    


            As it has several times, the administration is insisting that its sudden moves and inconsistent messaging were part of the plan all along.
    


            “This is just another great example of how President Trump had a detailed plan from the beginning that's being executed exactly as directed,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” He explained the administration's thinking that such items are vital to US national security and thus required different treatment for “reshoring” factories that make them.
    


            The administration insists its strategy is working, arguing that scores of countries included in the now-paused reciprocal tariffs have rushed to offer stunning deals to Trump to escape American pressure.
    


            The White House is now applying similar logic to China, betting that the might of the US economy will force Xi to offer concessions on long-held grievances that include concerns over market access, intellectual property theft and a vast trade imbalance that Trump insists is proof Beijing is ripping off Washington.
    


            “It's kind of almost a two-world system. There's a process about China, and that's very, very nascent … and then the process for everybody else,” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “So the process for everybody else is orderly, it's clear. People are coming to town with great, great offers.”
    


            The Trump approach is risky, and it may fail to take into account the complexities of the US-China relationship and the political dynamics in Beijing. This is because Xi's attempt to turn his country into a dominant great power is founded in a conceit that the US and other Western powers have historically adopted colonial-style policies to suppress Chinese influence and deprive it of its rightful place in the world. This makes it almost impossible for Xi to be seen as caving to what China regards as US bullying.

Trump's drive against top universities could carry a big economic cost



            Still, the administration has dismissed warnings that China can hurt the US as badly as Washington can hurt it. “They're playing with a pair of twos,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week on CNBC. He argued that since the US exports only a fifth of the total value of goods Beijing sends to the US, its economy would come off worse in a tit-for-tat trade war.
    


            That reasoning and Trump's confidence that his typical brinksmanship and raising of the stakes to intolerable levels, which he honed as a real estate mogul in New York, will be tested in the days to come.
    


            If Trump does manage to reframe the US trading relationship with China, he will claim a significant achievement in a new era of Washington relations with Beijing. For years, presidents of both parties reasoned that by liberalizing China's previously controlled economy, the US could usher its rival into the global rule-based trading system and promote political reforms inside the country. But that calculus began to change at the end of the Obama administration, and Xi's nationalistic rule sharpened the economic and geopolitical showdown between the two sides.
    


            Trump has argued with some justification that expanded trade with China has built a superpower foe that US leaders in both parties now regard as the premier threat to US national security and global power. At the same time, however, cheap clothes and consumer goods such as iPhones have massively improved the material circumstances of millions of Americans, even as globalization has hollowed out US manufacturing heartlands and left a trail of social blight.
    


            Despite the rising tensions and more nervousness to come on the stock markets this week, Trump's aides on Sunday defended the president's approach, which risks tipping into recession an economy that was humming along when he took office less than three months ago.
    


            “This is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” He added: “We've got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here.”
    


            That kind of success rate in negotiating trade deals, which normally take years to clinch, would be remarkable — one reason why many analysts don't take the administration's bombast about offers from foreign nations at face value. The possibility remains that countries such as Japan, India and South Korea, as well as the European Union, will offer Trump splashy concessions he can claim as a big win while they do not fundamentally change bilateral trading relationships.
    


            That would mean one of Trump's core justifications for the tariff war — remaking American manufacturing — would not be achieved. Cosmetic wins for Trump would also fail to justify the trillions of dollars his actions have wiped off global stock markets and the losses he's inflicted on millions of Americans' retirement accounts.
    


            There are growing signs that the president's chaotic economic management is depressing his political standing in a way that will be particularly sensitive for Republican lawmakers in the year before the midterm elections.
    


A new CBS poll Sunday showed that the president's approval ratings over his handling of the economy and inflation have dipped. Some 44% of respondents approve and 56% disapprove of his performance on the economy, while only 40% approve and 60% disapprove on his handling of inflation.  And 75% expect at least short-term price spikes due to tariffs, while 48% expect long-term increases.
    


            These are shaky numbers considering that the real impact of tariffs is yet to be felt by consumers in terms of rising prices. And Trump's bet is particularly hazardous given that his promise to lower the costs of food and housing was at the center of his win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November.
    


            Despite the tense times, one of Trump's loudest boosters in the Cabinet, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, remains bombastic.
    


            “Donald Trump has the ball. I want him to have it. He's the right person with it,” Lutnick said on ABC News' “This Week.” “He knows how to play this game. He knows how to deal with President Xi. This is the right person for the right role, and I am confident this is going to work out with China.”
    


            Yet the mystique of Trump as a master dealmaker, which has been more central to the president's political appeal than anything else, has never faced a tougher test.

Germany's incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that many citizens could see their net wages decline during his government's term due to rising social security contributions and uncertain tax relief.

In an interview with the tabloid Bild on Sunday, Merz addressed concerns that rising costs in Germany's pension, health and long-term care systems are outpacing reforms and eating into household incomes.

“Unfortunately, that's exactly the trend,” Merz said. “We've failed to implement the necessary reforms over the past 30 years.” 

When pressed on whether citizens could end up with less disposable income, Merz responded, “From today's perspective, these fears are certainly not unfounded. But it will be our task to dispel these fears and do the right thing so that at the end of this electoral term, people say: We are better off than at the beginning.”

According to Merz, the coalition agreement between his Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) includes a decision to maintain the pension guarantee – which ensures that a citizen's pension cannot fall below a fixed threshold – until 2031.

Merz signaled, however, that the coalition would seek to implement health and long-term care reforms in the coming years, which are expected to lead to higher costs for households.

Meanwhile, Merz confirmed that the CDU/CSU and the SPD have so far failed to agree on an income tax relief package for workers, but noted that the coalition has committed to reducing corporate taxes.

When asked whether his party had broken promises made during the election campaign regarding the “debt brake,” Merz acknowledged the criticism. While the CDU had previously advocated maintaining a constitutional rule limiting government borrowing, after the election, Merz's bloc and the SPD proposed a €1 trillion debt-financed spending package to invest in defense and infrastructure.

“I understand that. This [debt package] can only be justified if we combine it with the reforms we really need in Germany. And I think we've written the right things in the coalition agreement,” he said.

Merz is expected to be formally confirmed as chancellor in the coming weeks as negotiations with the SPD to form a coalition government continue. His comments come as a recent Ipsos poll put public support for his CDU/CSU bloc at 24%, with the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) overtaking it by 1%.

European nations hostile towards Moscow are advocating for the partitioning of Ukraine, according to Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large overseeing war crime investigations.

Last week, The Times of London reported an alleged US proposal to divide the country, reminiscent of Germany's division following World War II. 

Keith Kellogg, the US presidential envoy for Ukraine cited by the newspaper, later stated that his remarks had been misinterpreted by the British outlet. 

Miroshnik criticized the approach on Saturday as an embodiment of what he called the UK's colonial mindset. “Europe has a habit of slicing up other continents and nations and parceling them out,” he stated in an interview. 

He read the underlying message as the West saying: “We intended to partition Russia. Since we couldn't pull that off, let's divide Ukraine instead.”

The diplomat drew parallels between the proposal in The Times and the aftermath of World War I, noting that turning Arab regions of the former Ottoman Empire into mandate territories governed by the UK and France did not ultimately bode well for the Middle East.

Moscow opposes the presence of any NATO member states' troops in Ukraine, including the post-ceasefire security force suggested by the UK and France. Miroshnik insisted that an “occupation” by those nations would merely confirm Ukraine's status as a de facto “mandate territory” with a puppet government, primarily handled by the British. He added that Russia would not accept such a “toxic” neighbor.

“The time Kiev needs to lick its wounds may be alarmingly brief,” he cautioned. “It needs to reflect on its experiences, prepare, and train tens of thousands more militants via Britain before going to war again.”

Certain European NATO members have advocated for a “resilience force” to be stationed in Ukraine, presenting them as a deterrent. Kellogg said he did not propose dividing the country but rather discussed with the Times the idea of “zones of responsibility,” controlled by Russia, a British-French contingent, and Kiev itself, respectively.

Moscow views the Ukraine conflict as a NATO proxy war. Russian officials have argued that a lasting peace can only be achieved by addressing the fundamental issues, including the expansion of the US-led military bloc in Europe since the 1990s and the “neo-Nazi” character of the current Ukrainian government, which discriminates against ethnic Russians.

Indians have a great amount of love for Russia, Bollywood star John Abraham has said. He praised New Delhi for maintaining strong ties with Moscow despite Western pressure.

“Across the board, if you talk about Russia in India, we love Russia, we love Russians, and we love everything that is Russian,” Abraham told RT's Oksana Boyko on the ‘Worlds Apart' show.

Indian-Russian ties transcend political lines, according to the actor. “I'm not pro- or anti- the Indian government and don't have any political inclinations. But I think we took a damn good standand we've got a fantastic external affairs minister who goes out there and he speaks his mind on us (India) buying Russian oil, on why we need to do what we need to do, because we need to protect our country as well,” Abraham stated.

Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar has repeatedly defended New Delhi's decision to increase oil purchases from Russia after the US and its allies slapped Moscow with unprecedented sanctions over the Ukraine conflict.

Abraham defended the choice to maintain strong ties with Russia, calling it the “best decision” and arguing that it was necessary to protect India's interests and uphold its long-standing friendship with Moscow. 

The actor said Moscow's emphasis on its sovereignty and its refusal to be influenced by Western powers has also made more Indians identify with Russia's sentiments. “Both Russia and India, as well as other countries, may be sharing this sentiment, which involves recognizing and embracing their individual strengths and challenges,” he stated.

Abraham, whose father is of Syrian Christian heritage from the southern state of Kerala, and whose mother has Iranian Zoroastrian or Parsi roots, also touched upon India's ability to accommodate diverse communities, citing his own minority status as a testament to this. “I'm probably...a shining example and I'm really proud of where my country is going and I'm a staunch believer in its future,” he said.

The actor also expressed a desire to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person, saying: “I find him to be a strong personality and am curious to understand his thoughts and mindset, especially given the significant global pressure on him and his country.”

Putin has accepted an invitation from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make an official visit to the country later this year. Preparations for the event are underway, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

Russia is South Africa's principal partner in the advancement of its national space program, Patrick Ndlovu, chairman of the board at the South African National Space Agency (SANSA), has told Sputnik Africa.

During celebrations for Cosmonautics Day on Saturday, Ndlovu, who also serves as CEO of Infinity Integrated Solutions, said that Pretoria “has received most of its support from the Russian Federation.” He expressed confidence that through this partnership, the country's space sector would continue “naturally growing.”

“I must say that Russia has been the most willing to partner with South Africa on various mutually beneficial grounds to actually advance our space and mission as a nation,” the SANSA chairman said.

In addition to its collaboration with Russia, Ndlovu explained that South Africa is making significant contributions to global space exploration by utilizing its strategic geographic location to host advanced equipment for international space agencies and commercial satellite operators.

As an example, he mentioned the deployment of a space debris-tracking telescope operated by Roscosmos, Russia's space agency.

South Africa has also preserved the legacy of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin by maintaining a bust of him at one of its space facilities. According to a SANSA representative, this is intended to inspire younger generations of South Africans and to honor a pioneering figure in space history.

In June, Alexander Lutovinov, a correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation with South Africa in space communications. Speaking at the RAS Presidium, he highlighted the importance of expanding “cooperation in the field of astronomy and space research,” TASS reported.

Earlier in May, Humbulani Mudau, the CEO of SANSA, announced South Africa's support for Russia's proposal to establish a BRICS Space Council to strengthen space cooperation among member states.

“We see the Russian proposal to create a BRICS space council. We will develop our cooperation in this direction; South Africa supports this initiative,” Mudau stated.

Germany's chemical industry is in a “severe crisis” and in dire need of a return to cheap Russian gas, Reuters reported on Monday, citing executives in the sector. French energy majors Engie and Total have also told the agency that they could see a restart of imports of  hydrocarbon from Russia.

With a turnover of €225.5 billion in 2023, chemicals and pharmaceuticals are Germany's third-largest industry, behind automotive and machinery and equipment, according to the European Chemical Industry Council.

The EU committed to eliminating Russian gas imports by 2027, following the escalation of conflict between Kiev and Moscow three years ago. Brussels aimed  to replace them with more expensive  liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar and the United States. 

Talks with Qatar have stalled however, and Washington's shift away from the EU under US President Donald Trump, along with his tariff campaign, have left bloc chiefs concerned about the reliability of American supplies.

“We are in a severe crisis and can't wait,” Christof Guenther, managing director of InfraLeuna told Reuters. InfraLeuna hosts Dow Chemical and Shell plants and is one of Germany's biggest chemical manufacturing clusters.

“It's a taboo topic,” Guenther added, saying that many of his colleagues have agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas.

Before 2022, Russia met up to 60% of Germany's demand for natural gas. The loss of an affordable supply has led to increased energy costs, resulting in production cuts and job losses across the country's industrial sector.

“We need Russian gas, we need cheap energy - no matter where it comes from,” said Klaus Paur, managing director of Leuna-Harze, a petrochemical maker at Leuna Park. 

French energy firms Engie and Total have also spoken out in favor of resuming gas purchases from Russia.

“If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60 billion cubic meters (bcm), maybe 70, annually…” Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at Engie, told Reuters.

The EU used to import 150 bcm of pipeline gas from Russia every year, which covered 40% of its needs. After the Ukraine conflict is settled, the country could account for 20-25%, Holleaux said.

”Europe will never go back to importing 150 bcm…but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne suggested.

Russia has long reiterated that it is a reliable energy supplier, with the Kremlin saying in January that Moscow would resume gas deliveries to the EU, provided that there are buyers. 

Russian gas reached Germany and on to the wider EU via the Nord Stream undersea pipelines, which were damaged in a sabotage attack in 2022.  However, one string of Nord Stream 2, remains intact. 

The EU still receives Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline, which runs through Turkey and the Balkans. 

A key pipeline that delivered gas to Italy, Slovakia and Hungary via Ukraine was closed after Kiev refused to extend a transit agreement in January, and blew up a gas metering station on the border.

Former US President Joe Biden is directly responsible for allowing the Ukraine crisis to escalate into hostilities between Moscow and Kiev, his successor Donald Trump has said. 

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump argued that if he had won the 2020 election, the US would not be dealing with the Ukraine conflict and the Middle East crisis, and would have avoided an “embarrassing” withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Trump described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as “Biden's war.” “This is not my war. I've been here for a very short period of time... He gave them billions and billions of dollars. He should have never allowed – If he had any brain, which he didn't have and doesn't have… – that war to start.”

“I think frankly he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] had so little respect for Biden that he started it for that reason. And obviously, he didn't get along very well with [Ukraine's Vladimir] Zelensky or anybody else. And now you have millions of dead people, and those people – every one of them – should be alive right now,” Trump added.

The US president reiterated that settling the conflict remains a top priority but acknowledged the challenges involved, describing it as “a deeply seated war.”

The US committed around $175 billion in aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration, including advanced weapons systems, ammunition, and direct financial assistance. Biden pledged to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes,” while consistently refusing to engage in direct top-level talks with the Kremlin.

In contrast, Trump has resumed dialogue with Moscow since returning to office in January. Russian and US delegations have held several rounds of high-level talks in recent months on settling the Ukraine conflict and restoring bilateral relations. 

While Russia has welcomed the renewed contact and described the engagement as productive, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that resolving long-standing issues in US-Russia relations will take time. 

“We are now walking down this road together, very patiently. We have many more steps to take, but one just needs to understand how serious the damage is that was done to bilateral Russia-US relations under the previous administration,” Peskov said on Sunday. “Painstaking work is now being done to eliminate these consequences.”

Secretary of state says ‘criminals' were taken to country thanks to alliance between Trump and Nayib Bukele

The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members to El Salvador, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday, a day before that country's president is due to visit the White House.

“Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said in an X/Twitter post.

Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador. The alliance between @POTUS and President @nayibbukele has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere.

The alliance between Donald Trump and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”, Rubio added. The US president is due to meet Bukele at the White House on Monday.

It comes as US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported, despite a supreme court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” his return to the US.

Attorneys for the Trump administration said the high court's order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador.

The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge's order blocking his removal to El Salvador. Trump administration lawyers were able to confirm on Saturday that García remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Trump said on Saturday he was looking forward to meeting Bukele and praised him for taking “enemy aliens” from the United States. He said the two countries were working closely to “eradicate terrorist organizations”.

Administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members that they have not backed up in court.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.

Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization.

The deportations have been challenged in federal court. The US supreme court said the US government must give sufficient notice to immigrant detainees to allow them to contest their deportations. It did not say how those already in El Salvador could seek judicial review of their removals.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The truth is, we were always dangerously overexposed to decisions made in Washington – consider this chaotic moment an opportunity

“People speak with forked tongues about America,” a veteran foreign correspondent once said to me. It was a long time ago – during a debate about whether the US should intervene in a foreign conflict – and I have never forgotten it. What they meant was that just as the US is condemned for foreign intervention in some instances, it is also called upon to do so in others and then judged for not upholding its moral standards. That dissonance persists, and is even more jarring as we approach the 100th day of Donald Trump's second term. There is a duality to how the US is seen: as both a country that wantonly violates international law and as the only one capable of upholding that system of law and order. This duality, always tense, is no longer sustainable.

I have felt this ambivalence myself – the contradictory demand that the US stay out of it but also anger that it is not doing more. In Sudan, Washington frustratingly refuses to pressure its ally, the UAE, into stopping pumping arms and funding into the conflict. But what proof or history is there to support the delusional notion that the US cares about a conflict in which it has no direct interest? It is an expectation of moral policing from an amoral player that I remember even in childhood, after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the Arab world was rocked with fear of regional war. A fierce debate in our classroom in Sudan on the merits of US intervention was silenced by one indignant evacuee from Kuwait, who said that the most important thing was to defeat Saddam Hussein. Her words occasionally echo in my mind: “We must deal with the greater evil first.”

Even in Gaza, as Congress passed package after package of billions in military aid to Israel, there remained some residual hope – long extinguished now – that the phone call to Benjamin Netanyahu would finally come. And even as Trump emboldens Vladimir Putin, abandons Ukraine and slaps tariffs on allies, you can detect that belief in the fundamental viability of the US as an actor that can still default to rationality, and even morality.

But, for the first time that I can remember, the conversation is going in a new direction. The appeals to the difference between the presidency and other more solid US institutions are quieter now, as universities, law firms and even parts of the press kowtow to their erratic new king. The questions now being asked are about how Europe and the rest of the world can pivot away from the US, from its USAID programmes nestled within the health budgets of developing countries, and its global system of military assistance and deterrence. But they sound less like practical suggestions and more like attempts to get heads around a reality that is impossible to countenance.

The challenge is technical and psychological. It is difficult to imagine a post-American world because America crafted that world. When the US becomes a volatile actor, the very architecture of the global financial order starts to wobble. We saw this in the crisis of confidence in the dollar in the aftermath of Trump's “liberation-day” tariffs. The robustness of the rule of law and separation of powers – cornerstones of confidence in an economy – are also now in doubt, as the administration goes to war with its own judiciary and the president himself boasts about how many people in the room with him made a killing out of his stock market crash. Is it insider trading if your source is the president?

Just as formidable is the mental task of divestment from the US. A friend who holds a green card but lives under an illiberal regime in Asia told me that, deep down, he always felt protected from the dangers of his country's domestic politics by the knowledge that there was a safe haven to which he could retreat in case of persecution. No longer, as legal residents and visitors are hounded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) or turned away at the border. I know others who have cancelled work trips to the US for fear of deportation or blacklisting. With that insecurity comes an awareness that, for some in the global south who always knew that the US was not a benign presence, there was still the belief that there was something within its own borders that curbed its excesses. This was partly true, but also a reflection of US cultural power. The pursuit of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, “give me … your huddled masses”, the Obama hope iconography; all resonant and powerful touchstones. They are now reduced to dust. It is one thing to know that the US was never the sum of these parts, but another to accept it.

And there is a fear in accepting it. Because, for all its violations, the advent of a post-US world induces a feeling of vertigo. A world in which there is no final authority at all might be scarier than a world where there is a deeply flawed one. What is daunting is the prospect of anarchy, a new world where there is no organising principle in a post-ideological, everyone-for-themselves system. Not a cold war order divided into capitalist, communist and non-aligned. And not a post-cold war one divided into western liberal overlords, competing non-democracies and, below them, smaller clients of both.

But what the US's breakdown should really trigger is not overwhelm and bewilderment, but a project to build a new global order in which we all have a stake. What the US chooses to do in terms of foreign and economic policy can affect your shopping basket and the very borders of the nation state in which you live. It remains the world's largest economy, has the world's largest military, and is the home of the world's most powerful entertainment complex. This centrality combined with its collapse reveals the fact that the problem goes deeper than Trump. The world was always dangerously overexposed to whatever direction the US took.

Ironically, this all might be the beginning of a process that leads to genuine “liberation days” for other countries, but not the US itself. There is pain ahead, but also a sort of independence. Above all, there might finally be a recognition that the US's definition of peace and prosperity was always its own, enforced by sheer force of power and propaganda.

Impose ceasefire on Russia, says France's Macron, as leaders condemn deadly Palm Sunday strike on Sumy. What we know on day 1,146

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has urged Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to “understand what Putin did”. In a CBS interview broadcast on Sunday, Zelenskyy said: “Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead.”

Russia's missile strike on Sunday on the Ukrainian city of Sumy showed the urgent need to impose a ceasefire on Russia, declared the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “Everyone knows it is Russia alone that wants this war. Today it is clear that Russia alone wants to continue with it, showing its scorn for human life, international law and diplomatic efforts made by President [Donald] Trump,” said Macron. “Strong measures are needed to impose a ceasefire on Russia. France is working tirelessly toward this goal, alongside its partners.”

At least 34 people were killed, writes Luke Harding, and 83 others wounded by the Russian ballistic missile strikes in Sumy on Sunday morning. Two missiles landed in the crowded city centre as people went to church for Palm Sunday. One hit a trolley bus full of passengers. Two of the dead were children.

Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, called it “a perfidious act … and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended”. Merz, speaking to broadcaster ARD, said: “That is the response, that is what [Vladimir] Putin does to those who talk with him of a ceasefire. Our willingness to discuss with him is interpreted not as a serious offer to make peace, but as weakness.” Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said she condemned this “new horrible and cowardly Russian attack … which goes against all real engagement in favour of peace”.

The EU chief, Antonio Costa, said: “Russia continues its campaign of violence, showing once again that this war exists and endures only because Russia chooses so.” The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was ‘appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy” and the Russian president “must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without conditions”.

Donald Trump late on Sunday said the Russian strike on Sumy was “a horrible thing”. “I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing,” he told reporters on board Air Force One while headed back to Washington. Asked to clarify what he meant by a “mistake”, Trump said that “they made a mistake … you're gonna ask them” – without specifying who or what he meant, Agence France-Presse reported.

There was condemnation from elsewhere in the Trump administration on Sunday. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said: “The United States extends our deepest condolences to the victims of today's horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy. This is a tragic reminder of why President Trump and his administration are putting so much time and effort into trying to end this war and achieve a just and durable peace. The US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg – who has played little visible part in trying to bring about a ceasefire – said: “Today's Palm Sunday attack by Russian forces on civilian targets in Sumy crosses any line of decency.”

Dan Sabbagh analyses whether the civilian toll in Sumy could force the Trump administration to toughen its line in peace talks with Russia that have hardly developed in two months. Washington's approach, under Trump, has been to try to negotiate an end to the war by talking directly with Moscow, while remaining mostly silent on Russian attacks on civilians.

Zelenskyy called on allies to put “strong pressure” on Russia or it would continue to drag out the war. “It's been two months since Putin ignored America's proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said. “Unfortunately, they in Moscow are confident that they can afford to keep killing. We need to act to change the situation.”

Military representatives of Turkey and foreign nations will meet in Turkey on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss Black Sea security in the event of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, the Turkish defence ministry said on Sunday. It did not specify the countries attending.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific – moves that pose a challenge for the US president

In the space of just five weeks, China held live-fire drills on the doorsteps of Australia, Taiwan and Vietnam. It tested new landing barges on ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country's internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having.

China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it's also testing the thinking of a bigger rival further afield: Donald Trump.

Since Trump took office in January, he and his cabinet members have focused their China strategy on tariffs and have launched an escalating trade war with Beijing. They had been largely silent on China's growing acts of aggression in the Indo-Pacific's seas.

That's starting to change.

On April 1, the US state department condemned Beijing's “aggressive military activities and rhetoric” in relation to unannounced military drills in the Taiwan Strait, which have become bigger in scale in recent months and are increasingly resembling actual invasion. That came on the heels of a visit to the region by US defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he assured Japan and the Philippines that America would continue to defend them against China. He clarified the US had not changed its status quo stance on Taiwan, and the Pentagon reiterated China remained the US' biggest threat.

But the US's Indo-Pacific allies will want to hear those assurances from Trump, who has not shown his cards on issues like Taiwan. When asked by a journalist in February for his stance, Trump refused to be drawn and has said nothing on Taiwan since. He's not afraid to diverge from his senior advisers, and his haphazard approach to Ukraine ceasefire talks – and tariffs – gives little confidence the president has a consistent, long-term strategy on any given global affair.

“The Chinese are watching what's happening with the Trump administration and seeing how far they can push things,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

And in their testing of Trump, the seas around China are likely to become more restive, Davis said, adding that China will keep ratcheting up its drills in the Taiwan Strait and target countries with which it has territorial disputes, including the Philippines and Japan.

“China will be more willing to impose the risk of casualties on the Philippines through ramming ships and so forth. It might go from using water cannon to something a bit more aggressive,” Davis said. “The goal is to intimidate Manila into accepting China's interests.”

How heavily involved the US military should get in the Indo-Pacific and how far the US should go to protect Taiwan from China are issues that have divided Trump's most senior officials, according to a former state department staffer who worked in Trump's initial weeks in office.

“There are definitely different competing camps that you could liken to a royal court, all competing for the last word and influence with Trump,” the former staffer said. “There is definitely a split over Taiwan policy between traditional NatSec folks like (Marco) Rubio and (Mike) Waltz versus Maga folks.”

But which side Trump is on isn't clear.

Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute's international security program, said it was known that a faction of the Trump administration wanted to turn away from Europe. “But it's not at all clear that he agrees with the second part of it – doing more in Asia,” he said.

What is clear from Trump's posture in Ukraine talks is that he is open to putting deals on trade and major geopolitical issues on the same table. He also has a tendency to change his stance on a subject in a matter of days.

Beijing will be watching to see how Trump sways. If Russia's Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan.

And that's causing anxiety among the US's closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. “Even the prospect for a ‘grand bargain' with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,” she said.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China “deplores” the US' criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them “a mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China's internal affairs.”

What Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet.

The lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.

He points to mass firings in the country's intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US's bargaining position in trade talks.

China will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. A Reuters report suggests it already is.

“We're blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,” Russel said.

The defunding of Radio Free Asia – a sister organisation of Voice of America – is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea.

“It's a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,” Russel said of the cuts. “Why are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There's a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.”

That may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial.

A Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia's southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables – critical infrastructure that allows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets.

“I'd prefer it wasn't there,” is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts.

Prime minister accuses opposition of ‘borrowing ideas' and says ‘there's lots of really good Australian music around'

Anthony Albanese says Liberal campaign tactics such as releasing a hip-hop diss track against Labor are “beyond my comprehension”, accusing his opponents of “borrowing ideas” in their election pitch.

The Liberal campaign released a rap song with lyrics critical of Labor's record on the cost of living, claiming the economy was “looking a mess” and that “eggs and cheese” cost $100. The song, titled Leaving Labor, was shared on the opposition's SoundCloud account on Monday. While Coalition sources maintained the song was not generated by artificial intelligence, the campaign did not reveal the artist behind it, only saying it was a “commercial artist”.

Hours after the Liberal campaign had shared the song with journalists, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was asked about it at a press conference, and said he had not heard it. “I'm sure the gurus have put together a cracking ad,” he said.

At his own press conference in Tasmania, the prime minister said jokingly that the song had been “drawn to my attention”.

“The Liberal party can explain their own campaign,” he said at a paper mill in Boyer, north of Hobart. “Some of it is way beyond my comprehension, some of the things they're doing in this campaign.”The noted rock'n'roll fan continued: “You know, there's lots of really good Australian music around.”

“We heard one of those at my campaign launch yesterday: Sounds of Then by the great Ganggajang. We can all sing ‘This is Australia',” he said.

“We are a different country. I'm running as an Australian prime minister on Australian values. I'll leave it to others to see why they consistently just borrow cultures and ideas and policies from other places as well.”

Albanese and Labor have regularly used American music in campaign videos online. One recent video of Albanese was soundtracked by a Kendrick Lamar song; Labor has also referenced Sabrina Carpenter or her music in several posts.

When sharing the song, Coalition sources referenced famous American rap feuds including Drake and Lamar, and Nas and Jay-Z. The cover art for the song, with Albanese's face superimposed on shrugging emojis, appeared to be a nod to Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy, which was referenced several times in diss tracks from Lamar during their 2024 feud.

Critics and music fans reached broad consensus Drake lost the feud after a weeks-long public battle with Lamar, who later performed several songs criticising him at the February 2025 NFL Super Bowl.

Leaving Labor includes lyrics such as: “We living cheque to cheque / Labor's got us feeling so stressed”; “We need to find a solution / we need to switch up the people in power”; and “Albo's got to leave”.

The song carries an authorisation message at the end for the Liberal party.

Comments about the song on SoundCloudwere mostly negative.

The track recalled a similar stunt from the Liberals in the 2022 election, an ad jingle titled There's a hole in your budget, later released with a “club remix”.

The Coalition senator Matt Canavan backed the new song on Monday as a “catchy tune”, but when asked if he'd put it on his own playlist, admitted “probably not”.

“If it gets the message out … If it makes people to understand those real issues which are causing pain for everyday Australians, I'm all for it,” he told ABC's Afternoon Briefing.

The Greens senator Barbara Pocock, on the same panel, suggested it was “not going to be a memorable hit for the 2025 election”.

“If you want to connect with young people, have some policies that actually matter to them: deal with student debt, talk about housing and make real changes that make a difference,” she said.

“If Peter Dutton needed a theme song, it should involve backflips.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Environment minister says experts ‘actively working' to prevent leaks in wake of February attack; Russian foreign minister praises Donald Trump for his understanding of the conflict. What we know on day 1,145

Ukraine is seeking solutions to repair the damage caused by a Russian drone attack to the confinement vessel at the stricken Chornobyl nuclear power plant, a government minister said on Saturday. Environment minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said Ukraine was working together with experts to determine the best way to restore the proper functioning of the containment vessel, or arch, after the 14 February drone strike. “We are actively working on this ... We, of course, need to restore the ‘arch' so that there are no leaks under any circumstances, because ensuring nuclear and radiation safety is the main task,” she said. The arch was installed in 2019 to cover the leaking “sarcophagus” underneath, hurriedly put in place in the weeks following the 1986 Chornobyl disaster. The February drone attack punched a large hole in the new containment structure's outer cover and exploded inside.

Russia and Ukraine's top diplomats on Saturday used a conference in Turkey to trade accusations of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha says Russia has launched daily attacks at Ukraine since agreeing to the pause. Sybiha said Russia had launched “almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 (exploding) drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians,” since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov insisted Moscow has stuck to the terms of a limited 30-day ceasefire. Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine had carried out five attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the past day.

Lavrov praised Donald Trump on Saturday for what he said was a better understanding of the Ukraine conflict than any other western leader. “President Trump was the first and so far, I think, almost the only one among the western leaders who repeatedly, with conviction, several times stated that it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into Nato,” Lavrov said at the Antalya diplomacy forum in southern Turkey. Trump has previously said it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory, and that he was “OK” with Ukraine not having Nato membership.

The US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said his remarks over a possible partition of Ukraine had been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal. Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country.

The US has demanded control of a crucial pipeline in Ukraine used to send Russian gas to Europe, according to reports, in a move described as a colonial shakedown. US and Ukrainian officials met on Friday to discuss White House proposals for a minerals deal. Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration.

Russia's ambassador to the UK has not denied allegations that Russian sensors have been hidden in seas around Great Britain in an attempt to track UK nuclear submarines. Andrei Kelin told the BBC on Sunday that while he did not deny Russia was attempting to track British submarines, he rejected the idea that such activities presented a threat to the UK. “All these threats are extremely exaggerated,” he said.

US envoy Steve Witkoff wrapped up his latest talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday, after Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart to move quicker to end what he said was the country's “senseless war” with Ukraine. The Kremlin said afterwards only that the meeting had taken place and “focused on various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement”, without elaborating. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said earlier that he expected no diplomatic “breakthroughs” from the talks – Witkoff's third with Putin since February.

A Russian guided bomb struck a house in the north-eastern Ukrainian town of Kupiansk, injuring four people and possibly trapping three more under rubble, the regional governor said. Kupiansk, located in Kharkiv region, was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It was recaptured by Ukrainian troops later that year in a lightning counteroffensive.

A Ukrainian F-16 pilot was killed in combat, Kyiv said Saturday, in the second such incident since the delivery of the precious US-made fighter jets to Ukraine to help fight Russia's invasion. The army did not give more details on the circumstances of how he died and said that a commission was working to establish “all the circumstances of the tragedy.” Kyiv received the first deliveries of F-16s last year, after spending two years pushing for them.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

PS5 digital price in UK would rise to £430 and €500 in Europe as Japanese games developer cites ‘challenging economic environment'

Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation 5 by 25% as the video game industry reels from the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs.

The Japanese game developer said it had made the “tough decision” to raise the price of the console's digital edition to £429.99 in the UK and €499.99 in Europe, starting from Monday. There will be no price change for the standard PS5, which comes with a disk drive.

The company cited “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” behind its decision to increase the retail price of the PS5 in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania.

In Australia, the standard PS5 will rise to A$829.95, while the digital edition will increase to A$749.95. In New Zealand, the standard console will increase to NZ$949.95, and the digital to NZ$859.95.

The technology industry has been grappling with the possible impact of President Trump's tariffs on its supply chains. Rival Japanese game developer Nintendo unveiled its new handheld console, the Switch 2, the day before Trump launched his barrage of “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign goods on 2 April. A few days later, the company postponed preorders of the device in the US, as it said it would need to assess the potential effect of tariffs.

Japan was hit with a 24% tariff on its exports to the US on Trump's “liberation day” on 2 April. Like most of Trump's new tariffs, they have been paused for 90 days. However, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday that his country did not plan to make big concessions in negotiations with the US and that it would not rush to reach a deal. Talks between the two governments are due this week.

Companies such as Apple, whose products are largely assembled in China, are also bracing for higher costs. Analysts at the investment bank UBS have warned that the price of an iPhone 16 Max, with 256GB of storage, could rise 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), based on a total tariff of 145%.

While there is still a great deal of uncertainty around Trump's trade policy, Japanese shares rose on Monday after the US said it would pause levies on some electronics, including smartphones. Tokyo's index of blue chip stocks, the Nikkei 225, closed up 1%.

However, US officials said on Sunday that the pause on smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, with Trump warning on Sunday that no one was “getting off the hook”.

Trump's tariff chaos has naturally scared some Britons back into the safety of savings accounts – but investing is about playing the long game

Recent headlines about stock markets in freefall and graphs with downward arrows are not what you would choose as a backdrop to persuading people to move from cash savings into riskier investments.

But that was what the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was faced with after announcing that a review of cash and shares Isas was on the way.

A week after her March spring statement included confirmation that the government was considering changes to the tax-efficient accounts “to earn ­better returns for savers, boost the culture of retail investment, and support the growth mission”, Donald Trump put the frighteners on ­investors with his tariffs announcement.

But while they may have dodged losses linked to recent market gyrations, those who hold only savings accounts have missed out on some serious stock market gains in recent years. Figures issued by the Investment Association at the end of March showed that £10,000 put into a cash Isa five years ago would in effect be worth £8,713 “in today's money” once inflation was taken into account. By contrast, the same sum put into a stocks and shares Isa that invested in a global equity fund would have been worth £12,249, it said. That figure was issued on 27 March, before the stock market turmoil of the last few days.

Ruth Handcock, the chief executive of the money advice company Octopus Money, says that over most periods, investments have outperformed cash savings.

“The reasons for not investing are not logical,” she says. While everyone needs some cash they can get their hands on in an emergency, “people who only save see the value of their money eroded by inflation”, she adds.

Despite that, figures from the investment firm Aberdeen show that typically, after property and pension savings, people in the UK choose to stash their money on deposit – in a bank, building society, at National Savings and Investments, or one of the new app-based providers.

Aberdeen says UK consumers hold an average of 15% of their assets in cash, compared with 8% in stocks. That compares with 13% for each among French consumers, and with 10% and 33% respectively in the US.

Among the countries the company compared, the UK was not the most cash-heavy – in Japan, 35% of savings were in cash – but British residents had the ­smallest proportion of their assets in the markets.

Separate research by the Investment Association found that in 2023, only 39% of UK adults were actively investing – which included buying cryptocurrency and other assets.

While not everyone has enough money to put by for the long term, even among those who seemingly do have something spare to put by, there is a high reliance on cash accounts.

So why are we a nation of savers, not investors?

Alexander Joshi, the head of behavioural insight at Barclays Private Bank, says its research has shown there are two main reasons why people stick to cash: “Firstly, they find investing too confusing and complicated. Secondly, they perceive it to be too risky,” he says. “A fifth of UK adults who don't invest say it's because they have insufficient knowledge, and a quarter say it's because investing is too complicated.”

Handcock blames the “paucity of help that's available” to people who do not know what to do with their money.

Richard Wilson, the chief operating officer at Aberdeen, says the UK has “failed for years to spark a national culture of retail investing – a culture that you see embedded in the US”.

He says there is a need for better financial education.

“We also need a more competitive stock market. That means no stamp duty [tax] on UK shares, and a friction-free, simpler Isa system,” Wilson says. “While Isas have clearly enjoyed many successes, the brand has been stretched too far, and high levels of complexity risk putting people off altogether.”

The government's plans include a review of Isas, though it has dropped the idea of one designed to incentivise people to put money specifically in UK shares. It is also working with the City regulator on ways to make financial advice more accessible.

It acknowledges that not everyone can afford to invest, and that people should have emergency funds that are easily available and safe. But it wants to increase investment by those who can afford it.

Handcock says Isas could be better set up to encourage investment and that people's personal savings allowance should be used more to encourage the use of bank and building society accounts. “How do you create the ladder to investing? We've relied on the Isa to do that, and people have got stuck at cash,” she says. Instead, the focus could be on stocks and shares Isas. “What we'd then need is help to use it.”

For anyone wavering between investing and saving, this month's severe stock market turbulence could easily have tipped the scales in favour of a bank or building society account.

Joshi says: “Those who are reluctant to invest may be experiencing ‘confirmation bias'. In simple terms, they are overly focusing on information about investing that ­confirms their pre-existing beliefs, which might be negative to begin with.”

He says the current uncertainty will naturally make people more cautious when it comes to their money.

“An expectation of rising living costs is likely to make people more conscious of their day-to-day spending, and it may cause them to shy away from risk, especially when it comes to investing,” he says. “In the short term, recency bias is also likely to play a factor, because people tend to overweight the importance of recent events at the expense of their long-term objectives or financial goals.”

However, investing is all about playing the long game. “As they say: time in the market beats timing the market,” Joshi says. “If people are still unsure, one option is to start with small investments to gain confidence and to build from there.”

 Only invest money you don't need soon. Investments are long-term and you will be able to ride out the ups and downs in the stock markets if you do not need to withdraw the money when things are going badly.

 Instead of trying to pick individual stocks and shares, go for a fund. This means you don't have to research hundreds of companies to find the right ones, and allows you to spread your money more widely, as you can, in effect, own bits of lots of shares.

 Choosing a low-cost tracker fund is a good place to start if you are not going to put in much money. Tracker funds tend to have the lowest charges – they focus on a certain market and try to follow its performance.

 Invest regularly rather than putting in a lump sum. The best way to avoid any scary losses is to invest regular sums. When the market is lower, you are buying more units for your money and stand to gain when it recovers – so you make a virtue of any dips.

 Investments held in an Isa are not subject to tax. Although you are starting small, you might want to put in more money as you get more confident, and if your choices perform well, you may be grateful you have shielded your gains.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Good news at last: just a little exercise can reduce the risk of dementia","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/14/exercise-risk-dementia-study-middle-age","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:32:00 GMT","

A recent study shows the benefit of being a middle-aged ‘weekend warrior' who only exercises once or twice a week

In these bleak times, glimmers of hope often seem to come out of the pages of scientific research. Take what we know about exercise. Just in the past few months, we've learned that moderate exercise may almost halve the risk of postpartum depression for new mothers, and that even five minutes of exercise a day could help lower blood pressure.

But what really caught my eye recently was a study from Latin America that included roughly 10,000 people who were assessed over two decades using the Mexico City prospective study. The research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examined cognitive function with the aim of understanding the impact of exercise on mental ability, including mild dementia. The researchers took account of confounding variables such as age, diet, smoking and alcohol intake, nightly sleep and educational attainment, which have all been shown to affect overall health and wellbeing. By controlling for these factors, the contribution of physical activity towards mild cognitive impairment was estimated.

The study found that “weekend warriors” – that is people who exercise only once or twice a week – were 25% less likely to develop mild dementia than those who didn't exercise at all; while those who were regularly active (at least three times a week) were 11% less likely. The authors of the study didn't address why weekend warriors actually fared better than regular exercisers, but focused on the big picture: they estimate that 13% of mild dementia cases could be avoided if all middle-aged adults exercised at least once or twice a week.

While we have known about the benefits of physical activity for physical health, such as preventing diabetes and hypertension, for a long time, newer research is pointing to the positive effects on our minds. As a personal trainer, I'm used to telling individual clients and classes how we can make certain muscles “stronger”. But people should also be encouraged to think more expansively about what's going on – to visualise their muscles producing small proteins travelling up to their brain to protect neural matter. This is what makes us feel happy and helps delay mild dementia. Referred to as “muscle-brain cross-talk”, exercise has increasingly been prescribed as an effective intervention for depression.

The latest analysis on mild dementia and exercise is exciting to read because it shows that you don't have to do huge amounts of exercise – punishing daily regimes – to reap significant benefits to your health. So stop stressing if you can't, or don't want to, get up at 6am to exercise before work each day, or can't make it to the gym in the evening because you prefer to see your friends or family. You can also look at your overall fitness plan, if you have one, in a weekly block, rather than being guilty if a few days go by when you're not able to fit in movement. How active are you over seven days, and where can you add in enjoyable and easy ways to get moving – whether it's a Sunday morning jog or a Saturday afternoon swim?

Those of us in the physical activity community often think about optimising fitness – what is the best exercise, compound set of moves, or new hack to introduce? But this incremental fixation, which is really about the fit becoming fitter, and tinkering around the edges, misses the bigger picture: the wider public health challenge of getting those who are inactive, or feel like they're not sporty, to get moving. So three cheers to the researchers in Mexico City if it's the incentive you need – even just a little bit of exercise can go a long way.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A man is facing charges after authorities say he broke into the Pennsylvania governor's mansion in the middle of the night, set a fire that left significant damage and forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building during the Jewish holiday of Passover.

Firefighters extinguished the fire early Sunday morning and no injuries were reported. The suspect, identified as Cody Balmer, 38, was arrested nearby later in the day, police said. 

Balmer, who turned himself in to police, told them that he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he found him, according to court documents released Monday. 

Authorities said they were investigating how someone was able to elude police to break into the governor's residence in Harrisburg.

Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris said the fire was a carefully planned attack but emphasized the investigation is continuing. He did not give a possible motive.

Balmer apparently scaled an iron security fence that stands around 7 feet (2.1 meters) and is monitored by security cameras, police said. 

Police became aware someone had climbed over the fence and began a pursuit on the grounds but initially didn't locate anyone.

Police allege Balmer broke into the southern wing of the residence, entering a room often used to entertain crowds and display art, and set a fire using a homemade incendiary device. Police said two broken glass beer bottles containing gasoline were found. The fire left significant damage to the room, charring walls, tables, buffet serving dishes, plates and a piano. Window panes and brick around doors and windows were blackened.

Balmer was inside for around a minute before he left and escaped the premises, authorities said. 

Authorities said Balmer, who turned himself in after police received a call from a female “ex-paramour” who said he confessed, faces charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. 

Balmer, who had walked about an hour from his home to the governor's residence, “admitted to harboring hatred towards Governor Shapiro,” according to a police affidavit. No reason was given. 

Balmer has faced criminal charges over the past decade including simple assault, theft and forgery, according to online court records. He drew a sentence of probation after guilty pleas to theft and forgery counts. Simple assault charges from 2023 appeared unresolved.

Authorities did not say whether Balmer has a lawyer. One recent residence listed for him in Harrisburg was condemned in 2022.

Balmer's mother told The Associated Press on Monday that she had tried in recent days to get him assistance for mental health issues, but “nobody would help.” She said her son had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The AP was not able to verify that information.

“He wasn't taking his medicine, and that's all I want to say,” Christie Balmer said, speaking at the family home in Harrisburg.

Balmer was taken to a hospital for treatment following an undisclosed medical event not connected to the incident or his arrest, authorities said Monday. Balmer remains under state police supervision and will be transported to the Dauphin County jail for arraignment upon his release, though it was not clear how long he would be at the hospital.

Shapiro, 51, is the first-term governor of the nation's fifth-most populous state, a presidential battleground that has helped make him a rising star in the Democratic Party and viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028.

Shapiro said he, his wife, their four children, two dogs and another family had celebrated Passover at the residence on Saturday and were awakened by state troopers pounding on their doors at about 2 a.m. Sunday. 

Shapiro has been outspoken about his Jewish faith.

He used his first ad in his campaign for governor in 2022 to tell family stories and describe his commitment to making “it home Friday night for Sabbath dinner,” complete with footage of him and his children at the table. 

“Family and faith ground me,” he said.

In stump speeches and his election-night victory speech, Shapiro regularly quoted an ancient rabbinic maxim: “No one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.”

The attack happened on the Jewish holiday of Passover, which began at sundown Saturday. 

The holiday commemorates the Israelites' liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt, including their 40-year journey through the desert. It is one of the holiest days of the year for Jews and is celebrated with a special meal called a Seder, which includes the eating of matzah, a type of unleavened bread, and the retelling of the Exodus story.

Shapiro had celebrated with a Seder at the official residence with his family and members of the Jewish community in the same room where authorities said the fire was set.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — China's leader Xi Jinping said no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, presenting China as a force for stability in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's latest moves on tariffs,

Although Trump has paused some tariffs, he has kept in place 145% duties on China, the world's second-largest economy. 

“There are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war,” Xi wrote in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media. “Our two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.”

Xi's visit lets China show Southeast Asia it is a “responsible superpower in the way that contrasts with the way the U.S. under President Donald Trump presents to the whole world,” said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.

While Trump has said he respects Xi, he interpreted the meeting between the two Asian leaders as a sign they were attempting to put the U.S. at a disadvantage on trade.

Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said China and Vietnam were trying “to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.”

Xi was greeted on the tarmac by Vietnam's President Luong Cuong at the start of his two-day visit, a mark of honor not often given to visitors, said Nguyen Thanh Trung, a professor of Vietnamese studies at Fulbright University Vietnam. Students of a drum art group performed as women waved the red and yellow Chinese and Communist Party flags. 




While Xi's trip likely was planned earlier, it has become significant because of the tariff fight between China and the U.S. The visit offers a path for Beijing to shore up its alliances and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese exports. 

In Hanoi, Xi met with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, his counterpart. “In the face of turmoil and disruption in the current global context, China and Vietnam's commitment to peaceful development, and deepening of friendship and cooperation and has brought the world valuable stability and certainty,” he said. 

He also met with Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. The two sides signed a series of memorandums in areas including strengthening cooperation in supply chains, railroad development and environmental protection, according to Associated Press footage of the signed documents. 

Nhan Dan, the official mouthpiece of Vietnam's Communist Party, said that China and Vietnam will speed up a $8 billion railway project connecting the two countries in a deal that was approved in February. 

The timing of the visit sends a “strong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,” said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. She said that given the severity of Trump's tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development.

Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the U.S and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with the U.S. 

In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia. 

Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, as businesses moved here. China is its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media.

That trade relationship goes both ways.

“The trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself,” said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, pointing out that since Xi became the president in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice. 

But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a “very precarious situation” given the impression in the U.S. that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang. Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump's order before the 90-day pause.

China and Vietnam have real long-term differences, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has faced off with China's coast guard but does not often publicize the confrontations.

After Vietnam, Xi is expected to go to Malaysia next and then Cambodia.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Nobody had to remind Draymond Green of Golden State's struggles in the NBA play-in tournament, because those results are still plenty fresh.

Yet this time, Green is thrilled the Warriors have the added advantage of Jimmy Butler on their side to help them try to reach the first-round playoffs.

“Man, we've got a lot of really good basketball players around this locker room key in what we're trying to do,” Butler said. “I like the confidence he has in myself. I also have the same amount of confidence. I know that I and we have a job to do, and I know that we're capable of doing it, so play-in here we come.”

After a 124-119 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in a regular-season finale for the ages on Sunday, Green, Butler and Stephen Curry will have to take their team down the tougher road once again. 

The Warriors face the Memphis Grizzlies in a play-in game Tuesday night at Chase Center for the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Beating the Clippers would have earned Golden State the sixth seed.

“We've got to turn the page quickly and move on to that game, so our guys will have tomorrow off and come in and have a walk-through on Tuesday and ready to roll,” coach Steve Kerr said. “A great opportunity there to win a game and get into the playoffs, which has been our goal this whole time.”

Butler had 30 points on 12-for-20 shooting and nine assists playing 48 minutes against the Clippers.




“He does what the game calls for,” Curry said of Butler.

Though Butler knows there is little room for error this time of year. 

“It didn't end the way that we wanted it to end so we've got to figure something out, myself included, and hit the ground running come Tuesday,” Butler said. “It felt good to have the ball and make all the right decisions.”

The Warriors were eliminated by the Sacramento Kings 118-94 in the play-in tournament as the No. 10 seed last year. In 2020-21, Golden State lost to the Lakers 103-100 before having its season ended by the Grizzlies in a 117-112 defeat. 

“We haven't fared well in these play-in games, so we've got to make sure we're locked in and ready to go,” Green said.

In 2023, Butler and Miami lost a play-in game to Atlanta but bounced back to beat the Bulls thanks to his 31 points — and the Heat wound up making an NBA Finals run before losing to Denver. 

“We joked about that I think last week that he went into the play-in packing for two months,” Curry said. “We'd love to have that opportunity.”

Given Butler's remarkable record of brilliant performances on the playoff stage, Curry and Green know Golden State can lean on that.

“I've been excited since the trade deadline because of that,” Curry said of having Butler on the big stage.

The OT game Sunday certainly resembled a playoff atmosphere. Butler has helped turn around the Warriors since being acquired at the trade deadline. 

“We'll just draw on having Jimmy as a whole,” Green said. “You saw the effort he put out there tonight. That's it. Not necessarily the experience in the play-in or any of that, just riding our aces.”

Butler, for one, can't wait.

“We're right where we want to be.”

The remarks came during Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele's White House visit on Monday.

Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters Monday that it is ""up to El Salvador"" whether they will choose to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident deported in what Trump officials have acknowledged was an ""administrative error,"" saying that if the country chooses to do so, then the U.S. would ""provide a plane.""

Her remarks came as President Donald Trump hosted El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday for a bilateral summit focused largely on immigration – and the hundreds of migrants deported by the U.S. to El Salvador for detention in the country's maximum-security prison.

When asked by reporters Monday about Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported in error to El Salvador, Bondi said the matter was up to Bukele's administration.

""That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,"" Bondi said. 

STEPHEN MILLER DOUBLES DOWN ON DEPORTATION OF ALLEGED GANG MEMBER: ‘NOT MISTAKENLY SENT'

""The Supreme Court ruled precedent that if El Salvador wanted to return him,"" she continued. ""This is international matters, foreign affairs.""

Bondi said that ""if they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it – meaning to provide a plane,"" Bondi said.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that a lower court's order ""requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""

Bukele received a warm welcome from Trump, who praised the Salvadorian leader as a ""fantastic"" president who is ""taking care of a lot of problems,"" including accepting hundreds of U.S. migrants into their detention facility, part of a roughly $6 million deal struck by U.S. officials and El Salvador earlier this year. 

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller doubled down on Bondi's assertion, noting that Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian national.

""It's very arrogant, even for American media, to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point,"" Miller told reporters, claiming that ""two courts"" had found Abrego Garcia to be a member of the MS-13 gang.

In fact, Abrego Garcia was granted temporary protection status in the U.S. by a court in 2019 from being removed to El Salvador, after it determined he would face criminal prosecution from gangs if he were removed to his home country.

Bukele, for his part, did not seem to think he had the authority to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., suggesting Monday that the move would be beyond the scope of his authorities.

""How can I smuggle a terrorist into the U.S.? I don't have the power to return him to the United States,"" Bukele said.

FEDERAL JUDGE HAMMERS DOJ ON WHEREABOUTS OF ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBER FOLLOWING SCOTUS ORDER

Also in attendance at Monday's meeting were several members of Trump's Cabinet, including the aforementioned Bondi, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and an architect of Trump's immigration policies. 

The meeting comes as El Salvador has received hundreds of migrants from the U.S., including more than 200 Venezuelan nationals abruptly removed in March under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, and alleged members of the Salvadorian gang MS-13.

Most recently, U.S. officials said they deported 10 more migrants to El Salvador over the weekend. 

As of this writing, the Trump administration has not returned any of the individuals who have been sent to El Salvador's sprawling, high-security prison, including any Venezuelan nationals who may have been mistakenly identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, and one Maryland resident whom U.S. officials acknowledged was wrongfully deported.

In March, after the first migrant flights arrived in El Salvador despite a federal judge's order that the flights be ""immediately"" returned to U.S. soil, Bukele took to social media to mockingly share footage of their arrival.

""Oopsie...Too late,"" he said on X, using an irreverent tone slightly emblematic of Trump's own style.

El Salvador has already accepted hundreds of migrants from the U.S., drawing praise from President Trump and other hard-line immigration hawks – but critics warn the removals may violate due process protections under the U.S. Constitution. Immigration advocates have also raised concerns that deported individuals have not had a chance to challenge their removals in court. 

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said on Monday that he has requested a meeting with Bukele this week to discuss the return of Abrego Garcia. He said in a letter Monday that he has met with Abrego Garcia's family members, including his wife and brother, who expressed to him that they are ""extremely concerned"" about his safety. 

""If Kilmar is not home by midweek – I plan to travel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release,"" Van Hollen said.

Most recently, a federal judge ordered Trump officials last week to provide the court with daily updates about its efforts to ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia, the wrongfully deported Maryland resident.

In a court filing submitted Sunday evening, Justice Department lawyers argued they are not required to comply with a judge's order to ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvadorian prison in what administration officials have since acknowledged was an ""administrative error.""

They argued that the order itself likely exceeds the power of the courts, arguing they ""have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.""

Meanwhile, Trump officials continue to publicly rail against so-called ""activist judges,"" whom they have argued are attempting to stymie Trump's agenda and his priorities on immigration enforcement.  

Noem on Monday praised the Supreme Court's recent emergency ruling that upholds, for now, the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to more quickly deport certain migrants.

The Supreme Court's ruling ""was a very clear message to other judges across this country … [to] stop acting like you have the authority to dictate foreign policy and national security decisions that the president is making to protect its citizens,"" she said in an interview on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We need to stop this, stop allowing liberal judges to try to dictate what President Trump is doing to make America safe again,"" she said. ""I'm grateful for the Supreme Court's decision, and I'm hopeful that we can have a new path forward where the president and his powers are recognized.""

President-elect Donald Trump called on award-winning TV producer Mark Burnett to be special envoy to the United Kingdom.

As President Donald Trump reshapes American foreign policy around hard-nosed deals and national self-interest, a new report warns the UK must rethink its strategy to preserve its ""special relationship"" – or risk being sidelined in Washington.

Darren Spinck, a fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, cautions that there will be no ""business as usual"" under Trump and that the ""special relationship"" between the U.S. and UK can no longer be taken for granted. To remain a key ally, Spinck argues in a new report, Britain must embrace Trump's ""transactional"" approach to foreign policy.  

""Choosing not to retaliate"" against Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs may signal a ""strategic patience that may facilitate bilateral negotiations,"" the report states. It outlines steps that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could take to align with the Trump administration and pursue a U.S.-UK free trade deal, including deeper security cooperation and a tougher stance on China.

Trump recently imposed 10% across-the-board tariffs on foreign nations and paused harsher levies he earlier proposed on every nation except China.

Another path, the report suggests, could involve the UK seeking accession to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the North American trade bloc, as a way to deepen economic ties with the United States.

The report also urges the UK Labour Party leadership to ""reduce commercial dependency on the PRC rather than deepening it,"" warning that closer economic ties with Beijing could strain U.S.-UK relations under Trump.

Spinck contrasted the Trump administration's focus on ""bilateralism, economic nationalism, and Indo-Pacific security"" with the Starmer government's preference for ""multilateral diplomacy, progressive trade policies, and European security commitments.""

""This policy gap threatens transatlantic cohesion, weakening their collective ability to act against common adversaries, particularly China,"" he warned. 

Divergent policies on China, NATO commitments and Indo-Pacific strategy could erode Five Eyes intelligence sharing, which is key to UK national security.

Spinck called on the British government to strike a deal with the U.S. that addresses the White House's digital privacy concerns – particularly after the UK ordered Apple to grant security agencies access to encrypted cloud data – and to launch a mineral mining partnership to bolster critical supply chains.

Whereas the previous conservative UK government deemed China its ""greatest state-based threat,"" the current liberal leadership has ""reversed the course of the previous three Conservative Party Governments and has sought to strengthen economic ties with Beijing,"" according to Spink. 

He said the UK had recently advanced Beijing's access to Western capital markets and re-established bilateral frameworks on industrial, trade and energy policy with China. 

""​​One must wonder why London appears eager to expand economic ties with China – a country widely criticized for its human rights record – while the UK's development finance institution has been less inclined to support international infrastructure development or mining projects in other regions.""

UK PRIME MINISTER TO ADMIT ‘GLOBALIZATION IS OVER' IN RESPONSE TO TRUMP TARIFFS: REPORT

The UK's growing relationship with China is a cause for concern for the U.S., according to the report. ( Stefan Rousseau/Pool via REUTERS)

""As the Trump Administration seeks to further accelerate America's decoupling from targeted CCP economic and technology sectors, the US feels that the Labour Government's apparent rapprochement with Beijing, after years of cautious relations following the PRC's 2020 breach of the Sino–British Joint Declaration, could unnecessarily complicate the ""Special Relationship,"" Spink wrote. 

He said that critical issues ""requiring transatlantic cooperation,"" such as a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, are ""at risk"" if the U.S. and the UK are not aligned on China policy.

The UK must also set aside its disagreements over U.S. domestic policy, according to Spinck, due to the more urgent need for security cooperation. 

""As the Labour Government works with President Trump's Administration, it should realize its views on a wide range of policies, including immigration, climate policy, digital privacy and welfare benefits, are vastly different,"" he wrote. 

He said such ""fractures"" like the UK government's demand for backdoor access to Apple's encrypted cloud storage ""have begun to define the overall relationship between the two allies, impacting the potential for foreign policy alignment.""

""Overcoming these cultural differences requires a shift to a more transactional model of foreign policy cooperation. Britain needs to take an active role in re-setting this agenda, pushing questions of domestic ideology to the margins in favor of solid, mutually beneficial measures.""

The UK could also signal goodwill by taking a tougher diplomatic stance on Iran. Spinck urged London to help close the ""transatlantic divide"" on Iran policy, which he said has ""disrupted attempts to forge a coherent approach to stopping Iran's nuclear progress.""

While the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sweeping sanctions, the UK remained a party and declined to trigger snapback sanctions – even amid reports that Iran had violated the agreement and was enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.

Spink also urged the UK to join the U.S. in designating Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Such moves, he argued, ""would also be seen as a victory for the long-established Trump policy on Iran – one that would cost the UK nothing and would generate much goodwill in Washington, D.C.""

FIRST ON FOX: A GOP organization dedicated to electing Republicans to state legislative and executive offices across the nation is spotlighting what it calls a ""record"" fundraising haul during the first three months of the year.

The Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) announced on Monday that, along with its strategic policy partner, the State Government Leadership Foundation, it raked in a combined $13 million in fundraising during the January-March first quarter of 2025. 

The group, in sharing their figures first with Fox News, highlighted that it was their ""best-ever first-quarter fundraising haul,"" and follows what they describe as ""a historic 2023-2024 election cycle,"" when the two groups combined raised $102 million.

Showcasing their grassroots appeal, the group noted that they brought in over $2.2 million online, with 5,130 new online donors and an average online donation of $24.68.

""This record-breaking fundraising achievement highlights the enthusiasm behind the results Republicans are delivering at the state level,"" RSLC President Edith Jorge-Tuñón emphasized in a statement to Fox News.

 ""While we're proud of this milestone, we must stay alert. Recent elections show Democrats are ready to invest unlimited resources in down-ballot races, taking advantage of low turnout to build momentum for the 2025-2026 cycle. We need to be proactive in countering these efforts,"" she added.

Jim Weakley, the president of the Lake Carriers' Association, which represents the interests of U.S. commercial shippers, discussed the national security risks present at the U.S.-Canadian border. (Fox News Digital)

As the White House focuses on cracking down on illegal immigration on the southern border, an expert warns that the maritime industry along the northern border faces threats from bad actors and the risk of foreign influence.

Fox News Digital spoke with Jim Weakley, president of the Lake Carriers' Association and retired U.S. Coast Guard officer, about national security risks along the Great Lakes and the Detroit Sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which covers parts of Michigan and northern Ohio along the U.S.-Canada border.

""What people outside our region or outside of law enforcement often don't understand is that border security—or any type of perimeter security—is a lot like a tube of toothpaste: if you apply pressure in one area, such as the southern border, the threat simply shifts to another part of the perimeter,"" he said.

""So, as we—rightfully, in my view—reinforce our southern border, which has proven to be significantly lax, bad actors looking to smuggle terrorists, humans, fentanyl, or other contraband will likely redirect their efforts to our northern border.""

NORTHERN BORDER ‘QUIET CRISIS' BREWS AS EXPERT FLOATS UNCONVENTIONAL SOLUTION TO COMBAT HUMAN SMUGGLING

Weakley said that the lower standards in Canada serve as a national security risk in the U.S., due to the stricter inspection and manning regulations.

""To work on a U.S. vessel, officers must be U.S. citizens and most crew must be at least green card holders, with limits on how many non-citizens can be on board. In contrast, Canada allows sailors and officers from a wide range of countries, including the Philippines, Jamaica and Ukraine.""

""Canadian companies can also issue pilotage endorsements, unlike the U.S., where it's tightly regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard. That means a Canadian vessel, even on Lake Michigan—where there's no Canadian border—could be operated by foreign nationals with minimal oversight. They also carry fewer pilots and use cheaper, Chinese-subsidized ships, which further lowers their costs. 

Weakley argued that the standards are a national security risk and a major reason why Canada dominates 90% of the cross-lake shipping market, putting U.S. carriers at a disadvantage.

As the Great Lakes region plunges into the wintry weather, the lakes freeze over and provide human smugglers with another way to traverse across to America, Weakley explained.

""The vastness of the Great Lakes makes border security and law enforcement far more complex, especially when the Canadians aren't pulling their weight,"" he said. ""In fact, I don't believe they have any law enforcement presence on the Great Lakes during the winter.""

""We're doing much more to secure the border on both sides. However, the Canadians are doing less, which forces the U.S. to take on a greater share of the responsibility. And as we strengthen our southern border, the threat along the northern border is only going to grow.""

During testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Kash Patel told lawmakers adversaries such as China and Russia have started to target the northern U.S. border with Canada.

""The enemy adapts,"" Patel said.

The Trump administration has overseen a dramatic shift at the U.S. southern border since taking office in January, with the number of CBP recorded encounters plummeting by 90% in most sectors compared to the same time period last year. The administration has poured in resources to stop the spiraling immigration situation at the southern border.

The sudden silence there came after record-setting numbers of illegal crossings during the four years of the Biden administration, a trend that also saw a dramatic increase in attempted crossings by immigrants outside of North and Latin America.

Chinese nationals were among the most likely to attempt illegal crossings, with the number of crossings from citizens of the country rising to over 24,000 in 2023, a more than 5,200% increase from the 450 encounters just a year earlier, according to CBP data.

Overall, Patel told lawmakers that between 2022 and 2025, roughly 178,000 Chinese nationals attempted to cross the southern border.

CBP declined to comment but pointed to data that depicted encounters at the Northern Land Border in the Detroit Sector, broken down by fiscal year (FY) and demographic group.

FY 2024 had the highest monthly peaks, especially in May (139 encounters) and July (74). FY 2022 had consistently very low encounter counts, never surpassing 35 per month.

FY 2025 saw a large jump in February (139) compared to only 53 the same month in FY 2024.

Victims of car collisions may have more to worry about as insurance companies warn drivers to be aware of a growing scam involving tow truck companies.

Chris Stroisch, the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) vice president of public affairs & communications, shared with Fox News Digital that they are seeing a ""significant spike in predatory tolling in the United States, which has increased 89% in the last three years.""

""We're seeing predatory towing occurring in cities both large and small. So you're seeing predatory towing occurring in large cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. But you're also seeing it in small communities like Des Moines, Iowa,"" Stroisch said.

Stroisch explained that these predatory towers are ""following the money"" and will operate wherever they can make the most profit.

""Unfortunately, what we're seeing on our end is that we're hearing a lot of sad stories,"" Stroisch said. ""Predatory towers that are engaging in reckless driving, they're engaging in turf wars even, and there's even been shootings tied to predatory towing that's all leading to very tragic, but avoidable deaths. So it's really just this growing problem that we've seen take off in the last three years in this country.""

The California Department of Insurance echoed the NICB warning and added that it has seen an uptick happening where some tow truck companies are targeting drivers involved in crashes by picking up their cars and then holding them hostage for large amounts of money. 

""This type of scam is preying on drivers at their most vulnerable moments—immediately after an accident—when they should be focused on their safety and next steps, not fighting to get their vehicle back,"" Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. ""Our department is committed to protecting Californians from fraud, and this PSA is an important step in ensuring drivers know the warning signs and how to protect themselves.""

A spokesperson for the agency told Fox News Digital that, right now, they are seeing two primary scams. One involves a tow truck driver showing up immediately after a collision occurs and offering to help the other driver by towing their vehicle to a body shop.

""Tow drivers show up to accident scenes and misrepresent to the crash victim that they were sent there by the insurance company, when they were in fact not,"" the agency said. ""The suspects steal/tow the victim's vehicle under false pretenses to a body shop or tow yard. They then charge exorbitant fees to the victim or insurance company to release the vehicle.""

The second scam the agency said they are seeing is when a tow driver steals personal information from the victim by posing as law enforcement or an insurance company employee.

""Suspects contact the crash victim claiming to be an employee of the victim's insurance carrier, indicating they will tow the vehicle to a body shop approved by their insurance company and then steal/tow the vehicle under false pretenses,"" the California Department of Insurance spokesperson said.

Stroisch added that there are two rules of thumb that they tell consumers.

""First thing, if you didn't request it, reject it,"" Stroisch said. ""If you're in an accident and a tow truck company shows up on scene that's unsolicited, we tell people to wait for law enforcement to arrive. And then once that tow truck company is on scene, to know as much as you can or know before you tow.""

The California Department of Insurance shared a few red flags drivers should be aware of to make sure they are not a victim of this type of scam, which include: 

In response to the growing scam trend, the agency said that it has created three law enforcement task forces in Southern California that investigate organized automobile insurance fraud. 

The task forces are comprised of CDI detectives, investigators from the California Highway Patrol, and investigators from the local district attorney's offices, the agency explained, adding that it manages these task forces.

""These task forces work up these crimes, present the case to the district attorney's offices for filing criminal charges, and arrest the suspects. Additionally, we work with other state agencies, such as the Bureau of Automotive Repair, to refer cases for administrative sanctions,"" the agency said. 

""We also spend considerable time educating our state and local law enforcement partners to assist us in better recognizing this type of activity, and we have been releasing public service announcements to raise the public's awareness.""

According to the department, the Inland Empire Automobile Insurance Fraud Task Force has investigated multiple cases, including one that has resulted in the arraignment and charges against 16 Southern California residents.

""This task force investigation found the auto fraud ring allegedly conspired together to create fraudulent insurance claims to illegally collect over $216,932,"" the department said in a statement. ""The investigation discovered the large-scale organized auto insurance fraud ring was engaged in multiple types of schemes including holding vehicles hostage and collusive collisions.""

This same ring, the department shared, was previously charged in a similar scheme stemming from vehicles stolen under false pretenses in San Bernardino County.

Stroisch shared that some of these operators are even charging upwards of 10 times the usual cost of a tow, and then are holding the vehicles hostage in the process. 

""The average cost of a tow is $109, but we're seeing costs that have skyrocketed, and we're seeing costs that are 10, 15, 16, and $17,000 that are just filled with absorbent fees and very vague descriptions of what people are actually paying for all while these vehicles are being held hostage,"" Stroisch explained. 

Officials said while most towing companies are reputable, there is a warning on unlicensed predatory tow truck companies that prey on drivers when they are most vulnerable. (Getty Images)

HOW SCAMMERS HAVE SUNK TO A NEW LOW WITH AN AI OBITUARY SCAM TARGETING THE GRIEVING

""If you're in an accident, get as much information as you can about a tow truck company and wait for law enforcement to arrive first."" 

While tow truck scams are nothing new, the California Department of Insurance said they are on the rise, increasing by over 1,500 reports since 2023.

""We do not have stats specific to this type of scam, but in 2024, CDI received 13,870 referrals of suspected automobile insurance fraud from insurance companies, government agencies and the public, which increased from 2023, where we received 12,363,"" the department shared.

The department said it is urging any drivers that believe they may be in a situation like this to verify the tow truck with their insurance company or wait for CHP to verify the tow truck was dispatched by CHP, adding to also not sign any documents until you have talked to their insurance company.

Stroisch said one of the biggest things that the bureau is seeing right now is the lack of laws and the lack of policies in some cities and states. 

""Every state, every municipality is different, and some states have laws against predatory towing. They have laws that require licensing of tow truck companies. They have laws that require transparency around fee schedules, but there are many cities and states that don't,"" Stroisch explained. ""So I think that from an NICB standpoint, we would recommend all lawmakers at every level, work together to put measures in place to help prevent this."" 

Stroisch suggested that banning accident scene solicitations is one example of how predatory towing can be thwarted. 

""That's where a lot of this is occurring. These tow truck companies that just show up on scene, so ban accident scene solicitation in the first place. So we are really encouraging lawmakers to work together to pass legislation.

""We are currently monitoring 107 different bills in 37 states that are all tied to predatory towing. So to have that many bills that are in some stage, it's just showing the problem that we're seeing right now.""

DJ Daniel, the teenage boy who was made a Secret Service agent during President Donald Trump's speech to Congress in March, has been sworn into another federal agency.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum helped Daniel – a cancer survivor – fulfill his goal of being sworn into 1,000 law enforcement agencies by swearing him in as an honorary United States Park Police officer on Sunday.

""DJ's resilience in his battle against cancer has inspired the nation. It was an honor to meet with him and his family today at @Interior!"" Burgum wrote on X.

Daniel then had the opportunity to patrol the National Mall after his swearing-in ceremony.

The agency said he ""demonstrated the highest degree of honor, integrity and service"" during his patrol.

Daniel made national headlines when Trump acknowledged him during his joint address to Congress on March 4 and deemed him an honorary Secret Service agent. 

He had the opportunity to visit the Secret Service Training Center on March 19, where he congratulated the latest graduating class alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secret Service Director Sean Curran, and then went on a tour of the facility.

TRUMP-AFFIRMED SECRET SERVICE AGENT 'DJ' DANIEL CONTINUES RECORD PUSH TO BE SWORN IN BY 1,000 LAW AGENCIES 

Daniel was diagnosed with brain and spinal cancer in 2018 and was given five months to live, according to his father, Theodis. He has had more than 13 brain surgeries since then and is also part of a research study.

His dad said Daniel is ""beating the odds.""

Daniel had a simple message for children with cancer that he shared during his visit to the Secret Service Training Center last month.

""Have faith. Believe in God. Listen to your parents,"" he said.

Kawasaki's CORLEO is a hydrogen-powered, AI-driven rideable robot. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on this new way of thinking about off-road transportation.

What if your next off-road ride wasn't on a motorcycle or ATV but on a robot that moves like a wolf? Kawasaki Heavy Industries has introduced something that feels straight out of a video game: CORLEO, a hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot prototype designed to be ridden by humans. Unveiled at the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025, this futuristic machine is built to handle rugged terrain with ease, combining cutting-edge robotics and sustainable energy.

Let's take a closer look at what makes CORLEO so cutting-edge.

Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

CORLEO isn't your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.

CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation.

HUMANOID ROBOT BREAKDANCES ITS WAY INTO HISTORY

CORLEO isn't just about getting from point A to point B. It's packed with advanced features that make it feel like something out of the future.

WORLD'S FIRST AI-POWERED INDUSTRIAL SUPER-HUMANOID ROBOT

CORLEO's sleek design is as impressive as its tech. Built with durable materials like metal and carbon fiber, it's tough enough for outdoor adventures while still looking futuristic. Fans of video games might notice some similarities to designs from Horizon Zero Dawn, which reportedly inspired some of its aesthetics.

HUMANOID ROBOT STUNS WITH PERFECT SIDE FLIP ACROBATICS

Right now, CORLEO is still in the prototype phase, so there are some unanswered questions, like how fast it can go or how far it can travel on a full tank of hydrogen. And while the idea of riding a robotic wolf sounds amazing, we'll have to wait a while before it becomes available. Kawasaki estimates it could take up to 25 years before something like CORLEO hits the market.

Still, this concept shows where off-road vehicles could be headed in the future. Kawasaki sees CORLEO as an alternative to traditional motorcycles or ATVs, something that could make exploring tough terrains safer, easier and more sustainable.

Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

CORLEO is part of Kawasaki's growing focus on robotics. The company has been making industrial robots for decades and recently expanded into new areas like collaborative robots (designed for manufacturing) and educational robots for classrooms. For example:

With CORLEO, Kawasaki is showing how its expertise in robotics can go beyond factories and classrooms into outdoor adventures.

Kawasaki's CORLEO is an entirely new way of thinking about off-road transportation. By combining robotics, AI and clean energy, Kawasaki is imagining a future where adventure meets sustainability. While we might not see robots like CORLEO on trails anytime soon, it's worth thinking about how this technology could change outdoor adventures forever. Who wouldn't want to ride a robot inspired by nature's most agile creatures?

Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses tips on how to protect your data amid AI privacy concerns and Ford filing a patent to bring the stick shift to electric vehicles.

Imagine an internet where your data can't be stolen, your messages are completely private and online security is unbreakable. That's the promise of quantum internet: a futuristic technology that could completely change how we connect online.

Here's a look at what quantum internet is, how it works and why it might be the future of online security.

Illustration of future tech (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Quantum internet is a next-generation network that uses the power of physics to send data in a way that's ultra-secure and computationally infeasible to hack. Quantum internet, quantum networks and quantum communication are all connected but have different roles. 

Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today's internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time.

This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating.

SELLING ON THE INTERNET? BEWARE OF SNEAKY TACTICS SCAMMERS USE TO TRICK YOU

One of the biggest breakthroughs of quantum internet is its potential to eliminate hacking and data breaches. Here's how.

Quantum internet could completely redefine online privacy, making it harder for hackers, corporations or even governments to access personal data. Here's how it could transform your online experience.

HOW TO SPEED UP YOUR WI-FI AND INTERNET CONNECTION

While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today's internet to quantum internet. 

Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won't happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure. 

Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.

While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.

1) Have strong antivirus software: Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data. The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.

3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection. For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream, 2FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a security key that plugs into your device.

Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that's faster, more secure and more private than anything we've seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.

Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the Justice Department's argument that the courts do not have authority to order the administration to return a deported Maryland man.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sounded off on ""fake news"" which she said put an accused MS-13 gang member on a pedestal in an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" Monday.

Salvadoran national Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, 29, was arrested on March 12 in Baltimore and deported to his home country three days later despite having been granted ""Withholding of Removal"" status and having legal working papers from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2019, a judge ruled that Abrego Garcia could not be deported because it was ""more likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs,"" according to a complaint filed by his attorney, Fox Baltimore reported.

The 29-year-old national was deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in Tecoluca, El Salvador, for being an alleged MS-13 gang member, but his attorneys say he does not have any gang ties. The Trump administration acknowledged it mistakenly deported him ""because of an administrative error,"" but said they cannot bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody.

A vigil is reportedly taking place on behalf of Abrego Garcia outside the White House on Monday, with faith leaders urging President Donald Trump to get him home. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" his return, but stopped short of requiring the government to return him to the United States. Both Abrego Garcia's attorneys and the Trump administration interpreted the decision as a win.

""Tonight, the rule of law prevailed,"" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's attorneys, said. ""The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge's order that the government has to bring Kilmar home. Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.""

But Noem saw the case differently.

""Yes, I think that what the Supreme Court said here in this decision was a very clear message to other judges across this country, is that stop acting like you have the authority to dictate foreign policy and national security decisions that the president is making to protect its citizens,"" Noem said on ""Fox & Friends."" 

""So, this was just one of those examples of an individual that was an MS-13 gang member, had multiple charges and encounters with the individuals here… trafficking in his background, was found with other MS-13 gang members, very dangerous person.""

""And what the liberal left and the fake news are doing to turn him into a media darling is sickening,"" she said.

Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller also defined the Supreme Court ruling as a win for the Trump administration in an appearance on Fox News, Monday.

""We won the Supreme Court case, clearly, 9-0,"" Miller said. ""A district court judge said, unconscionably, that the president and his administration have to go into El Salvador, and extradite one of their citizens - an El Salvadoran citizen - so that would be kidnapping. That we have to kidnap an El Salvadoran citizen against the will of his government and fly him back to America, which would be an unimaginable act, an invasion of El Salvador sovereignty.""

The ruling ""clearly"" read, Miller said, that ""no district court can compel the president to exercise his Article II foreign powers in any way whatsoever.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Microsoft is taking its foot off the AI accelerator. What does that mean?","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-data-center-cloud-decreased-spending-explained-why-2025-4","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:02:00 GMT","

In the high-stakes race to dominate AI infrastructure, a tech giant has subtly shifted gears.

Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022, there's been a mad dash to build as many artificial intelligence data centers as possible. Big Tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on land, construction, and computing gear to support new generative-AI workloads.

Microsoft has been at the forefront of this, mostly through its partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

For two years, there's been almost zero doubt in the tech industry about this AI expansion. It's been all very up and to the right.

Until recently, that is.

On Tuesday, Noelle Walsh, the head of Microsoft cloud operations, said the company ""may strategically pace our plans.""

This is pretty shocking news for an AI industry that's been constantly kicking and screaming for more cloud capacity and more Nvidia graphics processing units. So it's worth reading closely what Walsh wrote about how things have changed.

""In recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,"" she wrote in a LinkedIn post.

""By nature, any significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects,"" Walsh added.

She didn't share more details, but the TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias has found several recent examples of what he said was Microsoft backing off.

The tech giant has walked away from more than 2 gigawatts of AI cloud capacity in the US and Europe in the past six months, which was in the process of being leased, he said. In the past month or so, Microsoft has also deferred and canceled data center leases in the US and Europe, Elias wrote in a recent note to investors.

This pullback on new capacity leasing was largely driven by Microsoft's decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads, Elias said. A recent change to this crucial partnership allows OpenAI to work with cloud providers beyond Microsoft.

""However, we continue to believe the lease cancellations and deferrals of capacity point to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast,"" Elias added.

This is worrying because trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative-AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving. (I asked a Microsoft spokesperson all about this twice and didn't get a response.)

The reality is more nuanced than a simple pullback, though. What we're witnessing is a recalibration — not a retreat.

Raimo Lenschow, a Barclays analyst, put the situation in context. The initial wave of this industry spending spree focused a lot on securing land and buildings to house all the chips and other computing gear needed to create and run AI models and services.

In this AI ""land grab,"" it's common for large cloud companies to sign and negotiate leases that they end up walking away from later, Lenschow said.

Now that Microsoft feels more comfortable with the amount of land it has on hand, the company is likely shifting some spending to the later stages that focus more on buying the GPUs and other computing gear that go inside these data centers.

""In other words, over the past few quarters, Microsoft has 'overspent' on land and buildings, but is now going back to a more normal cadence,"" Lenschow wrote in a recent note to investors.

Microsoft still plans $80 billion in capital expenditures during its 2025 fiscal year and has guided for year-over-year growth in the next fiscal year. So the company probably isn't backing away from AI much but is becoming more strategic about where and how it invests.

Part of the shift appears to be from AI training to inference. Pretraining is how models are created, and this requires loads of closely connected GPUs, along with state-of-the-art networking. Expensive stuff! Inference is how existing models are run to support services such as AI agents and Microsoft Copilot. Inference is less technically demanding but expected to be the larger market.

With inference outpacing training, the focus is shifting toward scalable, cost-effective infrastructure that maximizes return on investment.

For instance, at a recent AI conference in New York, the discussion was focused more on efficiency than attaining artificial general intelligence, a costly endeavor to make machines work better than humans.

The AI startup Cohere said that its new Command A model needs only two GPUs to run. That's a heck of a lot fewer than most models have required in recent years.

Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, echoed this in a recent podcast. While he acknowledged a slight slowdown in returns from massive pretraining runs, he said the company's compute consumption was still ""unbelievable"" — it's just shifting to different stages of the AI pipeline.

Suleyman added that some of the canceled leases and projects were never finalized contracts but exploratory discussions — part of standard operating procedure in hyperscale cloud planning.

This strategic pivot comes as OpenAI, Microsoft's close partner, has begun sourcing capacity from other cloud providers and even hinting at developing its own data centers. Microsoft, however, maintains a right of first refusal on new OpenAI capacity, signaling continued deep integration between the two companies.

First, don't mistake agility for weakness. Microsoft is likely adjusting to changing market dynamics, not scaling back ambition. Second, the hyperscaler space remains incredibly competitive.

When Microsoft walked away from capacity in overseas markets, Elias said, Google stepped in to snap up the supply. Meanwhile, Meta backfilled the capacity that Microsoft left on the table in the US.

""Both of these hyperscalers are in the midst of a material year-over-year ramp in data center demand,"" Elias wrote, referring to Google and Meta.

So Microsoft's pivot may be more a sign of maturity than retreat. As AI adoption enters its next phase, the winners won't necessarily be those who spend the most — but those who spend the smartest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Apple is struggling to catch a break right now","https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tariff-uncertainty-china-iphone-exemption-trump-2025-4","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:46:00 GMT","

It was good while it lasted, but Apple's reprieve was short-lived.

On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be largely off the hook from Donald Trump's China tariffs after the US Customs and Border Protection announced an exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other tech gadgets.

That would have come as a relief to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the company had been hit by 145% tariffs on the goods it manufactures and assembles from its supply chain hub in China.

But on Sunday, there came a switch-up from Trump: he said the US tech industry wouldn't be free from additional tariffs after all. 

Instead, tech products would be shifted to a different category of tariffs in the future, Trump said in a post to his social media plaform Truth Social. 

""There was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday,"" Trump wrote. ""These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'""

He added, ""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick backed this position in an ABC News interview on Sunday and confirmed that tariffs affecting iPhones may return in the next month or so. 

The Trump administration has said its tariff strategy aims to bring more tech manufacturing to the US.   

But where does this rapidly evolving situation leave Apple? 

In the short term, it seems better than last week. 

Apple was coming off its worst three-day stock decline since 2001, while analysts had predicted doom scenarios in which iPhones could cost consumers over $2,000 if it passed on costs to consumers.

The Friday exemptions were backdated to April 5. That's not insignificant for Apple, which Counterpoint Research estimates makes as much as 80% of its iPhones intended for the US in China. 

So far, the market has reacted positively. Apple shares were up more than 3% on Monday morning. But any moves this week that put Trump's words on Truth Social into action could sour sentiment again.

This all subjects Apple to a constant whiplashing as it finds itself caught up in Trump's tariff strategy, and means it can't catch a break at all at a time when it's facing challenges elsewhere.

On one front, Apple has been facing a steady decline in its sales in its most important international market: China.

There, domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi have been putting out smartphones that rival the iPhone at aggressive prices. Apple's share of the smartphone market in the final quarter of 2024 totaled 17% — down from the 21% it held a year prior.

The company is also facing challenges turning big new bets unveiled last year into hits. Its AI push with Apple Intelligence has suffered — an AI feature for Siri has been delayed — and the Vision Pro headset is struggling to capture the interest of consumers and developers.

However, there are positives for Apple. Figures published on Monday by Counterpoint show that Apple is in the top spot of the smartphone market in the first quarter for the first time ever — a feat helped by the release of its cheaper iPhone 16e. Despite the recent sell-off, it remains one of the world's most valuable companies with hugely popular products, such as its smartwatches. 

There is also the possibility that Cook may be able to secure an exemption as he did during Trump's first term. The Apple CEO can hope that his years of effort building a tight relationship with Trump will pay off. For now, though, Apple can't catch a break.

TikTok users in the US are being inundated with videos from Chinese influencers encouraging American buyers to overcome punitive Trump tariffs by buying direct from the “world's factory” — China.

Mostly filmed at Chinese factories purporting to supply top US brands from Lululemon Athletica Inc. to Nike Inc., the influencers aim to “expose” how the vast majority of consumer goods are made in the world's second-largest economy. Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don't you just contact us and buy from us? You won't believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The US Federal Trade Commission is finally having its day in court against Meta Platforms Inc., arguing that the company must be broken up for illegally monopolizing the social media market after buying Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. 

The FTC's opening salvo began Monday in Washington before Chief Judge James Boasberg in a case that's been years in the making. Agency attorneys kicked off their arguments by invoking a long US tradition of seeking to ensure a competitive marketplace, one that the FTC's lead trial lawyer, Daniel Matheson, accused Meta of violating.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said Monday that he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States despite a U.S. Supreme Court order that says the Trump administration should facilitate his return.

""The question is preposterous,"" Bukele said at the White House during a meeting with President Donald Trump, when he was asked about sending Abrego Garcia back from the notorious Salvadoran prison where he has been held since being forcibly deported in March.

""How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?"" Bukele said. ""I don't have the power to return him to the United States.""

Top Trump administration officials at the same Oval Office meeting suggested they would not comply with Maryland U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis' demand that officials facilitate Abrego Garcia's return from his native country.

The Trump administration, which claims he is a gang member, has admitted that Abrego Garcia, a married father of three who lives in Maryland, was deported due to an administrative error.

But the administration also argues it has no legal responsibility to get him back, and that federal courts lack the power to compel his return.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld Xinis' order, but asked her to clarify it. Xinis quickly did so, and on Friday told the Trump administration to give her daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, and about its efforts to get him back.

Bukele suggested he would not comply with the administration, even if asked.

 ""I mean, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country,"" the Salvadoran president said.

""We just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere and you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world?"" Bukele said. ""That's not going to happen.""

Trump then quipped that the media would ""love"" to have criminal released into the U.S., adding that they are ""sick people.""

He also said he wants Bukele to accept as many criminals as possible.

After insulting the CNN reporter who asked about Abrego Garcia, Trump had tossed the question about his return to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Bondi said Abrego Garcia — who has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S. — had been determined in the courts to be a member of the gang MS-13 who was in the country illegally.

Xinis has said there is no evidence that he is a gang member.

""That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,"" Bondi said.

She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Abrego Garcia only requires that the Trump administration ""facilitate"" his return, ""meaning provide a plane,"" if El Salvador decides to return him.

Trump then asked top White House advisor Stephen Miller to weigh in.

""He's a citizen of El Salvador,"" Miller said. ""So it's very arrogant, even, for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio nodded along at Miller's interpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling.

After Bukele said he would not release Abrego Garcia, Rubio said, ""I don't understand what the confusion is.""

""This individual is a citizen of El Salvador,"" Rubio said. ""He was illegally in the United States and was returned to his country. That's where you deport people back to their country of origin.""

Rubio added: ""The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the President of the United States, not by a court. And no court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy in the United States, it's that simple. End of story.""

When the CNN reporter attempted to ask Trump a follow-up question, the president replied, ""How long do we have to answer this question from you?""

""Why don't you just say, Isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country?"" Trump said.

Consumer worries grew over inflation, unemployment and the stock market as the global trade war heated up in March, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey released Monday.

The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents saw inflation a year from now at 3.6%, an increase of half a percentage point from February and the highest reading since October 2023.

Along with concerns over a higher cost of living came a surge in worries over the labor market: The probability that the unemployment rate would be higher a year from now surged to 44%, a move up of 4.6 percentage points and the highest level going back to the early Covid pandemic days of April 2020.

The survey also showed angst about the uncertainty translating into problems for stock market prices.

The expectation that the market will be higher a year from low slid to 33.8%, a decline of 3.2 percentage points to the lowest reading going back to June 2022. While the expectations for equities pulled back, respondents said they figure gold to rise by 5.2%, the highest since April 2022.

The survey reflects other readings, such as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which showed one-year expectations in mid-April at their highest since November 1981.

In the case of the New York Fed measure, the survey took place ahead of President Donald Trump's April 2 ""liberation day"" tariff announcement, as well as the 90-day suspension of the order a week later. However, it is largely consistent with other measures reflecting consumer concern over the impact tariffs will have, even as market-based measures show inflation worries are low among traders.

Expectations for inflation at the five-year horizon actually edged lower to 2.9%, down 0.1 percentage point, and were unchanged for the three-year outlook at 3%. The outlook for food prices a year from now nudged up to 5.2%, its highest since May 2024, and was at 7.2% for rent, an increase of half a point. The outlook for medical care costs also jumped to an expected 7.9% increase, the most since August 2024.

Respondents expect gasoline to rise by 3.2%, a 0.5 percentage point drop from the February outlook.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Monday that ""more than 10"" countries have made ""very good, amazing"" trade deal offers to the United States after President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports from many nations.

Hassett also said in a Fox Business interview that there is no chance at all — ""100% not"" — that the U.S. will experience a recession in 2025.

He denied there was any insider trading by Trump or White House officials ahead of the president's monthslong pause in so-called reciprocal tariffs Wednesday.

Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are mulling whether offers of trade pacts from other countries are ""good enough,"" Hassett said in the interview.

""The one question that I have open in my mind is, should we go one at a time, or should we announce a bundle all at once?"" Hassett said.

He also said business executives have been telling him that companies are pushing to move their overseas operations back to the U.S, while consumers are buying up foreign goods because they are ""worried about future tariffs.""

""So everything's through the roof, anecdotally,"" he said, adding that recent U.S. jobs report data is ""really, really good.""

An industry group survey published Monday found that 62% of U.S. CEOs now expect a recession or other economic downturn within the next six months. A day earlier, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that he was worried that turmoil from Trump's tariffs and economic policies will lead to ""something worse than a recession.""

Hassett's optimism about America's trade and economic trajectory came as stock market indices rose Monday morning.

The gains followed news over the weekend that Trump had granted an exemption on reciprocal tariffs imposed on imported electronics, including phones, computers and semiconductors.

Trump later insisted Sunday in a Truth Social post that there was no exemption granted, and that tariffs on those items would be imposed in a different ""bucket"" later.

On Wednesday, Trump abruptly announced that the sweeping reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries he had announced April 2 would be reduced to a 10% flat rate for 90 days.

The postponement, announced just hours after the steep tariffs took effect, sent stocks soaring after a four-day slide.

That swing led Democrats to ask questions about possible market manipulation or insider trading.

Lawmakers pointed to Trump's Truth Social post in which he declared ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!"" hours before announcing the tariff pause.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Sunday that ""there's enough smoke here that should demand congressional hearings.""

House Democrats on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate, noting, among other things, a ""spike"" in purchases of call options minutes before Trump announced the tariff delay. Call options give their holders the right to buy stock shares at a certain price, and act as effective bets that that price will be lower than the retail price of the shares at the time the options are executed.

On Friday, Democrats in the Senate also wrote to the SEC, asking for an investigation.

Hassett, asked about Booker's push for hearings, said, ""There was no insider trading at the White House.""

But he said the large stock movements will be investigated by the proper authorities, he said.

""When there are big movements in markets, then there are people around town that investigate and make sure that nothing funny was happening,"" he said.

""But I'm sure it's not anything to do with the White House,"" Hassett added.

OPEC on Monday cut its oil demand growth forecast for 2025 and 2026 as President Donald Trump's tariffs weigh on global economic growth.

The cartel now sees demand for crude growing by 1.3 million barrels per day this year and next year, down about 150,000 bpd from its previous estimates. OPEC also lowered its global economic growth forecast to 3% and 3.1% for 2025 and 2026, respectively, taking both estimates down 0.1 percentage point from its prior outlook.

""The global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year,"" the group said in its monthly oil market report. ""However, recent trade related dynamics have introduced higher uncertainty to the short-term global economic growth outlook.""

Trump has slapped 145% tariffs on China, the world's second-biggest economy and largest crude importer. The president has imposed 10% tariffs on most other countries during a 90-day period that allows for trade negotiations. More industry-specific tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors may be on the way.

Key members of the broader OPEC+ group have agreed to accelerate oil production starting in May even as OPEC sees slightly lower demand for crude and softer economic growth.

Trump's trade war and the OPEC+ decision to accelerate output has weighed heavily on prices this month. Crude oil futures are down about 13% since Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan on April 2.

U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent were trading more than 1% higher on Monday.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched his fiancee Lauren Sanchez into space Monday with an all-female celebrity crew that included Katy Perry and Gayle King.

It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before — or lucky and well-connected — can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts.

The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned some 65 miles (105 kilometers) up, promising a few precious minutes of weightlessness.

Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and ""CBS Mornings"" co-host King.

Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence.

Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice.

It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin's first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad.

The celebrity launch was the nation's first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963. That's when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet.

Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15% of the more than 700 people who have traveled into space. Sanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits.

""It's an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,"" Perry told The Associated Press last week.

The launch brought out VIPs to West Texas including Oprah Winfrey and several women who previously have flown on private flights. Winfrey, a close friend of King, wiped away tears when the capsule reached space and the passengers were heard marveling at the moon and shouting with joy.

This wasn't the first Blue Origin launch with marquee names.

""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner caught a lift to space with Blue Origin in 2021 at age 90, soon after Bezos' inaugural trip. He was followed by former New York Giants defensive end and TV host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the rocket is named. Two aviation pioneers who missed out on space when they were younger — Wally Funk and Ed Dwight — also rocketed away at ages 82 and 90, respectively.

Most of Blue Origin's passengers — 58 counting the latest launch — have been business or science types, TV hosts or YouTubers. Ticket prices are not disclosed.

The Russian Space Agency also has launched its share of space tourists, beginning with a California financier in 2001. Two decades later, a Russian actress filmed aboard the International Space Station.

Elon Musk's SpaceX also sells multi-day trips to private customers. SpaceX's first client to fly, billionaire tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman already has launched twice and performed the first private spacewalk. He's now set to become NASA's next administrator if confirmed by the Senate.

Chinese-born bitcoin investor Chun Wang just returned from the first spaceflight to carry people over the north and south poles. Wang picked up the whole SpaceX tab for himself and three polar explorers for an undisclosed sum.

""In this exciting new era of commercial spaceflight, the dream of becoming an astronaut is no longer limited to a select few,"" Wang said via X last week.

Intel has agreed to sell a 51% stake in its Altera programmable chip business to buyout firm Silver Lake for $4.46 billion, in the first major move under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan to revive the struggling American chipmaker.

The deal, announced on Monday, values Altera at $8.75 billion, a sharp decline from the $17 billion Intel paid in 2015.

The sale will provide Intel a cash boost as the chipmaker aggressively cuts costs to bolster its balance sheet, while it invests in a capital-intensive undertaking to become a contract manufacturer.

Shares of Intel were up 3.9% in premarket trading.

Since last year, Intel has taken steps to spin Altera out as a separate unit and said it planned to sell a portion of its stake.

""Today's announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,"" CEO Tan, who took the helm after former top boss Pat Gelsinger's ouster, said.

Altera makes programmable chips that can be used for various purposes from telecom equipment to military.

Reuters had first reported in November that Silver Lake was among potential suitors competing for a minority stake in Altera.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, after which Intel expects to deconsolidate Altera's financial results from Intel's financial statements, the company said.

In 2024, Altera generated revenue of $1.54 billion and posted an operating loss of $615 million.

Raghib Hussain, who was an executive at custom AI chipmaker Marvell Technology MRVL.O, will succeed Sandra Rivera as Altera CEO from May 5, Intel said.

British retailers have warned that Chinese companies risk flooding the U.K. with low cost goods as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs choke off access to the world's largest consumer market.

The British Retail Consortium said domestic firms had raised alarm about cheaper goods being ""rerouted"" away from the U.S. and toward other markets in the wake of Trump's 145% tariffs on China, along with the closure of a key tax loophole for low-cost imports.

""Retailers are very concerned about the risk of some lower quality goods being rerouted from the US to Europe as a result of the tariffs,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive at the BRC, said in a statement.

Analysts flagged that risk was especially pronounced among Chinese producers selling via online marketplaces such as Amazon, Shein and Temu.

""The likes of Shein and Temu, I guess there is a risk that they choose to direct exports over to Europe away from the U.S. and that pressures pricing, particularly for discount retailers and retailers at the lower end,"" Richard Chamberlain, head of European consumer discretionary equity research at RBC, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" on Monday.

Chamberlain added that this could hit lower cost British and European firms like clothing giant Primark and household goods store B&M. Primark declined to comment on the matter, while B&M did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.  

Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order ending a near century-old ""de minimis"" tax loophole for imports worth up to $800, in a move set to stymy the rapid growth of low cost Chinese retailers such as Shein and Temu.

Now, U.K. retailers are calling for the U.K. government to follow suit for its own tax exemption on imports worth up to £135 ($178).

""In light of current geopolitical tensions, the Government should review the de minimis rules to ensure the best outcomes for UK retailers and their customers,"" BRC's Dickinson said.

Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), told CNBC that even before the tariff announcement, member firms had been raising concerns about the volume of items coming into the country from Chinese companies and calling for an end to the tax-free import threshold.

""For many months, we have been asking the government to review the current duty de-minimis,"" Goodacre said by email. ""Billions of products every year are being sold through the large marketplaces, entering the country duty-free and also avoiding any VAT obligations.""

""The thought of Chinese companies dumping even more goods through these channels, a real possibility, is a worry for large and small retailers,"" he continued.

""Whilst customers will see lower prices, it will set an unfair marketplace leaving bricks and mortar stores at an even greater disadvantage than normal.""

However, Chamberlain suggested that the ability of Chinese firms to flood other markets could be limited, as the added cost of selling into the U.S. drives up their costs across the board.

""Those Chinese e-tailers are facing cost rises in their own right, especially with the changes to the de minimis rules that should cause them to have to pay import duties on exports into the U.S. So that may mean that they have to raise prices globally,"" he noted.

Airlines have a bird's eye view of the economy, and CEOs are seeing clouds.

Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines pulled their 2025 outlooks last week, calling out a murky U.S. economic picture and weaker near-term demand.

Airline CEOs are warning about slowing bookings, including weaker corporate travel, citing President Donald Trump's trade war, mass government layoffs, fewer visitors from Canada and other countries, and more recently, weaker demand for domestic coach seats as price-sensitive consumers grow skittish about planning trips.

Consumer sentiment tumbled this month, according to a University of Michigan survey. Bank of America said in a report Thursday that consumer spending on ""nice to have"" discretionary services like restaurants and tourism slipped in February and March.

""I think we're acting as if we're going to a recession,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""I think everybody is going into a defensive posture.""

It's a sharp change from the start of the year, when Bastian said 2025 was set to be the ""best financial year"" in the century-old airline's history.

Now, airlines are banking even more on wealthier leisure travelers, a big driver of record revenue in the wake of the pandemic. They're hoping those consumers will continue to treat themselves to pricier, roomier seats, despite global market turmoil and a more concerning economic picture.

Budget travel icon Spirit Airlines last week used a beloved line from Parker Posey's North Carolinian character in ""The White Lotus"" in an ad for the carrier's priciest and roomiest seats.

""I just don't think at this age, I'm meant to live an uncomfortable life,"" Spirit quoted on its Instagram account above a picture of its ""Big Front Seat,"" which can fetch three times the price of a standard seat in exchange for more legroom and other perks.

Airlines are hoping that other travelers share the sentiment.

Carriers and credit card companies for years have been expanding their plush airport lounges. Airlines have also been racing to outfit their planes with more premium seating, like suites with doors. Air France and Lufthansa recently unveiled new, spacious first-class cabins, and demand is so high for stepped-up first- and business-class seats, which have hundreds of parts and require regulator approval, that it's holding up deliveries of new planes.

Delta and Frontier said they are pulling back their growth plans or even reducing capacity, especially for off-peak domestic trips on certain days of the week like Tuesday or Wednesday.

So far, executives are more optimistic about the expensive international routes and for seats like long-haul business class and premium economy.

""The impact has been most pronounced in domestic and specifically in the main cabin with softness in both consumer and corporate travel,"" said Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, on an earnings call last week. ""While not immune in this environment, we do continue to see greater resilience in international and our diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, reflecting underlying strength of our core consumer.""

Delta has already seen premium-segment revenue such as first-class seats or premium economy on international long-haul trips, grow faster than main cabin. Hauenstein says that's about to step up.

Premium revenue continues ""to widen the lead over main cabin,' he said. ""So we're expecting the spreads and the yields to actually widen in this next quarter as opposed to converge.""

United Airlines, which is Delta's closest rival, has a sprawling international network and has invested heavily in high-end refurbishments, lounges and flashy new destinations aimed at wealthier, globe-trotting customers. That carrier will provide more insight into consumer trends when it reports quarterly results this week.

American, Southwest and other airlines report in the following weeks.

Even as airlines have high hopes for higher-paying customers, there are problems brewing in international travel, too.

Delta and United have said they are paring back some of their Canada-U.S. flights, echoing comments from Canadian carriers as U.S.-bound travel demand falls, a trend that's threatening to further widen the $50 billion U.S. international travel deficit.

Non-U.S. citizen visitor arrivals in the United States last month totaled about 4.5 million, down nearly 13% from 2019, before the pandemic, and down nearly 10% from last year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

Weaker demand is set to bring more deals, and airlines have run fare sales even through late spring. But it could even mean cheaper flights to popular international destinations.

""This is probably the best summer for Europe travel I've seen years,"" said Scott Keyes, founder of travel deal site Going, formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights.

""I don't think there would have been all that much hope for it in 2022, 2023 and 2024,"" he said. ""The stars are aligning to boost the odds.""

In this article

Sony hiked the price of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing a ""challenging economic environment"" behind its move.

In Europe, the PS5 Digital Edition will now cost 499.99 euros ($569.9), Sony said in a blog post on Sunday. That is up from a previous price of 449.99 euros. The company said the U.K. recommended retail price is £429.99, a rise from the previous price of £389.99.

There is no price increase for the PS5 with HD Blu-ray disk drive in Europe and the U.K, while the PS5 Pro, an upgraded model of the console which was launched last year, was also spared hikes.

PS5 prices were also boosted for sales into Australia and New Zealand.

Sony said it has made the ""tough decision"" to raise prices against the ""backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.""

Global financial and currency markets have been volatile since U.S. President Donald Trump announced so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on more than 180 countries earlier this month. Since then, Trump has reduced some levies to allow time for negotiations and has exempted certain products, like smartphones.

Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, said its likely Sony will also raise PS5 prices in the U.S.

""I would be very surprised if Sony was able to keep the PlayStation prices in the US stable. Now is the 'right' time for the company to hike prices because user backlash would be comparably limited,"" Toto told CNBC on Monday.

""So yes, I expect Sony to raise prices in the U.S. eventually, once it's at least a bit more clear where exactly tariffs are headed.""

It's not the first time that Sony has boosted prices for the console, which is now more than four years old. It previously undertook hikes in 2022 in various countries and regions, then further lifted the console's price in Japan last year.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stock markets closed higher on Monday after investors parsed news of a U.S. tariff exemption for some tech items.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed higher by 2.7%, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 ended the day up 2%, Germany's DAX up by 2.6%, and France's CAC 40 up by 2.4%.

Oil and gas stocks jumped 3% despite forecasts of weaker oil prices in 2025, while banks rose nearly 3%.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk rose 3.7% after competitor Pfizer scrapped the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill over a livery injury in one patient.

After the market closed, luxury giant LVMH reported a 3% drop in first-quarter sales of 20.3 billion euros ($23.1 billion), lower than the 21.2 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts.

U.S. President Donald Trump's extreme and fast-changing tariff policy has led to one of the most volatile periods on record for global equities.

After a strong start to the year in which it had been outperforming U.S. markets, the Stoxx 600 has fallen more than 8% in April so far, while Wall Street's S&P 500 has lost 4.43%.

In fresh developments over the weekend, smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices and components were exempted from the U.S. duties — though only temporarily, according to officials. U.S. Customs and Border Protection guidance indicates 20 product categories are exempt from the 125% tariff newly-imposed by Trump on Chinese imports and the 10% baseline tariff on imports from other countries, while a 20% tariff on all Chinese goods remains in effect.

Trump on Sunday said he would be announcing the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, NBC News reported.

Key questions for markets remain over exactly how long Trump's pause on his full ""reciprocal tariff"" plan will last, and how various countries will seek to or be able to negotiate without resorting to their own retaliatory action. The European Union last week paused its own countertariffs for 90 days in order to engage in talks.

Currency and bond markets have also been swept up in the action, with the euro climbing to its highest level against the U.S. dollar for more than three years.

The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury jumped from 3.99% at the start of last week to 4.49% by Friday, with its spread over the German 10-year bund widening by the most in a week since 1990.

Meanwhile, investors must also contend with the start of first-quarter earnings season this week, with companies now facing a hugely uncertain trade environment.

It is relatively quiet on the data front, but inflation figures will be released in the coming days ahead of the European Central Bank's April meeting on Thursday.

Asia-Pacific markets gained on Monday, as U.S. stock futures rose.

European stock indexes closed higher as investors welcomed news of a U.S. tariff exemption.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed higher by 2.6%, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 ended the day up 2%, Germany's DAX up by 2.6%, and France's CAC 40 up by 2.4%

Stocks kicked off Monday's session in the green.

The Dow jumped 480 points, or 1.2%, shortly after 9:30 a.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively.

— Alex Harring

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, lowered its outlook for oil demand growth in its latest monthly report published Monday. 

The 12-member oil producer organization had previously been significantly more bullish on global growth and oil demand than many other economic forecasters.

""The global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year, however, the near-term trajectory is now subject to higher uncertainty given the recent tariff-related dynamics,"" OPEC's report read.

""The global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 is revised down slightly"" to 1.3 million barrels per day, year-on-year, compared to a forecast of 1.4 million barrels per day in March. The forecast for global oil demand growth in 2026 was also revised down to 1.3 million barrels per day from 1.4 million.

""This minor adjustment is mainly due to received data for 1Q25 and the expected impact on oil demand given recently announced US tariffs,"" the report said.

— Natasha Turak

Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk spiked higher after competitor Pfizer scrapped its weight loss pill following a livery injury in one patient.

Novo Nordisk, famed for its weight loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, was last up 4.5% at 12:09 p.m. in London.

Rival firm Pfizer earlier announced that it would end the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill after one of its patients experienced a liver injury. The patient was taking an oral GLP-1 drug called danuglipron, and had their dosage of it increased over a short period of time. The patient recovered quickly after they stopped taking the pill, according to Pfizer.

""While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients,"" Dr. Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, said in a press release, adding that the company is continuing to develop other weight loss drugs.

European software firms crowded the top of the Stoxx600 on Monday morning following fresh tariff developments over the weekend, which saw smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices and components exempted from U.S. tariffs.

Swiss software firm Logitech led gains and was up 8.8% at 11:50 a.m. in London. British medical products and tech firm Convatec gained almost 7%. GN Group, a Danish manufacturer of audio products, was up nearly 6%.

Meanwhile, manufacturing firm Vallourec was up 5.8%, while Technip Energies, an engineering and tech firm, was up 4.8%.

Germany's Federal Cartel Office on Monday said it had cleared Italy's UniCredit to acquire a stake of up to 29.99% in Commerzbank, amid persisting questions over a potential future takeover by the Italian lender.

""The notified minority acquisition alone will strengthen UniCredit's market position in the private and corporate banking business in Germany. We have therefore taken a close look at the financial services segments particularly affected. Other significant competitors are active in all areas, which is why the transaction had to be approved,"" said Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office, in a Google-translated statement. 

Last month, UniCredit, which progressively accrued a roughly 28% stake in Commerzbank over surprise derivative builds at the end of last year, received critical permission to own a shareholding of up to 29.99% in the German lender from the European Central Bank, which has euro zone banks under its purview. 

It remains unclear whether UniCredit will pivot toward a full takeover offer for Commerzbank, after it simultaneously launched an acquisition bid for Italian peer Banco BPM. Commerzbank has meanwhile been actively making a standalone case with investors.

The euro and British pound extended last week's gains as the U.S. dollar remained on the backfoot on Monday, with the dollar index down 0.63% at its lowest level for three years.

The euro was up 0.23% at 8:50 a.m. U.K. time at $1.138, while sterling was up 0.6% at $1.136.

Benjamin Picton, senior macro strategist at Rabobank, said in a Monday note that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's prior argument that the cost of tariffs would be partially shouldered by exporting countries due to a stronger dollar appeared to have ""gone out the window for now.""

However, Picton also noted that the overvaluation of the U.S. dollar due to its reserve currency status was a long-standing bugbear of Trump and some of his allies.

— Jenni Reid

European stocks roared back into the green at Monday's open after a weekly loss of 1.9% for the regional Stoxx 600 index.

Germany's DAX popped 2.06%, while France's CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up by 1.9% and 1.75%, respectively.

— Jenni Reid

The scale of recent financial market volatility spurred by Trump tariffs was highlighted in research published by Deutsche Bank strategists Henry Allen and Jim Reid on Sunday, who called it among the ""most tumultuous periods in living memory.""

The period since the initial announcement on April 2 has seen the S&P 500 record its worst day since the pandemic in March 2020, along with its best day since the Financial Crisis in 2008, they said. Swiss equities have been among the worst performers in Europe, with the Swiss Market Index falling 10.4% in local currency terms.

They also highlighted moves in global bond yields, with the U.S. 10-year yield seeing its biggest weekly increase since 2001, despite its traditional status as a safe haven investment during turbulent periods. The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and Germany's 10-year bund has widened by the largest weekly amount since German reunification in 1990, as the latter has emerged as an alternative flight-to-safety asset.

— Jenni Reid

Goldman Sachs forecasts a decline in oil prices this and next year on the back of the rising risk of a recession and higher supply from the OPEC+ group.

The investment bank expects the Brent Crude to edge down to $63 a barrel through the end of this year and $58 next year. Meanwhile, it expects the West Texas Intermediate to average at around $59 a barrel for the rest of this year and $55 in 2026.

Oil prices fell Monday on the back of uncertainties on the rollout of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff rollout.

Brent Crude fell 0.37% to trade at $64.52 per barrel as of 11.35 a.m. Singapore time, while the WTI dropped 0.39% to $61.26.

Technology stocks in Asia-Pacific climbed Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump paused tariffs on phones, computers and consumer electronics.

Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry - which assembles iPhones for Apple - was up 4.46% as at 10 a.m. Singapore time.

Over in Japan, gains were led by Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp, which added 3.89%, and SoftBank Group, which was up 2.29%.

Meanwhile, South Korean parts maker LG Innotek, which gets a substantial chunk of its revenue from Apple, was last seen up 7.26%.

In Hong Kong, the best performers were Nio which surged 6.33%, Alibaba which gained 5.73% and Xpeng which advanced 5.6%.

— Amala Balakrishner

While the Trump administration's move to exempt smartphones, computers and semiconductors, among other electronic devices and components, from ""reciprocal"" tariffs may have been a win for Big Tech, the market could still be facing ""mass uncertainty"" around President Donald Trump's tariff policy, says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

""The White House made the right move in our view as tech leaders and the overall tech industry knew that if these tariffs went into effect it would essentially be a shut off valve for getting products to the US consumers,"" Ives wrote in a note dated Sunday.

""[B]ut still there is mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead with all focus on China tariff negotiations being front and center and any progress on this game of high stakes poker between Beijing and DC being crucial to the markets and the economy this week,"" he continued.

Just as many mission-driven fund managers have reconsidered their defense policy in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an analyst at Goldman Sachs says it is now time for sustainable investors to re-evaluate their approach to oil and gas companies.

It comes at a time when European energy majors have slashed renewable spending and doubled down on fossil fuels in an effort to boost near-term shareholder returns.

Investments focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors tend to favor companies that score highly on certain criteria, such as climate change, human rights or corporate transparency.

Tobacco giants, fossil fuel companies and weapons makers have typically been among those to have been screened out or excluded from sustainable portfolios.

""In the same way that the sentiment on defense companies has changed with the Russia-Ukraine war, I think the sentiment on ownership of oil and gas should change,"" Michele Della Vigna, head of EMEA natural resources research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC by video call.

A persistent unwillingness to own energy majors is biased by a ""major mistake"" in evaluating the energy transition from the perspective of European investors, Della Vigna said — an approach that he expects to change.

Goldman's Della Vigna outlined three reasons to back-up his view on why ESG investors should bring oil and gas stocks in from the cold.

""Let's be clear, this energy transition will be much longer than expected. We are going to have, we think, peak oil demand in the mid-2030s [and] peak gas demand in the 2050s,"" Della Vigna said.

""And we clearly show that we need greenfield oil and gas development well into the 2040s. So, if we need new oil and gas development, why wouldn't we own these companies?""

The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, has said it expects fossil fuel demand to peak by the end of the decade. The energy watchdog has also repeatedly warned that no new oil and gas projects are needed to meet global energy demand while achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Della Vigna's second point was that oil and gas companies represent some of the biggest investors in low-carbon energy worldwide, adding that a failure to both engage with, and finance oil and gas stocks would ultimately serve as a barrier to the energy transition.

In addition, Della Vigna said that unlike utilities, which he described as infrastructure builders, oil and gas companies are ""market makers"" and ""risk-takers.""

""So, we need their capabilities, the balance sheet and the risk-taking. They are some of the largest investors in low carbon and whether we like it or not, we also need their core businesses of oil and gas,"" Della Vigna said.

""Otherwise, we will not have affordable energy, especially for emerging markets, and we will have energy poverty, which I don't think is acceptable in any ESG framework,"" he continued.

""I think the energy companies that lead the energy transition should be a cornerstone of ESG funds — not a divestment target,"" Della Vigna said.

Not everyone is convinced that oil and gas stocks should follow defense companies into an ESG portfolio.

""I think it is a bit extreme,"" Ida Kassa Johannesen, head of commercial ESG at Saxo Bank, told CNBC by video call.

""Just because defense stocks have gained favor doesn't mean that oil and gas should also gain favor. I don't think we should compare the two directly,"" Kassa Johannesen said.

""We can see the negative impacts of oil and gas. The current climate situation is not good. We see record-breaking temperatures, rising greenhouse gas emissions, oceans warming and sea level rise. I mean, why would we want to see more fossil fuels? Most ESG investors would not,"" she added.

Scientists have repeatedly pushed for rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to stop global average temperatures rising. These calls have continued through an alarming run of temperature records, with the planet registering its hottest year in human history in 2024.

Extreme temperatures are fueled by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels.

Allen Good, a senior stock analyst covering the oil and gas industries at Morningstar, said it's difficult to foresee a time where there will be a total acceptance of oil and gas in ESG.

He added, however, that a slightly more relaxed approach from investors is feasible on the basis that energy majors significantly increase the amount they invest in renewable and low-carbon technologies.

""I mean ESG, to me, it's whole raison d'être is the energy transition [and] climate change. So, I would find it hard to believe that they would say they are going to start investing in oil and gas companies,"" Good told CNBC by telephone.

""Now, I think what you could start to see is some loosening around the edges, whereby they come to some agreement where a company is investing X amount in renewable energy, or their earnings will be X amount in 10 years, then maybe a Total[Energies] gets into the portfolio. But someone like an Exxon or even a Chevron … I would find that hard to see how that gets in ESG,"" he added.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said that there are no winners in a trade war and warned against protectionism.

The comments come ahead of his state visits to three Southeast Asian countries from April 14 to 18: Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. Xi's visit to Vietnam began on Monday and will end on Tuesday.

In an exclusive article for Nhan Dan, the official newspaper of Vietnam's Communist Party, Xi wrote that ""trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere.""

He added that Vietnam and China should ""resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.""

In 2024, mainland China was Vietnam's third largest source of foreign investment, behind Singapore and South Korea.

The world's second largest economy is also reportedly Cambodia's largest foreign investor, and the third largest investor in Malaysia for approved investments.

In the article, he said that it is important that both Vietnam and China ""promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.""

Xi also called for deeper cooperation between the two countries, including business cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, saying ""China welcomes more quality Vietnamese products in the Chinese market and encourages more Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Vietnam.""He added that the two sides should increase cooperation in areas like industrial and supply chains, as well as ""emerging"" ones such as 5G, artificial intelligence and green development.

Xi also urged the two sides to work with the Global South ""to uphold the common interests of developing countries.""

Vietnam was hit with one of the highest levels of ""reciprocal"" tariffs from the U.S. at 46%, although this has been paused by U.S. President Donald Trump for 90 days. Imports from Vietnam to the U.S. will be subject to the baseline 10% levies for now.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


On late Friday, the Trump administration welcomed the weekend in the best way: by announcing that electronics — such as smartphones, computers and semiconductors — will be temporarily exempted from his so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs, including the baseline 10% rate on all countries.

That means such products imported from China will apparently not be subjected to the 125% tariff U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on Beijing (a 20% tariff will remain). Apple CEO Tim Cook must be heaving a sigh of relief: The Cupertino-based company manufactures around 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers in China, according to an estimate from Evercore ISI.

The news is also a relief for consumers, who desperately need an uplift in mood, based on the findings of the University of Michigan's latest survey. After all, it's not just corporations and importers that are affected by tariffs. Laptop prices have already shot up, according to disgruntled comments on Reddit. The Nintendo Switch 2 preorder was postponed.

Perhaps even Trump is keeping in mind the famous Wall Street adage: Don't bet against the U.S. consumer.

Tech exempted from tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs, according to guidance issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday evening. However, Trump and his aides on Sunday suggested those exemptions would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks, adding to the confusion over abrupt policy changes.

U.S. markets rise amid a volatile weekU.S. stocks climbed Friday to end the week on a positive note despite heavy market turbulence caused by the Trump administration's tariffs. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 5.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 5% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 7.3%. Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index popped over 2%, leading gains in the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1.6%.

Consumers in the U.S. are really downcastConsumer sentiment in April sank further, according to the University of Michigan's survey. It posted a mid-month reading of 50.8 — the lowest since June 2022 and the second lowest in the survey's history going back to 1952 — below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 54.6. At the same time, respondents' expectation for inflation a year from now leaped to 6.7%, the highest level since November 1981 and up from 5% in March.

'Very close' to a recessionBlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday told CNBC that he thinks ""we're very close, if not in, a recession now."" However, Fink said he did not think the U.S. was in a financial crisis and expects ""megatrends"" like artificial intelligence would persist. Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio raised similar alarm bells Sunday, saying the country is ""very close to a recession"" — but he's ""worried about something worse than a recession"" if the situation isn't handled well.

Exports from China soarChina's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year ago, in U.S. dollar terms, according to data released by its customs authority Monday. That significantly beats Reuters' poll estimates of a 4.4% growth and is the biggest increase since October last year. Imports fell 4.3% in March from a year earlier, more than economists' expectations of a 2% decline.

Singapore downgrades growth forecastThe Monetary Authority of Singapore on Monday eased its monetary policy for the second time in a row. The central bank also announced a 3.8% year-over-year expansion in Singapore's economy for the first quarter, missing the Reuters poll estimate of 4.3% growth. The country's Ministry of Trade and Industry cut its gross domestic product forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, down from its previous outlook of 1%-3%.

[PRO] What would Buffett do?Warren Buffett began 2025 with the most cash he's ever had on hand. CNBC Pro's Yun Li looks at the methods by which the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has handled past market crises to get a glimpse into how he might navigate the current market meltdown — an environment in which he's known to thrive.

China urges Trump to correct mistakes and heed 'rational voices' on reciprocal tariffs

China's Commerce Ministry called the U.S. tariff exemptions a ""small step"" and urged U.S. President Donald Trump to ""completely abolish"" the reciprocal tariffs, which include a 145% duty on imports from China.

""We urge the U.S. to heed the rational voices of the international community and domestic parties, take a big stride in correcting its mistakes, completely abolish the wrongful action of 'reciprocal tariffs,'"" the ministry said in an online statement, according to a CNBC translation.

The recent exemptions of tariffs on imports of tech products are being presented domestically as Trump is backing down and further evidence that Chinese supply chains are not easily replaceable by U.S. companies.

Amid a brain drain and economic woes, Bhutan has used cryptocurrency to double the salaries of its civil servants.

Bhutan mines bitcoin to offset declining tourism revenue, fund economic growth

For years, Bhutan has measured its economic and social development using uncommon currencies: happiness and sustainability.

But amid growing economic pains and a brain drain, the small, landlocked Himalayan kingdom is adopting a new emblem of progress, which is propelling Bhutan into a leading role globally in embracing financial innovation: Bitcoin.

Nestled between India and China, Bhutan – also the first country in the world to become carbon negative – has mined millions of dollars in the world's most popular cryptocurrency in recent years, making an economic bet that almost no other country has to the same extent.

So, why is Bhutan going big on Bitcoin? How is it mining the energy-intensive cryptocurrency? How much wealth in Bitcoin does the country hold? And is its move risky, given the wild fluctuations in prices that the digital currency has witnessed over the years?

Bitcoin is the first decentralised, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, created in 2008. It is not controlled by any government.

People can buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and these transactions are recorded on a shared ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin has value because there is a finite number of Bitcoins that can exist on the blockchain, about 21 million. Most of these coins have been mined, and approximately one million remain.

Bitcoin mining is the process through which new Bitcoins are officially added to the blockchain. To mine Bitcoin, an energy-guzzling supercomputer needs to solve a complex puzzle. This adds a new digital coin into circulation.

Bhutan's hydropower plants fuel supercomputers that solve complex problems to be rewarded with Bitcoin, which can be added to the blockchain.

“It's just a simple strategic choice that many people have made and earned billions of dollars, and I think governments should do it,” Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay told Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith in the capital, Thimphu, in March.

Tobgay explained that during the summer months, there is more water flow, and the hydropower plants generate more energy than needed.

“That's where Bitcoin mining makes tremendous sense,” said Tobgay.

The country is in the midst of mounting economic challenges, and Bitcoin mining is among a set of steps the nation of 800,000 people is taking to fight its way out of the crisis.

The country has no outlet to the sea, and although – at a little more than 38,000sq km (14,672sq miles) – it is almost as big as Switzerland, most of this land is not arable due to its mountainous terrain. Bhutan imports most of its food from India, which Tobgay described as the kingdom's “closest friend and neighbour”.

Tourism contributes more than 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). In 2023, it brought in $334m, according to the Royal Monetary Authority, Bhutan's central bank. The country's GDP stood at $3.02bn that year.

However, those figures mask the country's struggle to draw people back to visit its mountains, forests and Buddhist shrines since a setback during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bhutan has long controlled how many tourists it hosts to ensure that its pristine ecology is not affected by a higher footfall than it can manage. It charges a sustainable development fee of $100 to foreign tourists. The only exception to this rule is tourists from India, who have to pay $15. Tobgay says the vision behind this is to attract “high-value and low-volume” tourists.

But now, Bhutan is struggling to attract even the limited number of tourists it wants. According to Tobgay, the country can host approximately 300,000 tourists every year.

“Last year, I think about 150,000 tourists visited,” the prime minister said.

Bhutan's youth unemployment rate was 19 percent in 2024. The global average youth unemployment rate in 2023 was 13.6 percent, according to the World Bank.

One of the most potent symptoms of Bhutan's crisis is the exodus of young, educated people to other countries in recent years – and their departure only compounds the country's economic struggle.

In 2022 alone, more than 10 percent of Bhutan's skilled and educated population left the country. Australia, one of the major destination countries, saw its Bhutanese immigrant population more than double in five years between 2016 and 2021.

“We have jobs in Bhutan but they cannot compete against the wages that they can earn elsewhere in developed countries,” Tobgay said.

This brain drain has also depleted Bhutan's civil services. There was a sharp increase in civil servants quitting the system since 2019, with the number of civil servants quitting continuing to increase until 2023, the state-funded Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) reported in April 2024.

This is where Bitcoin, as an economic resource, appears to have helped. In 2023, the Bhutanese government sold $100m of cryptocurrency to double the salaries of civil servants, Al Jazeera's Smith reported from Thimphu.

Since then, the BBS reported a marginal decline in civil servants quitting their jobs. In the first quarter of 2024, 500 civil servants resigned, compared with the nearly 1,900 who resigned in the same period in 2023.

 



 

Bhutan has not formally disclosed how much it holds in the cryptocurrency.

However, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, Bhutan's Bitcoin holdings are worth more than $600m as of April 9, making up about 30 percent of the kingdom's GDP.

Arkham's data suggests that Bhutan also holds other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and LinqAI, although the kingdom's holdings of these currencies are much smaller than those of Bitcoin.

Bhutan's king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, has long advocated for the country to invest in its digital infrastructure.

“Being a small nation makes us a smart nation – this is not out of choice but out of necessity,” the king said in a 2019 address. “Technology is an indispensable tool that will be necessary to realise this aspiration.”

Bitcoin mining is one of the few ventures that allows Bhutan, a constitutional monarchy, to grow its economy while aligning with its values as a country, analysts say.

“The number of private sector investments that flow into Bhutan is quite limited because of the restrictions that come with Bhutan's mandate to maintain around 60 percent of forest cover and to focus on happiness and conservation of the environment rather than embracing industrialisation rapidly,” Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation (ORF), told Al Jazeera.

This limitation is also something Prime Minister Tobgay spoke of.

“We have been mindful to be very careful about foreign direct investment,” Tobgay said. “We have been careful about allowing industries that would harm the environment, that would pollute our air, that would undermine our culture.”

What Bhutan does have is an environment and natural resources conducive to mining the cryptocurrency, said the ORF's Shivamurthy.

The capital, Thimphu, and other regions have cold temperatures, reducing the need to overutilise the cooling systems needed to prevent supercomputers from overheating. The average temperatures in the country remain between 15 to 30 degrees Celsius (59-86 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout the year, according to data from the World Bank.

The country also produces more hydropower than it consumes.

“It is important for Bhutan to capitalise on the green energy we have in terms of mining Bitcoin as a part of our investment portfolio,” Ujwal Deep Dahal, the CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, the commercial and investment arm of the Royal Government of Bhutan, told Al Jazeera.

Bhutan exports hydroelectricity to India. But Bitcoin mining gives Bhutan an alternative to exports. Where tariff rates are good, it sells the power to India. In projects where the rates are not good, Bhutan keeps the power and uses it to mine Bitcoin instead, the ORF's Shivamurthy explained.

“Instead of exporting [hydropower] at a very cheap rate, we are using it to mine Bitcoins in the high mountains of Bhutan,” Tenzing Lamsang, editor-in-chief of The Bhutanese newspaper, a private weekly based in Thimphu, told Al Jazeera.

Besides mining Bitcoin, the country is building a special administrative region and economic hub, the Gelephu Mindfulness City, to combine its ideals of sustainability and wellbeing with commercial growth. The city is an urban development project with low-rise buildings, sustainable businesses, residential zones, a national park and a wildlife sanctuary.

 



 

While governments were wary about Bitcoin in its early days, many are now changing their approach.

On March 6, United States President Donald Trump established a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Besides the US, El Salvador holds nearly $550m in Bitcoin, the government announced on March 5.

Other governments, such as the Central African Republic and France, are beginning to recognise Bitcoin as a legal tender.

On April 7, Pakistan appointed Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, which is the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, as an adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), a regulatory body set up in March, as the country attempts to position itself as a crypto leader in South Asia.

Bitcoin is trading up 11% from the lows of $74,450 as of Wednesday, as overall markets saw a significant jump — with the Nasdaq up nearly 12%, the S&P 500 up 9%, and the Dow up 8%.

The altcoin market, including ETH, is up 8.35%, but still 40% below its all-time high of $1.6 trillion. It would need to rise by 70% to reach that peak again.

Bitcoin Weekly Chart

Bitcoin has shown demand at the previous weekly swing from March 10, which is around $76,560. This is a crucial level for Bitcoin to hold in the short term. As we've seen a significant rally, Bitcoin should not return to the lows if the price is going to reverse the daily trend.

Closing above the 50EMA on the weekly also would be ideal.

Bitcoin Daily Chart

Even with this massive rally, the structure on the daily chart still remains bearish. This is why understanding structure is important. Just because sentiment may feel more bullish than ever, as the markets haven't seen a rally like this in a long time, things could still continue the bearish trend.

Screenshot via TradingView User NoticeTrades

In terms of the daily structure, this is a decent start for a rally, but there are key levels to monitor.

The first is the $88,000 range, where price was rejected twice.

The second is the $92,000 range, which is the lower end of the consolidation that eventually broke.

With this strong rally on Wednesday, you would want to see continuation. That's the key here. If you start seeing this momentum fade and price trades back below $80,000, it could be a sign that this was just a move to create another lower high on the daily, setting up a continuation to the downside.

As always, it's crucial to stay disciplined and monitor the key levels closely. The market's reaction at these price points will give us a clearer picture of whether the rally can sustain itself or if the bearish trend will resume. Keep an eye on the structure and adjust your strategy accordingly. Patience and proper risk management will be key as we navigate through these critical levels.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired around 3,450 Bitcoin worth $286 million last week, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Unveiling a Bitcoin purchase for the third straight Monday, the Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns 531,644 Bitcoin worth $45.2 billion, based on the asset's current price.Strategy paid an average price of $82,600 per Bitcoin last week, it added.

Strategy, which has shifted its focus from software development to become a Bitcoin treasury, said it meanwhile sold one million Class A common shares through an at-the-money offering program unveiled in October. Under the initiative, Strategy said it can still issue an additional $2 billion worth of common shares, alongside swaths of preferred perpetual stock.

Strategy's shares rose 4% on Monday to around $312, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 1.5%, adding on to last week's recovery after the White House said smartphones and computers would be exempt from sweeping levies, including 125% taxes on Chinese goods, per Nasdaq.

Monday's price action represents a dramatic turnaround after investors navigated outsized uncertainty last week, including a disclosure from Strategy that it may ultimately need to sell Bitcoin to meet its financial obligations. Amid tariff-linked concerns, Strategy's shares fell as low as $236, or around 32% below their opening on Monday.

“No Tariffs on Orange Dots,” Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday, referring to the way Bitcoin buys look on Saylor Tracker.

The price of Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $85 on Monday, showing a roughly 8.3% increase of the past week, according to CoinGecko. Over the past month, it's virtually flat.

Strategy has become the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin since it began accumulating the asset in 2020. Over time, as it has embraced its role as a Bitcoin treasury firm, Strategy has issued billions of dollars in debt to buy more Bitcoin than it could otherwise.

The Nasdaq-listed firm's 531,600 Bitcoin tower over the next largest corporate holder, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, which is around 47,500 Bitcoin, according to Bitcoin Treasures. As of this writing, Strategy's stash accounted for more than 2.5% of Bitcoin total supply.  

The Tokyo-based investment firm Metaplanet, which began buying Bitcoin last May, said on X on Monday that it had recently bought 319 Bitcoin worth $27 million. The company said in an update that it now holds 4,525 Bitcoin worth around $385 million.

Among publicly traded companies, MetaPlanet is currently the 10th largest Bitcoin holder, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.

14 April 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, announced today its intention to deploy both existing and future hashrate on OCEAN, a leading Bitcoin mining pool focused on decentralization and launched by long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. This strategic move strengthens Tether's ongoing commitment to supporting the resilience, transparency, and decentralization of Bitcoin's foundational infrastructure.

OCEAN empowers miners to build their own block templates using their open source DATUM protocol, reducing dependency on centralized intermediaries and enhancing censorship resistance within the Bitcoin network. Tether's deployment leverages OCEAN's DATUM Gateway software, designed to deliver high-performance mining operations even in bandwidth-constrained environments.

“As a company committed to financial freedom and open access, we see supporting decentralization in Bitcoin mining as essential to the network's long-term integrity,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Deploying hashrate to OCEAN aligns with both our mining investments and our broader mission to fortify Bitcoin against centralizing forces.”

Tether will roll out OCEAN's DATUM Gateway across its mining operations worldwide, including in rural and underserved areas such as parts of Africa. By enabling on-site generation of unique block templates and aggregating thousands of rig connections with low-latency performance, DATUM ensures global competitiveness while promoting geographic and operational diversity.

“Tether's decision to mine on OCEAN reflects months of deep technical evaluation,” said Giv Zanganeh, VP of Mining & Energy at Tether. “We believe the DATUM protocol is the software stack most aligned with Bitcoin's decentralization ethos. Its architecture allows us to achieve reliable connectivity even in low-bandwidth regions, expanding the reach and resilience of our infrastructure.”

OCEAN leadership welcomed the development. Luke Dashjr, Chairman and CTO, commented: “Tether's involvement is a strong signal that decentralization remains a core priority for Bitcoin's future. Their participation underscores the value of open, censorship-resistant mining protocols.” Mark Artymko, OCEAN's President, added: “This alignment reinforces our shared belief that financial inclusion and decentralization go hand-in-hand.”

This deployment also builds on Tether's growing presence in Africa, where the company is actively investing in infrastructure and education. Most recently, Tether collaborated with Quidax on a major crypto literacy initiative across Nigeria and other African nations aimed at equipping millions with the tools to access and benefit from digital assets. By combining mining operations with educational programs, Tether is driving financial empowerment and digital resilience throughout the continent.

Vitalik Buterin, the original creator of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of the most recognizable figures of the cryptocurrency industry. He's often admired in the ecosystem for being highly technical while also deeply philosophical about technology's role in society. For those that do not follow crypto closely, Buterin starkly contrasts the stereotypical image of a flashy cryptocurrency billionaire with his minimalism in his personal style as well as his geeky and awkward mannerisms.



The documentary “Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,” which is set for global release April 15, tries to give us a peek into those aspects of Buterin, following his early life and childhood in Russia followed by immigrating with his family to Toronto, Canada, where his love for computers and technology began in his high school years. 



At the core of Buterin's life was the creation of Ethereum, which came after his early involvement in Toronto's Bitcoin community, where he saw the potential of the asset in giving people some financial freedom. While thinking how he could apply those concepts to other aspects of life, Buterin set out to write a whitepaper on creating the blockchain version of the internet.



Toronto has strong ties to Ethereum's early days. It was home to some of the first Ethereum developer hackathons and meetups organized by Ethereum's Canadian co-founders in the city.



This year, CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 takes place in Toronto May 14-16, highlighting Canada's vibrant crypto community.



The film walks through the various stages of Ethereum's lifetime, including the start of the network and the struggles Buterin faced in his new leadership role, the boom of the blockchain during the NFT era, the importance of the Merge in reducing Ethereum's energy consumption, and Buterin's urge to help Ukraine in its war with Russia by deploying crypto for resources.



CoinDesk sat down with the directors of the documentary, Chris Temple and Zach Ingrasci, to hear about their perspectives on creating the film, ahead of its global release.



This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.



CoinDesk: Why did you want to make a documentary about Ethereum?



Zach Ingrasci [ZI]: So Chris and I have been making documentaries together for 15 years now. We make character driven documentaries. So I really love those human stories that give us insight into the emotions and motivations of people in really interesting places.



We aren't crypto experts. We both studied economics, so we have a bit of understanding of finance. But when we met Vitalik in 2021 I think he immediately clicked something in our brains like: “oh, here's a story that kind of breaks the stereotypes that mainstream audiences have of this space.”



Quickly after meeting Vitalik, we did an NFT crowdfund for the film on mirror.xyz, peoplepleaser did the NFT. We raised basically the full budget of the film, and it allowed us to create this independent story and approach to follow Vitalik around the world, as, he lives out of a 40 liter backpack



How did you guys decide what parts of Ethereum's history to include in Vitalik's story? One noticeable moment I thought was interesting that you left out was not to include the 2016 DAO hack? Why exclude that key moment in Ethereum's history but leave in other moments?



ZI: This is the challenge of making these films. We had a very broad mandate, following the community, not just focused on Vitalik. And then after two years of filming, we realized that the kind of narrative structure would only make sense if you were able to follow one person and then get to meet the community through his eyes.



The DAO hack is very confusing to explain, and so there's an element of just what at its essence is important. And I think, you know, the moment for Vitalik to decide whether the Ethereum Foundation would be nonprofit versus for profit is a very understandable concept for a mainstream audience. They get it.



As you mentioned, there was the premiere a few months ago, and it was only accessible to people on-chain. If the movie is aimed for a mainstream audience, why first decide to release it on-chain, instead of a streaming platform where more of those folks can access it?



ZI: It's a practical answer. The documentary industry is broken, so to have an independent film premiere on a mainstream platform doesn't even mean anything, unless you have real marketing. And so actually, the on-chain release, the NFT, the trailer release on Zora, building sponsorship for this mainstream release is critical.



Chris Temple [CT]: People love the film, and have rallied behind it and been interested and been sharing it with their moms, being like: “Hey, this is what I do for a living.”



This isn't just our film, this film belongs to the community. And I think empowering people with it at that first step, and using the technology that the film was all about felt very right to us.



How did you convince Vitalik to do the film? He's not very rerceptive to the media so how did you get him to agree to do it?



ZI: I think we got really lucky in some ways. This was before he was on the front page of TIME magazine. I think he was motivated to speak up about what he believed the future of Ethereum should look like, and how to build it, and people should focus on building things that have real world value.



So I think we just happened to meet him at the perfect moment when he and the people around him were looking to have access to broader audiences.



I think ultimately, that's what makes for us Vitalik the perfect participant of a film, because his reluctance to be in that spotlight, that genuine authenticity. You can tell on the film that he's not trying to hog the spotlight. This is something that he's uncomfortable with, and something that's taken a long journey for him to even find where his voice is and how it should be.



CT: It was a very challenging production, more than any film we've ever made, because Vitalik is nomadic, he's all over the world, and he says, “I'm going to be tomorrow in Montenegro…If you want to come.” We have to immediately try to scramble and get everybody there just to get those moments, even if it's just a couple of hours with Vitalik.



Recently, there's been a bunch of leadership changes at the EF, and Vitalik has been at the core of making the decision on those changes. The movie shows how uncomfortable Vitalik can be in stepping into that leadership role and having to make core decisions like whether the EF should be a non-profit vs for-profit organization and going against some co-founders.



Given all the key decisions he's had to make over the past few months and a key leader in Ethereum, what do you think went through his mind, and has he become more comfortable in his leadership role?



ZI: I really can't speak for Vitalik, but I do think that's why this film has never been more relevant. Because if we are looking for insight into how Vitalik thinks and what he cares about, I think the thing he cares most about is that Ethereum will be useful in the world.



There's an important quote in the film about “if Ethereum is only used for speculation, that's a huge missed opportunity.” So it's not surprising that Vitalik didn't go to the White House [to meet with President Trump]. Vitalik cares about how this tool will be used in the long term for real, positive change in the world. He is uncomfortable with conflict, we know that, we see that in the film. So I can't imagine this has been an easy process for him.



But you can definitely tell that he's begun to understand how to use his voice in this ecosystem and use his kind of soft power.Read more: Ethereum Foundation Picks New Co-Executive Directors, Following Leadership Reshuffle



What was filming in Ukraine during the start of the Russian invasion like? And why does Vitalik feel so connected to that cause?



ZI: We have some experience filming on the borders of war zones. Luckily, at that time Kiev was relatively safe.



It really was Vitalik's idea, he always wanted to support the hackers there. Vitalik just felt like he could be there to support them, and it's something he cares so deeply about for two reasons: 1) he actually has Ukrainian ancestry, and 2) coming from Russia, I think he regrets having met with Putin.



Then there's also just really one of the first concrete examples of real positive impact in the world, of how crypto is being used when the banking system was in chaos, and so quickly got money to the front lines.



There's a deleted scene where he's playing chess with Fedorov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine. But you know, Fedorov was talking about how 1000s of their military were saved because of that $100 million Vitalik raised in crypto was quickly mobilized.



What are you hoping that your audience takes away from this film?



CT: Documentaries are bad at information, but they're great at provoking questions and getting emotions. If we can inspire an audience to be more savvy and think more critically about technology, not just in these extremes of it's all bad or it's all good, but to understand a bit of that spectrum along the middle there, and look at both the positive and negative consequences of technology.



I think that kind of techno optimism is the core of what this film is really about. Helping anybody apply those lessons, whether it's within crypto, within AI, because technology is just going to continue to shift and impact our lives.



The movie is about Vitalik as a person but also a bit about Ethereum's history. So is Vitalik = Ethereum?



ZI: I don't think he is, and I think that's what he hoped for at this point. I hope that comes across in the film, and that's why we called it an Ethereum story, because I think it's one of many that gets told. I think that's where Vitalik has been successful because he is not Ethereum.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin: ‘Privacy is freedom'","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-privacy-is-freedom","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:48:06 GMT","

 Buterin highlighted the urgent need for stronger privacy solutions, arguing that overreliance on transparency rests on naive assumptions about human nature. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said privacy should be a top priority for developers, warning that assumptions about transparency and good intentions in global politics are overly optimistic.

In an April 14 blog post, Buterin argued that privacy is essential to maintain individual freedom and protect against the growing power of governments and corporations. He criticized the idea that increased transparency is inherently beneficial, saying it relies on assumptions about human nature that are no longer valid.

“These assumptions include believing that global political leadership is generally well-intentioned and sane, and that social culture continues to progress in a positive direction,” Buterin wrote. “Both are proving to be increasingly untrue.”

Buterin claimed there was “no single major country for which the first assumption is broadly agreed to be true.” Furthermore, he wrote that cultural tolerance is “rapidly regressing,” which is reportedly demonstrable by an X post search for “bullying is good.”  

Buterin said that he found his lack of privacy unsettling at times. He added:

While this may appear as a suggestion that privacy is an advantage only for those who venture outside the social norms, he highlighted that “you never know when you will become one of them.”

Buterin only expects the need for privacy to increase as technology develops further, with brain-computer interfaces potentially allowing automated systems to peer directly into our brains. Another issue is automated price gouging, with companies charging individuals as much as they expect them to be able to pay.

Buterin also argued strongly against the idea of adding government backdoors to systems designed to protect privacy. He said such positions are common but inherently unstable.

He highlighted how, in the case of Know Your Customer data, “it's not just the government, it's also all kinds of corporate entities, of varying levels of quality” that can access private data. Instead, the information is handled and held by payment processors, banks, and other intermediaries.

Similarly, telecommunication companies can locate their users and have been found to illegally sell this data. Buterin also raised concerns that individuals with access will always be incentivized to abuse it, and data banks can always be hacked. Lastly, a trustworthy government can change and become untrustworthy in the future, inheriting all the sensitive data. He concluded:

Related: Privacy will unlock blockchain's business potential

Buterin raised the issue of governments being able to access anything with a warrant “because that‘s the way that things have always worked.” He noted that this point of view fails to consider that historically, the amount of data available for obtaining through a warrant was far lower.

He said the traditionally available data would still be available even “if the strongest proposed forms of internet privacy were universally adopted.” He wrote that “in the 19ᵗʰ century, the average conversation happened once, via voice, and was never recorded by anyone.”

Buterin suggested solutions based mainly on zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) because they allow for “fine-grained control of who can see what information.” ZK-proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove a statement is true without revealing any additional information.

One such system is a ZK-proof-based proof of personhood that proves you are unique without revealing who you are. These systems rely on documents like passports or biometric data paired with decentralized systems.

Another solution suggested is the recently launched privacy pools, which allow for regulatory-compliant Ether (ETH) anonymization. Buterin also cited on-device anti-fraud scanning, checking incoming messages and identifying potential misinformation and scams.

These systems are proof of provenance services for physical items using a combination of blockchain and ZK-proof technology. They track various properties of an item throughout its manufacturing cycle, ensuring the user of its authenticity.

The post follows Buterin's recent privacy roadmap for Ethereum. In it, he highlighted the short-term changes to the base protocol and ecosystem needed to ensure better user privacy.

Bitcoin (BTC) price approaches its key resistance level at $85,000 on Monday; a breakout indicates a bullish trend ahead. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) found support around their key levels last week, suggesting a recovery is in the cards.

Bitcoin price broke and closed above its descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple high levels since mid-January) on Friday and rallied 2.22% the next day. However, on Sunday, it faced rejection at the $85,000 level, which coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the daily resistance level. At the time of writing on Monday, it trades at around $84,000. 

If BTC breaks and closes above $85,000, it could extend the rally to the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart flattens around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the bullish momentum to be sustained.

BTC/USDT daily chart

If BTC fails to close above $85,000 and continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $73,072.

Ethereum price found support around its daily level of $1,449 last week, recovered slightly, but faced resistance around $1,700. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $1,638.

If ETH continues its recovery and closes above $1,700, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $1,861.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 42 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week. It points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the bullish momentum to be sustained.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH closes below its daily support level of $1,449, it could extend the decline to retest its important psychological level of $1,300.

XRP price recovered by 14.28%, breaking above its 200-day EMA at $1.95 on Wednesday. It declined by 4.24% the next day, and the 200-day EMA level was tested. XRP continued its recovery and retested its April 2 high of $2.23 on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it stabilizes at around $2.14.

If XRP breaks and closes above $2.23, it could extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 50 and points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating the bearish momentum is fading. The RSI must maintain its level above 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP closes below its 200-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Ethereum is approaching a key breakout from a triangle pattern, with bulls eyeing the $2,000 mark.

At $1,623, Ethereum has registered an intraday recovery of 1.60% at the time of writing. This bullish comeback is on the verge of erasing Sunday's 2.8% drop from the $1,650 mark. Ethereum's recovery has brought it to the apex of a triangle pattern.

Amid improving broader market sentiment, Ethereum's chances of a breakout are steadily increasing. Will this push ETH toward the psychological $2,000 level?

In the 4-hour price chart, the recent bullish turnaround from the $1,418 level marks a significant recovery for Ethereum. The higher high formation in Ethereum led to a local support trendline. 

The overhead resistance near $1,675, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci level, highlights the top of an ascending triangle pattern. A longstanding resistance trendline also creates a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart.

Also, technical indicators are showing a bullish trend. The Supertrend indicator suggests an uptrend is in motion, and the 4-hour RSI, remaining above the halfway mark, reflects strong bullish momentum. These indicators maintain an optimistic outlook for Ethereum.

As Ethereum approaches the apex of the triangle, price action traders are expecting a high-momentum move in either direction. According to Fibonacci levels, a bullish breakout could target the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $1,948.

This would increase the chances of Ethereum reaching the $2,000 psychological level. However, a potential breakdown could retest the $1,418 support level.

As Ethereum trades at relatively low levels, large investors are ramping up accumulation. According to CryptoQuant, the balance distribution of Ethereum by cohort shows significant growth in large holdings.

In the past year, the balance of holdings between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH has increased from 29.64% to 37.42%. The balance of wallets holding more than 100,000 ETH has risen to 11.88%, up from 11% a year ago.

Meanwhile, the retail segment has been reducing its holdings, with the balance of wallets holding 100 to 1,000 ETH falling from 29.47% to 21.48%.

Despite this, the strong support from large investors suggests an extended rally could be on the horizon.

As Ethereum nears a potential breakout rally, bullish sentiment in the derivatives market has significantly increased. Long positions in Ethereum have surged to 51.25%, boosting the long-to-short ratio to 1.0513.

The Ethereum open interest remains steady near $17.94 billion, while the funding rate has jumped to 0.0060%. The positive funding rate and the growing number of long positions signal increasing optimism for Ethereum.

As of Wednesday, the ETH/BTC pair is trading at 0.019, a level not seen since January 2020. This massive downtrend has sparked renewed interest in the ongoing relationship between the two leading cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin and Ethereum—especially considering the significant divergence between them in recent months.

In March 2024, Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high, while Ethereum lagged, remaining about 20% off its highs before topping out near $4,100 in early March of the same year. This divergence marked a stark contrast between the performance of the two assets, with Bitcoin pushing to new highs while Ethereum struggled to keep pace.

Fast forward to April 2024, and the gap has only widened. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,590, down 61% from the swing high formed in early December. In comparison, Bitcoin is down only 28% from its high in January, showing a more resilient performance in the face of market volatility.

With Ethereum's price struggling while Bitcoin maintains relative strength, the question remains: Can Ethereum mount a comeback, or will it continue to underperform against its more dominant ‘counterpart'?

Trending: It's no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here's how everyday investors are getting started.

The Reality of Picking Altcoins: Can They Outperform Bitcoin?

Many investors are drawn to altcoins, hoping they can outperform Bitcoin. However, much like in the stock market, consistently picking winners is difficult. In traditional markets, even top fund managers struggle to beat broad indices like the S&P 500. The same applies to crypto—Bitcoin is the market leader, setting trends and capturing most capital flows.

While altcoins can surge at times, many fail to maintain long-term relevance or underperform during market corrections. Ethereum's recent struggle to keep up with Bitcoin's rally highlights this challenge. Like in stocks, a diversified approach—holding Bitcoin as a core position while selectively investing in altcoins with strong fundamentals—remains the safest strategy. Ultimately, Bitcoin's dominance makes it hard for altcoins to consistently outperform.

Diving Into The Charts

When it comes to the trend, it has clearly been downhill for ETH, and it is currently not showing any signs of changing. However, it is important to identify previous levels that could act as potential demand zones, where traders or long-term investors may look to increase their positions.

On the weekly chart, ETH has traded below an old low printed in August 2023, when the majority of markets started to bottom. This is a natural support area for ETH and could act as a level where we see a short-term bounce.

The important factor to monitor will be momentum at this level and whether Bitcoin dominance starts to fall. Currently, Bitcoin dominance is still above 60%, and the momentum for Ethereum is not there just yet.

 The Trump family-linked crypto project has now spent around $347 million buying altcoins — and has a paper loss on all of them, according to onchain analysis. 

The Trump family-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has added 4.89 million SEI tokens valued at $775,000 to its portfolio, according to onchain data. 

Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the purchase was made on April 12 by one of WLFI's trading wallets using USDC transferred from the project's main wallet. It's the same trading wallet previously used by WLFI to accumulate other altcoins.

WLFI holds a diversified portfolio, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and a larger number of altcoins, such as Tron (TRX), Ondo Finance (ONDO), Avalanche (AVAX) and now Sei (SEI).

According to blockchain researcher Lookonchain, WLFI has spent a total of $346.8 million accumulating 11 different tokens, but as of April 12, it has yet to see a profit on any of them. The project's Ethereum investments alone are currently down over $114 million. 

Overall, Lookonchain says WLFI's portfolio is down $145.8 million.

Only two months ago, in a Feb. 3 X post, Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, urged his followers to buy Ether, writing: “In my opinion, it's a great time to add $ETH.” Originally, the tweet also included “you can thank me later,” but it was edited to remove those five words.

At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed ETH's price had fallen 55% since Eric Trump's tweet, currently trading at $1,611, down from the Feb. 3 close of $2,879.

Meanwhile, an icon for WLFI's stablecoin, USD1, has appeared on Coinbase, Binance and the crypto aggregator website CoinMarketCap in what appears to be the coin's unofficial logo unveiling.

Trump's involvement with USD1 has attracted criticism from lawmakers on both sides of US politics. At an April 2 US House Financial Services Committee hearing on stablecoin legislation, Democratic Representative Maxine Waters suggested President Trump may be ultimately planning to use USD1 to replace the US dollar.

“Trump likely wants the entire government to use stablecoins, from payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to Social Security payments to paying taxes. And which coin do you think Trump would replace the dollar with? His own, of course.”

The committee's Republican chair, French Hill, aired similar concerns.

“If there is no effort to block the president of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers.”

Bitcoin is trading up 11% from the lows of $74,450 as of Wednesday, as overall markets saw a significant jump — with the Nasdaq up nearly 12%, the S&P 500 up 9%, and the Dow up 8%.

The altcoin market, including ETH, is up 8.35%, but still 40% below its all-time high of $1.6 trillion. It would need to rise by 70% to reach that peak again.

Bitcoin Weekly Chart

Bitcoin has shown demand at the previous weekly swing from March 10, which is around $76,560. This is a crucial level for Bitcoin to hold in the short term. As we've seen a significant rally, Bitcoin should not return to the lows if the price is going to reverse the daily trend.

Closing above the 50EMA on the weekly also would be ideal.

Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.

Bitcoin Daily Chart

Even with this massive rally, the structure on the daily chart still remains bearish. This is why understanding structure is important. Just because sentiment may feel more bullish than ever, as the markets haven't seen a rally like this in a long time, things could still continue the bearish trend.

Screenshot via TradingView User NoticeTrades

In terms of the daily structure, this is a decent start for a rally, but there are key levels to monitor.

The first is the $88,000 range, where price was rejected twice.

The second is the $92,000 range, which is the lower end of the consolidation that eventually broke.

With this strong rally on Wednesday, you would want to see continuation. That's the key here. If you start seeing this momentum fade and price trades back below $80,000, it could be a sign that this was just a move to create another lower high on the daily, setting up a continuation to the downside.

As always, it's crucial to stay disciplined and monitor the key levels closely. The market's reaction at these price points will give us a clearer picture of whether the rally can sustain itself or if the bearish trend will resume. Keep an eye on the structure and adjust your strategy accordingly. Patience and proper risk management will be key as we navigate through these critical levels.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: XRP and 2 Other Altcoins with an Unstoppable Rally Around the Corner","https://financefeeds.com/cardano-ada-price-prediction-xrp-and-2-other-altcoins-with-an-unstoppable-rally-around-the-corner/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:23:09 GMT","

Savvy investors are already positioning themselves in altcoins that show the best possibility for exponential development as the cryptocurrency market gets set for what many anticipate to be another historic bull run. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most often used cryptocurrency, several less well-known initiatives show even more promise. Among them, Cardano (ADA), XRP from Ripple, and Rexas Finance (RXS) stand out as three cryptocurrencies with an irresistible climb in the following months, most likely. Strong technology, valuable applications, and rising acceptance support these projects. These altcoins could see notable breakouts as institutional investors and retail traders hunt for fresh prospects to set new all-time highs (ATH) in 2025 and beyond.  Let us investigate why Cardano, XRP, and Rexas Finance are positioned for notable expansion and why they could be the best choices for the next bull market.

Long regarded as among the most sophisticated blockchain systems available in cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA) excels in a scientific approach to blockchain development—that is, in using peer-reviewed research and thorough testing before significant innovations. Attracting developers and businesses, the Hydra scaling technology and Plutus smart contracts make Cardano more fit than ever to handle enormous transaction volumes at low cost. In 2021, Cardano reached its last all-time high of $3.10. ADA is prepared for a significant comeback in the next bull cycle with its expanding network of DeFi apps, NFT markets, and tokenized assets. Analysts estimate Cardano might surpass $5 if the market conditions match or approach $10. This is one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies entering 2025 because of its solid foundations and sustainability concentration.

One of the more divisive yet generally embraced cryptocurrencies on the market is XRP from Ripple. Unlike many speculative crypto ventures, XRP is helpful in the real world as a bridge currency for international payments and remittances.  Banks, payment companies, and financial institutions know about Ripple's network for fast and low-cost transaction processing. Since it has been legally clashing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has suffered. The unresolved case has made it difficult for XRP to increase prices and reach new heights. However, many analysts think a big breakout is about to happen, even if the case is not resolved. XRP is still much undervalued; its all-time high was $3.40. If Ripple gets regulatory clarity and keeps growing its alliances with financial institutions, XRP might quickly surpass $5 or even $10 in the next bull market. XRP is among the most exciting cryptocurrencies for long-term investors as worldwide demand for cross-border payments rises, and its adoption could be explosive.

Although Cardano and XRP are well-known projects, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a newly developed altcoin that might yield enormous returns for early investors. Rexas Finance is leading the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), enabling users to own and trade assets, including real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property, on the blockchain, unlike conventional cryptocurrencies. One of Rexas Finance's main benefits is its capacity to democratize investment. Conventional financing only makes high-value assets like fine art and real estate available to the rich. But thanks to Rexas' fractional ownership approach, investors of all kinds can now purchase and trade tokenized versions of these worthwhile assets.

Currently, RXS is in its presale period at $0.20; its intended launch price is $0.25. Rexas Finance is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting blockchain initiatives in asset management, having already raised over $47,624,594 in its presale and sold over 458,120,680 tokens.

Real-World Utility: Rexas Finance offers a real-world asset ownership solution, unlike many speculative crypto ventures, enabling more inclusive, open, and quick investment. Purchasing fractional real estate shares, precious metals, and other valuable assets allows investors to democratize their wealth-building chances. CertiK has thoroughly audited Rexas Finance to guarantee that its smart contracts are safe and free from flaws. Expanding its use cases outside asset tokenization, the Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Launchpad, and Rexas GenAI offer a complete ecosystem for token creation, fundraising, and NFT development. Given its strong fundamentals and market demand for real-world asset tokenization, RXS has the potential to reach $10-$20 in the next cycle, delivering 50x to 100x returns for early investors.

With the next bull market horizon, Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the top altcoins that could experience unstoppable rallies. Cardano's smart contract and DeFi growth could push ADA toward $5+. XRP's regulatory clarity and banking partnerships could drive it to new highs of $5-$10. Rexas Finance's RWA tokenization revolution could see RXS explode past $10-$20. These three cryptos provide the best risk-to-reward potential for investors hoping to position themselves for enormous returns in the following market cycle. The key is to invest early and hold long enough to reap the rewards of their inevitable breakout. With blockchain technology revolutionizing industries and new opportunities emerging, it is time to accumulate these promising assets before they take off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Mantra investors cashed out before OM token crashed 90% — Blockchain data","https://cointelegraph.com/news/mantra-investors-dumped-om-before-90-percent-crash","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:32:07 GMT","

 Mantra CEO John Mullin denied reports suggesting there were insider sales by investors like Laser Digital before the 90% crash of its OM token. 

Update (April 14, 1:15 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add comments by Mantra CEO John Mullin from an AMA event hosted by Cointelegraph.Update (April 14, 4:33 pm UTC): This article has been updated with data from Arkham Intelligence.

Mantra CEO John Mullin denied reports suggesting large-scale token transfers by major Mantra investors in the days leading up to the sharp collapse of the OM token, while speaking in an AMA hosted by Cointelegraph on April 14.

“The Mantra association, our key investors, our advisers — no one has sold, and we are going to categorically deny and also provide verifiable proof onchain proof that this is the case,” Mullin stated in the AMA.

Previous reports suggested that Laser Digital, a strategic Mantra investor, cashed out large portions of Mantra (OM) tokens before the cryptocurrency collapsed on April 13.

Laser Digital is a digital asset business backed by Nomura. The firm announced a strategic investment in Mantra in May 2024.

At least two wallets linked to Laser Digital were among 17 wallets that moved a combined 43.6 million OM tokens — worth about $227 million at the time — to exchanges before the crash, the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported on April 13, citing Arkham Intelligence data.

According to Arkham data, a Laser Digital-linked wallet, “0x84EE7,” sent 6.5 million OM tokens to an unlabelled Arkham wallet address, “0xB37DB,” on April 11.

The “0xB37DB” address subsequently dumped the tokens on the OKX exchange in several transactions, Arkham data shows.

Arkham did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request to comment on Laser Digital's wallets' tags.

Laser Digital subsequently denied Lookonchain reports alleging its involvement in the OM crash, claiming that the referenced wallets did not belong to it.

“Laser has no involvement in the recent price collapse of $OM,” Laser said in an X post on April 14. “Assertions circulating on social media that link Laser to ‘investor selling' are factually incorrect and misleading,” the firm added.

In addition to Laser Digital, some social media reports also linked the OM onchain activity to an address allegedly tied to another Mantra investor, Shorooq Partners.

According to Lookonchain data, a wallet associated with Shane Shin, a founding partner of Shorooq Partners, received 2 million OM tokens on April 13 at 11:52 am UTC, hours before the crash.

The tokens came from a previously dormant wallet that received 2.75 million OM in April 2024, Lookonchain reported.

Shin also subsequently denied selling the tokens, stating that the transfers implied wallet-to-wallet transactions rather than transfers to an exchange.

“No tokens have been sold. The community can check the wallet address and all its transactions to understand the situation fully. Here is the wallet address for full transparency,” Shin wrote in a post on X, attaching his wallet address.

Both Laser Digital and Shorooq were among the investors in the $109 million Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF) announced on April 7.

“It is important to note up front that Shorooq (its funds and founding partners) and Mantra (management and team members) have not sold OM tokens in the lead up to, or during, this crash,” a spokesperson for Shorooq told Cointelegraph.

The representative also emphasized that Shorooq is an equity investor in Mantra, not solely a token investor. “This means that our focus is on the long-term growth of the project,” the spokesperson added.

While denying the accuracy of Arkham's data, Mantra CEO Mullin stressed that the company was not aware of the identity of the addresses dumping OM prior to its crash.

“I don't know who those wallets belong to,” Mullin said during the Cointelegraph AMA, adding:

Mullin said that Mantra believes the wallets were “mislabeled by Arkham,” adding that the platform provided its key wallet addresses in a transparency report published on April 8.

As OKX and Binance were among exchanges that saw significant OM activity before and during the crash, both exchanges addressed the issue. OKX founder Star Xu called the incident a “big scandal to the whole crypto industry.”

While Mantra CEO John Mullin attributed the OM crash to one exchange, Binance hinted at “cross-exchange liquidations.”

“Our initial findings indicate that the developments over the past day are a result of cross-exchange liquidations,” Binance said in an announcement on April 14.

In an update on April 14, OKX said that Mantra's tokenomics had gone through major changes since October 2024 and flagged suspicious activity across multiple exchanges.

blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure Generated Unaudited Revenue of $26.8 million and Net Income of $4.0 million in 2024

blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure Focused on Crypto Mining, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), and High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) Data Hosting Markets

blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure Expected to Expand into U.S.-based Crypto Mining

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN), the developer of the Signing Day Sports app and platform to aid high school athletes in the recruitment process, today announced the signing of a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure (collectively together with certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries, “blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure” or “blockchAIn DI”) which will operate a crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting company with an expected 200MW of properties in South Carolina and Texas. The transaction will be structured as an all-equity exchange in which Signing Day Sports will acquire all of the equity securities of blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure through the issuance of its equity securities to the equity securityholders of blockchAIn DI. Signing Day Sports will not be required to make any cash payment to blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure or the securityholders of blockchAIn DI in connection with the transaction.

In 2024, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure generated unaudited revenue of $26.8 million and net income of $4.0 million.

The market for digital infrastructure—including crypto mining, HPC, and AI-related computing—is evolving rapidly as demand for energy-efficient processing power continues to grow. Amid increasing sustainability standards and renewed emphasis on domestic infrastructure, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is positioned to pursue opportunities across a wide range of compute-intensive applications.

blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's current operations include a 40 MW crypto mining hosting facility in South Carolina with expansion capability to 50 MW for third-party crypto miners in South Carolina, subject to utility approval. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure anticipates transitioning to internally owning and mining crypto currency at their South Carolina facility in late 2025 or early 2026, to facilitate revenue and earnings growth. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is also in the process of commissioning a new 150MW crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting facility in Texas with favorable economics with 34.5kV of interconnectivity to the grid for activation in late 2026. The Texas facility can be modularly built providing flexibility for crypto mining and/or AI and HPC data hosting activities. It is currently anticipated that the first 100MW will be initially focused on internally owned crypto mining operations and the remaining 50MW of capacity used for AI and HPC data hosting. This capital efficient and flexible modular business model will provide blockchAIn DI with optionality to pursue different revenue mixes as the crypto mining, AI and HPC markets continue to develop.

Signing Day Sports views the proposed transaction as a compelling opportunity to enhance its platform by combining with a technology-driven business with strong fundamentals and scalable infrastructure.

The transaction between blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure and Signing Day Sports is intended to result in the combined company being traded on the NYSE American. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure will continue to operate under blockchAIn DI's management team, and it is intended that blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure will merge with and into a newly-formed subsidiary of Signing Day Sports with blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, surviving the merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signing Day Sports.

“This transaction gives us a highly strategic entry point into the digital infrastructure space—one that is already revenue-generating, cost-efficient, and well-positioned to scale,” said Danny Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of Signing Day Sports. “blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure provides a platform anchored by crypto mining operations, HPC capacity, and a clear roadmap toward AI workload enablement. We are excited about the potential to participate in this growing market through a combined company with proven assets, operational depth, and a strong financial foundation. Our teams will work expeditiously to move the transaction forward and we anticipate completing the due diligence and definitive docs within the next 45 days.”

The LOI is non-binding, and the transaction's completion remains subject to customary due diligence, execution of definitive agreements, regulatory and stock exchange approvals, and other standard closing conditions. Signing Day Sports intends to provide further updates as discussions progress.

Terms of the Transaction

The business combination is expected to be effectuated through a structure, whereby blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure will merge with and into a newly formed subsidiary of Signing Day Sports with blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signing Day Sports. The parties may also agree upon a to-be-determined alternative structure based on the appropriate legal, tax and accounting structuring advice of their respective representatives. Under the LOI, the consideration to be paid at closing to blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure or their securityholders will be comprised of shares of Signing Day Sports common stock with a value of approximately $215.0 million, subject to an exchange ratio and other certain adjustments, at an implied value per share for Pubco of $10.04 (including adjustment as applicable for exchange listing purposes). Upon the closing of the business combination, the stockholders of Signing Day Sports are anticipated to collectively own approximately 8.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company, and blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's equity securityholders are anticipated to collectively own approximately 91.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company. The board of directors of Signing Day Sports post-transaction will be comprised of no less than five (5) and no greater than seven (7) directors. At least one director will be designated by the existing directors of Signing Day Sports, and blockchAIn DI will designate the remaining directors. blockchAIn DI will also designate the new Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company.

It is anticipated that the definitive agreements will contain customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Signing Day Sports and blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, including covenants relating to both parties using their commercially reasonably efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by the agreement to be satisfied, covenants regarding obtaining the requisite approval of Signing Day Sports' stockholders, covenants regarding indemnification of directors and officers, and covenants regarding Signing Day Sports' and blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's conduct of their respective businesses between the date of signing of definitive agreements and the closing, and other customary conditions to closing. It is anticipated that definitive agreements will also contain certain termination rights for both Signing Day Sports and blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, and, in connection with the termination of any such definitive agreements under certain circumstances, Signing Day Sports and blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure may be required to pay the other party a termination fee.

As Canada approaches a pivotal election on April 28, 2025, Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, is positioning the cryptocurrency giant for influence in a market he believes is primed for blockchain innovation. I spoke with him about the cryptocurrency exchange's expanding presence in Canada, the unique characteristics of the Canadian market, and his vision for the country's crypto future. Our conversation revealed not only Coinbase's strategic ambitions but also Matheson's personal passion for advancing blockchain adoption in his home country.

As a Canadian entrepreneur with experience in both traditional finance and tech startups who joined Coinbase after nearly six years at Shopify, Matheson urges the Canadian government to move quickly to integrate crypto into their economy.

This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

CoinDesk: Your career has taken you from traditional finance to Shopify to crypto. Was there a specific moment when you realized digital assets would reshape finance, or was it a gradual conviction?

Lucas: I'm a Canadian entrepreneur and I've been working in finance and business most of my career. I spent the first part of my career in finance, mostly in M&A, and I founded a tech company after grad school with my best friend in Silicon Valley, which is where I started my journey with Coinbase. I've been a Coinbase customer for over 10 years now.

After selling that company, I joined Shopify and I worked there for almost six years, helping build their business, their operational and finance functions. At Coinbase, I help lead a team who are building a platform for Canadians to diversify their assets into the digital economy.

CoinDesk: How long has Coinbase been operating in Canada, and what regulatory milestones have you achieved?

Lucas: Coinbase has been in Canada for almost four years now. We've been officially pursuing our registration here in Canada for a number of years as well. Canada is registered as a restricted dealer under CSA. We're the first international exchange to be registered in Canada.

We're lucky to have a regulatory regime here where we operate under a compliant regime in Canada to grow our business. We are now pursuing our IIROC registration with IIROC as a full dealer registration, that'll expand the types of products and services that we can offer Canadians.

CoinDesk: Ethereum was born in Canada, yet most of its ecosystem developed elsewhere. Is there a certain irony in having to convince Canadian institutions to embrace a technology with Canadian roots?

Lucas: Coinbase seeks regulatory clarity all over the world, and we look for markets that provide stability and clear rules for us to operate under a regime. Canada is one of those markets that is identified as being open to providing clear rules and regulating cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase.

When we look across the world, Canada's also a very crypto-literate country. It's the third most crypto-aware country of all the international locations that we operate in, so we have quite a strong awareness about the technology here.

The opportunity for it to help our financial system — as you probably know, Ethereum was founded here in Canada. We have very strong roots here in Canada around cryptocurrency and around technology. We have a lot of really great universities in computing science that are focused on blockchain technology and helping our students in Canada understand the opportunity.

CoinDesk: That's fascinating about Canada being the third most crypto-aware country. How does that translate to adoption rates?

Lucas: When we survey countries around the world, we survey how aware citizens are to specific types of cryptocurrencies, uses of cryptocurrencies and technology. Canadians are the third most crypto-aware country of all the international markets that we survey.

We see some surveys in Canada suggesting that upwards of 30% of Canadians by the end of this year will own digital assets. So we see very strong adoption in Canada and healthy diversification into the asset class. Of course, Canada was the first to introduce crypto-related ETFs, so we have quite a broad awareness about the opportunity for Canadians to diversify into crypto through traditional ETFs as well.

CoinDesk: Who are the Canadians using Coinbase? Is there a particular demographic profile?

Lucas: We have a very broad distribution of demographics in Canada. We have a very diverse user group in Canada—people who are diversifying from young students, immigrants who are looking to remit money.

We see a significant number of people building and diversifying portfolios, accumulating digital assets for long-term diversification and wealth preservation. Then we have a significant amount of institutional investors in Canada starting to diversify assets into the crypto economy as well.

So we see very strong adoption across retail, and in Canada specifically now we're seeing a healthier adoption from institutional investors and more interest from institutional investors, pension funds, asset managers who are exploring diversifying their clients' assets into crypto as well.

CoinDesk: With Canada's election approaching on April 28th, what policy changes would you like to see from the next government?

Lucas: We proposed a number of changes for our new government to really think deeply about over the next term. We've recommended that they:

Currently, our large banks—we have big banks with 80-90% of the money in Canada—do not bank crypto trading platforms, so we are very keen to help our government encourage our financial institutions to participate in the digital economy. (You can read Lucas's writing on what Canada should do to be a global crypto leader here.)

CoinDesk: You've mentioned 'Stand with Crypto' as an advocacy initiative. How are you organizing the industry to influence policy in Canada?

Lucas: 'Stand with Crypto' is an organization that has advocated for clear rules all around the world for crypto, and we've recently launched Stand with Crypto here in Canada with a number of partners. We have a number of crypto trading partners joining Stand with Crypto to help us advocate for change.

Stand with Crypto is really an opportunity for our elected officials to understand this opportunity so that we can prioritize it clearly. Canada has a lot of priorities and challenges within our economy, and crypto technology can help us rebuild our economy and our economic freedom. That's one of the ways that we organize.

Canada also has two strong industry associations, the Canadian Blockchain Consortium and the Canadian Web3 Council, and these organizations help unify views and help us align on opportunities that we can engage with our regulators to drive more regulatory clarity in the market.

CoinDesk: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are challenging centralized platforms like Coinbase in the US. How do you view this trend affecting your business in Canada?

Lucas: I think decentralized finance will form a very healthy and significant part of our financial economy. I think that's the foundation of the technology and the ecosystem—to decentralize financial interactions in a trusted, safe, compliant manner.

I think the decentralization of finance will be a healthy part of how some investors will choose to participate. But centralized exchanges provide a very valuable tool to on-ramp and off-ramp from the digital economy in a compliant way that helps governments and institutions around the world get comfort that platforms like Coinbase are managing risks appropriately, managing anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, ensuring that people on their platform are acting in good faith.

CoinDesk: If you could say a few things to the upcoming administration, what would they be?

Lucas: I would say the rest of the world is moving quickly to adopt crypto and integrate it into their economy. It's time for Canada to do the same—to integrate crypto into our economy, build a national strategy, and educate Canadians about why the world is going digital.

CoinDesk: There seems to be a patriotic element to your advocacy. Do you see Canada becoming a global leader in crypto?

Lucas: I think Canada can be a leader in crypto. Canada has the opportunity to embrace this technology in a meaningful way to help this country rebuild ourselves and grow our economy.

I think we're entering a time where we need to rethink how we organize our government, how we tax our government, how we generate revenues, and how we spend money. I think we're entering a cycle where governments are expected to do more with less. That's what entrepreneurs do with technology every day, and that's what governments around the world are starting to embrace is the opportunity to do more with less, to be more efficient, to provide better government services through technology, to be more entrepreneurial.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Kava Labs' Scott Stuart: Decentralized AI Delivers Real Value, Not NFT Style-Hype","https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/04/14/kava-labs-scott-stuart-decentralized-ai-delivers-real-value-not-nft-style-hype","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:45:07 GMT","

Artificial Intelligence tokens have long-term staying power and won't be another crypto fad like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), even though the industry has already seen its share of flops, Kava Labs co-founder Scott Stuart said in an interview with CoinDesk.

""We had this first AI wave, but that wave was projects like Fetch saying, 'We're going to do a merger,' but producing nothing from it, or projects like Virtuals or AI16z, initially doing well, then dropping off by 80% or 90%. It was an unhappy outcome,"" Stuart told CoinDesk in an interview.

Market data shows that since January, Virtuals, the native token of the AI-related Virtuals Protocol, is down nearly 85%. FET, the token of Fetch.ai, the artificial intelligence alliance, is down 60%.

KAVA, for its part, is fairing reasonably well, down 5%, beating the CoinDesk 20, a market index, which is down 29%.

Kava didn't start as an AI project. Initially known for Cosmos-based decentralized finance (DeFi), began as just another DeFi project, but pivoted to decentralized AI as a differentiator amidst ongoing crypto market consolidation.

Since its pivot, Kava has shipped its Kava AI platform and marketplace, a blockchain-native chatbot resembling ChatGPT powered by DeepSeek's R1 large language model, the autonomous AI agent Oros, and decentralized GPU infrastructure.

Stuart said this pivot was necessary because altcoins face increased challenges without a compelling narrative, making decentralized AI's clarity and value proposition critical.

""Unlike speculative bubbles such as NFTs, decentralized AI's fundamental utility ensures its resilience. NFTs or similar trends are essentially memes built on top of memes. Anything that's beta to meme coins will inevitably rise and fall with hype cycles,"" he said.

The company is building a decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure designed to be auditable, transparent, and open-source. Given its performance compared to the rest of the market, clearly, they are onto something.

“When you look at AI as a technology, it's just another way for corporations to present you information,"" Stuart said. ""With OpenAI, there's a secret sauce component, and at any point in the future, they can tweak that model to serve you what they want.”

Stuart argues that the stakes are substantial in separating AI from this black box as technology becomes increasingly integral to daily life.

“Closed-source AI can tweak models in ways you can't see. You don't know if it's optimized for your benefit or a company's or even a nation-state's interest,” he said.

And he's not the only one that has these concerns. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Simon Kim, CEO of South Korea's Hashed, the country's leading web3 fund, said closed-source AI has made a 'God' from a machine. Its inner workings remain unknown and incomprehensible, but it has established itself as a pillar of society.

In contrast, Kava Labs promotes an ""open-weight"" approach, allowing anyone to verify AI model parameters, much like Ethereum's transparent smart contracts.

Recognizing how regulators increasingly view AI transparency as a strategic U.S. interest, Stuart sees an opportunity to build decentralized AI infrastructure that's certifiably 'made-in-the-U.S.A.' and backed by open-source funding initiatives.

""During the last administration, the trend was toward offshoring everything,"" he said. ""Now it seems they're serious about reversing that, and we're using this shift as an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-based infrastructure.""

And underneath this infrastructure will be open source technology.

""The future of AI isn't corporate-controlled,"" he concluded. ""It's open, transparent, and decentralized. Kava aims to lead this transformation.""

A Pennsylvania man has pleaded guilty to federal charges after failing to report millions in profits from trading non-fungible tokens.

In an April 11 press release, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania said Waylon Wilcox, 45, admitted to filing false tax returns for 2021 and 2022, underreporting more than $13 million in income from NFT trades.

Most of the unreported gains came from buying and selling 97 pieces from the popular CryptoPunks collection.

According to prosecutors, Wilcox filed a false return in April 2022, claiming significantly less income for 2021 than he actually made. The move reduced his tax bill by over $2.1 million. He did it again in October 2023 for the 2022 tax year, dodging another $1.1 million in taxes.

In total, Wilcox underreported about $8.5 million in 2021 and another $4.6 million in 2022. He falsely answered “no” when asked on both returns if he had traded digital assets.

Federal investigators allege Wilcox made around $7.4 million from selling 62 CryptoPunks in 2021 and another $4.9 million from 35 Punk sales in 2022. 

The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and its Criminal Investigation Division. According to the release, taxpayers are expected to report any gains or losses from NFT sales as part of their taxable income.

“In today's economic environment, it's more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying the taxes they owe,” Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent in Charge Yury Kruty added.

Wilcox could face a maximum penalty of up to six years in prison, along with supervised release and possible fines. A judge will determine his final sentence in accordance with federal sentencing statutes and guidelines.

Wilcox's case comes at a time when the NFT market is already under pressure, with weekly sales volumes slipping. As previously reported by crypto.news, NFT sales volume fell 4.7% last week to $94.7 million, extending the downturn from $102.8 million the week before. 

Activity has also slumped, with NFT buyers and sellers dropping over 75% each, and Q1 2025 trading volume down 24% from the previous quarter, according to DappRadar.

Even top-tier collections like CryptoPunks are feeling the strain. Last week, CryptoPunk #3100, one of just nine Alien Punks, was sold at a $10 million loss. At the time, the collection's floor price was down 67% since its 2021 peak.

Vitalik Buterin, the original creator of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of the most recognizable figures of the cryptocurrency industry. He's often admired in the ecosystem for being highly technical while also deeply philosophical about technology's role in society. For those that do not follow crypto closely, Buterin starkly contrasts the stereotypical image of a flashy cryptocurrency billionaire with his minimalism in his personal style as well as his geeky and awkward mannerisms.



The documentary “Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,” which is set for global release April 15, tries to give us a peek into those aspects of Buterin, following his early life and childhood in Russia followed by immigrating with his family to Toronto, Canada, where his love for computers and technology began in his high school years. 



At the core of Buterin's life was the creation of Ethereum, which came after his early involvement in Toronto's Bitcoin community, where he saw the potential of the asset in giving people some financial freedom. While thinking how he could apply those concepts to other aspects of life, Buterin set out to write a whitepaper on creating the blockchain version of the internet.



Toronto has strong ties to Ethereum's early days. It was home to some of the first Ethereum developer hackathons and meetups organized by Ethereum's Canadian co-founders in the city.



This year, CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 takes place in Toronto May 14-16, highlighting Canada's vibrant crypto community.



The film walks through the various stages of Ethereum's lifetime, including the start of the network and the struggles Buterin faced in his new leadership role, the boom of the blockchain during the NFT era, the importance of the Merge in reducing Ethereum's energy consumption, and Buterin's urge to help Ukraine in its war with Russia by deploying crypto for resources.



CoinDesk sat down with the directors of the documentary, Chris Temple and Zach Ingrasci, to hear about their perspectives on creating the film, ahead of its global release.



This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.



CoinDesk: Why did you want to make a documentary about Ethereum?



Zach Ingrasci [ZI]: So Chris and I have been making documentaries together for 15 years now. We make character driven documentaries. So I really love those human stories that give us insight into the emotions and motivations of people in really interesting places.



We aren't crypto experts. We both studied economics, so we have a bit of understanding of finance. But when we met Vitalik in 2021 I think he immediately clicked something in our brains like: “oh, here's a story that kind of breaks the stereotypes that mainstream audiences have of this space.”



Quickly after meeting Vitalik, we did an NFT crowdfund for the film on mirror.xyz, peoplepleaser did the NFT. We raised basically the full budget of the film, and it allowed us to create this independent story and approach to follow Vitalik around the world, as, he lives out of a 40 liter backpack



How did you guys decide what parts of Ethereum's history to include in Vitalik's story? One noticeable moment I thought was interesting that you left out was not to include the 2016 DAO hack? Why exclude that key moment in Ethereum's history but leave in other moments?



ZI: This is the challenge of making these films. We had a very broad mandate, following the community, not just focused on Vitalik. And then after two years of filming, we realized that the kind of narrative structure would only make sense if you were able to follow one person and then get to meet the community through his eyes.



The DAO hack is very confusing to explain, and so there's an element of just what at its essence is important. And I think, you know, the moment for Vitalik to decide whether the Ethereum Foundation would be nonprofit versus for profit is a very understandable concept for a mainstream audience. They get it.



As you mentioned, there was the premiere a few months ago, and it was only accessible to people on-chain. If the movie is aimed for a mainstream audience, why first decide to release it on-chain, instead of a streaming platform where more of those folks can access it?



ZI: It's a practical answer. The documentary industry is broken, so to have an independent film premiere on a mainstream platform doesn't even mean anything, unless you have real marketing. And so actually, the on-chain release, the NFT, the trailer release on Zora, building sponsorship for this mainstream release is critical.



Chris Temple [CT]: People love the film, and have rallied behind it and been interested and been sharing it with their moms, being like: “Hey, this is what I do for a living.”



This isn't just our film, this film belongs to the community. And I think empowering people with it at that first step, and using the technology that the film was all about felt very right to us.



How did you convince Vitalik to do the film? He's not very rerceptive to the media so how did you get him to agree to do it?



ZI: I think we got really lucky in some ways. This was before he was on the front page of TIME magazine. I think he was motivated to speak up about what he believed the future of Ethereum should look like, and how to build it, and people should focus on building things that have real world value.



So I think we just happened to meet him at the perfect moment when he and the people around him were looking to have access to broader audiences.



I think ultimately, that's what makes for us Vitalik the perfect participant of a film, because his reluctance to be in that spotlight, that genuine authenticity. You can tell on the film that he's not trying to hog the spotlight. This is something that he's uncomfortable with, and something that's taken a long journey for him to even find where his voice is and how it should be.



CT: It was a very challenging production, more than any film we've ever made, because Vitalik is nomadic, he's all over the world, and he says, “I'm going to be tomorrow in Montenegro…If you want to come.” We have to immediately try to scramble and get everybody there just to get those moments, even if it's just a couple of hours with Vitalik.



Recently, there's been a bunch of leadership changes at the EF, and Vitalik has been at the core of making the decision on those changes. The movie shows how uncomfortable Vitalik can be in stepping into that leadership role and having to make core decisions like whether the EF should be a non-profit vs for-profit organization and going against some co-founders.



Given all the key decisions he's had to make over the past few months and a key leader in Ethereum, what do you think went through his mind, and has he become more comfortable in his leadership role?



ZI: I really can't speak for Vitalik, but I do think that's why this film has never been more relevant. Because if we are looking for insight into how Vitalik thinks and what he cares about, I think the thing he cares most about is that Ethereum will be useful in the world.



There's an important quote in the film about “if Ethereum is only used for speculation, that's a huge missed opportunity.” So it's not surprising that Vitalik didn't go to the White House [to meet with President Trump]. Vitalik cares about how this tool will be used in the long term for real, positive change in the world. He is uncomfortable with conflict, we know that, we see that in the film. So I can't imagine this has been an easy process for him.



But you can definitely tell that he's begun to understand how to use his voice in this ecosystem and use his kind of soft power.Read more: Ethereum Foundation Picks New Co-Executive Directors, Following Leadership Reshuffle



What was filming in Ukraine during the start of the Russian invasion like? And why does Vitalik feel so connected to that cause?



ZI: We have some experience filming on the borders of war zones. Luckily, at that time Kiev was relatively safe.



It really was Vitalik's idea, he always wanted to support the hackers there. Vitalik just felt like he could be there to support them, and it's something he cares so deeply about for two reasons: 1) he actually has Ukrainian ancestry, and 2) coming from Russia, I think he regrets having met with Putin.



Then there's also just really one of the first concrete examples of real positive impact in the world, of how crypto is being used when the banking system was in chaos, and so quickly got money to the front lines.



There's a deleted scene where he's playing chess with Fedorov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine. But you know, Fedorov was talking about how 1000s of their military were saved because of that $100 million Vitalik raised in crypto was quickly mobilized.



What are you hoping that your audience takes away from this film?



CT: Documentaries are bad at information, but they're great at provoking questions and getting emotions. If we can inspire an audience to be more savvy and think more critically about technology, not just in these extremes of it's all bad or it's all good, but to understand a bit of that spectrum along the middle there, and look at both the positive and negative consequences of technology.



I think that kind of techno optimism is the core of what this film is really about. Helping anybody apply those lessons, whether it's within crypto, within AI, because technology is just going to continue to shift and impact our lives.



The movie is about Vitalik as a person but also a bit about Ethereum's history. So is Vitalik = Ethereum?



ZI: I don't think he is, and I think that's what he hoped for at this point. I hope that comes across in the film, and that's why we called it an Ethereum story, because I think it's one of many that gets told. I think that's where Vitalik has been successful because he is not Ethereum.

The United Kingdom has positioned itself as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. From government debates on regulation to growing retail interest, the digital currency scene in the UK is evolving quickly. With this shift, two crypto topics are capturing widespread attention: crypto mining software and the rise of politically-themed meme coins like the trending Trump Meme Coin. 

This article explores these areas from a UK-centric viewpoint, considering market trends, technological implications, and cultural impact on local investors and enthusiasts alike.

While the UK is not typically associated with large-scale crypto mining (compared to countries with lower electricity costs), it remains a hub for blockchain innovation and small-to-mid-scale mining operations. For UK-based crypto enthusiasts, crypto mining software remains essential in supporting solo or pool-based mining using local setups.

Crypto mining software allows individuals or businesses to validate transactions on blockchains like Bitcoin using their hardware. Programs like EasyMiner, CGMiner, and BFGMiner are often used by UK hobbyists and developers testing energy-efficient mining rigs. Even with the UK government's increasing focus on green technology, local innovators are exploring how mining software can be optimised for sustainable performance.

More importantly, software developers in London and across the UK are beginning to create hybrid applications, combining mining functions with portfolio tracking and energy usage analytics. As discussions about crypto's carbon footprint grow louder, British tech companies are expected to lead the way in eco-conscious mining innovation.

Despite being rooted in American politics, the Trump Meme Coin has found curious traction among British investors, largely thanks to its online virality and the UK's ongoing interest in U.S. politics and pop culture. The coin, styled around former President Donald Trump, is a digital token that merges satire with speculation, much like previous meme coins such as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.

For the UK audience, this coin's appeal lies not in direct political support but in its entertainment value, market volatility, and social media buzz. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram are filled with UK-based traders discussing the coin's swings, memes, and news updates.

More broadly, the UK has a long-standing tradition of political satire, making politically charged meme coins a natural fit for crypto-curious Britons. While experts advise caution, especially due to lack of regulation and high volatility, the Trump Meme Coin offers insight into how internet culture and decentralised finance (DeFi) are influencing British investor behaviour.

British crypto miners, whether casual hobbyists or small-scale entrepreneurs, often face challenges such as high electricity costs, regulation uncertainty, and limited access to industrial-scale hardware. This makes choosing the right mining software especially important for efficiency and sustainability.

Features that appeal to UK miners include:

Some miners even integrate their systems with renewable energy sources (like rooftop solar) to align with government sustainability targets and lower operational costs. With smart mining software, UK users can remain competitive in a global crypto landscape, even without access to industrial-scale infrastructure.

The popularity of meme coins in the UK shouldn't be underestimated. Though many start as jokes, their impact on internet culture and financial habits is real. In London, where financial innovation often intersects with art and satire, meme coins are being viewed as both speculative assets and digital collectibles.

Take the Trump Meme Coin for example, it's more than just a token. It's a statement, a conversation starter, and in some circles, a tool for gamifying the financial experience. UK traders and younger investors in particular are drawn to these digital assets not just for profit, but also for the shared sense of community they create.

However, concerns remain about stability, rug pulls, and market manipulation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK has issued multiple warnings about the risks of crypto investing, particularly in meme coins and other unregulated digital assets. Still, with proper risk management and awareness, meme coins continue to attract attention from a broad spectrum of the UK's tech-savvy population.

As the UK sets ambitious goals for carbon neutrality and digital transformation, the sustainability of crypto mining is under the spotlight. Unlike countries where energy is cheap and regulations are lax, the UK enforces higher standards for energy usage and environmental impact.

This context has inspired local developers and companies to rethink how mining software operates. Several London-based blockchain startups are developing AI-integrated mining dashboards that reduce energy waste and improve efficiency. Some are even exploring ways to integrate carbon-offset tracking into mining platforms, aligning with the UK government's broader environmental goals.

Moreover, recent reports from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology indicate growing interest in supporting green blockchain infrastructure. While large-scale crypto mining may not be feasible in the UK due to cost and environmental constraints, mining software is rapidly evolving to suit a smaller, greener, and smarter approach.

British culture has always embraced satire, from the pages of Private Eye to comedy classics like Spitting Image. It's no surprise, then, that meme coins resonate with a UK audience attuned to irony, humour, and quick-turn trends.

As for coins like the Trump Meme Coin, their success lies in striking a balance between entertainment and finance. In UK online forums, these coins are discussed not just as investments, but as part of larger conversations around digital identity, censorship, and decentralisation.

Some analysts even suggest that the rise of meme coins has democratised crypto investing in the UK, making it more appealing to people outside of traditional financial hubs like Canary Wharf. With mobile apps and user-friendly exchanges, even novice investors can participate, though they must tread carefully in this volatile space.

As meme coins continue to intersect with art, politics, and fintech, they may increasingly reflect the diverse cultural narratives of modern Britain.

The crypto world is evolving quickly, and the UK is keeping pace with a uniquely British lens on innovation, regulation, and cultural impact. From the development of crypto mining software optimised for eco-conscious users, to the unexpected popularity of political meme coins like the Trump Meme Coin, the landscape is as diverse as it is dynamic.

For UK residents, from London tech startups to individual crypto investors, the future of digital assets holds both promise and unpredictability. What's clear is that understanding the nuances of these technologies, alongside a healthy dose of scepticism and curiosity, will be essential for anyone hoping to navigate crypto space successfully in Britain.

Visa is joining the Global Dollar Network (USDG), a stablecoin consortium convened by U.S. regulated digital asset firm Paxos, alongside cryptocurrency and fintech heavyweights like Robinhood, Kraken and Galaxy Digital, according to two people familiar with the plans.

Visa is the first traditional finance incumbent known to be joining USDG, whose initial cohort of members also includes Anchorage Digital, Bullish (the owner of CoinDesk) and Nuvei.

The stablecoin business, whose lucrative potential is opening up to more firms amid regulatory change, has been dominated by the first and second largest issuers of USD-pegged tokens, Tether's USDT and its smaller sibling Circle with USDC.

USDG is designed to share the yield with participant firms that can create connectivity and liquidity, unlike Tether, for example, which retains the interest gained from its stablecoin reserves. 

The large card networks have been busy partnering in the crypto space. Visa was recently reported to be helping Sam Altman's World Network, and Mastercard is working with the non-custodial wallet MetaMask.

Visa did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Paxos said the firm can not comment on prospective partners.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP, SOL, ADA Price Prediction: Ripple, Cardano, Solana Bulls Eye Recovery in Short Term","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/14/xrp-ada-sol-bulls-eye-recovery-in-short-term-price-action-indicates","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:08:29 GMT","

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) tokens are exhibiting technical strength in a signal of potential short-term price recoveries, data indicates.

Bullish patterns—XRP's $2.00 breakout, ADA's double bottom at $0.55, and SOL's rally to above $130—suggest accumulation phases despite broader market volatility. However, a bitcoin drop below $80,000 or intensified macro pressures could limit gains.

Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in a note to CoinDesk that traders must await confirmation of a bitcoin trend reversal before long-term dip buying on major tokens. 

""Bitcoin has yet to confirm a growth reversal,"" Kuptsikevich said. ""The key area along the way is the $85,000 level, where the 50-day moving average passes. Its overcoming will be an important confirmation of the bullish sentiment, while fluctuations below it will remain market noise.""

""XRP found support last week on the decline to the 200-day moving averages. This small but encouraging signal suggests that market participants are still adhering to a ‘buy on dips' strategy, believing in the continuation of the bullish trend,"" he added.

Here are technical analysis highlights for XRP, ADA and SOL, based on CoinDesk data:

XRP surged 11% from $1.87 to $2.07 in the past week, breaking a psychological $2.00 barrier earlier Monday. Recent price action shows a higher low at $2.065, recovering to $2.068, with decreasing volatility indicating accumulation.

Technical Outlook:

Short-Term Target: If $2.00 holds, bulls may want to watch $2.10-$2.15, with a break below risking $1.99.

Solana rallied 3% from a low of $125 to nearly $134 in early European hours Monday, part of a 30% climb from $101.30 to $125.48 in the past week driven by ETF approval optimism (76% odds on Polymarket).

Support around the $120 mark remains firm, with recent consolidation between $124.50-$125.30 testing $125.50 resistance.

Technical Outlook:

Short-Term Target: Clearing $135 could push SOL to $140 and above. A drop below $120 risks $105, but the channel favors bulls.

ADA rebounded 18.6% from $0.537 to $0.637 in the past week, forming a double bottom at $0.55 with strong volume on April 9th. Despite bitcoin's 15% weekly decline and trade tensions (China's 34% U.S. import tariffs), ADA's consolidation above 60 cents (now support) signals strength. With the ascending channel with support at 63 cents, bulls can now target at least 70 cents.

Technical Outlook:

Short-Term Target: A break below 63 cents risks 55-59 cents, but the double bottom supports the upside.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

In markets, securing the best entry point is often half the battle, as timing and level significantly influence success by skewing the risk-reward ratio in traders' favor.

While bitcoin's (BTC) near-term outlook may appear constructive with increased demand for bullish bets in the options market, the cryptocurrency's proximity to key resistance that capped the upside in recent months means the risk-reward profile for those looking to capitalize on the bullish prospects is less favorable.

Since Saturday, BTC has been pushing against the lower boundary of the ""Ichimoku cloud"" at around $85K. Developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, the Ichimoku cloud is a technical analysis indicator that offers a comprehensive view of market momentum, support, and resistance levels. 

The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line.

The difference between Leading Span A and B forms the Ichimoku Cloud, with its upper and lower boundaries serving as potential support and resistance levels based on the price's position relative to the cloud. When prices are above the cloud, it indicates a bullish trend, while prices below suggest a bearish trend.

In early February, BTC fell below $100K, trading beneath the Ichimoku Cloud. Since then, the cloud's lower boundary has functioned as a strong resistance and supply zone, limiting recovery rallies. 

As BTC trades near this level again, bulls, especially those looking to hit the market with fresh bids, might want to be cautious. The immediate upside may be restricted by cloud resistance around $85K, while support lies below $75K, nearly $10K lower from the going market rate. The situation equates to an unfavorable risk-reward for long bets.

The rejection at the Ichimoku Cloud on April 2 resulted in a substantial sell-off, pushing BTC below $75K, mirroring a similar pattern that followed the February 21 rejection.

Thus, the latest interaction with cloud resistance warrants close monitoring for the potential return of selling pressure. A downturn from this resistance level would shift attention back to the $75K mark.

On the contrary, a potential move beyond $90K, marking a breakout above the cloud, would signal a resumption of the broader bull run and a rally to record highs.

Crypto traders were reminded of Terra's LUNA early Monday as trendy real-world asset upstart Mantra's OM token dropped 90% within hours on no sudden catalyst — with conspiracy theories and allegations running abound among crypto circles.

OM plunged from over $6 to just over 40 cents late Sunday to early Monday in typically low liquidity hours for the crypto market — where outsized volumes can trigger massive price movements in either direction.

“We want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong,” the team said in an X post following the price drop. “Today's activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details about what happened as soon as we can.”

Mantra lets users tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities, enabling compliant digital investments in tangible assets. Its OM token facilitates transactions and governance.

In January 2025, Mantra partnered with DAMAC Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, to tokenize $1 billion in assets, including real estate, hospitality, and data centers.

OM was among the biggest market gainers in 2024, rising more than 400% on relatively low public conversation on crypto-related social media - which intrigued traders and investors alike on the strength of the move.

Meanwhile, co-founder John Patrick Mullin alleged the movement was likely due to exchanges closing OM positions, which impacted all market exposure.

“We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mullin said in an X post. “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice.”

He further alleged “intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.”

Sherpas, OMies, and broader crypto community,First off, the team and I greatly appreciate the support that we have received over the past several hours, which we believe is a testament to the strong support MANTRA has among its investors and community. We have determined that…

OM-tracked futures recorded over $50 million in liquidations on the long side, a record figure for the tokens. Open interest slumped from $345 million to just over $130 million, indicating a quick exit for unsettled futures bets.

Some prominent crypto voices aren't buying that narrative, however, with scores of dismissive replies under Mullin's posts.

OKX founder Star Xu added in a response to a separate post that flagged over $220 million in token deposits to exchanges before the price crash.

""It's a big scandal to the whole crypto industry. All of the onchain unlock and deposit data is public, all major exchanges' collateral and liquidation data can be investigated. OKX will make all of the reports ready,"" Xu said.

Bitcoin (BTC) is flat as East Asian markets open for the week, trading above $84K, as the White House presents mixed messages on semiconductor and technology component tariffs.

Over the weekend, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the White House's decision to exempt items like smartphones, computers, and the semiconductors that power them from tariffs was a temporary measure.

President Trump confirmed it later in a press briefing, stating that the tariff rate would be announced next week, but there would be some ""flexibility"" on the matter.

""The market saw a material rebound as popular consumer electronics categories were exempted from the 125% tariffs on China,"" BTSE COO Jeff Mei told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Even after Trump mentioned that they would simply be moving to another bucket of tariffs rather than exempted altogether, markets held their gain amidst rumors that business leaders were able to convince the Trump administration to peel back some of their highest tariffs.""

""From our side, we believe there will be challenges to shift global supply chains away from China overnight and that low-end, low-margin manufacturing is most likely going to shift to other Asian countries after they broker trade deals. That being said, we do think that this rally looks temporary and that markets will continue to be volatile in the short term,"" Mei added.

Meanwhile, China has announced its own tariffs on semiconductors, hitting U.S.-origin chips with a 34% tariff. However, China counts origin as where the chip was fabricated, not designed.

As the majority of U.S. chip companies, like AMD and Nvidia, don't operate their own fabs and instead rely on Taiwan's – which China counts as its own territory – TSMC, they would be effectively exempt from these tariffs.

Analysts in China acknowledge short-term disruptions from the semiconductor tariffs but broadly view them as an opportunity to accelerate domestic innovation, localization, and supply-chain restructuring, ultimately benefiting China's semiconductor industry in the long run.

Local media in Taiwan report that TSMC is accelerating the construction of another fab in Arizona in order to be able to provide more U.S. fabricated chips as a cloud of uncertainty hangs above the sector.

Within China, equity traders seem to be waiting on the final tariff news in order to make their next move.

Shanghai's SSE composite index is up 0.8%, while Shenzhen's tech-heavy SZSE is up 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 2.4%.

Elsewhere in crypto, Hong Kong's Bosera HashKey Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been approved to offer staking services. This comes after the city's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, issued guidance on offering staking services in Hong Kong.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that the market hasn't taken to ether ETFs very kindly. The best-performing ETFs on the market, he wrote, have been those that are short ether ETFs.

Ether has been down 47% over the last year, according to CoinDesk market data, while CoinDesk 20 is up 14%.

Ray Dalio is sounding the alarm — not just about a potential recession, but about a deeper, systemic breakdown of the global economic and political order in an interview with CNBC on Sunday. His concerns aren't just about market volatility; they point to a broader structural fragility.

Interestingly, bitcoin (BTC) has been showing resilience amidst the chaos. The digital asset has broken a three-month downtrend and is approaching $85,000, signaling it may be stepping into a role as a potential alternative safe haven.

Mixed signals continue from the White House on tariffs, adding to the growing uncertainty weighing on global markets. As a result, markets continue to be extremely volatile especially over the past two weeks as Trump's tariff policies take hold. 

Dalio, the founder of investment giant Bridgewater, is particularly focused on the mounting U.S. debt and deficit. He argues that Congress must bring the federal deficit down to 3% of GDP, warning that the imbalance between debt supply and investor demand could cause serious dislocations, according to CNBC. 

That's already playing out in the bond market, where U.S. Treasury yields are climbing. The 10-year sits just under 4.5%, while the 30-year is hovering just below 5%. These elevated yields are rattling markets and could force the Federal Reserve to step in in order to calm markets. 

Dalio also warns that tariff uncertainty is feeding into broader macro instability. The U.S. dollar, as measured by the DXY index, has now fallen below 100 for the first time in years — a potential sign of capital flight from the country. He is calling for a comprehensive trade deal with China and a currency adjustment to strengthen the yuan, aiming to stabilize a system that's looking increasingly fragile, according to the report. 

In a sobering comparison, Dalio likens today's risks to those seen during the U.S. exit from the gold standard in 1971 and the global financial crisis in 2008, according to the report. Both were inflection points that reshaped the financial system.

 Mantra CEO John Mullin denied reports suggesting there were insider sales by investors like Laser Digital before the 90% crash of its OM token. 

Update (April 14, 1:15 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add comments by Mantra CEO John Mullin from an AMA event hosted by Cointelegraph.Update (April 14, 4:33 pm UTC): This article has been updated with data from Arkham Intelligence.

Mantra CEO John Mullin denied reports suggesting large-scale token transfers by major Mantra investors in the days leading up to the sharp collapse of the OM token, while speaking in an AMA hosted by Cointelegraph on April 14.

“The Mantra association, our key investors, our advisers — no one has sold, and we are going to categorically deny and also provide verifiable proof onchain proof that this is the case,” Mullin stated in the AMA.

Previous reports suggested that Laser Digital, a strategic Mantra investor, cashed out large portions of Mantra (OM) tokens before the cryptocurrency collapsed on April 13.

Laser Digital is a digital asset business backed by Nomura. The firm announced a strategic investment in Mantra in May 2024.

At least two wallets linked to Laser Digital were among 17 wallets that moved a combined 43.6 million OM tokens — worth about $227 million at the time — to exchanges before the crash, the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported on April 13, citing Arkham Intelligence data.

According to Arkham data, a Laser Digital-linked wallet, “0x84EE7,” sent 6.5 million OM tokens to an unlabelled Arkham wallet address, “0xB37DB,” on April 11.

The “0xB37DB” address subsequently dumped the tokens on the OKX exchange in several transactions, Arkham data shows.

Arkham did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request to comment on Laser Digital's wallets' tags.

Laser Digital subsequently denied Lookonchain reports alleging its involvement in the OM crash, claiming that the referenced wallets did not belong to it.

“Laser has no involvement in the recent price collapse of $OM,” Laser said in an X post on April 14. “Assertions circulating on social media that link Laser to ‘investor selling' are factually incorrect and misleading,” the firm added.

In addition to Laser Digital, some social media reports also linked the OM onchain activity to an address allegedly tied to another Mantra investor, Shorooq Partners.

According to Lookonchain data, a wallet associated with Shane Shin, a founding partner of Shorooq Partners, received 2 million OM tokens on April 13 at 11:52 am UTC, hours before the crash.

The tokens came from a previously dormant wallet that received 2.75 million OM in April 2024, Lookonchain reported.

Shin also subsequently denied selling the tokens, stating that the transfers implied wallet-to-wallet transactions rather than transfers to an exchange.

“No tokens have been sold. The community can check the wallet address and all its transactions to understand the situation fully. Here is the wallet address for full transparency,” Shin wrote in a post on X, attaching his wallet address.

Both Laser Digital and Shorooq were among the investors in the $109 million Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF) announced on April 7.

“It is important to note up front that Shorooq (its funds and founding partners) and Mantra (management and team members) have not sold OM tokens in the lead up to, or during, this crash,” a spokesperson for Shorooq told Cointelegraph.

The representative also emphasized that Shorooq is an equity investor in Mantra, not solely a token investor. “This means that our focus is on the long-term growth of the project,” the spokesperson added.

While denying the accuracy of Arkham's data, Mantra CEO Mullin stressed that the company was not aware of the identity of the addresses dumping OM prior to its crash.

“I don't know who those wallets belong to,” Mullin said during the Cointelegraph AMA, adding:

Mullin said that Mantra believes the wallets were “mislabeled by Arkham,” adding that the platform provided its key wallet addresses in a transparency report published on April 8.

As OKX and Binance were among exchanges that saw significant OM activity before and during the crash, both exchanges addressed the issue. OKX founder Star Xu called the incident a “big scandal to the whole crypto industry.”

While Mantra CEO John Mullin attributed the OM crash to one exchange, Binance hinted at “cross-exchange liquidations.”

“Our initial findings indicate that the developments over the past day are a result of cross-exchange liquidations,” Binance said in an announcement on April 14.

In an update on April 14, OKX said that Mantra's tokenomics had gone through major changes since October 2024 and flagged suspicious activity across multiple exchanges.

 Strategy acquired 3,459 BTC worth $285 million, boosting its total holdings to over $35.9 billion as institutional confidence wanes amid global trade tensions. 

Michael Saylor's digital asset firm, Strategy, purchased 3,459 Bitcoin for $285.5 million, signaling continued confidence in Bitcoin even as global markets face trade-related headwinds.

Strategy acquired the 3,459 Bitcoin (BTC) for $285.5 million at an average price of $82,618 per BTC. The purchase brings Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 531,644 BTC, acquired for a cumulative $35.92 billion at an average price of $67,556 per coin, achieving an over 11.4% yield since the beginning of 2025, Saylor wrote in an April 14 X post.

The $285 million purchase marks Strategy's first Bitcoin investment since March 31, when the company acquired $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin, Cointelegraph reported.

According to data from Saylortracker, the firm is currently sitting on more than $9.1 billion in unrealized profit, representing a 25% gain on its total Bitcoin position as of 12:20 pm UTC.

Strategy's continued accumulation comes despite a broader market pullback and declining appetite for risk assets. The downturn has been largely attributed to global trade policy uncertainty after US President Donald Trump announced a new round of tariffs.

Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs on April 9, reverting the tariffs to the 10% baseline for most countries, except for China, which currently faces a 145% import tariff.

“Crypto markets opened the week with cautious strength, continuing a broad recovery from last Monday's tariff-induced sell-off,” Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“This week's calendar includes key data from China, Fed commentary and updates on retail sales, all of which could shape the next leg of risk asset performance,” she added.

Zooming out to the next decade, Bitcoin remains on track to surpass $1.8 million by 2035, in a development that may see Bitcoin surpass gold's $21 trillion market capitalization as the superior savings technology, Joe Burnett, director of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

 The OM price bounce appears eerily similar to what Terra's LUNA witnessed after its 99% crash in May 2022. 

Mantra's OM (OM) token staged a sharp rebound after plunging 90% over the weekend, following an active response from the project's team addressing allegations of a rug pull scam.

As of April 14, OM was trading for as high as $1.10, almost 200% higher than its post-crash low of $0.37 a day prior.

The rebound came after Mantra addressed rug-pull allegations. 

Co-founder JP Mullin reassured the community that the project remains active, pointing to the official Telegram group being “still online.”

“We are here and not going anywhere,” Mullin wrote, also sharing a verification address to prove the team's OM token holdings. He attributed the OM's crash to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges.”

Source: JP Mullin 

The assurance calmed the OM token sell-off that had obliterated over $5 billion in market capitalization and liquidated $75.9 million worth of futures positions in a day.

Numerous online commentators claimed the Mantra team, reportedly controlling 90% of the token supply, orchestrated the sell-off amid suspicious OM transfers to centralized exchanges right before the crash.

Analyst Ed further alleged that the Mantra team used their OM holdings as collateral to secure high-risk loans on a centralized exchange. 

He noted that a sudden change in the platform's loan risk parameters triggered a margin call, contributing to the token's sharp decline. 

Source: Ed

Exchanges adjust loan risk parameters to manage market volatility and protect themselves from potential insolvency due to falling collateral values. Centralized exchanges like OKX have changed their parameters since Mantra's tokenomics update in October 2024.

Notably, Mantra doubled the total supply of OM tokens from 888,888,888 to 1,777,777,777 that month. It further transitioned from a capped to an uncapped, inflationary model with an initial 8% annual inflation rate.

OKX CEO Star Xu called Mantra a “big scandal,” adding that it would release relevant reports regarding its crash in the coming days.

OM's 200% rebound from its $0.37 low may look impressive, but its structure closely resembles the classic bull trap pattern seen in Terra's LUNA debacle in May 2022.

OM's price has crashed below the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) support near $3.25 and is now testing resistance at the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) at around $1.08.

Meanwhile, OM's weekly relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to 33.31, signaling weakening momentum and increasing the risk of another breakdown.

This setup strongly mirrors LUNA's post-crash behavior. After its sharp decline in May 2022, the price staged a brief recovery but failed to reclaim its 50-week and 200-week moving averages, triggering a deeper and more prolonged downtrend.

OM now faces mounting skepticism despite the temporary bounce, with chartist AmiCatCrypto saying that the Mantra token can plunge 90% within a day after rallying for 100 days.

 NYDIG analyst Greg Cipolaro says crypto futures rates have been “persistently positive” amid the Trump administration's flip-flopping tariff regime. 

Crypto markets have been fairly stable amid wider market panic caused by US President Donald Trump's “on-again, off-again” sweeping global tariffs, according to a New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) analyst.

“Despite the carnage in traditional financial markets, the crypto markets have been relatively orderly,” NYDIG global head of research Greg Cipolaro said in an April 11 note. “Historically, in broad risk-off moves, we tend to see stresses show up in crypto markets. We have yet to see that.”

Cipolaro said crypto perpetual futures rates have “been persistently positive,” with liquidations spiking on April 6 and 7 in the days after Trump first announced the tariffs on April 2 but only to a total of $480 million, which he added “was well below other notable liquidation events.”

He noted that the price of Tether (USDT), a US dollar-tracking stablecoin widely used token in crypto trading, was below $1 but had “not experienced a sharp decline.” 

Trump unveiled a sweeping tariff regime on April 2 that lumped various levies on every country before pausing them for 90 days just hours after they came into effect on April 9 and instead charging a base tariff of 10%, besides China, which currently has tariffs of up to 145%.

Traditional and crypto markets tanked after Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, and many assets haven't recovered to the same level as before their unveiling.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration caused more confusion with its tariffs, saying on April 13 that an April 11 decision to exempt many electronics from tariffs was temporary and they would still be hit with levies.

Cipolaro said that Bitcoin (BTC) didn't escape the market volatility, “but at current prices has fared far better than many other asset classes.”

He added that Bitcoin's volatility hasn't risen to historic levels, unlike the traditional markets, and “has been relatively stable” despite instability instigated by the Trump administration.

“Perhaps investors are increasingly searching for stores of value not tied to sovereign countries and thus not affected by the trade turmoil.”

Bitcoin is down 22.5% from its mid-January peak of over $108,000 and has traded flat over the past 24 hours at $84,730, according to CoinGecko.

Cipolaro said the narrowing gap between Bitcoin's volatility and other assets makes it “increasingly more appealing” to funds with risk parity portfolios — those that use risk to choose asset allocations.

He added that investors are likely reducing their risk exposure but “perhaps some reallocation of asset mix to Bitcoin is one of the reasons it has been more buoyant.”

“Risk parity funds allocating to Bitcoin can help dampen its volatility — making the asset more attractive and potentially reinforcing a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and stability,” Cipolaro said.

However, YouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha told Cointelegraph in an April 12 note that despite a wider market rebound, “technical indicators are painting a concerning picture.”

He said a “death cross,” when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, is potentially forming on Bitcoin and the S&P 500.

Lienkha said the pattern is “generally considered a bearish signal for the medium term, suggesting that markets may struggle to sustain upward momentum without a clear catalyst or a stream of positive macroeconomic developments.”

 Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain says at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6 million OM into crypto exchanges starting April 7, representing 4.5% of the circulating supply. 

The team behind real-world tokenized asset blockchain Mantra says its native token's sudden 90% plunge was caused by exchanges forcibly closing positions without notice, with one currently unnamed exchange potentially to blame. 

On April 13, Mantra (OM) price dropped from $6.30 to below $0.50, rapidly shedding over 90% of its $6 billion market cap.

“We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mantra co-founder John Mullin wrote in an April 13 statement on X.

“The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice,” he added.

“That this happened during low-liquidity hours on a Sunday evening UTC, early morning Asia time, points to a degree of negligence at best, or possibly intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.”

Mullin told an X user they believe one exchange “in particular” was to blame but said they were still “figuring out the details.” He told others that the centralized exchange in question wasn't Binance. 

Mantra has an upcoming community connect on X, where Mullin says the team would share more information.

Some traders allege the token collapse was a rug pull, while others are speculating the Mantra team had used their tokens as collateral to take out a massive loan from a centralized exchange and the team fell prey to a loan risk parameter change, then a margin call.

Mullin denied these theories in follow-up X posts, saying, “The team did not have a loan outstanding” and haven't orchestrated a rug pull.  

“Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM's tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible,” Mullin said.

The price of OM staged a minor recovery in the aftermath of the price collapse, briefly returning above $1, but it is back down and currently trading around $0.7894, according to CoinGecko.

The token hit an all-time high of just under $9 on Feb. 23 and is now down over 91% from that figure.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain said in an April 14 post to X that some OM whales moved 14.27 million tokens to the crypto exchange OKX three days before the crash. In March, the same whales picked up 84.15 million OM for $564.7 million.

“Now, after a brutal 90% drop, their remaining 69.08 million OM is worth just $62.2 million, putting their total estimated loss at a staggering $406.3 million,” Spot On Chain said.

“However, they may have hedged the position elsewhere, and it's possible they contributed to the sharp drop.”

At the same time, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain said that since April 7, at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6 million OM into crypto exchanges, representing 4.5% of the circulating supply.

Language Differences Control Your Brain's Sentence-Prediction Habits

The brain's response to information depends on language's grammatical structure

By Gayoung Lee edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Understanding a simple-looking sentence such as “I read this article yesterday” actually requires some sophisticated conceptual computation: a subject (“I”) performed an action (“read”) on an object (“article”) at a specific time (“yesterday”). But the human brain routinely does this work nearly instantaneously based on the language's grammatical rules, says linguist Andrea E. Martin of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands. And Martin's team has now found that the human brain accommodates fundamental grammatical differences across languages by adjusting how it processes each sentence.

For a recent study in PLOS Biology, the researchers observed variations in Dutch-speaking participants' brain waves while they listened to a Dutch-language audiobook. To visualize these changes, the scientists used a metric quantifying how many new “predictions” the brain makes of words that could come next in a sentence. This framework was then tested against three different parsing strategies, or linguistic models that illustrate how the brain builds information over time.

Previous English-based studies with a similar setup concluded in favor of a model where listeners “wait and see” how each phrase in a sentence will end before interpreting it. But the Dutch speakers in Martin's study leaned strongly toward a highly predictive model; participants tended to preemptively finish each phrase in their head before it was complete. (A third model, in which listeners wait to hear all the phrases in a sentence before interpreting any part of it, is seldom used in either language.)

In Dutch language structure, verbs come near the end of a sentence rather than immediately after the subject like they do in English, explains study lead author Cas W. Coopmans, a postdoctoral researcher in New York University's department of psychology. For instance, “‘I ate a cookie with chocolate' in Dutch would be ‘I the cookie with chocolate ate.' You would have to wait very long for the verb to come,” Coopmans says. “And that's probably unrealistically late; you're probably much more predictive in processing” the sentence.

Ripley Cleghorn

Neither parsing strategy is necessarily “better or worse” than the other, Coopmans adds. “It just happens to be suited to the language [people] are processing. So we seem to be quite flexible in that you might process one language differently from another simply because they have different properties.”

The findings support the need for scientists to incorporate more diversity when crafting linguistic models, says Jixing Li, a linguist at City University Hong Kong, who was not involved in the new study. Her own work has illustrated how different brain regions activate when processing English or Chinese sentences because of their differing linguistic properties. If these studies are done only in neurotypical English-speaking adults, she says, crucial differences in processing will be missed. Li contends that this limitation defeats the purpose of the models, which are meant to provide a realistic picture of human language-based thinking.

Diversifying subjects in studies of how the brain processes language “is going to help us capture how the brain is [understanding] the structured meaning of language, and the social utility of language, in many different ways,” Martin says. “There's so much yet to be understood in the brain.”

Physicists Are Closer Than Ever to Solving the Puzzle of the Ghostly Neutrino's Mass

In just the first 259 days of data collection, KATRIN, a beta-decay-based detector in Germany, has set the smallest upper limit yet on the mass of the neutrino—the universe's lightest massive particle

The neutrino is a notorious troublemaker in the world of particle physics. This tiny, elusive particle with no electric charge likely permeates every corner of the universe, but you'd be hard-pressed to know that without extremely specialized instruments. Trillions pass through you every second, in fact, all without interacting with a single atom of your body. That is but one of the reasons why, for something so supposedly abundant and fundamental, we know painfully little about the neutrino—not even something so basic as its mass.

But neutrino physics might be on the verge of an experimental breakthrough: physicists with the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment in Germany have succeeded in measuring the upper limit of the neutrino's mass to a mere 0.45 electron volts (eV), which is less than one millionth of the mass of an electron. These results, published last week in Science, represent just a fraction of KATRIN's investigations; about three quarters of the detector's planned data haul from its ongoing 1,000-day campaign remains to be analyzed and revealed.

Another reason for excitement is that KATRIN has achieved a twofold increase in sensitivity from just last year, when some researchers raised questions as to whether the experiment would even be able to make progress on physicists' decades-long quest to gauge the neutrino's mass. And the KATRIN team intends to push the detector even further, says Alexey Lokhov, a co-author of the new study and an experimental physicist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By the conclusion of KATRIN's campaign, he says, the detector's sensitivity is targeted for a lower-end neutrino mass of 0.3 eV, another significant boost.

With their eyes on that prize, for this particular round of data analysis, Lokhov and his colleagues, including co-author Christoph Wiesinger, performed several technical overhauls to significantly improve the instrument's capabilities. “By the end of this year, we'll have this new, really big chunk of data to look at,” says Wiesinger, a physicist at Technical University of Munich, Germany. “Now KATRIN is in a more stable, near-final configuration, [so] I'm very confident we'll manage this [sensitivity boost] in upcoming years.”

The KATRIN experiment began operations in 2019. It seeks to constrain the neutrino's mass by looking at the energy spectrum of electrons and electron antineutrinos emitted by decaying tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. As detailed in the new paper, during the experiment's first 259 days, KATRIN performed energy measurements of about 36 million electrons. From the energy spectrum of these electrons, physicists were able to infer the mass of the neutrino by identifying what would appear to be a “distortion” in the energy spectrum of electrons, Lokhov explains. “The trick is that to produce a neutrino in this decay process, one needs to at least produce a mass that a small, nonzero mass [that] would influence how much energy [would be] left for the electrons.” And that “leftover” energy, he says, would hint at the presence of something else—the neutrino—present in the decay process.

To be clear, KATRIN still hasn't locked in on an absolute value for neutrino mass—nor is it supposed to. But that may be more the product of the neutrino's innate weirdness rather than any representation of KATRIN's shortcomings. The neutrino's mass is particularly elusive quarry because it stubbornly refuses to abide by the tenets of the Standard Model of particle physics. Famously, almost all of this theory's predictions have been experimentally confirmed, yet some of its forecasts for the neutrino have notoriously fallen flat. The model predicts that neutrinos should be completely massless, but this was ultimately refuted by a Nobel-winning experiment that showed neutrinos not only have mass but also, for whatever reason, change mass by oscillating between three different neutrino varieties, or “flavors.”

“You know, when everything is settled and we are all happy, [neutrinos] are like that one person in the room saying, no, not quite,” muses Carlos Argüelles Delgado, a physicist at Harvard University, who is unaffiliated with KATRIN.

But the neutrino's troublesome nature is precisely why physicists are so enamored with it; the tiny particle, theorists say, must be a rebel with a cause, with some deeper and more fundamental explanation for its quirks that could open vast new realms of physics beyond the Standard Model's increasingly bland confines. And results like KATRIN's are part of a steady flow of theoretical and experimental advances bringing us incrementally closer to those long-awaited breakthroughs.

“There's a tricky business here because the neutrinos are superpositions of mass states—they have three—and what [KATRIN] shows is that this mass combination can be no larger than 0.45 eV,” Argüelles Delgado says. Now, with the experiment's lengthy campaign set to conclude by the end of this year, the clock is ticking towards a final countdown. Time is running out to further boost its sensitivity and tighten its snare around this slippery subatomic subversive. “If the true mass of the neutrinos is within the sensitivity range of KATRIN, then KATRIN should be able to measure it,” explains Georgia Karagiorgi, a particle physicist at Columbia University, who is not part of the research team.

That said, KATRIN is probably going to be the last of its kind, Argüelles Delgado says, noting the diminishing returns associated with scaling up such experiments. Major investments to make bigger, longer-running experiments risk only delivering marginal advances—which is all the more reason why KATRIN's sunk costs and ongoing success now call for urgency. “Given KATRIN's projections, it's clear that additional data will help get it to [the researchers'] target sensitivity, so they absolutely need to run it now,” Karagiorgi says.

If or when KATRIN achieves its intended higher sensitivity, this particular experiment will end—but the hope is that future instruments will be able to continue its mission by taking heed of what physicists have learned from KATRIN. Despite its end, the data will be a treasure trove that physicists will mine for discoveries for many years to come. After all, the greater quest to measure the neutrino's mass is unquestionably a marathon.

“Neutrinos are so elusive that, well, you need either these big detectors or very, very sophisticated technologies,” Wiesinger says. “But even though that the [neutrino's] mass is so small, we expect today that just by there being so many [of them], they have a large influence on the cosmos—how structures are forming and how they evolve.”

It's fascinating to realize that such an infinitesimal and rebellious particle can have such profound effects on both subatomic and cosmic scales—and that it can be robustly studied in earthbound laboratories at all.

“Neutrinos are one-of-a-kind portals to new discoveries in physics—they were always like this from the beginning, when they were first postulated,” Lokhov says. “And even now, they're still bringing some new, exciting discoveries that [further] our understanding of nature.”

Welcome to the Critical Zone.

We're walking around on living skin every day. Well... sort of. Earth's Critical Zone, often called its “living skin,” is the near-surface environment that extends from the tops of trees down to about 700 feet into the soil. It's home to rocks, groundwater, and many, many organisms—and scientists just discovered a new resident. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study finds a whole new phylum of microbes that may help purify water. 

A phylum is a level of classification below kingdom and above class. It's essentially a “major category” of living things that groups organisms together based on shared qualities. The newly-discovered phylum, CSP1-3, is just a small part of the diverse ecosystem that is the Critical Zone. 

“This zone supports most life on the planet as it regulates essential processes like soil formation, water cycling, and nutrient cycling, which are vital for food production, water quality, and ecosystem health,” James Tiedje—researcher on the study—said in a press release. “Despite its importance, the deep Critical Zone is a new frontier because it's a major part of the Earth that is relatively unexplored.” 

Researchers identified CSP1-3 in soil samples from China and Iowa. Yes, the two locations seem unrelated—but that was intentional. Researchers wanted to know if CSP1-3 was generally occurring or specific to just one location. 

Using DNA extracted from the respective soil samples (pulled from about 70 feet deep), the team found that millions of years ago, the bacteria actually lived in hot springs and freshwater. Researchers suggest that the organisms underwent at least one transition to colonize soil environments throughout its evolutionary history. And these microbes aren't just sitting around—they are extremely active.

​​ “Most people would think that these organisms are just like spores or dormant,” Tiedje said in the release. “But one of our key findings we found through examining their DNA is that these microbes are active and slowly growing.”

Researchers were also surprised by the sheer amount of these microbes which, in some cases, made up over 50% of the soil's population. This level of dominance is not present in topsoil, and Tiedje explains that this is likely because the bacteria has evolved to thrive in the destitute deep soil conditions over many centuries. CSP1-3 lives off of the nitrogen and carbon washed down from the top soil, simultaneously sustaining itself and completing the water filtration process. 

“CSP1-3 are the scavengers cleaning up what got through the surface layer of soil,” Tiedje said. “They have a job to do.”

Overall, the study emphasizes the role of soil in global processes. In the future, researchers hope to culture some of the microbes and learn about their physiology. Unfortunately, this proves to be difficult, as deep soil conditions are hard to replicate. This research could prove important for ongoing studies attempting to solve some of the issues we are facing today. 

“CSP1-3's physiology, driven by their biochemistry, is different, so there may be some interesting genes of value for other purposes,” Tiedje said. “For example, we don't know their capacities for metabolizing tough pollutants and, if we could learn that, we can help solve one of the Earth's most pressing problems.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","An Open Source Pioneer Wants to Unleash Open Source AI Robots","https://www.wired.com/story/hugging-face-acquires-open-source-robot-startup/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Hugging Face, a company that hosts open source artificial intelligence models and software, announced today that it has acquired Pollen Robotics, the French startup behind the bug-eyed, two-armed, humanoid robot called Reachy 2. Hugging Face plans to sell the robot and will also allow developers to download, modify, and suggest improvements to its code.

“It's really important for robotics to be as open source as possible,” says Clément Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face. “When you think about physical objects doing physical things at work and at home, the level of trust and transparency I need is much higher than for something I chat with on my laptop.”

Simon Alibert and Rémi Cadene are research engineers in AI and robotics at Hugging Face.

In videos shared by Pollen Robotics, Reachy 2 can be seen performing tricks like tidying coffee mugs and picking up fruit. Matthieu Lapeyre, cofounder and CEO of Pollen Robotics, says several leading AI companies are using Reachy 2 to research robotic manipulation, although he says he can't name them due to confidentiality agreements. The ultimate goal is for people to use descendants of Reachy 2 in their homes.

Lapeyre says selling humanoid robots remains challenging, because the use cases are unclear and the systems are still unreliable—though some companies are starting to find success. Today, the technology is mostly developed by a few well-financed companies, including Tesla, Figure, and Agility Robotics. “With Hugging Face, we hope to democratize that,” he says.

Many AI models, software frameworks, and tools that researchers and engineers rely on to build AI models and applications are already open source. This means the models are shared free of charge, with licenses that allow the code to be modified and reused. Making hardware open source typically means releasing designs, component details, and 3D models that allow pieces to be manufactured more easily.

The availability of powerful open-weight AI models (meaning downloadable but not necessarily fully open source) has made it easier for researchers and startups to experiment with cutting-edge AI, as they can see how models work and modify the code. Delangue says that Hugging Face believes something similar is needed in robotics. “Hopefully open source can unleash a wide and diverse range of [new robot] capabilities,” he says.

Lapeyre adds that open-sourcing hardware has a similar effect. Robot developers “can [3D] print a part if something is broken,” he says, adding, “if something is not perfect, they can make it a bit better by adding a new part.”

The current AI boom has coincided with renewed interest in robotics, as the latest models help enable new advances in the capabilities of hardware systems. Some prominent researchers argue that AI will need a physical presence in order to match or surpass human intelligence, because that advancement may require a direct understanding of the physical world.

The hype surrounding humanoid robots has led to some dubious claims. Some of the companies racing to build humanoid robots have posted demo videos on social media that seem to promise incredible abilities. But experts warn that such videos could be misleading. A system that seems extraordinary online could in fact be tele-operated by a person off camera. It could also fail if conditions change even slightly or be unable to complete a task reliably.

Delangue says the open source approach should make progress more transparent. “You can't cheat; you can't hide with open source,” he says.

Hugging Face already hosts some open source robotics code. Delangue says that use of this code has spiked over the past year, reflecting growing interest in robotics generally.

Some robotics researchers, especially those in academia, favor the open approach. “Making robotics more accessible increases the velocity with which technology advances,” says Sergey Levine, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley and cofounder of Physical Intelligence, a startup working to develop vastly more capable and general purpose robotic models.

Physical Intelligence made the first of its robot foundation models, Pi0, available on Hugging Face in February. The model allows a range of different robots to learn to do a variety of physical tasks.

Levine says that researchers in academia and industry have already contributed valuable ideas and tweaks to his product. He adds there is potential for outsiders to contribute to the development of new hardware as well.

“There's a lot more creativity people can apply to how they build the actual physical hardware,” he says.

The open approach appears to be gaining momentum across the AI industry. Meta was the first major AI company to offer a cutting edge open weight model when it released Llama in 2023. Several other cutting edge open-weight models have followed. In January, a relatively unknown Chinese startup called DeepSeek shocked the tech industry and the stock market by releasing a powerful AI model that was reportedly developed at less cost than those made by US firms.

Even OpenAI, the company at the center of the current boom, which has kept its most powerful models a closely guarded secret, said in March that it would change its approach and release a free, open-weight model this summer.

Much of the IT and cybersecurity infrastructure underpinning the US health system is in danger of a possible collapse following a purge of IT staff and leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), four current and former agency workers tell WIRED. This could put vast troves of public health data, including the sensitive health records of hundreds of millions of Americans, clinical trial data, and more, at risk of exposure.

As a result of a reduction in force, or RIF, in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), the sources say, staff who oversee and renew contracts for critical enterprise services are no longer there. The same staff oversaw hundreds of contractors, some of whom play a crucial role in keeping systems and data safe from cyberattacks. And a void of leadership means that efforts to draw attention to what the sources believe to be a looming catastrophe have allegedly been ignored.

Thousands of researchers, scientists, and doctors lost their jobs earlier this month at HHS agencies critical to ensuring America's health, such as the Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Hundreds of administrative staff were also subjected to a reduction in force. Many of these staffers were responsible for helping ensure that the mass of highly personal and sensitive information these agencies collect is kept secure.

Employees who were subject to the RIF, as well as some who remain at the agency, tell WIRED that without intervention, they believe the systems they managed could go dark, potentially putting the entire health care system at risk.

“Pretty soon, within the next couple of weeks, everything regarding IT and cyber at the department will start to operationally reach a point of no return,” one source, who was part of a team that managed these systems at HHS for a decade before being part of the RIF, alleges to WIRED.

Like many across the agency, administrative staff found out they were part of the RIF on April 1 in an email sent at 5 am Eastern, though a number of employees only realized they had been let go when their badges no longer worked when trying to access HHS buildings.

Among those impacted were half of the staff working at the OCIO—around 150 people, including the entire workforce at the Immediate Office of the CIO, which includes senior figures like the chief of staff, HR director, acquisition director, and budget director, sources tell WIRED. The CIO, Jennifer Wendel, who has worked in the federal government for almost three decades, is also departing, sources say, and will end her tenure next month. Wendel did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

“The suggestion that critical IT and cybersecurity functions at HHS are being left unsecured is simply untrue,” an HHS spokesperson tells WIRED. “Essential operations at HHS, including contract management and cybersecurity oversight—remain staffed and functional. It's unfortunate that some former employees are spreading unfounded rumors. HHS remains committed to a secure, modernized HHS that serves the American people, not internal bureaucracy.”

One team that was purged from HHS managed over a hundred contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including crucial cybersecurity licenses. It also managed the renewal of contracts for hundreds of specialized contractors who perform critical tasks for the department, including a dozen cybersecurity contractors who work at the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC)—the primary component of the department's overall cybersecurity program which is overseen by the chief information security officer.

While all of HHS's agencies have their own cybersecurity and IT teams, the CSIRC is the only one that has visibility across the entire network of the department. This center, based in Atlanta, monitors the entire HHS network and is tasked with preventing, detecting, reporting, and responding to cybersecurity incidents at HHS.

“It is the department's nerve center,” the source says. “It has direct links to DHS, CISA, Defense Health Agency, and the intelligence community.”

The contractors provide round-the-clock coverage on three eight-hour shifts every single day, monitoring the network for any possible outages or attacks from inside or outside the network. Those contracts are set to expire on June 21; while there is time to renew them, it's not clear who is authorized to do so or knows how, since the entire office that oversees the process is no longer working at HHS.

Adding to the threat is the decision by the General Service Administration to terminate the lease for the CSIRC in Atlanta, effective December 31, 2025.

Many of the cybersecurity and monitoring tools the contractors use to monitor the networks are also due for renewal in the coming months.

If the situation is not addressed, “pretty soon, the department will be completely open to external actors to get at the largest databases in the world that have all of our public health information in them, our sensitive drug testing clinical trial information at the NIH or FDA or different organizations' mental health records,” the source claims, echoing the opinions of other sources who spoke to WIRED.

In the weeks leading up to the RIF, some administrative staff did have interactions with Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) operatives, including Clark Minor, a software engineer who worked at Palantir for over a decade and was recently installed as the department's chief information officer.

As one employee was detailing the work they did at the OCIO, they said, they got the sense that Minor—whose online résumé does not detail any experience in the federal government—seemed overwhelmed by the sheer scale of HHS, an agency that accounted for over a quarter of federal spending in 2024 and consists of an almost innumerable amount of offices and staff and operating divisions.

Minor has not provided guidance to the remaining HHS staff on the transition, according to two sources still at the agency.

Minor did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Some internal systems are already breaking down, according to sources still working at HHS. One employee, who facilitates travel for HHS employees, says the RIF “set federal travel back to processes that were in place prior to the first Electronic Travel System contract in 2004.”

While sources who spoke to WIRED differed on exactly when and how the IT and cybersecurity infrastructure at the department might collapse, they all agreed that without a radical intervention in the coming weeks, the fallout could be catastrophic.

""If the US health system lost CMS, FDA, NIH, and CDC functionality indefinitely without warning, and no backup systems were available, this would be an unprecedented systemic shock,"" one source at the OCIO tells WIRED.

Current HHS workers say they have not been presented with a plan to remedy the looming crisis, and have seen no leadership from either the political appointees or DOGE operatives who have been installed at HHS.

“There is no transition, and those in charge are AWOL,” one person currently working at HHS tells WIRED, echoing the sense of “chaos” found in an in-depth investigation into HHS by Stat. “I'm doing nothing productive. I'm answering emails stating we cannot help, we cannot process, we have no guidance, we cannot operate. This ship has no captain whatsoever, and I'm playing in the band while the Titanic sinks.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","TraderTraitor: The Kings of the Crypto Heist","https://www.wired.com/story/tradertraitor-north-korea-crypto-theft/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

On February 21, the largest crypto heist ever started to unfold. Hackers gained control of a crypto wallet belonging to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit, and stole almost $1.5 billion of digital tokens. They quickly shunted the money between dozens of cryptocurrency wallets and services to try and obscure the activity, before starting to cash the stolen funds out.

The eye-popping digital raid had all the hallmarks of being conducted by one of North Korea's elite subgroups of hackers. While Bybit remained solvent by borrowing cryptocurrency and launched a bounty scheme to track down the stolen funds, the FBI quickly pinned the blame on the North Korean hackers known as TraderTraitor.

Before the Bybit heist, TraderTraitor had already been linked to other high-profile cryptocurrency thefts and compromises of supply chain software.

“We were waiting for the next big thing,” says Michael Barnhart, a longtime cybersecurity researcher focused on North Korea and investigator at security firm DTEX Systems. “They didn't go away. They didn't try to stop. They were clearly plotting and planning—and they're doing that now,” he says.

This article is part of WIRED's Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of. You can read the rest of the series here.

North Korea's hackers—alongside those from China, Russia, and Iran—are consistently considered to be one of the most sophisticated and most dangerous cyber threats to Western democracies. While all of these countries engage in espionage and theft of sensitive data, North Korea's cyber operations come with their own set of distinct goals: helping to fund the hermit kingdom's nuclear programs. Increasingly, that means stealing cryptocurrency.

Over at least the past five years, the totalitarian regime of Kim Jong-un has deployed technically skilled IT workers to infiltrate companies around the world and earn wages that can be sent back to the motherland. In some cases, after being fired, those workers extort their former employers by threatening to release sensitive data. At the same time, North Korean hackers, as part of the broad umbrella Lazarus Group, have stolen billions in cryptocurrency from exchanges and companies around the world. TraderTraitor makes up one part of the wider Lazarus group, which is run out of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean intelligence agency.

TraderTraitor—which is also referred to as Jade Sleet, Slow Pisces, and UNC4899 by security companies—is primarily interested in cryptocurrency.

“They use a variety of creative techniques to get into blockchain, cryptocurrency, anything that has to do with platforms, trading forums, all of those different things that are around cryptocurrency and decentralized finance,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, the director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft. “The Jade Sleet group [TraderTraitor] is one of the most sophisticated groups within that echelon,” she says.

TraderTraitor first emerged around the start of 2022, multiple cybersecurity researchers say, and is likely an offshoot of the North Korean APT38 group that hacked the SWIFT financial system and attempted to steal $1 billion from the Central Bank of Bangladesh at the start of 2016. “They walked off with very little money,” says DTEX Systems's Barnhart. “In that moment you had a real, significant shift.”

Barnhart says North Korea realized that relying on other people—such as money mules—could make their operations less effective. Instead, they could steal cryptocurrency. Two groups emerged from that tactical shift, Barnhart says, CryptoCore and TraderTraitor. “TraderTraitor is the most sophisticated of all,” he says. “And why? Because APT38 was the A team.”

Since then, TraderTraitor has been linked to multiple large-scale cryptocurrency thefts in recent years. For instance, the March 2024 theft of $308 million from Japan-based cryptocurrency company DMM has been linked to TraderTraitor by the FBI, Department of Defense, and police in Japan.

TraderTraitor typically targets people working at Web3 firms using spear-phishing messages—most often, people working on software development. “They know the individuals that work at these companies, they track them, they have profiles on them, they know which trading platforms are doing the most volume. They're focused on that entire industry, understanding it backwards and forwards,” says Microsoft's DeGrippo.

GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, highlighted in July 2023 how TraderTraitor created fake accounts on the coding platform, plus LinkedIn, Slack, and Telegram. The TraderTraitor criminals can create fake personas that they use to message their targets or use real accounts that have been hacked, GitHub's research says. In that instance, TraderTraitor invited developers to collaborate on GitHub, before ultimately infecting them with malware using malicious code. Recently, security researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team found 50 North Korean recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and linked them back to TraderTraitor.

The group has been seen using “custom backdoors,” such as PLOTTWIST and TIEDYE, that target macOS, says Adrian Hernandez, a senior threat analyst at Google's Threat Intelligence Group. “These are typically heavily obfuscated to prevent detection and thwart analysis,” Hernandez says. “Once UNC4899 [TraderTraitor] has gained access to valid credentials, we've observed this threat actor moving laterally and accessing other accounts to access hosts and systems, keeping a low profile and aiming to evade detection.”

Once the North Korean hackers have their hands on cryptocurrency or digital wallets, the money laundering often follows a similar pattern, as cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic outlined in a blog post breaking down the Bybit hack. To avoid having cryptocurrency wallets frozen, they quickly swap stolen tokens—which are often issued by centralized entities and can have restrictions placed upon them—for more mainstream cryptocurrency assets like ether and bitcoin that are harder to limit.

“The second step of the laundering process is to ‘layer' the stolen funds in order to attempt to conceal the transaction trail,” Elliptic writes. This means splitting the funds into smaller amounts and sending them to multiple wallets. With Bybit, Elliptic writes, money was sent to 50 different wallets that were then emptied in the coming days. This cryptocurrency is then moved through various cryptocurrency exchanges, converted into bitcoin, and passed through crypto mixers that aim to obscure crypto transactions.

“North Korea is the most sophisticated and well-resourced launderer of crypto assets in existence, continually adapting its techniques to evade identification and seizure of stolen assets,” Elliptic says in its blog post.

In addition to cryptocurrency heists, TraderTraitor has been linked to hacks at software supply chain companies, most prominently JumpCloud in June 2023. Compromising software used by multiple companies may provide the hackers a stealthier way into their intended targets. “That could impact any tech industry, any organization that uses that software,” says Andy Piazza, senior director for threat research at Unit 42.

As TraderTraitor has increasingly garnered attention over the past couple of years, Piazza says he has seen the group improve their operations and attempt to evade detection. For example, Unit 42's recent research noted that TraderTraitor had been using malware the researchers called RN Loader that installs an information stealer and then deletes itself, making it harder to detect.

“You can definitely tell that they're stepping up,” Piazza says.

Piazza says that unlike haphazard Russian hacking groups—which were both in the networks of the DNC simultaneously around 2016—there appears to be more organization with the North Korean groups. “It seems more coordinated that they're not bumping into each other out in the battle space,” Piazza says. “They're really showing that they have the capability to be focused on that OPSEC, to be focused on that persistence capability.”

North Korea's hacking operations may be even more complex than many realize. According to Piazza and other experts WIRED spoke to, the crypto hackers and the undercover IT workers may even coordinate. Their tactics show some “overlap,” Piazza says.

“If you right now went out onto some type of freelance website and said that you are a brand-new crypto startup and you're looking for developers before the day is out, you would have North Koreans in your inbox,” Barnhart, the DTEX Systems researcher, says. He says some North Korean hackers can bounce between the country's different groups, and there's the possibility that they could also work with or alongside its IT workers. There may be more overlap than people thought, Barnhart says.

“Whenever we attribute this [hacking] back to TraderTraitor, was nobody else involved? Did somebody else have a hand in there?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Brass Typhoon: The Chinese Hacking Group Lurking in the Shadows","https://www.wired.com/story/brass-typhoon-china-cyberspies/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

As China continues its digital gambit around the world, researchers are warning that hacking activity from long-tracked groups is evolving and blending together. On top of that, attackers are hiding their campaigns more effectively and blurring the lines between cybercriminals and state-backed hacking.

Last year, revelations rocked the United States federal government that the Chinese hacking group known as “Salt Typhoon” had breached at least nine major US telecoms. And the group's rampage even continued into this year in the US and other countries around the world. Meanwhile, the Beijing-linked hacking group “Volt Typhoon” has continued to lurk in US critical infrastructure and utilities around the world. Meanwhile, the notoriously versatile syndicate known as Brass Typhoon—also called APT 41 or Barium—has been operating in the shadows.

This article is part of WIRED's Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of. You can read the rest of the series here.

The group, which researchers have been tracking since about 2012, has quietly continued its broad targeting around the world over the past year. Brass Typhoon has cast a wide net, leading researchers to view it as a sort of broad coalition that has attacked everything from a US livestock app to source code and chip designs from Taiwan's semiconductor industry and even power grids. And over the last year, the group has compromised international institutions in the tech and automotive sectors, materials, shipping and logistics, media, and more, using new and refined malware in an array of sustained campaigns.

“They're absolutely still active and still evolving,” says John Hultquist, who leads threat intelligence at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. “But it's harder to attribute some of this activity than it was in the past, because it's all part of a much bigger ecosystem of China's activity which has been deliberately built to create a tremendous amount of capability.”

Brass Typhoon is known for having carried out a notable string of software supply chain attacks in the late 2010s and for brazen attacks on telecoms around the same time in which the group specifically targeted call record data. The gang is also known for its hybrid activity, carrying out hacks that align with Chinese state-sponsored espionage by the Chinese Ministry of State Security, but also moonlighting on seemingly cybercriminal projects, particularly focused on the video game industry and in-game currency scams.

Research indicates that Brass Typhoon has continued to be active in recent months with financial crimes targeting online gambling platforms as well as espionage targeting manufacturing and energy firms. Its sustained activity has run in parallel to Salt and Volt Typhoon's recent, attention-grabbing campaigns, and analysis increasingly shows that China's state-backed hacking operations must be viewed comprehensively, not just in terms of individual actors.

“I think we should not get too down the rabbit hole of is it Salt? Is it Flax? Is it Volt?” former US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly told WIRED during her last days in that role in January, referring to an array of Beijing-linked hacking groups. “At the end of the day, China, as we've seen in assessments from the Intelligence Community, is the most formidable, persistent cyber threat that we are dealing with.”

Hultquist agrees, emphasizing that while tracking the activity of individual groups is still vital, it is increasingly important for defenders to factor in the advantages that state espionage and offensive hacking operations gain from broad collaboration.

“There was a time when there were very simple indicators that told us who each actor was, and they were operating incredibly loudly, so it was easy to spot the smash-and-grab nature of the activity,” he says. “APT 41 is still doing some loud activity, but so much of its activity now has gotten better and they've made an effort to really avoid our controls.”

Ultimately, though, researchers say that the most significant takeaway about Brass Typhoon's current activity is that it continues apace.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Black Basta: The Fallen Ransomware Gang That Lives On","https://www.wired.com/story/black-basta-ransomware-gang/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The pecking order of ransomware gangs is always shifting and evolving, with the most aggressive and reckless groups netting big payouts from vulnerable targets—but often ultimately flaming out. Russian-speaking group Black Basta is the latest example of the trend having stalled out in recent months due to takedowns by law enforcement and a damaging leak. But after some quiet weeks, researchers warn that, far from being dead and gone, the actors involved with Black Basta will reemerge in other cybercriminal groups—or potentially already have—to start the cycle once again.

Since appearing in April 2022, Black Basta has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in payments targeting an array of corporate victims in health care, critical infrastructure, and other high-stakes industries. The group uses double extortion to pressure targets into paying a ransom—stealing data and threatening to leak it while also encrypting a target's systems to hold them hostage. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned last year that Black Basta had gone on a spree targeting more than 500 organizations in North America, Europe, and Australia.

This article is part of WIRED's Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of. You can read the rest of the series here.

A major international law enforcement takedown in 2023 of the “Qakbot” botnet hindered Black Basta's operations, though. And, this February, a major leak of the group's internal data—including chat logs and operational information—rocked the group. Since then, it has gone dormant. Researchers warn, though, that the criminals behind Black Basta are already on the move and are almost certain to stage a resurgence.

“We haven't seen the leaders of Black Basta regroup, but they're going to continue to work, they're going to continue to operate,” says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst focused on ransomware at the security firm Recorded Future. “There's still too much money in it not to. And ransomware actors are creatures of habit just like anyone.”

The leak revealed details about Black Basta's malware and technical capabilities, its internal squabbles, and clues about the identity of the actors behind the group, particularly its main administrator. The exposed data was from what might be considered Black Basta's heyday, September 2023 to September 2024. During this period, the group didn't shy away from the possibility of causing harm with its breaches. A particularly aggressive attack last year on the St. Louis–based health care network Ascension, for example, reportedly caused disruptions in care, including rerouted ambulances.

Black Basta struggled to maintain its momentum, though, after the 2023 Qakbot takedown, known as Operation Duck Hunt.

“It was a huge blow to them, and they were trying to get back on their feet—use other botnets, work on a custom botnet, but that didn't really work, and ultimately their infection rate was declining,” says Yelisey Bohuslavskiy, chief research officer of the threat-intelligence firm RedSense. “They had fewer targets and were getting into fewer networks. They were still dangerous, but there was this feeling that there was deterioration going on.”

Even in this decline, there was evidence that Black Basta was trying to mount a resurgence. In addition to exploring new malware, the gang started focusing on compromising targets through social engineering and influence campaigns, particularly spam email operations and tech support scams. But after the leak, Bohuslavskiy says, members began moving to other groups and have already been buoying their new gangs.

Like any industry, the Russian cybercriminal landscape is full of people who have worked together or competed against one another for years. Black Basta was able to establish itself so quickly because many of its members were involved with previous cybercriminal operations, including the longtime cybercriminal gang Conti. Conti is a well-known group because of another internal leak incident in 2022 that exposed its inner workings and ties to the Kremlin. After Conti's demise, researchers tracked its members as they dispersed and started new hacking groups, including Black Basta.

While Black Basta is not unique in its tactics and methods, researchers say that the group is noteworthy for its technical skills and depth of cybercriminal experience, which allowed it to push the envelope on the approaches a ransomware group can take.

“The people behind Black Basta have been in a lot of networks and have a lot of experience,” Recorder Future's Liska says. “They aren't the most prolific group but I think they are one of the more dangerous groups because they are so skilled.”

February's leaks revealed, for example, that Black Basta developed a tool for automatically infiltrating network devices like routers that had easily-guessable passwords. Automating a tool to guess passwords is not a groundbreaking capability, but it is the type of project that many ransomware groups wouldn't think to take on themselves or have the capacity to develop in-house.

In a report last week analyzing the leaked Black Basta communications, researchers from the security firm Trustwave wrote, “The messages show how members exhibit remarkable autonomy and creativity, adapting quickly to evolving security landscapes.”

The Black Basta leak is a cache of 200,000 messages and other data apparently taken from the group's Matrix chat server, bestflowers247.online, by user “ExploitWhispers.” The trove includes the text of the group's communications plus time stamps, sender and recipient details, and other metadata. The identity and motivation of “ExploitWhispers” is unknown, but they claimed to have leaked the data because Black Basta had allegedly attacked Russian banks, violating the unwritten rule that cybercriminals can operate in Russia with impunity so long as they do not attack Russian organizations.

While the exposure that came with the leaks was a death knell for Black Basta as a group, it is more likely to be a setback than a permanent defeat for its members.

“We haven't seen the leaders of Black Basta regroup, but they're going to continue to work, they're going to continue to operate,” Recorded Future's Liska says. “There's still too much money in it not to. And ransomware actors are creatures of habit just like anyone.”

RedSense's Bohuslavskiy adds that he has already seen signs of Black Basta members cropping up in other active gangs, including “BlackSuit,” “INC,” “Lynx,” “Cactus,” and “Nokoyawa.”

“Now that Black Basta is done, a lot of the people have migrated, and there are a number of other ransomware groups that are getting infusions of Black Basta talent,” Bohuslavskiy says.

Nvidia said on Monday that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test AI chips in Arizona and Texas as part of an effort to move a portion of its production to the U.S.

The chipmaker said the production of its Blackwell chips has started at TSMC's chip plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and that Nvidia is building “supercomputer” manufacturing plants in Texas — with Foxconn in Houston and with Wistron in Dallas. In Arizona, Nvidia is partnering with Amkor and SPIL for packaging and testing operations, the company added.

Mass production at the Houston and Dallas plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months, and within the next four years, the company aims to produce up to half-a-trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the U.S.

“The engines of the world's AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.”

The announcement comes days after Nvidia reportedly narrowly avoided export controls on its H20 chip after striking a domestic manufacturing deal with the Trump administration. According to NPR, the H20, Nvidia's most advanced chip that can still be exported to China, was spared thanks to a promise from Huang to pour capital into components for U.S.-based AI data centers.

Many other AI companies have leaned into Trump's “America-first” approach to AI in bids to curry favor with the administration. OpenAI teamed up with SoftBank and Oracle for a $500 billion U.S. data center initiative dubbed the Stargate Project in January, while Microsoft pledged $80 billion to build AI data centers in its 2025 fiscal year, with 50% of that earmarked for the U.S.

Trump has strong-armed certain partners to get his desired outcome in recent months. He reportedly told TSMC that it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if the company didn't build new chip factories in the U.S.

Nvidia claimed its U.S. chip manufacturing initiatives could create “hundreds of thousands” of jobs and drive “trillions of dollars” in economic activity over the coming decades. But programs to ramp up the domestic chipmaking industry face formidable — and growing — challenges.

Retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions from China threaten the supply of necessary raw materials to build chips in the U.S., and there's a severe shortage of skilled frontline workers for assembling chips. Meanwhile, the Trump administration's moves to undermine the Chips Act, a bill passed in 2022 to dole out billions in grants to chipmakers, could deter future investments from semiconductor giants.

Audio-enabled traffic control crosswalk buttons across Silicon Valley were hacked over the weekend to include audio snippets imitating the voices of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. 

Videos taken by locals in Menlo Park, Palo Alto, and Redwood City in California show the crosswalk buttons were playing AI-generated speech designed to sound like the two billionaires.

“It's normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience,” said one crosswalk button, which was hacked to sound like Zuckerberg. “I just want to assure you, you don't need to worry because there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.” 

One crosswalk button that was hacked to sound like Musk said: “I guess they say money can't buy happiness… I guess that's true. God knows I've tried. But it can buy a Cybertruck and that's pretty sick, right?”

“F—k, I'm so alone,” the Musk voice adds.

It's not clear why the sidewalk buttons were hacked, or by whom, but signs point to possible hacktivism.

our crosswalks just got vc funding apparently #paloalto #elonmusk #tesla #siliconvalley #walkablecities 

Replying to @whitney 🍉 

Menlo Park, home of meta, crosswalk speakers are getting hacked… @Mark Zuckerberg 

Palo Alto Online, one of the first outlets to report the hack, cited a Redwood City official as saying the city was “actively working to investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.” According to the outlet, the tampering may have happened on Friday.

Audio-enabled crosswalk buttons are widely used across the United States to allow those with visual impairments or accessibility needs to hear custom audio messages that play for pedestrians to know when it is safe to cross a street. 

In a video from 2024, physical penetration specialist and security researcher Deviant Ollam explains how audio-enabled crosswalk buttons can be manipulated often by way of default-set passwords that have not been changed.

Polara, the company that makes the audio-enabled crosswalk buttons, did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Monday.

AI dev platform Hugging Face has acquired Pollen Robotics, a robotics startup based in France, for an undisclosed amount. Wired reports that Hugging Face plans to sell Pollen's humanoid robot, Reachy 2, and let developers download and suggest improvements to its code.

Pollen Robotics, which aims to bring affordable humanoid robots to the home, was founded in 2016 by Matthieu Lapeyre and Pierre Rouanet. The company managed to raise €2.5 million (around $2.83 million) from investors including Bpifrance prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.

If you've followed the progress of robotics in the past 18 months, you've likely noticed how robotics is increasingly becoming the next frontier that AI will unlock.At Hugging Face—in robotics and across all AI fields—we believe in a future where AI and robots are open-source,…

The acquisition marks an expansion of Hugging Faces' robotics efforts, with which Pollen was closely involved. Last year, Hugging Face teamed up with Pollen to build “Le Robot,” and open source robot trained to do a variety of household chores. Hugging Face also established a robotics team led by Remi Cadene, a former robotics engineer from Tesla's Optimus program.

Chipolo, the maker of AirTag-like devices, on Monday introduced the latest version of its product. Now, instead of offering models that only work with either Apple or Google's lost-item finding technology, the new Chipolo POP devices work with both companies' finding networks out of the box.

By combining these different functionalities into one device, Chipolo believes it will be easier for consumers to choose the right device for their needs. Plus, this would make Chipolo products better for gifting because buyers won't need to know whether the recipient uses Android or an iPhone, the company said.

The Chipolo devices are among a handful of companies, including Tile, Pebblebee, and Samsung, that make their own AirTag-like trackers.

Unlike Tile, which designed a finding network that leveraged the people who had its mobile app installed, Chipolo chose to work with the existing finding networks offered by platform makers Apple and Google. (Though Tile arrived before the AirTag, the competition from Apple ultimately led to its finding an exit by selling in 2021 to family locator service, Life360, for $205 million.)

To date, Chipolo has sold more than 4.5 million of its devices. Following the launch of its first “Find My” compatible product, the Chipolo ONE Spot and the Chipolo Card Spot, it's seen a 30% average in annual growth, the company shared with TechCrunch via email.

In addition to offering support for both Apple and Google's finding networks, the new Chipolo POP includes other popular features from prior trackers, including the option to find your missing phone by double-pressing on your trackers out-of-range alerts, the ability to change the Chipolo's ringtone, and the option to use the tracker as a remote selfie shutter.

The Bluetooth range of the device has also been extended to 300 feett (90m) and the battery lasts up to a 1 year and is user-replaceable.

The new devices now come in blue, black, green, red, white, and yellow and sell for $29 (£30/€35) on Chipolo's website and Amazon.

Google's AI research lab, Google DeepMind, says that it has created an AI model that can help decipher dolphin vocalizations, supporting research efforts to better understand how dolphins communicate. 

The model, called DolphinGemma, was trained using data from the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP), a nonprofit that studies Atlantic spotted dolphins and their behaviors. Built on Google's open Gemma series of models, DolphinGemma, which can generate “dolphin-like” sound sequences, is efficient enough to run on phones, Google says. 

This summer, WDP plans to use Google's Pixel 9 smartphone to power a platform that can create synthetic dolphin vocalizations and listen to dolphin sounds for a matching “reply.” WDP previously was using the Pixel 6 to conduct this work, Google says, and upgrading to the Pixel 9 will enable researchers at the organization to run AI models and template-matching algorithms at the same time, according to Google.

If you don't need to have the lowest possible latency for your work and you're happy to have threads die then it's better than any bespoke solution you can build without an army of engineers to keep it chugging along.What's even better is that you can see all the context, and use the same command plane as the agents to tell them what they are doing wrong.

This might not seem like much of a big deal. But as we transition to more of these #nocode automated tools, the idea of having to know how programming works in order to interact with an API will start to seem archaic. I'd compare it to how esoteric the terminal looked after someone saw a GUI like the one used by Apple's Macintosh back in the 1980s.I looked forward to this day back in the early 2000s when APIs started arriving, but felt even then that something was fishy. I would have preferred that sites had a style-free request format that returned XML or even JSON generated from HTML, rather than having to use a separate API. I have this sense that the way we do it today with a split backend/frontend, distributed state, duplicated validation, etc has been a monumental waste of time.

Yes.  I know note taking and journaling posts are frequent on HN, but I've thought that this is the best way to go, is universal from any client, and very expandable.  It's just not generically scaleable for all users, but for the HN reader-types, it'd be perfect.

I have not thought about adding memory log of all current things and feeding it into the context I'll try it out.Mine is a simple stateless thing that captures messages, voice memos and creates task entries in my org mode file with actionable items. I only feed current date to the context.Its pretty amusing to see how it sometimes adds a little bit of its own personality to simple tasks, for example if one of my tasks are phrased as a question it will often try to answer the question in the task description.

1. How did he tell Claude to “update” based on the notebook entries?2. Won't he eventually ran out of context window?3. Won't this be expensive when using hosted solutions? For just personal hacking, why not simply use ollama + your favorite model?4. If one were to build this locally, can Vector DB similarity search or a hybrid combined with fulltext search be used to achieve this?I can totally imagine using pgai for the notebook logs feature and local ollama + deepseek for the inference.The email idea mentioned by other commenters is brilliant. But I don't think you need a new mailbox, just pull from Gmail and grep if sender and receiver is yourself (aka the self tag).Thank you for sharing, OP's project is something I have been thinking for a few months now.

The ""memories"" table has a date column which is used to record the data when the information is relevant. The prompt can then be fed just information for today and the next few days - which will always be tiny.It's possible to save ""memories"" that are always included in the prompt, but even those will add up to not a lot of tokens over time.> Won't this be expensive when using hosted solutions?You may be under-estimating how absurdly cheap hosted LLMs are these days. Most prompts against most models cost a fraction of a single cent, even for tens of thousands of tokens. Play around with my LLM pricing calculator for an illustration of that: https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices> If one were to build this locally, can Vector DB similarity search or a hybrid combined with fulltext search be used to achieve this?Geoffrey's design is so simple it doesn't even need search - all it does is dump in context that's been stamped with a date, and there are so few tokens there's no need for FTS or vector search. If you wanted to build something more sophisticated you could absolutely use those. SQLite has surprisingly capable FTS built in and there are extensions like https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec for doing things with vectors.

Do we even need to think of these as agents, or will the agentic frameworks move towrads being a call_llm() sql function?


reply



This works really effectively with thinking models, because the thinking eats up tons of context, but also produces very good ""summary documents"". So you can kind of reap the rewards of thinking without having to sacrifice that juicy sub 50k context. The database also provides a form of fallback, or RAG I suppose, for situations where the summary leaves out important details, but the model must also recognize this and go pull context from the DB.Right now I have been trying it to make essentially an inventory management/BOM optimization agent for a database of ~10k distinct parts/materials.

Large swathes of the stack is commoditized OSS plumbing, and hosted inference is already cheap and easy.There are obvious security issues with plugging an agent into your email and calendar, but I think many will find it preferable to control the whole stack rather than ceding control to Apple or Google.

TL;DR I made shortcuts that work on my Apple watch directly to record my voice, transcribe it and store my daily logs on a Notion DB.All you need are 1) a chatgpt API key and 2) a Notion account (free).- I made one shortcut in my iPhone to record my voice, use whisper model to transcribe it (done locally using a POST request) and send this transcription to my Notion database (again a POST request on shortcuts)- I made another shortcut that records my voice, transcribes and reads data from  my Notion database to answer questions based on what exists in it. It puts all data from db into the context to answer -- costs a lot but simple and works well.The best part is -- this workflow works without my iPhone and directly on my Apple Watch. It uses POST requests internally so no need of hosting a server. And Notion API happens to be free for this kind of a use case.I like logging my day to day activities with just using Siri on my watch and possibly getting insights based on them. Honestly the whisper model is what makes it work because the  accuracy is miles ahead of the local transcription model.

Personally, this appears to be extremely helpful for me, because instead of checking several different spots every day, I can get a coherent summary in one spot, tailored to me and my family. I'm literally checking the same things every day, down to USPS Informed Delivery. This seems to simplify what's already complicated, at least for my use cases.Is this niche?

Interesting. I would have guessed that any kind of forests have quite limited cap how much carbon it could retain in dead wood, and that this cap will be pretty much fixed. Unless something will stop natural decay processes releasing the carbon back to the atmosphere I don't see how existing grown forest could increase its capacity, since I suppose it is already at its equilibrium.(Unlike peatlands, where most of accumulated carbon remains underwater, so it presumably has much larger capacity.)Simply said, without ""burying or sinking wood mass"" I see no easy way to prevent carbon from returning into the atmosphere. Basically if we need to take carbon from the atmosphere, we should ideally put it back from where we have been mining it for last couple of centuries.

The article says, ""We found that a forest that's developing toward old-growth condition is accruing more wood in the stream than is being lost through decomposition"" and ""The effect will continue in coming decades, Keeton said, because many mature New England forests are only about halfway through their long recovery from 19th- and 20th-century clearing for timber and agriculture"".


reply



Still a bit confused about the emphasis in wood deposits in ""streams"" – reportedly way more effective, but I'd guess with very limited capacity to really ""lock"" the mass – compared to regular hummus – not that effective, but for forest with couple of centuries of growth ahead I'd guess way more capacious. Good news either way, though!

It's the same logic for construction materials. A house has dozens of trees worth of lumber in it, and that carbon is now trapped in the house for however many decades it takes until the house eventually burns down or rots.

Maybe it would be more effective to drop wet lumber off in the desert for a few years by rail before moving the dry lumber to permanent underground storage. This assumes two stages of transport to and from the desert would cost less carbon than transport to a kiln and then to storage.I'm not convinced that the wood even needs to be dried before burying, though.

A nuclear explosion might eventually be Earth's only way to protect itself from a dangerous asteroid. But preparing for that without launching nukes into space means getting creative.

One day, in the near or far future, an asteroid about the length of a football stadium will find itself on a collision course with Earth. If we are lucky, it will land in the middle of the vast ocean, creating a good-size but innocuous tsunami, or in an uninhabited patch of desert. But if it has a city in its crosshairs, one of the worst natural disasters in modern times will unfold. As the asteroid steams through the atmosphere, it will begin to fragment—but the bulk of it will likely make it to the ground in just a few seconds, instantly turning anything solid into a fluid and excavating a huge impact crater in a heartbeat. A colossal blast wave, akin to one unleashed by a large nuclear weapon, will explode from the impact site in every direction. Homes dozens of miles away will fold like cardboard. Millions of people could die.

Fortunately for all 8 billion of us, planetary defense—the science of preventing asteroid impacts—is a highly active field of research. Astronomers are watching the skies, constantly on the hunt for new near-Earth objects that might pose a threat. And others are actively working on developing ways to prevent a collision should we find an asteroid that seems likely to hit us.

We already know that at least one method works: ramming the rock with an uncrewed spacecraft to push it away from Earth. In September 2022, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, showed it could be done when a semiautonomous spacecraft the size of a small car, with solar panel wings, was smashed into an (innocuous) asteroid named Dimorphos at 14,000 miles per hour, successfully changing its orbit around a larger asteroid named Didymos. 

But there are circumstances in which giving an asteroid a physical shove might not be enough to protect the planet. If that's the case, we could need another method, one that is notoriously difficult to test in real life: a nuclear explosion. 

Scientists have used computer simulations to explore this potential method of planetary defense. But in an ideal world, researchers would ground their models with cold, hard, practical data. Therein lies a challenge. Sending a nuclear weapon into space would violate international laws and risk inflaming political tensions. What's more, it could do damage to Earth: A rocket malfunction could send radioactive debris into the atmosphere. 

Over the last few years, however, scientists have started to devise some creative ways around this experimental limitation. The effort began in 2023, with a team of scientists led by Nathan Moore, a physicist and chemical engineer at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sandia is a semi-secretive site that serves as the engineering arm of America's nuclear weapons program. And within that complex lies the Z Pulsed Power Facility, or Z machine, a cylindrical metallic labyrinth of warning signs and wiring. It's capable of summoning enough energy to melt diamond. 

About 25,000 asteroids more than 460 feet long—a size range that starts with midsize “city killers” and goes up in impact from there—are thought to exist close to Earth. Just under half of them have been found.

The researchers reckoned they could use the Z machine to re-create the x-ray blast of a nuclear weapon—the radiation that would be used to knock back an asteroid—on a very small and safe scale.

It took a while to sort out the details. But by July 2023, Moore and his team were ready. They waited anxiously inside a control room, monitoring the thrumming contraption from afar. Inside the machine's heart were two small pieces of rock, stand-ins for asteroids, and at the press of a button, a maelstrom of x-rays would thunder toward them. If they were knocked back by those x-rays, it would prove something that, until now, was purely theoretical: You can deflect an asteroid from Earth using a nuke.

This experiment “had never been done before,” says Moore. But if it succeeded, its data would contribute to the safety of everyone on the planet. Would it work?

Asteroid impacts are a natural disaster like any other. You shouldn't lose sleep over the prospect, but if we get unlucky, an errant space rock may rudely ring Earth's doorbell. “The probability of an asteroid striking Earth during my lifetime is very small. But what if one did? What would we do about it?” says Moore. “I think that's worth being curious about.”

Forget about the gigantic asteroids you know from Hollywood blockbusters. Space rocks over two-thirds of a mile (about one kilometer) in diameter—those capable of imperiling civilization—are certainly out there, and some hew close to Earth's own orbit. But because these asteroids are so elephantine, astronomers have found almost all of them already, and none pose an impact threat. 

The telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made.

Rather, it's asteroids a size range down—those upwards of 460 feet (140 meters) long—that are of paramount concern. About 25,000 of those are thought to exist close to our planet, and just under half have been found. The day-to-day odds of an impact are extremely low, but even one of the smaller ones in that size range could do significant damage if it found Earth and hit a populated area—a capacity that has led astronomers to dub such midsize asteroids “city killers.”

If we find a city killer that looks likely to hit Earth, we'll need a way to stop it. That could be technology to break or “disrupt” the asteroid into fragments that will either miss the planet entirely or harmlessly ignite in the atmosphere. Or it could be something that can deflect the asteroid, pushing it onto a path that will no longer intersect with our blue marble. 

Because disruption could accidentally turn a big asteroid into multiple smaller, but still deadly, shards bound for Earth, it's often considered to be a strategy of last resort. Deflection is seen as safer and more elegant. One way to achieve it is to deploy a spacecraft known as a kinetic impactor—a battering ram that collides with an asteroid and transfers its momentum to the rocky interloper, nudging it away from Earth. NASA's DART mission demonstrated that this can work, but there are some important caveats: You need to deflect the asteroid years in advance to make sure it completely misses Earth, and asteroids that we spot too late—or that are too big—can't be swatted away by just one DART-like mission. Instead, you'd need several kinetic impactors—maybe many of them—to hit one side of the asteroid perfectly each time in order to push it far enough to save our planet. That's a tall order for orbital mechanics, and not something space agencies may be willing to gamble on. 

In that case, the best option might instead be to detonate a nuclear weapon next to the asteroid. This would irradiate one hemisphere of the asteroid in x-rays, which in a few millionths of a second would violently shatter and vaporize the rocky surface. The stream of debris spewing out of that surface and into space would act like a rocket, pushing the asteroid in the opposite direction. “There are scenarios where kinetic impact is insufficient, and we'd have to use a nuclear explosive device,” says Moore.

This idea isn't new. Several decades ago, Peter Schultz, a planetary geologist and impacts expert at Brown University, was giving a planetary defense talk at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, another American lab focused on nuclear deterrence and nuclear physics research. Afterwards, he recalls, none other than Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb and a key member of the Manhattan Project, invited him into his office for a chat. “He wanted to do one of these near-Earth-­asteroid flybys and wanted to test the nukes,” Schultz says. What, he wondered, would happen if you blasted an asteroid with a nuclear weapon's x-rays? Could you forestall a spaceborne disaster using weapons of mass destruction?

But Teller's dream wasn't fulfilled—and it's unlikely to become a reality anytime soon. The United Nations' 1967 Outer Space Treaty states that no nation can deploy or use nuclear weapons off-world (even if it's not clear how long certain spacefaring nations will continue to adhere to that rule).

Even raising the possibility of using nukes to defend the planet can be tricky. “There're still many folks that don't want to talk about it at all … even if that were the only option to prevent an impact,” says Megan Bruck Syal, a physicist and planetary defense researcher at Lawrence Livermore. Nuclear weapons have long been a sensitive subject, and with relations between several nuclear nations currently at a new nadir, anxiety over the subject is understandable. 

But in the US, there are groups of scientists who “recognize that we have a special responsibility as a spacefaring nation and as a nuclear-­capable nation to look at this,” Syal says. “It isn't our preference to use a nuclear explosive, of course. But we are still looking at it, in case it's needed.” 

No asteroid larger than a kilometer is likely to hit us in that time frame, says a new study. But smaller ones could still pose a risk.

But how? 

Mostly, researchers have turned to the virtual world, using supercomputers at various US laboratories to simulate the asteroid-­agitating physics of a nuclear blast. To put it mildly, “this is very hard,” says Mary Burkey, a physicist and planetary defense researcher at Lawrence Livermore. You cannot simply flick a switch on a computer and get immediate answers. “When a nuke goes off in space, there's just x-ray light that's coming out of it. It's shining on the surface of your asteroid, and you're tracking those little photons penetrating maybe a tiny little bit into the surface, and then somehow you have to take that micro­meter worth of resolution and then propagate it out onto something that might be on the order of hundreds of meters wide, watching that shock wave propagate and then watching fragments spin off into space. That's four different problems.” 

Mimicking the physics of x-ray rock annihilation with as much verisimilitude as possible is difficult work. But recent research using these high-fidelity simulations does suggest that nukes are an effective planetary defense tool for both disruption and deflection. The thing is, though, no two asteroids are alike; each is mechanically and geologically unique, meaning huge uncertainties remain. A more monolithic asteroid might respond in a straightforward way to a nuclear deflection campaign, whereas a rubble pile asteroid—a weakly bound fleet of boulders barely held together by their own gravity—might respond in a chaotic, uncontrollable way. Can you be sure the explosion wouldn't accidentally shatter the asteroid, turning a cannonball into a hail of bullets still headed for Earth? 

Simulations can go a long way toward answering these questions, but they remain virtual re-creations of reality, with built-in assumptions. “Our models are only as good as the physics that we understand and that we put into them,” says Angela Stickle, a hypervelocity impact physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. To make sure the simulations are reproducing the correct physics and delivering realistic data, physical experiments are needed to ground them.

Every firing of the Z machine carries the energy of more than 1,000 lightning bolts, and each shot lasts a few millionths of a second.

Researchers studying kinetic impactors can get that sort of real-world data. Along with DART, they can use specialized cannons—like the Vertical Gun Range at NASA's Ames Research Center in California—to fire all sorts of projectiles at meteorites. In doing so, they can find out how tough or fragile asteroid shards can be, effectively reproducing a kinetic impact mission on a small scale. 

Battle-testing nuke-based asteroid defense simulations is another matter. Re-creating the physics of these confrontations on a small scale was long considered to be exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, those keen on fighting asteroids are as persistent as they are creative—and several teams, including Moore's at Sandia, think they have come up with a solution.

The prime mission of Sandia, like that of Lawrence Livermore, is to help maintain the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. “It's a national security laboratory,” says Moore. “Planetary defense affects the entire planet,” he adds—making it, by default, a national security issue as well. And that logic, in part, persuaded the powers that be in July 2022 to try a brand-new kind of experiment. Moore took charge of the project in January 2023—and with the shot scheduled for the summer, he had only a few months to come up with the specific plan for the experiment. There was “lots of scribbling on my whiteboard, running computer simulations, and getting data to our engineers to design the test fixture for the several months it would take to get all the parts machined and assembled,” he says.

Although there were previous and ongoing experiments that showered asteroid-like targets with x-rays, Moore and his team were frustrated by one aspect of them. Unlike actual asteroids floating freely in space, the micro-­asteroids on Earth were fixed in place. To truly test whether x-rays could deflect asteroids, targets would have to be suspended in a vacuum—and it wasn't immediately clear how that could be achieved.

Generating the nuke-like x-rays was the easy part, because Sandia had the Z machine, a hulking mass of diodes, pipes, and wires interwoven with an assortment of walkways that circumnavigate a vacuum chamber at its core. When it's powered up, electrical currents are channeled into capacitors—and, when commanded, blast that energy at a target or substance to create radiation and intense magnetic pressures. 

Flanked by klaxons and flashing lights, it's an intimidating sight. “It's the size of a building—about three stories tall,” says Moore. Every firing of the Z machine carries the energy of more than 1,000 lightning bolts, and each shot lasts a few millionths of a second: “You can't even blink that fast.” The Z machine is named for the axis along which its energetic particles cascade, but the Z could easily stand for “Zeus.”

The original purpose of the Z machine, whose first form was built half a century ago, was nuclear fusion research. But over time, it's been tinkered with, upgraded, and used for all kinds of science. “The Z machine has been used to compress matter to the same densities [you'd find at] the centers of planets. And we can do experiments like that to better understand how planets form,” Moore says, as an example. And the machine's preternatural energies could easily be used to generate x-rays—in this case, by electrifying and collapsing a cloud of argon gas.

“The idea of studying asteroid deflection is completely different for us,” says Moore. And the machine “fires just once a day,” he adds, “so all the experiments are planned more than a year in advance.” In other words, the researchers had to be near certain their one experiment would work, or they would be in for a long wait to try again—if they were permitted a second attempt. 

For some time, they could not figure out how to suspend their micro-asteroids. But eventually, they found a solution: Two incredibly thin bits of aluminum foil would hold their targets in place within the Z machine's vacuum chamber. When the x-ray blast hit them and the targets, the pieces of foil would be instantly vaporized, briefly leaving the targets suspended in the chamber and allowing them to be pushed back as if they were in space. “It's like you wave your magic wand and it's gone,” Moore says of the foil. He dubbed this technique “x-ray scissors.” 

In July 2023, after considerable planning, the team was ready. Within the Z machine's vacuum chamber were two fingernail-size targets—a bit of quartz and some fused silica, both frequently found on real asteroids. Nearby, a pocket of argon gas swirled away. Satisfied that the gigantic gizmo was ready, everyone left and went to stand in the control room. For a moment, it was deathly quiet.

Stand by.

Fire.

It was over before their ears could even register a metallic bang. A tempest of electricity shocked the argon gas cloud, causing it to implode; as it did, it transformed into a plasma and x-rays screamed out of it, racing toward the two targets in the chamber. The foil vanished, the surfaces of both targets erupted outward as supersonic sprays of debris, and the targets flew backward, away from the x-rays, at 160 miles per hour.

Moore wasn't there. “I was in Spain when the experiment was run, because I was celebrating my anniversary with my wife, and there was no way I was going to miss that,” he says. But just after the Z machine was fired, one of his colleagues sent him a very concise text: IT WORKED.

“We knew right away it was a huge success,” says Moore. The implications were immediately clear. The experimental setup was complex, but they were trying to achieve something extremely fundamental: a real-world demonstration that a nuclear blast could make an object in space move. 

“We're genuinely looking at this from the standpoint of ‘This is a technology that could save lives.'”

Patrick King, a physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, was impressed. Previously, pushing back objects using x-ray vaporization had been extremely difficult to demonstrate in the lab. “They were able to get a direct measurement of that momentum transfer,” he says, calling the x-ray scissors an “elegant” technique.

Sandia's work took many in the community by surprise. “The Z machine experiment was a bit of a newcomer for the planetary defense field,” says Burkey. But she notes that we can't overinterpret the results. It isn't clear, from the deflection of the very small and rudimentary asteroid-like targets, how much a genuine nuclear explosion would deflect an actual asteroid. As ever, more work is needed. 

King leads a team that is also working on this question. His NASA-funded project involves the Omega Laser Facility, a complex based at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. Omega can generate x-rays by firing powerful lasers at a target within a specialized chamber. Upon being irradiated, the target generates an x-ray flash, similar to the one produced during a nuclear explosion in space, which can then be used to bombard various objects—in this case, some Earth rocks acting as asteroid mimics, and (crucially) some bona fide meteoritic material too. 

King's Omega experiments have tried to answer a basic question: “How much material actually gets removed from the surface?” says King. The amount of material that flies off the pseudo-asteroids, and the vigor with which it's removed, will differ from target to target. The hope is that these results—which the team is still considering—will hint at how different types of asteroids will react to being nuked. Although experiments with Omega cannot produce the kickback seen in the Z machine, King's team has used a more realistic and diverse series of targets and blasted them with x-rays hundreds of times. That, in turn, should clue us in to how effectively, or not, actual asteroids would be deflected by a nuclear explosion.

“I wouldn't say one [experiment] has definitive advantages over the other,” says King. “Like many things in science, each approach can yield insight along different ‘axes,' if you will, and no experimental setup gives you the whole picture.”

Experiments like Moore's and King's may sound technologically baroque—a bit like lightning-fast Rube Goldberg machines overseen by wizards. But they are likely the first in a long line of increasingly sophisticated tests. “We've just scratched the surface of what we can do,” Moore says. As with King's experiments, Moore hopes to place a variety of materials in the Z machine, including targets that can stand in for the wetter, more fragile carbon-rich asteroids that astronomers commonly see in near-Earth space. “If we could get our hands on real asteroid material, we'd do it,” he says. And it's expected that all this experimental data will be fed back into those nuke-versus-­asteroid computer simulations, helping to verify the virtual results.

Although these experiments are perfectly safe, planetary defenders remain fully cognizant of the taboo around merely discussing the use of nukes for any reason—even if that reason is potentially saving the world. “We're genuinely looking at this from the standpoint of ‘This is a technology that could save lives,'” King says.

Inevitably, Earth will be imperiled by a dangerous asteroid. And the hope is that when that day arrives, it can be dealt with using something other than a nuke. But comfort should be taken from the fact that scientists are researching this scenario, just in case it's our only protection against the firmament. “We are your taxpayer dollars at work,” says Burkey. 

There's still some way to go before they can be near certain that this asteroid-stopping technique will succeed. Their progress, though, belongs to everyone. “Ultimately,” says Moore, “we all win if we solve this problem.”

Elon Musk may have run tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast.

Tech buzzwords are clanging through the halls of Washington, DC. The Trump administration has promised to “leverage blockchain technology” to reorganize the US Agency for International Development, and Elon Musk's DOGE has already unleashed an internal chatbot to automate agency tasks—with bigger plans on the horizon to take over for laid-off employees. The executive order that created DOGE in the first place claims the agency intends to “modernize Federal technology and software.” But jamming hyped-up tech into government workflows isn't a formula for efficiency. Successful, safe civic tech requires a human-centered approach that understands and respects the needs of citizens. Unfortunately, this administration laid off all the federal workers with the know-how for that—seasoned design and technology professionals, many of whom left careers in the private sector to serve their government and compatriots.

What's going on now is not unconventional swashbuckling—it's wild incompetence. Musk may have run plenty of tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast. If this administration doesn't change its approach soon, American citizens are going to suffer far more than they probably realize.

Many may wince remembering the rollout of Healthcare.gov under the Obama administration. Following passage of the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.gov launched in October of 2013 to facilitate the anticipated wave of insurance signups. But enormous demand famously took down the website two hours after launch. On that first day, only six people were able to complete the registration process. In the wake of the mess, the administration formed the US Digital Service (USDS) and 18F, the digital services office of the General Services Administration. These agencies—the ones now dismantled at the hands of DOGE—pulled experienced technologists from industry to improve critical infrastructure across the federal government, including the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs. 

Over the last decade, USDS and 18F have worked to build safe, accessible, and secure infrastructure for the people of the United States. DirectFile, the free digital tax filing system that the IRS launched last year, emerged from years of careful research, design, and engineering and a thoughtful, multi-staged release. As a result, 90% of people who used DirectFile and responded to a survey said their experience was excellent or above average, and 86% reported that DirectFile increased their trust in the IRS. Recently, Sam Corcos, a DOGE engineer, told IRS employees he plans to kill the program. When 21 experienced technologists quit their jobs at USDS in January after their colleagues were let go, they weren't objecting on political grounds. Rather, they preferred to quit rather than “compromise core government services” under DOGE, whose orders are incompatible with USDS's original mission.

As DOGE bulldozes through technological systems, firewalls between government agencies are collapsing and the floodgates are open for data-sharing disasters that will affect everyone. For example, the decision to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to IRS data and to databases of unaccompanied minors creates immediate dangers for immigrants, regardless of their legal status. And it threatens everyone else, albeit perhaps less imminently, as every American's Social Security number, tax returns, benefits, and health-care records are agglomerated into one massive, poorly secured data pool. 

That's not just speculation. We've already seen how data breaches at companies like Equifax can expose the sensitive information of hundreds of millions of people. Now imagine those same risks with all your government data, managed by a small crew of DOGE workers without a hint of institutional knowledge between them. 

Making data sets speak to each other is one of the most difficult technological challenges out there. Anyone who has ever had to migrate from one CRM system to another knows how easy it is to lose data in the process. Centralization of data is on the administration's agenda—and will more than likely involve the help of contracting tech companies. Giants like Palantir have built entire business models around integrating government data for surveillance, and they stand to profit enormously from DOGE's dismantling of privacy protections. This is the playbook: Gut public infrastructure, pay private companies millions to rebuild it, and then grant those companies unprecedented access to our data. 

DOGE is also coming for COBOL, a programming language that the entire infrastructure of the Social Security Administration is built on. According to reporting by Wired, DOGE plans to rebuild that system from the ground up in mere months—even though the SSA itself estimated that a project like that would take five years. The difference in those timelines isn't due to efficiency or ingenuity; it's the audacity of naïveté and negligence. If something goes wrong, more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits will feel it where it hurts. Any delay in a Social Security payment can mean the difference between paying rent and facing eviction, affording medication or food and going without. 

There are so many alarms to ring about the actions of this administration, but the damage to essential technical infrastructure may be one of the effects with the longest tails. Once these systems are gutted and these firewalls are down, it could take years or even decades to put the pieces back together from a technical standpoint. And since the administration has laid off the in-house experts who did the important and meticulous work of truly modernizing government technology, who will be around to clean up the mess?  

Last month, an 83-year-old pastor in hospice care summoned her strength to sue this administration over its gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we can follow her example. Former federal tech workers have both the knowledge and the legal standing to challenge these reckless tech initiatives. And everyday Americans who rely on government services, which is all of us, have a stake in this fight. Support the lawyers challenging DOGE's tech takeover, document and report any failures you encounter in government systems, and demand that your representatives hold hearings on what's happening to our digital infrastructure. It may soon be too late.

Earth's meteorite collection just got called out for being a little biased—and what's more, a team of astronomers pinpointed exactly why that bias occurs.

Carbonaceous asteroids are all over our solar system, both in the main belt and closer to Earth. But very few of the carbon-rich rocks are actually found on Earth, comprising just 4% of the meteorites recovered on our planet's surface.

The astronomical team wanted to understand what causes the discrepancy. Their findings, published today in Nature Astronomy, indicate that carbon asteroids get obliterated by the Sun and Earth's atmosphere before they can make it to ground.

“We've long suspected weak, carbonaceous material doesn't survive atmospheric entry,” said Hadrien Devillepoix, a researcher at Australia's Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy and co-author of the paper, in a university release. “What this research shows is many of these meteoroids don't even make it that far: they break apart from being heated repeatedly as they pass close to the Sun.”

The team analyzed nearly 8,000 meteoroid impacts and 540 potential falls from 19 different observation networks around the globe to understand why carbonaceous asteroids are so rare on Earth.

Carbonaceous meteorites on Earth give scientists the unique opportunity to study some of the oldest material in our solar system. But researchers also recover carbon-rich asteroid material from space; Japan's Hayabusa2 mission and NASA's OSIRIS-REx both plucked rocky material from distant asteroids and brought those samples to Earth, where they can be investigated to a fuller extent than remote observations allow.

“Carbon-rich meteorites are some of the most chemically primitive materials we can study—they contain water, organic molecules and even amino acids,” said Patrick Shober, a researcher at the Paris Observatory and co-author of the paper, in the same release.

“However, we have so few of them in our meteorite collections that we risk having an incomplete picture of what's actually out there in space and how the building blocks of life arrived on Earth,” Shober added.

The team found that meteoroids created by tidal disruption events—when asteroids swing by planets closely enough to be broken apart by the planet's forces—are particularly fragile, and survive atmospheric entry less than other types of asteroids.

Only the hardy carbon-rich asteroids make it to Earth, after surviving the Sun's heat and the fiery burnup that occurs when entering Earth's atmosphere. If astronomers want to get a proper assessment of the diversity of carbon-rich rocks, they'll have to consider those that couldn't survive the journey to Earth.

Ankylosaurs, a group of dinosaurs often compared to Pokémon, were built like walking tanks, with bony armor plating their backs and sides. They lived during the Late Jurassic (164 to 145 million years ago) and Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) periods, and consisted of two main subgroups: the nodosaurids, which lacked tail clubs and typically had four toes on both hands and feet; and the ankylosaurids, which had distinctive clubbed tails and usually three toes on their hind feet. While paleontologists have unearthed four-toed ankylosaur footprints throughout North America, three-toed ones have remained elusive—until now.

An international team of researchers has identified the first ankylosaurid footprints known to science. The 100-million-year-old fossilized footprints, discovered in Canada's Peace Region (spanning the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta), represent a new ankylosaurid species, which the team named Ruopodosaurus clava. The discovery also fills in a notorious gap in North America's fossil records from the middle of the Cretaceous period.

“While we don't know exactly what the dinosaur that made Ruopodosaurus footprints looked like, we know that it would have been about 5-6 metres long [16 to over 19 feet long], spiky and armoured, and with a stiff tail or a full tail club,” Victoria Arbour, the curator of paleontology at the Royal BC (British Columbia) Museum, said in a Taylor & Francis Group statement. Arbour and her colleagues' work is detailed in a study published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, which is published by Taylor & Francis Group.

Ruopodosaurus clava means “the tumbled-down lizard with a club/mace,” according to the statement, honoring both the mountain terrain that preserved the footprints and the dinosaur's sledgehammer-like tail club.

The researchers dated the footprints to the middle of the Cretaceous period, sometime between 100 and 94 million years ago. This makes the footprints doubly exceptional—prior to their discovery, some scholars had suggested that ankylosaurids did not exist in North America during that time range, given the lack of fossil evidence. The newly discovered tracks fill in this gap in North America's fossil record, and also demonstrate that nodosaurids and ankylosaurids shared this region millions of years ago.

The investigation began when Charles Helm, a co-author of the study and a scientific advisor at Tumbler Ridge Museum, documented three-toed tracks around Tumbler Ridge, a municipality in the foothills of British Columbia's Canadian Rockies, which is also in the Peace Region.

“Ever since two young boys discovered an ankylosaur trackway close to Tumbler Ridge in the year 2000, ankylosaurs and Tumbler Ridge have been synonymous. It is really exciting to now know through this research that there are two types of ankylosaurs that called this region home, and that Ruopodosaurus has only been identified in this part of Canada,” said Helm.

“This study also highlights how important the Peace Region of northeastern BC is for understanding the evolution of dinosaurs in North America—there's still lots more to be discovered,” Arbour added.

By following in the footsteps of dinosaurs that walked the Earth tens of millions of years ago, the team secured a first-of-its-kind discovery, as well as one more piece of the ankylosaur fossil record puzzle.

If you want to avoid paying every month with Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office 2024 Home & Business is the way to go. StackSocial is currently offering a lifetime license for just $159, which is the absolute best deal in its history compared to its usual $249.

See at StackSocial

Unlike Microsoft 365, where you'll pay more over time due to its subscription model, Office 2024 is a one-time, upfront purchase that allows you lifetime access to fundamental tools like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. This makes it the best choice if you rather pay a single fee and avoid ongoing fees.

Microsoft Office 2024 is the most suitable alternative to Microsoft 365. Although Microsoft 365 offers frequent updates and cloud services like OneDrive and Teams, it is rather pricey (typically $69.99 per year) for Personal subscriptions and even more for Business plans. Office 2024 includes all the latest updates in one package and does not require additional payments.

Office 2024 Home & Business is filled with features appropriate for both personal and business use: It builds on the success of Office 2021 with major improvements in performance, looks and functionality. Excel users will welcome its more intelligent handling of large datasets, PowerPoint can now record presentations with audio and live video feeds and Word introduces Focus Mode to eliminate distractions while composing, along with AI-powered Smart Compose to easily fill in sentences or generate ideas.

The new user interface of the suite is based on Fluent Design principles and provides a harmonious and beautiful experience for every application. Redesign makes navigation easier and reduces the learning curve for new users while expanding touch and pen support for tablets. In addition, customizable themes and templates provide an easy way to create professional documents, presentations, and spreadsheets without deep design expertise.

What's great is that Microsoft Office 2024 can be used offline: Unlike Microsoft 365, which is dependent on cloud services, Office 2024 will work completely offline after it has been installed. This is great for those who like to keep files locally or who need to have secure access to their applications without internet. While it does not have cloud storage and co-authoring applications like Teams, the suite compensates with extensive co-authoring capabilities that enable multiple users to edit the same document in real time.

For those concerned with future updates, know that Office 2024 does not receive new features after purchase—security patches and bug fixes, yes. But this is not a drawback when considering that Office 2024 already includes all the newest tools from Microsoft's productivity set (including Copilot's AI). With Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote all current in this release, there is little to need additional upgrades.

For only $159, this lifetime license is the ultimate value if you're a Mac or PC user looking to be as productive as possible at a reasonable price point. For business or individual projects, Microsoft Office 2024 delivers everything you need in one convenient package. With StackSocial‘s standing as an expert on software deals, now is the perfect time to grab this offer before prices go back to normal.

AirTags have been a godsend for those who have a habit of misplacing their belongings: Whether it's your keys, wallet, bag or luggage (or even your pet's collar), these small Bluetooth trackers offer a simple and effective solution to keep track of your belongings.

Amazon is now offering great discounts on the single AirTag unit and the 4-pack set which it an excellent time to pick up this handy device. Though these prices aren't all-time lows, they're near enough to low to make this offer very attractive—especially with word on the street that tariffs might double the price of electronics any time soon. The individual AirTag is now just $24 (orig. $29), and the 4-pack bundle can be had for $79 (orig. $99). Both options are Top 5 bestsellers in Amazon's Electronics category right now.

The AirTag is a tiny attachment that makes finding lost items simple: It's very simple to set up—just tap it to your iPhone or iPad, assign the AirTag a name for what you're using it for (such as “Keys” or “Backpack”) and you're ready to go. When linked to your Apple ID, the AirTag cooperates with the Find My app to display its location on a map in real time. If the item is nearby but not in sight, you can use Precision Finding on recent iPhones that have Ultra Wideband technology for a very precise location with on-screen directions and sound. Or you can have the AirTag play a sound from its built-in speaker to locate it in seconds.

One of the unique features of the AirTag is that it is able to leverage Apple's vast Find My network which is composed of hundreds of millions of devices across the globe. When you misplace something outside the home (at a hotel or airport, for example), the AirTag can transmit its location anonymously through nearby Apple devices and back to you via iCloud. This feature makes your items trackable even when they're out of Bluetooth range.

Obviously, privacy and security are also important aspects of the AirTag design: The device uses encrypted communication to protect your data and prevent unwanted tracking. Moreover, if someone attempts to use an AirTag to track you against your will, your iPhone will detect and alert you if there are any unfamiliar trackers nearby.

As fears mount over imminent tariff hikes that would essentially see electronics prices go through the roof, it's a great time to take advantage of Amazon's discounts. Purchasing AirTags today will ensure that you are not caught off guard by rising costs in the near future.

We're a good third of the way into 2025 and with it comes a bunch of opportunities to save on a variety of electronics and personal devices. Last year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and right now you can get them for as low as $125. These noise-cancelling earbuds are normally priced at $250, but after a trade in, you can get a credit of up to $120. That's a 50% discount just for handing over your old earbuds you weren't going to use anymore anyway. If you don't have an old pair to trade-in, you can still enjoy a $40 discount for a limited time. Choose between either white or silver as both options are available with the trade-in deal and standard discount.

See at Samsung

The Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed to be Samsung's most comfortable in-ear headphones yet so they can stay in all-day comfortably for an immersive listening experience. The Buds3 Pro each come with it's charging case and charging USB-C cable as well as three sets of ear tips of various sizes so you can mold them to your ears perfectly.

Adaptive active noise cancellation means the earbuds can change modes on their own automatically based on your surroundings. This allows you to stay alert to what's around you while still not being distracted by ambient sounds as you're listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks on the go. The adaptive equalizer can even tell how you are wearing them and tailor-fit the sound you hear to your ears. You can even pair them with your TV to experience full 360-degree immersive sound that feels like its coming from all around you.

With Galaxy AI, you can have conversations across the language barrier, face-to-face, in real time. This is the kind of ability joked about by Douglas Adams with the babel fish in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of novels. But now it's really coming I guess. They say “Hola,” and you'll hear “Hello,” in your ear.

Touch controls make it easy to pause, skip, accept calls and more without needing to remove your phone from your pocket.

The trade-in will bring the price of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro to as low as $125. By trading in your old pair of earbuds, you can save up to $125 on your new Galaxy Buds3. Samsung is accepting a wide array of in-ear headphones are part of the offer. If you hand over a set of Galaxy Buds2 Pro, you'll receive the full $125 credit. A standard pair of Galaxy Buds or will net you $100 as will the original Galaxy Buds Pro. Samsung is also accepting Apple AirPods. Trade in the AirPods 3 or the AirPods Pro or Pro 2 and you'll get you the full $125 credit. Even if you just gave some off-brand set of wireless or wired headphones, you can still save between $10 and $30.

And if you don't have a pair to trade in, you can still save $40 getting the Buds 3 Pro for just $210.

Another attempt to breach the CUDA moat.

The first traces of Moore Threads' GPU programming software stack, dubbed MUSA, have surfaced online, furthering the nation's pursuit of tech-autarky. MUSA serves as an alternative to Nvidia's CUDA environment, compatible with the domestic MUSA MTT GPU lineup. Any open-source pedigree of the SDK has not been mentioned, so it is likely proprietary and won't be of much benefit to developers outside China.

The U.S. has implemented a series of export restrictions on China, including: advanced AI chips, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), manufacturing equipment, and silicon wafers from leading players like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. In a bid to reduce reliance on Western hardware, China is hard at work developing its semiconductor ecosystem with in-house silicon, fab equipment, memory, CPUs, and even GPUs. The latter is of great importance, as modern-day machine learning (sometimes under the buzzword banner of AI) is largely accelerated by parallel computing, something which GPUs excel at.

A strong GPU programming ecosystem offers high-level abstraction, ready-to-use libraries, documentation, and profiling tools. With high-performance Nvidia GPU exports still in limbo, Moore Threads is offering an alternative to CUDA.

MUSA provides a built-in compiler (MCC), runtime libraries (MUSA Runtime), a comprehensive list of specialized libraries (MUSA-X), debuggers, and profilers. To ensure compatibility with already written CUDA code, the MUSA SDK also includes Musify, a tool that translates CUDA code for the MUSA environment, likely by translating PTX code at runtime, similar to zLUDA.



The MUSA SDK version 4.0.1 is compatible with x86 processors from Intel (on Ubuntu) and Hygon (on Kylin). Moore Threads is demonstrating the prowess of its stack through several demonstrations on its website, including speech synthesis, AI-image generation, image processing, AI-powered 3D face modeling, just to name a few. You can actually try out a bunch of these demos right now (though you might need an account), some of which are reportedly running on Moore Threads' MTT S3000 datacenter GPUs.

Despite CUDA's clear advantage in terms of advancement, maturity, and support, MUSA could find many indigenous customers in small-scale environments, evolving over time. AI developers and researchers envision a heterogeneous future, championing the adoption of hardware-agnostic and open-source platforms. Breaking free from CUDA's reign requires superior alternatives, with ROCm being a key contender. However, AMD's hardware support still trails behind Nvidia.

GPU prices have shot up again, pushing many toward the used card market.

Should you buy a used graphics card? After dealing with cryptomining-induced GPU shortages two generations back, the prior generation graphics cards were reasonably available for the past couple of years... and then AI-induced shortages hit, retail availability became a problem, and GPU prices shot up. Finding one of the best graphics cards has become a difficult proposition, at least for certain models, leading many to consider the used graphics card market.The good news for prior generation GPUs — the Nvidia RTX 40-series, AMD RX 7000-series, and Intel Arc A-series — is that cryptomining hasn't really been profitable for the past 2–3 years. That means any used cards likely haven't been running 24/7 at 100% load for months on end. That doesn't mean all cards have been treated equally well, but if you're careful about how you proceed, a used graphics card isn't necessarily a bad idea.The bad news is that prices on used graphics cards — using eBay sold listings as a proxy — are likely also far higher than many will be willing to pay. The GPU shortages have caused most previous generation GPUs to increase substantially in price over the past several months. For example, here's a chart showing sold listings for Nvidia's RTX 4070 over the past six months:



There's a massive dip in the first part of December, perhaps caused by people selling off used cards with plans to pick up something faster in the next month. The number of individual sales jumped to as many as 60 cards per day, and prices dropped to as little as $200. Things then returned to a relative ""normal"" of around $500 until the end of January, after which the shortages at the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 launch seemed to clue people in on how limited supplies might get. Since the start of February, the average price for a used RTX 4070 sold on eBay has increased to over $600.Things are starting to calm down, at least a bit, and the newer RTX 5070 has been routinely available (in the U.S.) for $550–$600 over the past few weeks. At that price, there's no reason to consider paying a similar sum for a used 4070. The RTX 5070 might not be a massive generational upgrade, but in our testing it's 18% faster than its predecessor at 1440p ultra. But I digress — check our GPU benchmarks hierarchy if you want more details on how the various current and prior generation GPUs stack up.The question we want to answer is, even if you can buy a used card, should you? Here are the things you should know when you're considering buying a used graphics card.



The first step in looking for a graphics card is to set your budget. Once you decide how much you're willing to spend, you can then start looking for a graphics card — new or used! — that falls in the appropriate range. You should also set realistic performance expectations.

Once upon a time, in the days of yore, gamers might see up to double the performance for roughly the same price when upgrading to a two generation newer card. Again, our GPU benchmarks article gives the important details (check the second page for a more extensive older test suite where we benchmarked almost every GPU of the past decade). That's no longer the case, with perhaps a 25~35 percent improvement per generation if we're lucky.

You should also think about the rest of your PC. If you're still using a 4-core Haswell-era CPU from 2014, running Windows 10, it's probably time to look at a full system upgrade. Windows 10 support will end October 2025, and you basically need a CPU and motherboard built after 2017 (give or take) to be able to run Windows 11. Yes, there are Windows 11 installation workarounds, but do you really want to go that route? That's your call.

Generally speaking, you want to keep your PC build balanced. If you don't have a top-end CPU, there's not much point in buying a GPU like the RTX 5090 or even RTX 4090. You can check our CPU vs GPU performance to see the impact of using various combinations of graphics cards and processors, and the games you play will also be a factor.

To help put the used graphics card market into perspective, here are the eBay average prices for sold listing from the past 30 days (March 12 through April 11, 2025). This is U.S. market data, and what you can find in other regions of the world can and will vary from what we're showing. It's also possible to get something quite a bit below the average price if you're patient.

The point isn't that eBay prices are a perfect indication of the used GPU market, but that they are an indicator. If U.S. eBay prices are trending up, we expect other regions to follow that pattern — not necessarily to the same extent, but trends don't happen in a vacuum.

For those looking for a used graphics card, start by checking the eBay prices versus retail prices and official MSRPs — even if the MSRPs often seem to have little to do with reality these days. It should hopefully be obvious, but if you're looking at eBay and the GPU you want typically costs more than a brand-new card from somewhere like Amazon or Newegg, you shouldn't buy from eBay. Just get the new card.In a similar vein, prior generation GPUs are going to be difficult to find at most retail stores, which means buying used is basically required. Most listings at places like Amazon for prior generation GPUs are from third party ""marketplace"" sellers. While some are legitimate, you'll want to exercise caution and pay attention to item descriptions and return policies — the same rules we apply toward buying used cards off eBay, in other words.Not surprisingly, the best values right now are mostly on budget to midrange cards from one or two generations back. Intel's Arc B570 is the highest ranked current-generation card, but keep in mind that performance is only slightly better than an RTX 3060 12GB, and slightly worse than an RTX 4060. But at least it can't be any more than a few months old.



Once you find a reasonable deal on a used graphics card, the next step is to consider the source. If a friend of family member offers to sell you a used card at a price you're willing to pay, great! Outside of that scenario, however, there's often no way to tell where a graphics card has been or what it's been doing for the past few years.

When you're shopping online, at places like eBay, Facebook, etc., our advice is to assume the worst. Don't take any information the seller / lister provides at face value. Older GPUs (RTX 30-series, RX 6000-series) are almost guaranteed to have been used for mining, and that can lead to VRM issues, memory instability, or other potential problems. We'd also be wary of ""like new,"" ""open box,"" or even ""factory sealed"" listings, as all can be faked.

Murphy's Law is in full effect here. If something could have been done with a GPU, it probably was. But that doesn't mean a card can't be salvaged. Thermal pads and thermal paste can deteriorate over time, and dust can build up in the fan blades and heatsink fins. It's possible a bit of cleaning and TLC will make a card that was struggling run like new. You might want to factor in the cost of new pads and even new fans, as well as the time required to clean a card.

Alternatively, if you can meet up in person for a purchase — or better yet, get someone to bring the card to you so you can test it — you can tell a lot about a card just by looking at it. Check for dust, and check to see if the screws holding the card together have been removed. (Those ""warranty void"" stickers do actually have some benefit.) If someone has a card in hand and it looks clean, especially in the nooks and crevices, there's a good chance it wasn't seriously abused. Obviously, this doesn't apply to eBay, and it's a potential advantage of places like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.



As with any product, age can make a big difference. We're not dealing with antiques or fine wines, where older means better. It's more like buying a used car. If a GPU is only a year old, even if it was driven hard, it should still have a warranty and is less likely to have serious problems. Purchasing an ancient ""high mileage"" graphics card on the other hand could just be asking for trouble.

If you find a reasonable deal on an RTX 40-series or RX 7000-series, worst-case, it's a couple of years old and probably wasn't used for mining, as Ethereum mining stopped being viable in mid-2022 (prior to when those GPUs launched). An RTX 30-series or earlier, or RX 6000-series or earlier, is an entirely different matter. Such cards likely went through the 2021–2022 mining heyday, and even older GPUs might have also been used for mining in 2017. 24/7 mining puts a lot of wear and tear on a card, and five-year-old hardware is simply more prone to problems than newer parts.

Conversely, an RTX 50-series, RX 9000-series, or Arc B-series used graphics card can't possibly be from before early 2025 (or December 2024 for the Arc B580), which means it should be totally fine right now. Unless it's a scam listing (see blow).

In short, buying a used GPU that's from the latest generation tends to be safer than buying a previous top-tier GPU from several years back. You could get lucky with a pristine GTX 1080 Ti, or you could end up with a 1080 Ti on its last legs, with VRMs or other components on the board that are starting to go bad. Plan accordingly.

Also, if you're digging deep in the bargain bins, do note that AMD has officially retired all RX Vega / RX 500 and earlier GPUs. Only the RDNA RX 5000-series and later cards still have active driver support. Nvidia has also retired driver support for GTX 700-series and earlier GPUs.

With Windows 10 reach end of life later this year, you'll need Windows 11 drivers and that might prove difficult for older GPUs. Stick to cards with active driver support, unless you're specifically trying to build a retro-gaming PC.



Generally speaking, if you buy something off eBay, even if the seller says ""no returns accepted,"" you can still ask for a refund if the product doesn't work. But it's better to deal with someone that has a normal 30-day return policy. Our experience is that eBay also tends to be heavily biased toward buyers, incredibly so, to the point where selling anything you can't afford to lose on eBay feels risky.Related to this, we strongly recommend sticking with sellers from within your country of residence. While returning a faulty product to China might be possible, it takes a lot longer, and shipping will probably cost more. Plus, it might take a week or more to get to you in the first place, which isn't fun if you just want a working graphics card. (And opens up the potential for the return window to expire during transit, another common scam.)You should also look at the seller's history. Don't buy anything from a brand-new seller, particularly if the deal looks too good to be true — it probably is! Someone with hundreds or thousands of past transactions won't want to damage their reputation. Many graphics card companies also have eBay stores, which should be safer than other options.You should also ask several technical questions. ""Hey, I was wondering when you bought this graphics card and what sort of PC you used it in."" Ask why they're selling the card. Have them send you a photo or video of the card running an actual game — have them open Tom's Hardware to show the date as well. It's better to be an annoying buyer than to get duped.Pay attention to the description as well, looking for bogus ""box only"" or ""picture"" listings. For eBay, you can put a minus sign in front of terms you wish to exclude from your search results. We recommend using the following terms on any GPU searches:-image -img -jpg -jpeg -pic -picture -png -parts -drawn -digital -boxIf you're trying to sell your own graphics card, for eBay in particular we would simply cancel any and all orders from buyers that haven't been around for more than a year at least, preferably two or more, with numerous orders. Look for expensive items as well — it's easy for scammers to create an account and ""buy"" a bunch of cheap items to make the account look legit, and then switch to an expensive GPU like an RTX 5090 for $3,000 or more. Each scammer account only needs to succeed once.Also, be wary of anxious buyers: If they urge you to ""please ship fast"" it could mean they're using a bogus payment method and they want the package to ship before they get caught. ""I'm buying this for a friend/relative"" messages are also red flags in our book. Another common scam is to buy something and then say, ""Oops, I gave you the wrong address..."" and try to get you to change shipping. Just cancel the order if someone says the address was wrong.Regardless of account age or communications, you should also punch the ship to address into Google Maps and look it up. It's difficult / impossible to determine if a house might simply be an Airbnb or VRBO rental (another scam tactic), but we know of someone that shipped a product to what turned out to be a storage unit. The buyer claimed the product ""was not as advertised"" and the seller ended up taking the hit.

Once you've purchased a used graphics card, there's one last critical step to take once the card arrives: Test it, ASAP! Our graphics card reviews and benchmarks can give you some idea of what to expect in terms of performance, assuming you have a similarly fast CPU and system, but stability is just as important as speed for a used part.We recommend breaking out some strenuous benchmarks once you get the card, to verify it works properly. 3DMark might suffice, but it's most useful if you have a paid version where you can tell it to loop a test sequence 50 times. FurMark is a good torture test, but any demanding 3D game can suffice. You'll want to have some other utilities running to check GPU temperatures, fan speeds, and power use. In fact, we have a whole article on how to test your graphics card.The point is that you want to throw some serious work at the GPU to ensure it runs properly. If it doesn't, the sooner you can ask for a refund and return the card, the better. You should also check clock speeds and memory speeds. If you're only seeing 1500MHz while gaming on an RTX 4070, or your memory runs at a lower speed than it should, something is wrong. See our how to check your graphics card temperature for additional details.You should run HWInfo64, MSI Afterburner, or some other utility and log the results, then check for a large decline in clocks accompanied by a fast ramp in temperatures. It's not unusual to see 60–80 degrees Celsius on many GPUs, but anything above 80C tends to be worrisome.If you do manage to buy an RTX 50-series GPU, check the ROPS count as well. A few early batches of RTX 5090, 5080, and even 5070 cards shipped with ""missing"" ROPS (Render Outputs), which can drop performance by 5–10 percent. If you get a good price, maybe that's okay, but don't pay full dollar for such a card.

If reading this has you worried that you'll spend a bunch of money on a used graphics card only to end up with a non-functional lemon, great: We've done our job. An ounce of prevention and all that. Or if you prefer, there's the old cliché about not spending more than you can afford to lose. The majority of sellers — on eBay, Facebook, etc. — are probably just regular people who aren't trying to scam you, but there are plenty of horror stories out there.Dealing with a local seller can offer you more peace of mind, but once you pay cash and the seller walks off, you're basically stuck with whatever you bought. eBay and auction sites aren't necessarily great either, but eBay tends to side with buyers far more often than sellers. Shop from an established eBay seller with a long history (years of activity) and good feedback, and you probably (hopefully) won't get burned.Given the choice between buying a new graphics card for MSRP and saving a bit of money by going with a previous generation card that might perform a bit worse, we'd almost invariably advise PC gamers to suck it up and spend the extra money on a new card. It's simply so much safer and less likely to cause problems. But if money is short or you've stumbled on a particularly compelling deal, there are perhaps worse things you could do than buying a used graphics card.

Georgia Tech scientists reckon advance could mean BCIs become more important in everyday life.

Researchers from Georgia Tech have developed a tiny, minimally invasive, brain-computer interface (BCI). The device is small enough to fit between hair follicles, and need only be inserted very slightly under the skin. It is thought that this super-compact new ""high fidelity"" sensor will make continuous everyday use of BCIs a more realistic possibility.

For many tech enthusiasts and futurists, BCIs play a large role in the expected evolution of human interaction with tech. However, some of the most advanced BCI systems we know of today are pretty bulky and rigid. Look at Elon Musk's Neuralink implant technology, for example.

Hong Yeo, the Harris Saunders Jr. Professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, decided to do something about this bulky invasive issue - while maintaining optimum impedance and data quality.

""I started this research because my main goal is to develop new sensor technology to support healthcare and I had previous experience with brain-computer interfaces and flexible scalp electronics,"" explained Yeo. ""I knew we needed better BCI sensor technology and discovered that if we can slightly penetrate the skin and avoid hair by miniaturizing the sensor, we can dramatically increase the signal quality by getting closer to the source of the signals and reduce unwanted noise.""



The Georgia Tech blog also mentions that this tiny new sensor uses conductive polymer microneedles to capture electrical signals and conveys those signals along flexible polyimide/copper wires. In addition to this naturally flexible construction the implant device is less than a square millimeter.

The tiny new hi-fi BCI might have one major drawback for certain applications. It only has a useful life of approximately 12 hours. So, perhaps we should think of it as a disposable, occasional use device.

In Georgia Tech field tests, six subjects used the new device for controlling an augmented reality (AR) video call. They used the BCI to ""look up phone contacts and initiate and accept AR video calls hands-free."" It proved to be 96.4% accurate in recording and classifying neural signals. However, the high-fidelity neural signal capture persisted only for up to 12 hours. Georgia Tech researchers stressed that during the half day, subjects could stand, walk, and run – enjoy complete freedom of movement, with the implant in place.

Perhaps we shouldn't get too excited about the possibilities of BCIs unlocking super-human powers, though. Recent research suggested that human thought runs at a leisurely 10 bits per second, so we might also need a brain overclocking upgrade to make the most of an advanced BCI's potential...

 April 14, 2025  

Short-term adherence to a palatable elemental diet (PED) significantly improved symptoms and the gut microbiota in adults with microbiome-driven gastrointestinal disorders, according to a new study.

“Elemental diets have long shown promise for treating gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn's disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), and IMO (intestinal methanogen overgrowth), but poor palatability has limited their use,” lead author Ali Rezaie, MD, medical director of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Motility Program and director of Bioinformatics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

Elemental diets are specialized formulas tailored to meet an individual's specific nutritional needs and daily requirements for vitamins, minerals, fat, free amino acids, and carbohydrates.

In SIBO and IMO specifically, only about half the patients respond to antibiotics, and many require repeat treatments, which underscores the need for effective nonantibiotic alternatives, said Rezaie. “This is the first prospective trial using a PED, aiming to make this approach both viable and accessible for patients,” he noted.

In the study, which was recently published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Rezaie and colleagues enrolled 30 adults with IMO (40%), SIBO (20%), or both (40%). The mean participant age was 45 years, and 63% were women.

All participants completed 2 weeks of a PED, transitioned to 2-3 days of a bland diet, and then resumed their regular diets for 2 weeks.

The diet consisted of multiple 300-calorie packets, adjusted for individual caloric needs. Participants could consume additional packets for hunger but were prohibited from eating other foods. There was no restriction on water intake.

The primary endpoint was changes in stool microbiome after the PED and reintroduction of regular food. Secondary endpoints included lactose breath test normalization to determine bacterial overgrowth in the gut, symptom response, and adverse events.

Researchers collected 29 stool samples at baseline, 27 post-PED, and 27 at study conclusion (2 weeks post-diet).

Although the stool samples' alpha diversity decreased after the PED, the difference was not statistically significant at the end of the study. However, 30 bacterial families showed significant differences in relative abundance post-PED.

Daily symptom severity improved significantly during the second week of the diet compared with baseline, with reduction in abdominal discomfort, bloating, distention, constipation, and flatulence. Further significant improvements in measures such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, urgency, and brain fog were observed after reintroducing regular food.

“We observed 73% breath test normalization and 83% global symptom relief — with 100% adherence and tolerance to 2 weeks of exclusive PED,” Rezaie told Medscape Medical News. No serious adverse events occurred during the study, he added.

Lactose breath test normalization rates post-PED were 58% in patients with IMO, 100% in patients with SIBO, and 75% in those with both conditions.

The extent of patient response to PED was notable, given that 83% had failed prior treatments, Rezaie said.

“While we expected benefit based on palatability improvements and prior retrospective data, the rapid reduction in methane and hydrogen gas — and the sustained microbiome modulation even after reintroducing a regular diet — exceeded expectations,” he said. A significant reduction in visceral fat was another novel finding.

“This study reinforces the power of diet as a therapeutic tool,” Rezaie said, adding that the results show that elemental diets can be palatable, thereby improving patient adherence, tolerance, and, eventually, effectiveness. This is particularly valuable for patients with SIBO and IMO who do not tolerate or respond to antibiotics, prefer nonpharmacologic options, or experience recurrent symptoms after antibiotic treatment.

Study limitations included the lack of a placebo group with a sham diet, the short follow-up after reintroducing a regular diet, and the inability to assess microbial gene function.

However, the results support the safety, tolerance, and benefit of a PED in patients with IMO/SIBO. Personalized dietary interventions that support the growth of beneficial bacteria may be an effective approach to treating these disorders, Rezaie and colleagues noted in their publication.

Although the current study is a promising first step, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the durability of microbiome and symptom improvements, Rezaie said.

Elemental diets may help modulate the gut microbiome while reducing immune activation, making them attractive for microbiome-targeted gastrointestinal therapies, Jatin Roper, MD, a gastroenterologist at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.

“Antibiotics are only effective in half of SIBO cases and often require retreatment, so better therapies are needed,” said Roper, who was not affiliated with the study. He added that its findings confirmed the researchers' hypothesis that a PED can be both safe and effective in patients with SIBO.

Roper noted the 83% symptom improvement as the study's most unexpected and encouraging finding, as it represents a substantial improvement compared with standard antibiotic therapy. “It is also surprising that the tolerance rate of the elemental diet in this study was 100%,” he said.

However, diet palatability remains a major barrier in real-world practice.

“Adherence rates are likely to be far lower than in trials in which patients are closely monitored, and this challenge will not be easily overcome,” he added.

The study's limitations, including the lack of metagenomic analysis and a placebo group, are important to address in future research, Roper said. In particular, controlled trials of elemental diets are needed to determine whether microbiome changes are directly responsible for symptom improvement.

The study was supported in part by Good LFE and the John and Geraldine Cusenza Foundation. Rezaie disclosed serving as a consultant/speaker for Bausch Health and having equity in Dieta Health, Gemelli Biotech, and Good LFE. Roper had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Living alone and having both depression and anxiety was associated with a 558% increase in risk for suicide compared with living with others and without these conditions, a new population-based study showed.

“These findings highlight the importance of considering living arrangements in individuals with depression or anxiety, especially for specific demographic groups, such as middle-aged individuals and men, in suicide risk assessments. Targeted interventions addressing these factors together are crucial to mitigate risk,” the investigators wrote. 

The study was led by Daa Un Moon, MD, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. It was published online on March 26 in JAMA Network Open. 

The observational design prevented the establishment of causality among living arrangements, psychiatric conditions, and risk for suicide. Although living arrangements were assessed annually, researchers could not track dynamic changes during follow-up or assess the period of living alone between assessments. The group living together included diverse arrangements that may have had different associations with the risk for suicide. Psychosocial factors, including previous suicide attempts and stressful life events, were not included in the study. Additionally, reliance on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th Revision) codes for psychiatric conditions may have led to potential underreporting or misclassification due to the lack of systematic mental health assessments. Cultural and healthcare system–related differences in South Korea may have limited the generalizability of the findings to other populations.

This study was funded by grants through programs supported by the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology. The investigators reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Liver-related adverse drug reactions were nearly three times more common than kidney-related adverse drug reactions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using methotrexate; however, fatal outcomes were higher in patients with kidney-related adverse drug reactions than in those with liver-related adverse drug reactions and even worse in those with adverse drug reactions affecting both.

""Because drug management in patients with RA using MTX [methotrexate] is a complex matter, precise and standardised recommendations on when and how frequently renal function needs to be tested to detect early signs of renal impairment might be helpful to prevent fatal outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Kai Khoroshun, Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany. It was published online on April 05, 2025, in Arthritis Research & Therapy.

The search strategy in Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities may have influenced the distribution of kidney- and liver-related cases. The quality of spontaneous reports was another limitation. The prevalence, risk, or incidence could not be calculated as the total number of methotrexate users was inaccessible.

Despite improvements in outcomes at 3 years after hospitalisation for COVID-19, health problems remained prevalent, with self-reported fatigue and cognitive issues worsening significantly between years 2 and 3 post-discharge. Additionally, post-exertional malaise (PEM) affected nearly one third of patients at 3 years after discharge.

""Our findings highlight the urgent need for research into effective management strategies for long COVID, as well as the importance of ongoing monitoring of disease trajectory to better understand the long-term outcomes of COVID-19,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Julia C. Berentschot, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online on April 06, 2025, in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe.

This study lacked control groups of individuals without COVID-19 and those not hospitalised for COVID-19. The findings may not generalise to patients who were not hospitalised or those vaccinated before admission. Finally, this study relied heavily on patient-reported outcome measures, which could have introduced bias in estimating health problems.

Can long-term physical activity influence mortality and biological aging? Researchers at the University of Jyväskylä in Jyväskylä, Finland, set out to answer this question and uncovered a surprising finding: Moderate physical activity had the most significant positive effect on longevity, reducing mortality by 7% over a 30-year period.

Interestingly, higher levels of physical activity did not confer additional mortality benefits. The study was published in the European Journal of Epidemiology.

The study, led by Anna Kankaanpää, postdoctoral researcher at the Gerontology Research Center (GEREC) at the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä, examined 22,750 twins born before 1958. Data on leisure-time physical activity were collected from participants in 1975, 1981, and 1990, and mortality follow-up was conducted until 2020.

The researchers also investigated how physical activity influences biological aging, measured using epigenetic “clocks,” and its impact on existing risk for genetic disease.

Participants were divided into four groups based on their activity levels using a validated questionnaire that measured metabolic equivalents in h/d: Sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. Physical activity was assessed over a 15-year period, and mortality rates were evaluated after 30 years of follow-up.

For a subset of twins, blood samples were collected to assess biological aging using epigenetic “clocks” based on changes in DNA methylation. Genetic data were available for 4897 twins.

The World Health Organization recommends 150-300 minutes of moderate or 75-150 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. The researchers used these recommendations to investigate their effects on mortality and the risk for genetic diseases.

However, adherence to these recommendations does not reduce mortality or alter the risk for genetic disease. Among twin pairs in which one twin followed the guidelines for 15 years and the other did not, there was no significant difference in mortality.

The researchers suggested that potential biases in observational studies may have led to a positive association between physical activity and mortality risk. Despite accounting for various potential confounding factors and the long follow-up period, this study did not confirm this association.

“In our studies, we aimed to account for various sources of biases, and combined with the long follow-up period, we could not confirm that adhering to physical activity guidelines mitigates genetic cardiovascular disease risk or causally reduces mortal,” said study co-author Laura Joensuu, postdoctoral researcher at GEREC, in a press release.

In a subset of twins who provided blood samples, the researchers observed a U-shaped relationship between leisure-time physical activity and biological aging. Both the sedentary and highly active groups were biologically older than the moderately active group.

Even after adjusting for various lifestyle factors, the highly active group was, on average, 1.2 years biologically older than the moderately active group and 1.6 years older than the active group.

“Biological aging was accelerated in those who exercised the least and the most,” said the study's corresponding author Elina Sillanpää, professor at GEREC.

As the researchers could not establish a significant link between long-term physical activity and slower biological aging, they concluded that biological age may not directly influence the relationship between physical activity and reduced mortality.

The researchers acknowledged the limitations of observational data, which are likely to be biased by various lifestyle factors, such as smoking or alcohol consumption.

“An underlying pre-disease state can limit physical activity and ultimately lead to death, not the lack of exercise itself,” said Sillanpää. This could distort the short-term association between physical activity and mortality.

These findings indicate that the relationship between physical activity and overall mortality is influenced by multiple interacting factors. The apparent association between leisure-time physical activity and lower mortality may reflect the participants' overall good health and lifestyle.

The researchers speculated that an overall healthy lifestyle may have a more positive effect on biological age than the maintenance of high levels of physical activity alone.

 April 14, 2025  

A new systematic review and network meta-analysis showed few differences in the cardiovascular (CV) effects of stimulants and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Short-term use of amphetamines, atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and viloxazine was associated with small increases in blood pressure (BP), pulse, or both in children, adolescents, and adults.

Further, the effects of stimulants, including amphetamines, lisdexamfetamine, or methylphenidate, were not significantly different from those of atomoxetine or viloxazine in the study groups.

In contrast, the alpha-2a agonist guanfacine lowered BP and pulse in both groups compared with placebo.

“Our findings stress the need to follow current recommendations to measure blood pressure and pulse at baseline and follow-up,” lead author Samuele Cortese, MD, PhD, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry, University of Southampton, Southampton, England, told Medscape Medical News. “They also show that overall cardiovascular effects are small for the majority of patients.”

“Alongside evidence from other trials and observational studies, this suggests that the benefit-risk ratio is in favor of benefit for ADHD medication for the majority of patients,” he added.

The study was published online on April 6 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have linked stimulants and atomoxetine to increases in BP and pulse.

These studies generally focused on a single medication or a limited number of CV outcomes, Cortese noted. “Ours is the first to provide comparative evidence on the effects of medications for ADHD on a broad range of cardiovascular parameters.”

The network meta-analysis included 102 RCTs with at least 12 weeks of follow-up (median, 7 weeks) involving 13,315 children and adolescents (mean age, 11 years; 73% men) and 9387 adults (mean age, 35 years; 57% men) with a primary diagnosis of ADHD treated with amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, or viloxazine. Three fourths of all participants were White.

Compared with placebo, the average increase in systolic BP was 1.07 mm Hg with atomoxetine for pediatric patients (95% CI, 0.36-1.79) and 2.25 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.84-3.67) for adults. Increases with methylphenidate averaged 1.81 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.05-2.57) and 1.66 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.38-2.93), respectively.

In adults, systolic BP increased on average with amphetamines 2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.66-3.94) and 3.72 mm Hg with bupropion (95% CI, 0.05-7.4), but the certainty of evidence was very low. Lisdexamfetamine increased systolic BP in children and adolescents only by 1.76 (95% CI, 0.68-2.83).

Mean increases in diastolic BP (mm Hg) in pediatric and adult patients were

Viloxazine also increased short-term diastolic BP in children and adolescents by a mean of 2.15 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.92-3.39).

There were no statistically significant pairwise differences between medications in terms of increases in systolic or diastolic BP in either age group.

Compared with placebo, guanfacine lowered systolic BP by 2.83 mm Hg in pediatric patients (95% CI, −3.8 to −1.85) and by 10.10 mm Hg in adults (−13.76 to −6.44); and diastolic BP by 2.08 mm Hg (95% CI, −3 to −1.17) and 7.73 mm Hg (−11.88 to −3.58), respectively.

Significant increases in pulse (beats/min) were observed over placebo for pediatric and adult patients taking atomoxetine (mean, 5.58 and 5.44), lisdexamfetamine (mean, 4.17 and 5.07), methylphenidate (mean, 3.88 and 4.37), and viloxazine (mean, 2.79 and 5.8), respectively.

Additionally, amphetamines and bupropion increased pulse in adults compared with placebo, and atomoxetine increased pulse compared with both methylphenidate and viloxazine in children and adolescents.

Guanfacine lowered pulse on average 4.06 beats/min for pediatric patients and 6.83 beats/min for adults compared with placebo.

Fewer data were available for ECG parameters but showed amphetamines were associated with decreased PR interval in children and adolescents; atomoxetine decreased PR interval in both age groups; lisdexamfetamine increased QRS complex in children and adolescents; methylphenidate decreased QRS complex in children and adolescents and increased QRS in adults; and viloxazine decreased PR interval in both age groups and decreased QRS complex in children and adolescents.

The findings should not be taken as definitive but rather call for more consistent reporting of ECG parameters in ADHD RCTs, the authors said.

The data in the RCTs are group averages and, “as such, provide an overall indication about the cardiovascular effects but are not applicable to the individual patient,” Cortese said.

Pliszka, professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, said the changes in BP and pulse were small and in line with other studies showing mean increases of 5 mm Hg for BP and 5 beats/min for pulse.

“Generally, such increases will not place the patient outside the healthy range,” he wrote.

He also pointed out that the changes represent mean effects and that some patients' BP or pulse might spike to borderline abnormal levels. “Such patients should be transitioned to another ADHD medication,” he added.

Pliszka noted that the small changes in PR and QRS interval should not raise concern and that ECGs before ADHD treatment should only be done if the patient has specific CV risk factors, consistent with current guidelines.

Pliszka and the investigators said the meta-analysis cannot shed light on longer-term outcomes and called for further research, such as machine learning analyses of large databases, to help predict which patients with ADHD are most at risk for CV disease.

“In summary, when using ADHD medications, clinicians should be vigilant about side effects but not avoid their use,” Pliszka said.

The limited number of racial/ethnic minorities, women, and older adults in the RCTs is an important limitation of the meta-analysis, Cortese told Medscape Medical News. Indeed, a previous analysis by the group showed that more than 40% of ADHD medication RCTs did not include data on race/ethnicity in their published report, even though reporting improved over time.

Additionally, because CV outcomes and risks are generally different across men and women over the lifespan, greater representation of women in ADHD trials is also important for a more comprehensive understanding, first author Luis Carlos Farhat, PhD, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). Cortese was funded by the NIHR for this project and reported additional NIHR grants and a grant from the European Research Executive Agency. Farhat was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation. Pliszka reported no relevant financial disclosures.

Cephalexin administered twice vs four times daily showed comparable treatment failure rates for urinary tract infections (UTIs) diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), potentially offering a more convenient option without compromising effectiveness, a new study showed.

""These findings suggest cephalexin dosed twice daily may be a reasonable option for the outpatient management of UTIs diagnosed in the ED, thus increasing adherence and decreasing cost without statistically compromising effectiveness,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Abigail Rath, PharmD, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina. It was published online on March 24, 2025, in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

This retrospective, single-center study had several limitations, including reliance on electronic medical record documentation, a manual chart review for follow-up visits, a small sample size, and the inability to confirm medication adherence. Some patients who sought care elsewhere may have been lost to follow-up. Additionally, microbiological failure was not assessed.

Adam DuVall, MD, MPH, is a rare medical oncologist who trained in both adult and pediatric hematology/oncology.

This distinction, which DuVall said he shares with only a handful of oncologists in the world, matches his role at University of Chicago (UChicago) Medicine, Chicago. Since joining UChicago in 2020, DuVall has helped expand its Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology Program, which aims to provide comprehensive, one-stop care and support for patients with cancer aged from 15 to 39 years.

Started in 2012, the program is one of the oldest in a growing array of initiatives nationwide that seek to address the specific psychosocial and other support needs of patients with cancer who fall into the gap between young children and the older patients who more typically have cancer. Along with DuVall and other oncologists, UChicago's AYA Program offers dedicated nurse practitioners, social workers, psychologists, a physical therapist, and a program administrator. A community health worker, who does home visits, helps patients coordinate travel, works with their insurance, and generally navigates the medical system, DuVall added.

The program receives about 1500-2000 visits a year, according to DuVall. What the young adult population with cancer has in common that distinguishes it from other age cohorts, he said, are its members' particular psychosocial needs. “Going through adolescence and young adulthood without cancer, there's plenty of things that are hard,” DuVall observed. “Put cancer on top of that, and it impacts every aspect of life.”

The proliferation of AYA programs comes as more and more studies have been published recently showing that young adults are increasingly getting cancer.

According to American Cancer Society research published in December in The Lancet Oncology, incidence rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) among young adults aged 25-49 years rose in the decade through 2017 in more than half of the 50 countries and territories examined. For the past 5 years studied, the incidence rate of early-onset CRC was highest in Australia, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, the United States, and South Korea. At the same time, the study found, rates among older adults in all of those places except South Korea were stable or declining.

Hyuna Sung, PhD, the study's lead author, said, “Research has shown that Gen X and millennials have higher risk of multiple types of cancer compared to the older generations.”

Some of the cancers found to be increasing among younger adults are linked to “excess body obesity,” Sung said, including not only CRC but also cancers of the uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, pancreas, breast, and stomach cardia, as well as myeloma. Early onset of cancers not linked to obesity, such as testicular cancer and small intestinal cancer, has also been shown to be on the rise, Sung noted.

As cancer rates among young adults have risen, nonprofits have stepped in to help medical institutions open programs geared to their needs. Teen Cancer America, founded by members of rock band The Who, has partnered with 64 hospitals in 36 cities to develop AYA-focused programs, funding 85 hospital positions, according to a spokesperson. The Los Angeles–based nonprofit has also provided free consultation to 130 hospitals without formally providing a grant, the spokesperson said.

A map on Teen Cancer America's website illustrates the nationwide spread of AYA programs, from UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, with more in between.

Michael Roth, MD, co-director of the AYA Program at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, likes to say, “If you've seen one AYA Program, you've seen one AYA Program.”

In other words, offerings vary. “Most centers do not have comprehensive AYA programs,” Roth said, noting that at many sites the AYA Program might consist of oncofertility support. “That said, programs are doing the best they can, knowing that the AYA population is growing exponentially globally.”

Almost 90,000 AYA patients are diagnosed with cancer each year, and 85% will be at least 5-year survivors, Roth said. There are more than 2 million survivors of AYA cancer, he added, and if the median age of diagnosis is 30, they can live five decades beyond their cancer treatment. “Their life matters,” Roth said. “It matters during treatment. Their life after cancer matters.”

The AYA Program at MD Anderson began in 2017, and it sees more than 2000 AYAs diagnosed with cancer every year, according to Roth. The program is designed to complement the care that patients with cancer aged from 15 to 39 years or older may already be receiving from their primary treatment teams. New patients see a medical provider, a social worker, and a vocational counselor for discussions about their needs and concerns, and they have access to a nutritionist and genetic counselor.

The program offers psychosocial and supportive care for patients who may be facing challenges with school, work, relationships, having young children, and mental health, Roth said. Along with assessments and counseling around fertility risks and genetic predisposition, MD Anderson also provides patients in the program with a long-term survivorship plan.

“It's not just increasing cures,” Roth observed. “We're also setting them up for a life of meaning and happiness and productivity and health.”

Almost 40% of visits to the program are conducted virtually, according to Roth. “Our goal is to meet the patients where they are,” he said. “We want to be convenient, not be a burden.”

Patients with AYA cancer diagnoses may be finishing up school or starting a job, developing their body image and sexual identity, or caring for young children or older parents.

“They feel incredibly isolated,” said Ann LaCasce, MD, MMSc, co-director of the Center for Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “They go into the cancer center or their community practice, and everyone is double, triple their age.”

Last year, Dana-Farber opened a Young Adult Lounge meant for patients aged 18 years or older to be able to relax and, if they wish, interact between appointments. “When you talk to these patients, they want to meet each other,” LaCasce said. “They want to share experiences.”

The Young Adults With Cancer Program at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville, Tennessee, opened its doors in 2019. It recently hired an interim nurse navigator, said Cathy Eng, MD, FACP, FASCO, director of the Program, which concentrates on patients aged 25-45 years.

“The face of cancer has changed,” Eng said.

She advises other oncologists to talk to their young adult patients as much as possible. “Really talk to them as an individual and see what other needs they have,” she said. “Even if they don't tell you the first time, ask them the second time, ask them the third time.”

Christopher Cann, MD, executive director of the Young Adult Cancer Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, did his fellowship under Eng. He joined Fox Chase in 2023, and the Young Adult Cancer Program started accepting patients around the end of last year, zeroing in on patients aged 18-39 years.

Following the implementation of a new best practice advisory that pops up in the medical records system, he said, oncofertility referrals increased by 400% within 6 months.

“My hope is that if every institution throughout the country can have a young adult program, even something small like this can provide a large impact for patients,” Cann said.

The University of North Carolina (UNC) AYA Cancer Program, part of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, formed in 2015. It has expanded into a team of about 12 including a nurse practitioner, fertility counselor, and psychologist, said Jacob Stein, MD, MPH, the program's AYA oncology liaison. UNC sees about 400 AYA patients with cancer annually, and the program interacts with slightly more than 100 of them, according to Stein.

“Our program has taken a very different approach, to target services, contact, and engagement with AYAs who we perceive to be at the highest need, either clinically or socially, for support,” he said.

Stein was the lead author on research presented last year at the ASCO Quality Care Symposium in San Francisco finding that patients engaged in the program were more likely to participate in clinical trials and received higher rates of fertility preservation and palliative care than AYA patients at UNC without program contact.

Andrew Smitherman, MD, MS, medical director of the UNC AYA Cancer Center Program, said the AYA field has grown impressively since a progress review group was started in 2005, which was backed by the National Cancer Institute and LIVESTRONG Young Adult Alliance. The group developed recommendations to address AYA oncology nationwide, in hopes of acting as a catalyst for future initiatives. Clearly, others caring for patients with cancer heard the message.

“If a colleague comes to me and says, ‘Where do I start, how do I make this change at my institution,' I usually lead with changing the culture,” Smitherman said. “Educating hospital leadership about the importance of this population, educating colleagues, finding partners. And then start thinking about ways to make structural changes, like creating space. That's worked really well for us.”

DuVall, Sung, Roth, LaCasce, Eng, Cann, Stein, and Smitherman declared no conflicts of interest.

 April 14, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — Tolebrutinib, a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that targets neuroinflammation, slowed disability progression by 31% in patients with nonrelapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS), results of a multi-center phase 3 study showed.

“Although tolebrutinib was associated with increased risks of respiratory complications and elevated liver enzymes, it also demonstrated several functional benefits, including a slowed decline in walking ability and a significant reduction in the annualized rate of new, or enlarging, T2 lesions.”

This study is believed to be the first to demonstrate a significant slowing of disability progression in patients with nrSPMS, a condition for which there are currently no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments.

“For years we been saying to patients that there really is nothing we can do to slow progression of their disease, but now we have something, and that's truly exciting”, lead investigator, Robert J. Fox, MD, chair of the HERCULES Global Steering Committee and a neurologist at the Mellen Center for MS Research and Treatment, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on April 8, 2025, at the American Academy of Neurology 2025 annual meeting and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.

About 85% of MS cases begin as the relapsing-remitting form, and over 10-20 years, a large proportion of patients transition to secondary progressive MS, where relapses subside and are gradually replaced by a steady decline in function, said Fox.

Tolebrutinib is an oral, brain-penetrant, and bioactive inhibitor of BTK, a key signaling molecule involved in neuroinflammation. It is designed to reduce activation and proinflammatory responses in B cells and myeloid cells within the central nervous system (CNS), as well as their counterparts in the peripheral immune system.

Several BTK inhibitors are under investigation in MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.

The HERCULES trial enrolled 1131 adults with nrSPMS, with a mean age of approximately 49 years and no relapses in the previous 24 months. Participants had documented disability progression within the past 12 months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 6.5.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either oral tolebrutinib (60 mg daily) or a matching placebo. The two groups were similar in demographic and disease characteristics.

Most participants (74%) had previously received at least one disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and 12.7% had gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline.

The median follow-up was 133 weeks. Overall, 76.9% of participants in the tolebrutinib group and 76.7% of those in the placebo group completed the trial.

The primary endpoint was confirmed disability progression (CDP), defined as an increase in EDSS score of at least 1.0 point for those with a baseline score ≤ 5.0, or at least 0.5 points for those with a baseline score > 5.0, sustained for a minimum of 6 months.

The primary endpoint was confirmed disability progression (CDP), defined as an increase in the EDSS score of 1.0 or more points (if the baseline score was ≤ 5.0) or 0.5 or more points (if the baseline score was > 5.0), that was sustained for at least 6 months.

Confirmed disability progression occurred in 22.6% of participants in the tolebrutinib group compared with 30.7% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 - 0.88; P = .003).

For the secondary endpoint — time to 3-month CDP — the study showed a 24% risk reduction in the tolebrutinib group vs placebo (27.6% vs 34.2%; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94; P = .01).

The treatment did not appear to improve arm function. The percentage of participants with a 20% increase in the score on the nine-hole peg test that was sustained for at least 3 months was 19.0% in the tolebrutinib group and 19.6% in the placebo group (HR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74-1.29; P = .84).

However, it did seem to preserve walking ability. The percentage of participants with a 20% increase in the score on the timed 25-foot walk sustained for at least 3 months was 41.1% in the tolebrutinib group and 49.6% in the placebo group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92).

Fox noted it was somewhat surprising that the treatment appeared to slow deterioration in walking ability but had no effect on arm function.

“We wouldn't have expected it to affect one and not the other, so we definitely need to dive into that data a bit more to understand the nuances of patient subpopulations,” he said.

All disability-progression events were independent of relapse activity, the investigators noted.

“What's really revolutionary is that we're slowing down progression in this population, which has never been shown before, and we're slowing down progression even though the effect on the relapsing aspect of MS is not very big,” said Fox.

Confirmed disability improvement was observed in 8.6% of participants treated with tolebrutinib compared with 4.5% of those treated with placebo (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.10-3.21).

Tolebrutinib was associated with fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions (adjusted rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.90; P = .011). Brain volume loss was similar between the two groups, which Fox noted was somewhat unexpected.

There was a slight increase in certain adverse events in the tolebrutinib group compared with that in the placebo group, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and influenza.

Serious adverse events occurred in 15.0% of participants receiving tolebrutinib vs 10.4% of those receiving placebo. The number of deaths was similar in both groups, at 0.3%.

Elevations in liver enzymes — specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) — were observed in 4.0% of participants in the tolebrutinib group compared with 1.6% of those in the placebo group.

A small proportion of participants receiving tolebrutinib (0.5%) experienced ALT elevations exceeding 20 times the ULN, all of which occurred within the first 90 days of treatment; no such cases were reported in the placebo group.

The vast majority of these cases resolved without lasting effects; however, one individual who required a liver transplant died. As a result, frequent liver monitoring during the first 90 days of treatment has been incorporated into the treatment protocol.

“We have to warn patients that this treatment can irritate the liver, and we need to monitor for it; it will mean weekly blood monitoring for first 3 months. We believe if we monitor carefully and identify the liver enzyme elevation early, we can intervene and stop it from progressing to liver failure,” said Fox.

Other trials have not shown a treatment benefit of tolebrutinib in patients with relapsing MS. “The pathology driving progression is probably quite different than the pathology driving relapses,” said Fox.

Sanofi, the study's sponsor, has submitted its regulatory application to the FDA, and a decision is expected within 6 months, said Fox.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Barbara Giesser, MD, a neurologist specializing in MS, and professor emeritus of clinical neurology, University of California at Los Angeles, said the study is “important and very well done.”

What largely distinguishes the new class of BTK inhibitors from current disease modifying treatments is their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and act on cells within the CNS, said Giesser.

She noted that these cells contribute to a mechanism of nerve damage known as smoldering inflammation, which is believed to play a major role in disease progression and the accumulation of disability.

The significant 31% reduction in the risk for disability progression at 6 months observed in the treatment group aligns with earlier data from smaller trials, which suggest that BTK inhibitors may slow — and potentially prevent — disability progression independently of their effects on relapses, said Giesser.

She expressed hope that the new findings will lead to broader access to treatments for nrSPMS. “Currently, the DMTs that have indications for SPMS are only authorized for SPMS with relapses,” she said.

This study was supported by Sanofi. Fox reported consulting for AB Science, Biogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, EMD Serono, Genentech, Greenwich Biosciences, Immunic, INmune Bio, Eli Lily and Company, Janssen, Novartis, Sanofi, Siemens, and TG Therapeutics; and receiving research support from Biogen, Novartis, and Sanofi. Geisser reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), combination therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and thiazolidinediones was associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared with those who used none or one of these therapies.

“This finding suggests a potential synergistic effect on mortality,” the study authors wrote. “The benefits of thiazolidinediones are tempered by their associated risks, such as fluid retention and an increased risk of HF. This study showed that GLP-1 RAs could mitigate the risk of HF associated with thiazolidinedione use,” they added.

“[This study], together with other emerging evidence and practice guideline recommendations, may offer a new frontier to consider the value of cost-effective combination therapy of a thiazolidinedione plus a GLP-1 RA in patients with T2D,” the authors of an invited commentary wrote.

This study was led by Jing-Xing Li, MD, MS, of the China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. It was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The observational design of this study limited the ability to establish causality, and the outcomes might have been influenced by residual confounding. The elderly study population may limit the generalizability of the results to younger individuals or those having different baseline characteristics. The increased risk for hypoglycemia observed with combination therapy could be a significant concern.

This study was partly supported by grants from the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare Clinical Trial Center and China Medical University Hospital Clinical Trial Center. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Cardiology 2025, the 28th Annual Update on Pediatric and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease, took place from February 19 to 23 in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The conference, hosted by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, brought together a diverse community of pediatric and congenital cardiovascular professionals and advocates, all united by this year's theme: Hope, Heal, and Learn. This year, discussions reinforced the urgency of collaboration, innovation, and resilience in pediatric cardiology. 

Pediatric cardiology is facing increasing challenges — resource constraints, rising patient complexity, and a growing need for personalized care. Multicenter initiatives like the Fontan Outcomes Network, National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative, FORCE Fontan Registry, and Additional Ventures Project Singular are breaking new ground, leveraging collective expertise to drive bold discoveries and elevate care standards. Evidence-based practice remains the foundation of pediatric cardiac care, ensuring quality improvement and excellence. Our community is stronger because of the multidisciplinary work we do together. 

The role of pediatric cardiac nurses is stronger than ever, spanning the full continuum of care from inpatient to outpatient settings. Their expertise is vital in driving innovation, enhancing patient outcomes, and ensuring the best possible care for children with cardiovascular conditions and their families. Nursing-led research enhances our knowledge base in best practices.

Advancements in catheter-based interventions, prenatal diagnosis, and surgical techniques are reshaping outcomes for children and adults with congenital and acquired heart disease. Conditions once deemed fatal now have clear and effective treatment pathways, allowing more patients to thrive well into adulthood. The evolution of ductal stenting, patent ductus arteriosus closure, pulmonary valve insertion, and sinus venosus atrial septal defect closure highlights the growing impact of minimally invasive approaches. Meanwhile, research continues to expand our understanding of beneficial pediatric heart medications. 

An important discussion at this year's conference is on self-care. Self-care should not be viewed as optional but instead should be regarded as obligatory. The well-being of pediatric cardiology professionals directly impacts patient care. Likewise, integrating emotional and psychological support into the treatment of our patients is critical for long-term success. Conference sessions emphasized the need for a holistic approach — one that prioritizes mental health, family-centered care, and the full spectrum of a child's welfare. 

An important takeaway from this year's conference is that exercise remains essential for individuals with single ventricle type congenital heart disease and Fontan circulation. Identifying the optimal ""dosage"" and activity type remains a priority. The dedicated Harrington Single Ventricle Session spotlighted the interplay of liver health, psychological health, and Fontan pathway characteristics, with new insights into cellular and metabolic mechanisms shaping future therapies. 

As we move forward, we reaffirm our commitment to early intervention and non-invasive strategies; cutting-edge research and technology; personalized, patient-centered care; and health equity and access for all children. Pediatric cardiology remains a dynamic and invigorated field driven by fresh ideas and relentless dedication. Together, we can shape a future where every child with heart disease has the best possible chance to thrive and live a normal life to their fullest potential.

Recent lithium and valproate use was associated with a 34%-46% lower risk for suicide in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD), investigators leading a large cohort study reported.

“Since treatment with lithium or valproate comes with various adverse effects such as weight gain, nephrotoxicity, hypothyroidism, teratogenicity, and thrombocytopenia, clinical decision making would be needed to take a balance between benefits and risk of prescribing lithium and valproate to suicidal individuals with [schizophrenia] or BD,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Junhee Lee, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea. It was published online on March 26 in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

Diagnoses were based on medical claims rather than structured clinical assessments, potentially affecting accuracy. Suicide was determined using death records only, potentially missing nonfatal attempts. The use of limited KCD codes may have led to the underreporting of suicide deaths. Additionally, adjustments for the risk for suicide relied on demographic factors alone rather than on clinical factors such as symptom severity.

The study was funded by Eulji University, Daejeon, South Korea. The investigators reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

The use of social media for phone reminders and health education doubled attendance rates in the 3 months after surgery in children with congenital ectopia lentis (CEL), while enhancing parental knowledge and increasing treatment rates for amblyopia.

“This approach offers a model for managing chronic conditions that require ongoing monitoring and intervention in resource limited settings, including in developing countries,” the researchers reported.

“For children with CEL and their parents, while phone reminders and health education communicated via a smartphone application [WeChat] improved adherence with short-term office visits at 3 months, such telehealth efforts and resources may be better spent elsewhere to improve screening over the short term for complications, such as amblyopia, after CEL surgery or screening annually long term for systemic problems in children with CEL,” according to an editorial accompanying the journal article.

This study was led by Yiyuan Ma, MD, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center in Guangzhou, China. It was published online on April 10, 2025, in JAMA Ophthalmology.

This study was limited by its 3-month follow-up period, which prevented evaluation of long-term adherence and health outcomes. The intervention required manual phone reminders and standardized educational materials, potentially affecting sustainability and scalability. As a single-center study conducted in China, findings may not be generalizable to other settings.

This study was supported by grants from the Guangzhou Basic Research Program Joint Funding Project, the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

CT examinations performed on 62 million patients in the United States during 2023 are projected to result in approximately 103,000 future cancer cases. Adults account for 91% of projected radiation-induced cancers despite higher per-examination risk in children.

“If current practices persist, CT-associated cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually…This would place CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption (5.4%) and excess body weight (7.6%),” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Rebecca Smith-Bindman, MD, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco. It was published online on April 14 in JAMA Internal Medicine.

According to the authors, the risk model parameters are primarily based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor outcomes, raising questions about the transferability of radiation risks from the mid-20th century Japanese population to the current US population. The calculations factored in average life expectancies, potentially overestimating future cancer risk for patients who undergo CT and have shorter life expectancy due to underlying illness. Additionally, while the CT categorization algorithm was 90% accurate compared with expert review, some examinations may have been miscategorized.

The research was supported by awards from the National Cancer Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and residual class settlement funds from a legal case. Smith-Bindman disclosed being a co-founder of Alara Imaging, Inc., a company focused on improving clinical and operational aspects of health systems, including radiation dose and image quality reporting for CT as part of payer-led quality programs. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and tissue scarring, and leading to impaired lung function and respiratory failure. Although current treatments, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, slow disease progression, they fail to completely halt or reverse fibrosis

Therefore, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed. Targeted drug delivery systems (TDDSs) are emerging as promising solutions. Biomaterials play critical roles in these systems by enhancing drug specificity, availability, and efficacy, while minimizing systemic toxicity. The most notable biomaterials include nanotechnology-based systems, including liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which facilitate drug penetration and slow release in fibrotic tissues. Hydrogels have three-dimensional structures providing controlled and sustained drug release at inflammation sites, and therefore are particularly valuable in PF treatment. Furthermore, biological carriers such as stem cells and extracellular vesicles have biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory effects that improve therapeutic outcomes. Despite the promising potential of these systems, clinical translation is hindered by several challenges, including immune clearance, stability of delivery platforms, and optimization of drug retention within diseased tissues. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating precision medicine with advancements in biomaterials may provide solutions opening new avenues for PF treatment.

This article discusses current developments in targeted drug delivery for PF, emphasizing the importance of biomaterials, the mechanisms and barriers involved in pulmonary drug delivery, and future perspectives for overcoming current limitations. The ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes by revolutionizing the approach to PF treatment through advanced drug delivery technologies.

A study reveals that a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet paired with physical activity preserves bone health in older adults with metabolic syndrome—especially women—highlighting a promising approach to prevent age-related osteoporosis.

A recent JAMA Network Open study evaluates the effects of a weight-loss lifestyle intervention on age-related bone deterioration.

Aging is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) and total bone mineral content (BMC), which increases the risk of osteoporotic fractures. As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of osteoporosis, which is associated with reduced quality of life and significant patient morbidity, has also risen. Thus, it is crucial to identify behavioral interventions that can mitigate the effects of osteoporosis to reduce the burden of this disease on the global healthcare sector.   

A balanced diet and regular physical activity are effective strategies that have been shown to prevent osteoporotic fractures, particularly among vulnerable patient populations like the elderly and obese. Since weight loss is frequently recommended to manage obesity-related conditions, it is essential to determine the role of these strategies on bone health to support the development of more effective weight loss strategies with minimal impact on age-related bone deterioration.

Adherence to a healthy diet during the energy reduction phase of weight loss could support the maintenance of sufficient BMD and BMC. To date, several studies have reported the benefits of the Mediterranean diet on bone health, irrespective of an individual's age. However, few studies have analyzed the effect of energy-reduced diets designed for weight loss to manage obesity and osteoporotic risk.

The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea-Plus (PREDIMED-Plus) randomized clinical trial was conducted across twenty-three healthcare centers in Spain. Herein, researchers investigated the effects of a multifactorial intervention on age-related BMD, total BMC, and low BMD prevalence among older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity over three years of follow-up.

Different lifestyle-based interventions considered in this analysis included an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral support.

Community-dwelling adults between 55 and 75 years of age with at least three metabolic syndromes and were either overweight or obese were recruited to participate. Initially, 6,874 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the control group or intervention group, stratified by center, sex, and age at a 1:1 ratio.

The control group was advised to follow an ad libitum traditional Mediterranean diet without energy restriction or specific physical activity recommendations. Comparatively, the intervention group received specific Mediterranean diet recommendations with a 30% energy reduction. The intervention cohort also received counseling to gradually increase their physical activity levels to meet recommended criteria by the World Health Organization (WHO) for adults 65 years of age and older.

In addition to physical activity and diet, study participants were subjected to behavioral and motivational strategies to facilitate the sustainable adoption of dietary and lifestyle modifications. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was also used to assess BMD variables and total BMC at baseline, as well as one and three years of follow-up.

A total of 924 individuals with metabolic syndrome and DXA scan data included in the final study cohort. At baseline, 464 study participants were included in the control group and 460 in the intervention group, 49.1% of whom were female with a mean age of 65.1 years.

As compared to controls, the intervention group experienced a greater reduction in total body weight by 3.3% and 3% over one and three years, respectively. A significant difference in total body weight changes was observed between the two groups at -2.8 kg and -2.2 kg after one and three years, respectively.

After adjusting for multiple covariate factors like smoking status, age, sex, educational level, and medical history, significant differences in mean changes between groups were observed.

For example, as compared to controls, study participants in the intervention group exhibited an overall increase in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD after three years. Furthermore, a protective association was established in women but not in men.

Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that, after three years, an increase in total femur, lumbar spine (L1-L4), and femoral trochanter BMD occurred among women in the intervention group as compared to controls. Likewise, the completer's case analysis also indicated that after three years, women in the intervention exhibited a greater increase in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD as compared to controls.

The sensitivity analysis results were consistent with these findings. Notably, the overall three-year intervention effect was more significant for total BMC in women as compared to men.

A modest hypocaloric Mediterranean diet combined with physical activity had a more profound effect on bone health in older women with metabolic syndrome, especially at the lumbar level, as compared to ad libitum Mediterranean diet recommendations.

Additional studies are needed to assess the impact of this weight loss lifestyle intervention on bone health for longer follow-up periods. Nevertheless, the study findings support incorporating this intervention into future public health strategies aiming to reduce the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in older adults.

What is medical data?
Identifiable vs. anonymized data: What is the difference?
Global views on data ownership
Commercial applications of medical data
Consent for data use: Informed or implied?
DeepMind, the NHS, & Fitbit
The changing landscape of data rights

Whether you are getting a blood test, stepping on a smart scale, or wearing a fitness tracker, you are generating a stream of personal medical data.

But who truly owns that information? As medical data becomes a more powerful asset in modern medicine, concerns about privacy, consent, and control are also growing.

Image Credit: Anggalih Prasetya/Shutterstock.com

Medical data includes a wide range of health information gathered through clinical care, research, and personal health monitoring. Together, these sources create a multidimensional view of an individual's health, supporting personalized care and data-driven decisions in medicine.1

The scope of medical data has expanded significantly with advances in technology and digital health. Traditionally, it includes Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which are comprehensive digital versions of patients' paper records that capture medical history and care plans across their healthcare journey.2

Genomic data, including DNA sequencing and genetic profiles, offers insights into disease risk, treatment response, and personalized therapies.3

Wearable devices (e.g., fitness trackers, smartwatches) and mobile health apps now collect vast amounts of medical data, enabling health monitoring, preventive care, and personalized healthcare decisions.4

A key distinction in medical data is whether it is identifiable or anonymized. Understanding this difference is crucial for ethical use, legal compliance, and maintaining public trust in digital health systems.

Identifiable data includes personal details linked to an individual and is subject to strict privacy and regulatory protections. Anonymized data lacks any identifying information and is commonly used in research, public health, and policy development, providing large-scale insights while preserving confidentiality.5

Is Data at the Center of Healthcare for the Future?

The legal landscape of medical data ownership and rights varies globally, with differing levels of patient control, access, and protection.

In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) grants patients rights to access and control their medical data but does not give them full ownership. While HIPAA allows patients to request, view, and correct their health information, legal ownership typically rests with healthcare providers and institutions.6

In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) emphasizes individuals' control over their data, granting comprehensive rights regarding its processing. These include data portability, allowing patients to transfer medical data to different providers, and the right to erasure, enabling individuals to request data deletion under specific conditions.6

In parts of Asia, data protection laws vary, with weaker regulations often giving healthcare providers more discretion and limiting patient rights compared to the US or EU.7

Medical data is a valuable asset with broad applications across healthcare.

In the AI sector, large volumes of structured and unstructured data, such as EHRs, imaging, lab results, and patient-generated information, train machine learning models to optimize patient diagnostics and treatment.8

In pharmaceutical research, real-world medical data, which is routinely gathered outside controlled clinical trials, is crucial for identifying drug targets, designing adaptive trials, and supporting regulatory submissions. It helps reduce time to market and lower research costs.9

Insurance companies use medical data to improve risk stratification, underwriting, and pricing models. By analyzing individual and population metrics, they can better predict health risks, tailor policies, and set appropriate premiums. This data-driven approach helps insurers manage costs, maximize profitability, and offer more personalized products.10

Mental Health Apps: Game-Changer or Gimmick?

As medical data collection and use expand across health systems, the line between informed consent and passive agreement is becoming increasingly blurred.

In traditional healthcare, informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical practice, ensuring individuals voluntarily agree to data use with a clear understanding of the risks, benefits, and purposes.

In contrast, many emerging digital health systems rely on lengthy, complex terms of service that are often overlooked and poorly understood. This creates a significant ethical and legal tension between transparent consent and opaque agreements accepted without true comprehension.11

This discrepancy can undermine trust and compromise data privacy and cloud accountability, creating challenges for both users and providers.

To maintain ethical standards and protect sensitive information, it is therefore crucial to ensure greater transparency, clearer consent processes, and stronger protections for personal medical data.11

Two high-profile examples highlighting data privacy issues are the Google DeepMind-NHS case and Fitbit health partnerships.

In 2015, Google's AI company DeepMind partnered with the UK's National Health Service (NHS) to develop an AI system for the early detection of acute kidney disease. The NHS shared data from over 1.5 million identifiable patients to test the Streams app.

The project faced scrutiny for not properly informing patients about data use, raising ethical concerns about consent and privacy.12

Fitbit, an American wearable tech company, has partnered with healthcare providers and research organizations to use wearable data to monitor and improve health outcomes.

While these collaborations offer valuable insights for personalized healthcare, they also raise concerns about the sharing, commercial use, and potential exploitation of personal medical data.13

The Science of Ultra-Processed Foods and Mental Health

As the digital landscape evolves, the future of medical data rights and governance increasingly emphasizes ethical and transparent practices.

An emerging trend is the rise of data cooperatives and patient-centered ownership models, empowering individuals to control their data. These models emphasize personal consent and allow individuals to decide how their data is used, enhancing autonomy and privacy.14

Technologies such as blockchain, which provides immutable records and decentralized data control while ensuring transparency and trust, and zero-knowledge proofs, which validate data without revealing sensitive information, are gaining attention for enhancing security, privacy, and transparency across sectors.14,15

The growing demand for ethical data use frameworks is driven by the need to balance innovation with privacy while respecting individuals' rights and building trust between consumers and organizations.

As the value of medical data rises, it is crucial to align technological advancement with ethical responsibility by prioritizing transparency, user empowerment, and respect for informed consent. This approach not only drives progress in healthcare and beyond but also gives individuals greater control over their digital lives.

Although clinical evidence suggests that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is an established major risk factor for heart failure, it remains unexplored whether sleep disorder-caused hepatic damage contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The authors of this article revealed that sleep fragmentation (SF) displayed notable hepatic detrimental phenotypes, including steatosis and oxidative damage, along with significant abnormalities in cardiac structure and function. All these pathological changes persisted even after sleep recovery for 2 consecutive weeks or more, displaying memory properties.

Mechanistically, persistent higher expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) in the liver was the key initiator of SF-accelerated damage phenotypes. SF epigenetically controlled the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) enrichment at the Nox4 promoter and markedly increased Nox4 expression in liver even after sleep recovery. Moreover, fine coordination of the circadian clock and hepatic damage was strictly controlled by BMAL1-dependent Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) transcription after circadian misalignment. Accordingly, genetic manipulation of liver-specific Nox4 or Sirt1, along with pharmacological intervention targeting NOX4 (GLX351322) or SIRT1 (Resveratrol), could effectively erase the epigenetic modification of Nox4 by reducing the H3K27ac level and ameliorate the progression of liver pathology, thereby counteracting SF-evoked sustained CVD. Collectively, our findings may pave the way for strategies to mitigate myocardial injury from persistent hepatic detrimental memory in diabetic patients.

Despite parents' strong food skills, new Canadian research finds no link to their children's cooking abilities, suggesting hands-on experience matters more than observation alone.

Study: Longitudinal associations between mothers' and fathers' food skills and their children's cooking skills. Image Credit: Red Fox studio / Shutterstock

Researchers at the University of Guelph, Canada, conducted a study to explore the impact of parents' food skills on their children's cooking skills. The study, published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, finds that children are less likely to learn cooking skills by simply watching their parents' food skills. The study did not directly measure observational learning, instead inferring this from the lack of association between parental skills and child outcomes.

Children perceive their parents as role models at an early age. At this developmental life stage, parents can strongly influence their children's habits, especially dietary habits, as they primarily make food decisions at home.

Existing evidence suggests that good food skills in parents are associated with healthy dietary habits in children. Food skills refer to a broad collection of knowledge and skills, such as meal preparation and planning, grocery shopping, and reading food labels.

While mothers scored higher in meal planning, fathers showed stronger skills in grilling and modifying recipes—a distinction that didn't translate to children's abilities.

The mechanism driving the association between parental food skills and children's healthy dietary intake is not clearly known. One proposed theory is that children may learn from their parents' food skills and eventually develop their own cooking skills. Cooking skills refer to a subset of food skills required to prepare meals.

In modern life, ready-to-eat, highly processed foods have become more popular than cooking healthy foods from scratch. This shift in eating habits may lead to a generation that lacks the skills required to cook from scratch.

Since learning cooking methods at an early age is associated with better food skills and diet quality later in life, effective strategies should be developed to encourage and support children to develop these skills.

The current study aimed to explore how parents' food skills influence children's cooking skills in families with school-going children. Although mothers are considered the key parents in teaching cooking skills, this study evaluated the food skills of both mothers and fathers, as recent evidence suggests that fathers play an important and unique role in improving their children's diet quality.

The study analyzed data from the Guelph Family Health Study, an ongoing follow-up study involving families who participated in a randomized controlled trial of a home-based obesity prevention intervention. The sample was predominantly White (85%), high-income, and English-speaking, which may limit generalizability to other populations.

Children over age 10 showed slightly better cooking skills than younger peers, hinting that skill development may accelerate in early adolescence.

The final analysis included data from 135 families, including 158 children, aged on average 9 years, and their parents (121 mothers and 66 fathers). Self-reported food skills and cooking skills were obtained from parents and children, respectively. As noted in the paper, children's self-reported cooking skills may have been subject to social desirability bias.

The study considered two aspects of food skills: mechanical and conceptual skills. Mechanical food skills refer to basic food skills, such as preparing meals, chopping and mixing, cooking, and measuring ingredients. Conceptualizing food skills refers to more advanced food skills, such as cooking complex recipes and adjusting them for healthier options.

Food and cooking skills were calculated for each parent and child, respectively. The scores ranged from one to four, with higher scores indicating higher levels of food or cooking skills.

Appropriate statistical models were used to determine longitudinal associations between parents' food skills and children's cooking skills, after adjusting for child age and sex, parent age, household income, intervention status (which showed no effect on outcomes), and other factors.

The study found that the mean food skill score for mothers was 3.65 (on a scale of 1 to 4), and for fathers, it was 3.42. For children, the self-reported cooking skill score was 3.36.

The study could not find any significant association between parents' overall food skills and children's cooking skills. Similarly, no significant association between children's cooking skills and parents' conceptualizing and mechanical food skills was observed.

The study finds that parents, despite having considerably high levels of food skills, did not significantly influence their children's cooking skills. In other words, the study findings suggest that children do not passively learn these skills from their parents through observation alone.

The current research team has previously reported that active involvement in meal preparation and cooking activities at an early age significantly improves cooking skills in children later in life. This finding indicates that active involvement instead of passive learning is required for children to gain food skills.

Although the majority of families had high household incomes, this homogeneity may limit how widely the findings apply to more diverse or lower-income groups.

Parental time constraints are one of the main factors restricting parents' ability to actively involve their children in meal preparation and cooking activities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, approximately 488 million people are working long hours, defined as 55 hours of work or more per week. These longer working hours might be associated with a reduction in time spent on meal preparation.

Longer working hours, combined with reduced daily meal preparation time, might explain the lack of association observed between parents' food skills and children's cooking skills.

Since childhood cooking abilities often result in healthier food selection in adulthood, researchers highlight the need for initiating school or community-based culinary programs to promote cooking in families and improve children's cooking skills.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New Cochrane review highlights gaps in newborn pain assessment tools","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250414/New-Cochrane-review-highlights-gaps-in-newborn-pain-assessment-tools.aspx","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:26:00 GMT","

A newly-published Cochrane review reveals significant gaps in the clinical rating scales used to assess pain in newborn babies, highlighting the urgent need for improved tools and global collaboration.

Despite the critical importance of accurately measuring pain in newborns, the review found that none of the available scales are backed by the high-quality evidence and methodological safeguards required to confirm their validity and reliability in clinical practice.

Neonatal pain assessment and management presents a challenge for clinical staff worldwide. Over 40 rating scales have been developed and adapted worldwide assessing different parameters and various types of pain.

Six to nine percent of all newborns require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to either illness of prematurity. These infants endure multiple painful procedures daily, which can lead to long-term negative effects. Due to this, valid tools to support the assessment of pain are of great importance.

The Cochrane review analysed 79 studies involving over 7,000 infants across 26 countries, evaluating 27 different clinical rating scales. All rating scales were found to be supported by very low-quality evidence, indicating major limitations in their effectiveness and clinical applicability.

Over 70% of rating scales in this review did not assess content and structural validity, and both these factors are essential when selecting a measurement instrument. Without a strong foundation in these areas, other necessary measures, such as reliability, cannot be accurately evaluated. Future studies must prioritise rigorous validation to improve neonatal pain assessment.""

Kenneth Färnqvist, physiotherapist and PhD candidate at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden

Measuring pain in newborns is particularly complex compared to adults. Such limitations may lead to an over- or under-estimation of pain, resulting in unnecessary sedation or inadequately treated pain, potentially jeopardizing infant safety through treatment side-effects, including withdrawal symptoms or prolonged discomfort. Premature infants further complicate matters, as they often have a reduced ability to display robust pain behaviour due to their immaturity. The same is also true for ill or sedated infants.

""It is important to remember that clinical rating scales are only surrogates for pain measurement,"" says Roger F. Soll, Professor of Neonatology at the University of Vermont. ""Given the uncertainty highlighted in this review, clinical staff should avoid relying too heavily on the rating scales currently in practice and instead strive to decrease painful procedures as much as possible in this vulnerable population.""

Despite the disappointing results, this review presents an opportunity for progress in neonatal pain assessment, particularly through global collaboration and innovation.

Emma Persad, doctor and PhD candidate at the Department of Women's and Children's Health at the Karolinska Institute, sees this as an opportunity for global collaboration and a call to action.

""This is our chance to unite clinicians and methodologists in developing a rigorously validated scale from scratch, one that meets all necessary checks before implementation in research and practice,"" Emma says. ""We look forward to beginning this impactful work and the implications it will have on assessing and managing neonatal pain worldwide.""

Rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnoses dropped during and shortly after Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico, according to a recent analysis. However, late-stage diagnoses eventually exceeded expectations, suggesting that limited access to cancer screening services due to these disasters likely hindered timely CRC diagnoses. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

During disasters, medical services may be delayed or inaccessible due to damaged infrastructure, overburdened health care facilities, or shortages of medical personnel. This can lead to late diagnoses, interruptions in treatment, and an overall worsening of survival and other health outcomes for patients.

To assess the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on CRC diagnoses, investigators analyzed 2012–2021 data from the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry, which has been collecting information on all cancer cases diagnosed and treated in Puerto Rico since 1950.

The team led by investigators at the University of Puerto Rico found that from 2012–2021, a total of 18,537 residents received a first-time diagnosis of CRC. In the month the hurricanes struck, 161.4 CRC cases would have been expected in the absence of any interruption, but instead, only 82 cases were diagnosed.

After a slight upward trend, there was a second decline following the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. In April 2020, the observed number of CRC cases was 50, but the expected number of cases without interruptions would have been 162.5.

By the end of the study, the estimated numbers of patients with early-stage CRC and those aged 50–75 years (the recommended screening age range) did not reach expected numbers. Meanwhile, numbers of patients with late-stage CRC and those outside the recommended screening age range (<50 years and ≥76 years) exceeded expected numbers.

These findings suggest that limited health care access during these events may have delayed cancer detection and may have worsened health outcomes. This issue is especially critical in Puerto Rico, since the health care system already faces important challenges.""

Tonatiuh Suárez-Ramos, MS,co–lead author

""Understanding these disruptions can help develop more adaptable and resilient strategies to ensure the continuity of essential care,"" added co-lead author Yisel Pagán-Santana, DrPH.

Senior author Karen J. Ortiz-Ortiz, DrPH, stressed the urgent need for policies that strengthen health care systems in Puerto Rico and other regions that face similar challenges. ""By evaluating the impact of events like hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to start the conversation about long-term solutions to improve cancer care coordination, reduce health disparities, and ensure continued access to care,"" she said. ""Ultimately, our goal is to help people live longer, healthier lives by making health care systems more resilient and accessible, even in times of crisis.""

Sleep is a necessary part of people's daily routine, but modern lifestyles and technology have ushered in an era of decreased rest time and subsequent fatigue. Further, the bedroom environment, such as light, sound, and temperature, is important for a good night's sleep, though this is often neglected in residential architecture.

In search of a conclusive remedy, common sleep studies use artificial light that is easy to control. Osaka Metropolitan University researchers, however, believe natural light could be more effective for re-creating actual living environments.

To test this, Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology student Xiaorui Wang and Professor Daisuke Matsushita led a team in examining whether introducing moderate light into the bedroom just before waking would improve morning wakefulness. Using light-shielding curtains and motorized closing devices, a comparative experiment was conducted on 19 participants under three conditions: natural light for 20 minutes before waking up (IA), natural light from dawn until waking up (IB), and no natural light before waking up (CC). After each session, participants' sleepiness, alertness, and fatigue were measured with an electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and a survey.

Results revealed that participants were less sleepy in IA and IB conditions than in CC. In addition, IA was found to be one of the most effective methods for improving wakefulness, as too much light in IB caused adverse effects.

In the future, we hope to control natural light in the sleep environment as it changes with the seasons and time of day, and to clarify how to introduce natural light that is suitable for a more comfortable awakening.""

Professor Daisuke Matsushita, Osaka Metropolitan University

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cikungunya virus structure reveals targets for antiviral therapy","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250414/Discovering-the-structure-of-Chikungunya-virus.aspx","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:29:00 GMT","

Chikungunya is a disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, with sporadic cases reported in other locations. Its symptoms often resemble those of dengue and Zika, resulting in common misdiagnoses. The illness causes fever and severe joint pain, which can be debilitating and may persist for different durations.1 

The chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus, is the causative agent of this serious illness. To facilitate viral RNA replication, CHIKV creates distinctive organelles called spherules on the plasma membrane of infected cells. While some viral protein structures within these spherules have been characterized, the full structure of the organelle is still not fully understood.

Researchers at Umea University employed  Thermo Scientific Krios Cryo-TEM (cryo-transmission electron microscope) along with Thermo Scientific Amira Software  to explore the structural arrangement of the spherules. Cryo-electron tomography of the plasma membrane uncovered clusters of balloon-like spherules attached to the membrane.2



Figure1. 3D recostructure of the spherules at the plasma membrane. Yellow: plasma membrane, red: viral RNA, and blue: protein complex sitting at the spherule necks. Image Credit: Thermo Fisher Scientific - Software

As shown in the figure above, the spherules possess a circular shape with diameters between 50 and 70 nm. The tomograms also displayed a filamentous structure within the membrane buds. The location and size of these filaments suggest that they are likely viral RNA, possibly in its double-stranded RNA replicative form.

Researchers proposed that analyzing the visible filaments within the spherules could provide insights into the quantity of viral RNA contained in each spherule.

To facilitate this, they employed the automated filament tracing feature available in Amira Software, which allows for the tracing and quantification of genetic material in individual spherules. This tool has demonstrated effectiveness in both quantifying and analyzing filament structures. 



Figure 2. Characterization and quantification of the viral RNA. A: 3D structure of the ds RNA filament obtained by Amira Software. Yellow: membrane, Red: RNA and blue: neck complex base. B: Increase of RNA lengths with spherule volume shown in a graph. C: Estimation of dsRNA length (in base pairs) for two datasets, and average copy numbers per spherule. Image Credit: Thermo Fisher Scientific - Software

The total length of viral filaments within the spherules was measured, revealing an approximate length of 18,600 ± 2900 Å and 21,400 ± 1600 Å per spherule (Figure 2B), which is equivalent to about 7300 ± 1150 and 8400 ± 600 base pairs per spherule across the two datasets (Figure 2). Notably, this length represents about 80-90 % of a full-length replicon RNA, which consists of 8820 base pairs.

This finding indicates that each spherule likely contains a complete copy of the template RNA strand, with a substantial portion in a double-stranded configuration. This insight is crucial for understanding the virus's replication mechanisms and may guide future research and therapeutic approaches.2

In conclusion, the investigation of RNA filaments has provided detailed insights into their organization within spherules. In addition to characterizing the RNA filaments, the authors examined protein and lipid interactions. Their research on viral proteins identified crucial roles for the non-structural proteins (nsP1 - nsP4) in stabilizing the spherule structure and aiding RNA replication.

Meanwhile, lipid characterization underscored the significance of specific lipid compositions in membrane curvature and stability. By integrating these findings, the study offers a comprehensive understanding of the interactions among RNA, proteins, and lipids in preserving the structural integrity and functionality of viral replication organelles.

Thermo Scientific's Amira Software offers advanced visualization, segmentation, and analysis capabilities, facilitating the examination and interpretation of complex datasets.

As demonstrated in this study, Amira enabled the revelation of the 3D structure of the chikungunya spherule at the plasma membrane and allowed for quantitative analyses to estimate viral RNA.

The software's ability to handle large datasets and produce accurate 3D reconstructions and quantitative analyses significantly enhanced the research, resulting in more precise and comprehensive findings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Magic happens when kids and adults learn to swim. Tragedy can strike if they don't.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250414/Magic-happens-when-kids-and-adults-learn-to-swim-Tragedy-can-strike-if-they-done28099t.aspx","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:54:00 GMT","

At a swim meet just outside St. Louis, heads turned when a team of young swimmers walked through the rec center with their parents in tow.

A supportive mom kept her eye on the clock while the Makos Swim Team athletes tucked their natural curls, braids, and locs into yellow swimming caps. In the bleachers, spectators whispered about the team's presence at the pool in Centralia, Illinois — as they do at almost every competition.

""They don't know that we're listening,"" Randella Randell, a swimmer's mom, later said. ""But we're here to stay. We're here to represent. We're going to show you that Black kids know how to swim. We swim, too.""

Randell's son, Elijah Gilliam, 14, is a member of the Makos' competitive YMCA and USA Swimming program based in North St. Louis. Almost 40 athletes, ages 4 to 19, swim on the squad, which encourages Black and multiracial kids to participate in the sport. Coached by Terea Goodwin and Torrie Preciado, the team also spreads the word about water safety in their community.

""If we can get everybody to learn how to swim, just that little bit, it would save so many lives,"" said Goodwin, a kitchen and bathroom designer by day who is known as Coach T at the pool. ""Swimming is life.""

But just like mako sharks, such teams of Black swimmers are rare. Detroit has the Razor Aquatics, Howard University in Washington, D.C., has a team that's made headlines for winning championships, and some alums from North Carolina A&T's former swim team created a group to offer water safety classes.

In the past, Black Americans were barred from many public swimming pools. When racial segregation was officially banned, white Americans established private swim clubs that required members to pay a fee that wasn't always affordable. As a result, swimming remained effectively segregated, and many Black Americans stayed away from pools.

The impact is still felt. More than a third of Black adults report they do not know how to swim, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, more than twice the rate for adults overall.

Seeing a need in their community, the parents of the Makos swimmers formed the Black Swimmers Alliance at the end of 2023 with a goal of ""bridging the gap in aquatic skills,"" according to its website. But the group, which offers swim lessons to families of color, is concerned about the flow of grant money dwindling because of the recent federal backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Even so, they are fundraising directly on their own, because lives are being lost.

In late January, a 6-year-old died at a hotel pool in St. Louis. A boy the same age drowned while taking swim lessons at a St. Louis County pool in 2022. And across the river in Hamel, Illinois, a 3-year-old boy drowned in a backyard pool last summer.

Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1 through 4, according to the CDC. Black children and Black adults drown far more often than their white peers.

Members of the Black Swimmers Alliance discussed those statistics before their advocacy work began. They also had to address another issue — many of the adult volunteers and parents with children on the Makos team didn't know how to swim. Even though their children were swimming competitively, the fear of drowning and the repercussions of history had kept the parents out of the pool.

The Makos athletes also noticed that their parents were timid around water. That's when their roles reversed. The children started to look out for the grown-ups.

Joseph Johnson, now 14, called out his mom, Connie Johnson, when she tried to give him a few tips about how to improve his performance.

""He was like, 'Mom, you have no idea,'"" the now-55-year-old recalled. ""At first, I was offended, but he was absolutely right. I didn't know how to swim.""

She signed up for lessons with Coach T.

Najma Nasiruddin-Crump and her husband, Joshua Crump, signed up, too. His daughter Kaia Collins-Crump, now 14, had told them she wanted to join the Makos team the first time she saw it. But among the three of them, no one knew how to swim.

Joshua Crump, 38, said he initially felt silly at the lessons, then started to get the hang of it.

""I don't swim well enough to beat any of the children in a race,"" he said with a chuckle.

Nasiruddin-Crump, 33, said she was terrified the first time she jumped in the deep end. ""It is the only moment in my life outside of birthing my children that I've been afraid of something,"" she said. ""But once you do it, it's freedom. It's pure freedom.""

Mahoganny Richardson, whose daughter Ava is on the team, volunteered to teach more Makos parents how to swim.

She said the work starts outside the pool with a conversation about a person's experiences with water. She has heard stories about adults who were pushed into pools, then told to sink or swim. Black women were often told to stay out of the water to maintain hairstyles that would swell if their hair got wet.

Bradlin Jacob-Simms, 47, decided to learn how to swim almost 20 years after her family survived Hurricane Katrina. She evacuated the day before the storm hit but said one of her friends survived only because that woman's brother was able to swim to find help.

""If it wasn't for him, they would have died,"" she said, noting that hundreds did drown.

""That's the reason why swimming is important to me,"" she said. ""A lot of times, us as African Americans, we shy away from it. It's not really in our schools. It's not really pushed.""

Makos swimmer Rocket McDonald, 13, encouraged his mom, Jamie McDonald, to get back into the water and stick with it. When she was a child, her parents had signed her up for swim lessons, but she never got the hang of it. Her dad was always leery of the water. McDonald didn't understand why until she read about a race riot at a pool not far from where her dad grew up that happened after St. Louis desegregated public pools in 1949.

""It was a full-circle moment,"" McDonald said. ""It all makes sense now.""

Now, at 42, McDonald is learning to swim again.

Safety is always a priority for the Makos team. Coach T makes the athletes practice swimming in full clothing as a survival skill.

Years ago, as a lifeguard in Kansas City, Missouri, Coach T pulled dozens of children out of recreational swimming pools who were drowning. Most of them, she said, were Black children who came to cool off but didn't know how to swim.

""I was literally jumping in daily, probably hourly, getting kids out of every section,"" Goodwin said. After repeated rescues, too many to count, she decided to offer lessons.

Swim lessons can be costly. The Black Swimmers Alliance aimed to fund 1,000 free swim lessons by the end of 2025. It had already funded 150 lessons in St. Louis. But when the group looked for grants, the alliance scaled back its goal to 500 lessons, out of caution about what funding would be available.

It's still committed to helping Black athletes swim competitively throughout their school years and in college.

Most of the time, the Makos swimmers practice in a YMCA pool that doesn't have starting blocks. Backstroke flags are held in place with fishing wire, and the assistant coach's husband, José Preciado, used his 3-D printer to make red, regulation 15-meter markers for the team. Once a week, parents drive the team to a different YMCA pool that has starting blocks. That pool is about 5 degrees warmer for its senior patrons' comfort. Sometimes the young swimmers fuss about the heat, but practicing there helps them prepare for meets.

Parents said white officials have frequently disqualified Makos swimmers. So some of the team parents studied the rules of the sport, and eventually four became officials to diversify the ranks and ensure all swimmers are treated fairly. Still, parents said, that hasn't stopped occasional racist comments from bystanders and other swimmers at meets.

""Some didn't think we'd make it this far, not because of who we are but where we're from,"" Goodwin has taught the Makos swimmers to recite. ""So we have to show them.""

And this spring, Richardson is offering lessons for Makos parents while their children practice.

""It's not just about swimming,"" Richardson said. ""It's about overcoming something that once felt impossible.""

A pioneering study presented today at ESCMID Global 2025 has demonstrated that an AI-powered lung ultrasound outperforms human experts by 9% in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).

The ULTR-AI suite analyses images from portable, smartphone-connected ultrasound devices, offering a sputum-free, rapid, and scalable alternative for TB detection. The results exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmarks for pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis, marking a major opportunity for accessible and efficient TB triage.

Despite previous global declines, TB rates rose by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023.2 Early screening and rapid diagnosis are critical components of the WHO's 'End TB Strategy,' yet many high-burden countries experience substantial patient dropouts at the diagnostic stage due to the high cost of chest x-ray equipment and a shortage of trained radiologists.3  

These challenges underscore the urgent need for more accessible diagnostic tools. The ULTR-AI suite leverages deep learning algorithms to interpret lung ultrasound in real time, making the tool more accessible for TB triage, especially for minimally trained healthcare workers in rural areas. By reducing operator dependency and standardising the test, this technology can help diagnose patients faster and more efficiently.""

Dr. Véronique Suttels, lead study author

The ULTR-AI suite comprises three deep-learning models: ULTR-AI predicts TB directly from lung ultrasound images; ULTR-AI (signs) detects ultrasound patterns as interpreted by human experts; and ULTR-AI (max) uses the highest risk score from both models to optimise accuracy.

The study was conducted at a tertiary urban centre in Benin, West Africa. After exclusions, 504 patients were included, with 192 (38%) confirmed to have pulmonary TB. Among the study population, 15% were HIV-positive and 13% had a history of TB. A standardised 14-point lung ultrasound sliding scan protocol was performed, with human experts interpreting images based on typical lung ultrasound findings. A single sputum molecular test (MTB Xpert Ultra) served as the reference standard.

ULTR-AI (max) demonstrated 93% sensitivity and 81% specificity (AUROC 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.95), exceeding WHO's target thresholds of 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity for non-sputum-based TB triage tests.

""Our model clearly detects human-recognisable lung ultrasound findings-like large consolidations and interstitial changes-but an end-to-end deep learning approach captures even subtler features beyond the human eye,"" said Dr. Suttels. ""Our hope is that this will help identify early pathological signs such as small sub-centimetre pleural lesions common in TB.""

""A key advantage of our AI models is the immediate turnaround time once they are integrated into an app,"" added Dr. Suttels. ""This allows lung ultrasound to function as a true point-of-care test with good diagnostic performance at triage, providing instant results while the patient is still with the healthcare worker. Faster diagnosis could also improve linkage to care, reducing the risk of patients being lost to follow-up.""

A new study reveals that moderate consumption of total and non-heme iron may reduce colorectal and colon cancer risk in South Korea, highlighting the role of plant-based iron in cancer prevention.

 Study: Iron Consumption and Colorectal Cancer in Korean Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study. Image Credit: Shutterstock AI Generator / Shutterstock.com

A recent Nutrients study investigates the association between iron consumption and the incidence of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in South Korea.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer to affect both men and women. Since 2019, the prevalence of CRC has risen by 2.6% in South Korea, thus emphasizing the crucial need to identify modifiable risk factors that can support the development of preventive strategies.

Previous studies have reported the multifactorial etiology of CRC that can involve excessive alcohol intake, physical inactivity, smoking, obesity, and dietary habits. In 2018, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) identified red and processed meat consumption as a risk factor for the development of CRC, which may be attributed to increased heme iron intake.

Heme iron catalyzes the synthesis of hydroxyl free radicals, mostly total N-nitroso compounds, and lipid peroxide radicals, which increase the risk of CRC. However, multiple population-based studies have contradicted this observation while reporting that heme iron consumption reduced the risk of colon and colorectal cancers.

To date, the association between heme iron consumption and CRC risks has been primarily studied in Western populations. Since dietary patterns and genetic predispositions significantly differ between Western and Asian populations, it is essential to independently investigate the impact of heme iron intake on CRC risk in a wide range of ethnic populations.

Study participants were recruited from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study's Health Examinees (KoGES HEXA) study, which included a large-scale population-based cohort. Individuals 40 years of age and younger, as well as those who were 69 years or older, were excluded from the analysis. Any individual with missing mortality, cancer-related, or incomplete dietary data were not considered.

At baseline, information about the participants' dietary pattern, daily food intake quantity, and types of food consumed were obtained through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The dietary iron content for each food item was obtained from the KoGES HEXA FFQ database.

Total and non-heme iron intake were classified by quintiles (Q) to ensure the statistical significance of each group. Notably, heme iron was categorized into quintiles due to the insufficient number of observations for absolute levels of heme iron intake.

The number of CRC cases was obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry.

A total of 109,908 individuals with a mean age of 53.8 years were followed up for 9.1 years. During the follow-up period, 608 new cases of CRC were recorded, which reflected an incidence of 60.5 CRC cases for every 100,000 person-years.

Complex associations between iron intake and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer were observed. Men, younger individuals, those with high body mass index (BMI), with a history of smoking or drinking, and those with higher levels of education consumed the most amount of iron ranging from 9.49-47.53 mg/Day (Q5), as compared to 1.09-4.97 (Q1).

Study participants in Q1 were more likely to be physically inactive, have a history of diabetes hypertension, or a family history of CRC as compared to those in Q5. The total energy consumption was higher in Q5.

Total daily iron consumption in Q2 was associated with a significantly lower risk of CRC and colon cancer as compared to Q1. However, no significant association between rectal cancer and total iron consumption was observed.

Among men, Q2 participants were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with lower CRC and colon cancer as compared to those in Q1. Among women, the results were statistically insignificant; however, the risk of these cancers was also the lowest in Q2.

Heme iron did not exhibit a linear trend nor significantly affect CRC and colon cancer risk. Relative to Q1, a reduced risk of rectal cancer was observed in Q4; however, these results were not statistically significant. As compared to Q1, significantly lower CRC and colon cancer risk were observed in the Q2 group for non-heme iron consumption.

Nonsignificant associations between non-heme iron consumption and rectal cancer were observed. Men in the Q2 group were significantly less likely to develop colon cancer and CRC as compared to Q1; yet, this association was not observed for rectal cancer.  

Moderate total and non-heme iron intake reduced colorectal and colon cancer risk in Koreans, possible via the displacement of carcinogens and the increased intake of protective micronutrients from plant-based foods.”

CRC and colon cancer risk is reduced by high total and non-heme iron consumption in a population of Korean individuals. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this association and the impact of diet in modulating cancer risk.

New research from the University of Waterloo suggests increasing the ratio of dietary potassium to sodium intake may be more effective for lowering blood pressure than simply reducing sodium intake.

High blood pressure affects over 30 per cent of adults globally. It's the leading cause of coronary heart disease and stroke and may also lead to other afflictions like chronic kidney disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and dementia.

""Usually, when we have high blood pressure, we are advised to eat less salt,"" said Anita Layton, professor of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Pharmacy and Biology at the University of Waterloo and the Canada 150 Research Chair in Mathematical Biology and Medicine. 

""Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet, such as bananas or broccoli, might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium."" 

Potassium and sodium are both electrolytes – substances that help the body send electrical signals to contract muscles, affect the amount of water in your body and perform other essential functions. 

Early humans ate lots of fruits and vegetables, and as a result, our body's regulatory systems may have evolved to work best with a high potassium, low sodium diet.""

Melissa Stadt, PhD candidate in Waterloo's Department of Applied Mathematics and lead author of the study

""Today, western diets tend to be much higher in sodium and lower in potassium. That may explain why high blood pressure is found mainly in industrialized societies, not in isolated societies."" 

While previous research found that increasing potassium intake can help control blood pressure, the researchers developed a mathematical model that successfully identifies how the ratio of potassium to sodium impacts the body. 

The model also identifies how sex differences affect the relationship between potassium and blood pressure. The study found that men develop high blood pressure more easily than pre-menopausal women, but men are also more likely to respond positively to an increased ratio of potassium to sodium.

The researchers emphasize that mathematical models like the one used in this study allow these kinds of experiments to identify how different factors impact the body quickly, cheaply, and ethically. 

The study, Modulation of blood pressure by dietary potassium and sodium: sex differences and modeling analysis, was recently published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology.

Cardiovascular disease is by far the most common cause of death worldwide, and myocardial infarction is the most common acute event. For those who survive a myocardial infarction, the risk of a new heart attack is greatest in the first year after the initial event because the blood vessels are more sensitive, making it easier for blood clots to develop. Reducing the ""bad"" cholesterol in the blood stabilises changes in the vessels, decreasing the risk for new events. The current established routine treatment is to treat with high-potency statins, immediately after the infarction. However, the majority of patients do not reach their treatment goals using only this medication. They need an add-on treatment in order to get down to the recommended cholesterol levels. 

Today's guidelines recommend stepwise addition of lipid-lowering treatment. But it's often the case that this escalation takes too long, it's ineffective and patients are lost to follow-up.""

Margrét Leósdóttir, Associate Professor at Lund University and senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden

In the study in question, she examined the prognosis of patients if the add-on therapy ezetimibe is applied early – (within 12 weeks after myocardial infarction), late (between 13 weeks and 16 months) or not at all. Based on Swedish registry data from 36,000 patients who had a myocardial infarction between 2015 and 2022, Margrét Leósdóttir´s research group has used advanced statistical models to emulate a clinical trial. The results show that patients who received a combination treatment of statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks after the infarction and were able to lower cholesterol to the target level early, had a better prognosis and less risk of new cardiovascular events and death than those who received the add-on treatment late or never. Based on the results, many new heart attacks, strokes and deaths could be prevented every year if the treatment strategy would be changed. 

""Combination therapy is not applied up-front for two main reasons. General recommendations are not included in today's guidelines and a precautionary principle is applied to avoid side effects and overmedication. However, there are positive effects from applying both medicines as soon after the infarction as possible. Not doing this entails an increased risk. In addition, the drug we have examined in the study causes few side effects and is readily available and inexpensive in many countries."" 

Margrét Leósdóttir hopes that the research results will in time provide support for changes in the recommendations. A treatment algorithm has already been introduced at her hospital in Sweden to help doctors to prescribe appropriate lipid-lowering treatment for patients who have had a myocardial infarction. It has been noted that patients achieve their treatment goals earlier and two months after the infarction twice as many patients have reduced their bad cholesterol to the target level, compared with previously. 

""Several other hospitals in Sweden have also adopted the algorithm and there are similar examples from other countries that have produced as good results. My hope is that even more will review their procedures, so that more patients will get the right treatment in time, and we can thereby prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","‘It goes beyond winning': Emma Hayes is all-in when it comes to women's soccer","https://www.cnn.com/sport/emma-hayes-uswnt-womens-soccer-interview-spc/index.html","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:52:00 GMT","


            Emma Hayes had only been head coach of the US Women's National Team for a few months when she led them to an Olympic gold medal last August.
    


            It was the highest-profile success in a career that had included winning 15 trophies in 12 years as manager of Chelsea, including five straight league titles.
    


            But speaking to CNN's Amanda Davies at the end of last year, Hayes said that for her, football is about more than just the silverware.
    


            “I enjoy winning, but it's not my motivator,” she said. “I think creating inspiring environments for people to thrive in and creating a landscape where women in particular can thrive and develop, grow, be given opportunity — that's what I get out of bed for every day.”
    


            Hayes has advocated for women in football throughout her career, unsurprising considering that her dad once told her “to change the face of women's football.”
    


            She grew up in the London neighborhood of Camden, where her dad was active in the football community, starting a local league, and Hayes was equally obsessed with the sport.
    


            “I was the kid that would come home from school, drop my school bag, run down to the pitch, play till 10 at night,” she recalled.
    


            A warren of music venues, markets and counterculture, Camden is famous for producing artists, actors and campaigners. “I think this diverse, eclectic, little left-of-center place that's Camden, with our market and multicultural neighborhood, I think has had such a big impact on who I am,” Hayes said.
    


            A skiing accident at the age of 17 ended her nascent playing career. She studied for a master's degree in intelligence and international affairs, but in 2002 she returned to football, starting her career as a coach in the US.
    


            Hayes' first coaching job was with the Long Island Lady Riders. They immediately won their conference and Hayes was made W-League Coach of the Year, before becoming head coach of the women's team at Iona College in New York, until 2005.
    


            She then spent two years winning multiple trophies as an assistant coach at Arsenal, returning to the US in 2008 to coach the Chicago Red Stars, one of the seven teams established as part of the new Women's Professional Soccer league. Though the team had a star roster, including Megan Rapinoe, they struggled, finishing sixth out of seven in 2009 and 2010, and Hayes was fired.
    


            But Hayes says she has that experience to thank for her future success.
    


            “Without being fired, I don't think I'd be the coach that I am,” she told CNN. “I think that shapes you, and I think you should be fired. I think it's good for the soul because it develops that little bit of resilience that's required.”
    


            After the Chicago Red Stars, Hayes spent some time away from coaching, but in 2012 she became the manager of Chelsea, leading them to unprecedented success.
    


            It was that success that paved the way for her to take the top job with the US Women's National Team. But just as that coaching role came up in 2023, Hayes' dad died, and she was caught between her dream job and her grieving family.
    


            “The last thing I wanted to do was abandon anyone,” she said. “I didn't want to abandon Mum. My sisters needed me. We all needed each other. And all I kept thinking was, ‘I can't do this. This is selfish.'”
    


            “And then I kept hearing my dad in the background going, ‘This is what you worked your whole life for, this is the one you want.'”
    


            She was driving to work one morning when she heard his voice, telling her: “You have got to go to that interview, you have got to get that job.” She rang her agent and said: “I've got to go. My dad wants me to do it.”

            Coaching the most dominant team in the history of international women's football, and the winner of four Women's World Cup titles, has given her an even bigger opportunity to advocate for women's football. “I want to use my platform and my voice to support women front and center,” she said.
    


            Hayes is glad to be back in the US, where she thinks there is more equality in football than in her home country. “We've got a long way to go in our culture in England to be able to see the value of women in football,” she said.
    


            “There is always a greater sense that the game of football in England is only for males,” she added.
    


            “Unfortunately, still with football, everything is modeled on the men's game. So we say, ‘oh, we've got to run teams like the men's game. You've got a coach them like the men's game.' Why do we have to do that?”
    


            In 2024, Hayes won the women's Johan Cruyff Trophy, the inaugural Ballon d'Or award for the world's best coach, but Hayes believes there's plenty still to play for. “Beyond doing the sport I love, I believe I was put on this Earth to build women's soccer out in a certain way, to push the envelope, to be strategic about that. And it goes beyond winning.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Phallon Tulllis-Joyce: Diving into the mix to be the USWNT's next no.1","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/phallon-tulllis-joyce-uswnt-goalkeeper-journey","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 17:25:00 GMT","

A self-proclaimed late bloomer in the goalkeeping world, could Tullis-Joyce be the answer to the USWNT's shot-stopper vacancy?

Phallon Tullis-Joyce knows all about patience.

Whether it is plunging 130ft down into the depths of the ocean, or waiting to become Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper, the football player is well-versed in the art of biding her time.

The 28-year-old is considered a late bloomer in the sport, something relatively common for those who spend their career between the goalposts.

A move to England two years ago represented a new phase in her career, one that was duly rewarded with a senior debut for the United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) in April 2025.

When she is not on the pitch, though, you can find her scouring the ocean for wildlife.

“I was obsessed with soccer from the start and I was obsessed with marine biology from the start,” she said in an interview with the Guardian.

“I always knew that those were my paths.”

But for now, at least, she is focused on diving into a new opportunity – one that could see her assume the no.1 spot for the USWNT.

Tullis-Joyce's debut for the USWNT.

Phallon has loved the ocean for as long as she can remember.

“I just fell in love with how much mystery there is,” she revealed to Just Women's Sports.

“When you go underwater, you will never see the same thing twice.

“The animals and their adaptations and how they've evolved to exist underwater – it just blows my mind every single time.”

Her passion led to qualifications, majoring in marine biology at university before becoming deep-diving certified up to 130ft.

It's not something she enjoys alone, though. In fact, she is working with the Manchester community to give her vast knowledge of sea life to children in schools.

“I've had a great time being with the community and helping out in any way that I can; I just love shedding any kind of light on how awesome our oceans are,” she told the club website.

“At the schools, the kids are incredible and love learning too… I think it's super important to be part of our community, especially as professional athletes.

“So many people helped me along the way, and this is my way of giving a little back; all that I have learned that's been passed and shared with me – passing that on to future generations is what I'd like to do.”

A post shared by phallon (@phallon)

A handful of goalkeepers are in the mix to become Emma Hayes's next no.1 for the United States, following the international retirement of Alyssa Naeher late last year.

Tullis-Joyce is a bit of a latecomer to the party, earning her first call to camp last November.

She proved once again that patience is a virtue, continuing to work on her game before being rewarded with her debut against Brazil in April.

To top it off, the ocean enthusiast kept a clean sheet on her first appearance.

At the time of writing, this season has seen Tullis-Joyce play 25 games for Manchester United, conceding just 10 goals and earning a staggering 17 shutouts.

“I've been a little bit of a late bloomer for a goalkeeper,” she admitted.

“My progress has been a little slower, but you can still have your time… I still believe that no matter what age you are, you can still grow – I'm still learning plenty of new things.

“I want to show my communication skills and own it. I want to be a strong force at the back.”

She spent much of last season waiting in the wings, learning from England's Mary Earps, preparing for her moment in the spotlight.

“As much as learning can be painful sometimes, it has been such a great growth experience for me to be exposed to the national team environment and see what it takes to play at the top level,” she told Sky Sports.

“It was a massive eye-opener and [I'm excited] to keep growing for Manchester United and hopefully for my country.”","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'olympics.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","A Golden summer is vital for USMNT's progress","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/gold-cup/2025/4/14/24406242/usa-usmnt-gold-cup-progress-win-trophy-2026-world-cup-mentality","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:29:08 GMT","

Filed under:

The team's performance at the Gold Cup has become incredibly important.

The United States Men's National Team recently learned who they would face in the group stage of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, setting the stage for their summer competition. The Gold Cup marks the final competitive matches the USMNT will have before they co-host the 2026 World Cup. 

For the USMNT, this summer's Gold Cup has become vital to demonstrate the progress that fans have been hoping to see in the leadup to the World Cup. Since the 2022 World Cup ended, the USMNT have participated in five official competitions, with the schedule set up for the team (along with Canada and Mexico) to continue to test themselves while preparing for the World Cup as co-hosts). The results started out okay but have since trended downwards:

The results of the 2024 Copa América prompted U.S. Soccer to make at change at the head coaching position, replacing Gregg Berhalter with Mauricio Pochettino. However, the team under Pochettino failed to win the Concacaf Nations League after winning the first three editions of the tournament. That has placed even more pressure on the team and the coach to perform well this summer and claim the Gold Cup title.

As the team was seeking to test itself against the best teams in the world, the general sentiment was that playing teams from Concacaf - outside of maybe Mexico - was not helping the team get better. However, they have failed to win in 3 of the 5 major tournaments since the 2022 World Cup, and Concacaf was involved in each of them. Panama has either eliminated or helped to eliminate the USMNT from each of those tournaments, further adding to the idea that the team needs to focus on beating the teams in front of them in the region.

Group D at the Gold Cup will pose some challenges, with the USMNT facing Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in June in San Jose, Austin, and Dallas. Trinidad & Tobago has beaten them twice in official competitions in the past 8 seasons dating back to that fateful night in Couva, while Haiti has always given the USMNT trouble. Saudi Arabia and the USMNT drew in a pre-World Cup friendly in September 2022, but the Saudis are not scared of any team and will try to take it to a United States team that many think are reeling.

So, to ensure that progress is made, what does that mean for the USMNT? It means that the approach needs to be serious with the goal to win while putting their best foot forward. It is expected that Mauricio Pochettino will bring his A roster to the Gold Cup, outside of the players who may be injured and those players (Tim Weah, Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna) who will be unavailable due to the Club World Cup. 

It will not be a time for experimentation. The team needs to inject some positivity into the fanbase, to show them that they can be once again comfortable in defending home turf during a major tournament. They have to play with the vigor that will be needed to make a run at the World Cup and that vigor, tenacity, never quit mentality shouldn't fluctuate based on the perceived level of the opponent. How the team feels it should play in order to beat Germany should be how they play against Grenada or Guatemala. How they fought to try and beat England in the 2022 World Cup should be how they take the field in the Concacaf Nations League against El Salvador. The toughness that is present in a draw against Brazil cannot be absent in a match against Belize.

A big step is recognizing that the improvement needs to come and the awareness that it starts with each player individually bringing the passion to USMNT camp every time. “The mentality has to change,” Tyler Adams said before the Concacaf Nations League third place match against Canada. “We've had good talks about where we are and where we need to go, just an honest evaluation and then there needs to be a response.” Fans didn't see it against Canada, which was another loss, but fans want to see that mentality this summer. The Gold Cup, and the preceding friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, will be the last prime opportunity for the team to show they can win a major tournament on home soil.

Ultimately, Mauricio Pochettino wants the fans to be positive about the outlook of the United States Men's National Team. “I want to send the message to the fans: don't be pessimistic or get bad feelings,” he said after the loss to Canada back on March 23rd. “I don't want the people to feel pessimistic. Disappointed? Disappointed, we are all. And the fans need to feel the disappointment that we didn't win. But I don't want to allow (them) to feel pessimistic, because I think we have good players. We are going to find a way to perform. And for sure we are going to compete in a different way. And (at) the end, we are going to get different results than [against Panama] and [Canada].”

If the USMNT can't get to the Gold Cup final with a real chance to claim the team's eighth Gold Cup title, the pessimism will only grow. And on the cusp of the biggest moment in American men's soccer history, the last thing the USMNT want to do is to flub on the sitter and blow a great opportunity to create a lasting legacy. Regret can't be on the menu in 2027, but it could be if they blow the amazing opportunity 2026 presents.

Winning the Gold Cup won't mean that the team will emerge as the favorites to win the World Cup. It will give the fanbase some much needed juice and it will give everyone confidence. That's going to be much needed as they prepare to host the world, and it's why the 2025 Gold Cup is so vital to the USMNT's progress on the path towards success.

The Italian giants will be among the top contenders to take the trophy as they look to build on recent success

After a decade of Juventus dominance at the very top of Italian soccer, Serie A has become as entertaining as any league in the world. With a number of strong teams, the country's top flight has gone from Europe's most predictable league to one of its most unpredictable.

Of those top sides, Inter Milan have come closest to shedding the ""very good"" label in favor of a ""great."" They've won the league twice in the last four years and, if results hold, they'll win it again this year.

On the continent, they have a Champions League final run on their resume, too, proving that they can win at every level. They're Italy's model club. No team in the world wants to face Inter.

They'll get another chance to showcase that in the Club World Cup. Their Champions League successes put them in a position to go toe-to-toe with the game's elite. Led by stars all over the field, Inter will head to the United States this summer with both belief and expectations. This is a team that can win, one that has the talent, experience and mentality to go out and beat anyone in their path.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Al Hilal will fly the flag for the Roshn Saudi League at this summer's expanded FIFA Club Word Cup 2025 in the United States, when they compete against a selection of the most prominent clubs in football.

The Riyadh giants, the reigning RSL champions, have been drawn in the inaugural edition of the 32-team tournament in Group H, alongside Real Madrid, FC Salzburg and CF Pachuca.

RSL champions also drawn against FC Salzburg and Pachuca

In fact, Al Hilal open their campaign against the current European champions, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on June 18. It's an opponent Al Hilal goalkeeper Yassine Bono knows well after faced them 10 times during his time in Spain with Girona and Sevilla.

The Moroccan, the 2023-24 RSL Goalkeeper of the Season, spoke to FIFA about helping the Saudi Arabian side make a splash on the global stage in a few months' time.

How excited are you to take part in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025?

“We at Al Hilal are honoured, as a club and as players, to participate in the first edition of the [expanded] FIFA Club World Cup, and we look forward to delivering a performance worthy of Al Hilal.”

Al Hilal goalkeeper Yassine Bono is the reigning RSL Goalkeeper of the Season

What does it mean to you to play against Real Madrid, and does it have a different flavour playing against them for Al Hilal in the world's most prestigious club competition?

“I've played against Real a lot; I have many friends in the team, and I've always met their fans on the streets of Spain. I've always had mutual respect for the club and its supporters.

""I've faced a lot of great teams throughout my career, and I'm privileged that Real Madrid is one of them, and it's a great honour to do it again wearing the Al Hilal shirt, which is a world-famous club in its own right.

“There are no easy games in modern football, and that certainly applies to this tournament. We want to go as far as possible. As a Moroccan player at a World Cup, I aspire to reach a level I have never reached before.”

You honed your skills at Wydad AC and Atletico Madrid. Would you like to face either of them in the next round?

“Honestly, I'd rather not face them [laughs], but I hope they achieve the best and reach the highest levels.”

What do you expect the atmosphere to be like in the USA, with fans flocking in from around the world?

“Since a World Cup is a tournament that brings together many cultures from all over the world in one country and one stadium, I'm sure the atmosphere will be amazing.”

Al Hilal has recently expanded its fan base, with supporters now all over the world. How do you feel about playing in front of North American fans, who usually only follow you on TV?

“As part of our position in the Arab world, we recognise the value of the fans and realise how important they will be for us at the Club World Cup.

""Great teams seek to reach a larger audience in a tournament like this. We already have fans on different continents, and our participation is a positive thing for them.”

How do you feel about playing this tournament in the USA, one of the co-hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup?

“Every player in the world wishes to have the opportunity to represent his country in the World Cup, but now there is a new opportunity thanks to the Club World Cup. I am honoured to represent Al Hilal in this tournament and, God willing, we will perform at our best.”

FIFA unveiled its team of 117 match officials on Monday for the inaugural Club World Cup and said referees would wear body cameras and enforce stricter goalkeeper time-wasting rules at the tournament to be staged across the United States.

The FIFA Referees Committee appointed the officials from 41 member associations - 35 referees, 58 assistant referees and 24 video match officials - for the June 14 to July 13 event.

Body cameras will provide fans with unprecedented views of on-field action, FIFA said, while goalkeepers who hold the ball beyond eight seconds will now see opponents awarded corner kicks rather than indirect free kicks.

""We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision, which was never offered before,"" said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee.

""It also has a purpose in terms of referee coaching because, of course, having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing.""

Collina highlighted the historic nature of the appointments for the expanded tournament featuring 32 teams from all six FIFA confederations and spanning 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. host cities.

""The selected referees are among those who have the privilege to be part of this for the first time, so I'm sure that all the match officials will be thrilled,"" he said.

""We are coming from high-standard performances delivered during the last FIFA tournaments. So the bar is higher and when you set the bar higher it's more difficult to keep the standard. But we are working very hard and 'Team One' will make a solid contribution to the success of this exciting competition.""

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin explains why a 64-team World Cup is a ""bad idea."" (0:28)

Concacaf president Victor Montagliani has joined other confederations in opposing the proposal of CONMEBOL leader Alejandro Domínguez to expand the World Cup to 64 teams for the 2030 edition of the international tournament.

Domínguez introduced the official proposal to broaden the competition during an online meeting of FIFA's ruling council, insisting the tournament grow from the traditional 32 participants to 64.

""At Concacaf, we've shown that we are open to change by supporting the Women's World Cup expansion and the continuous evolution of our Confederation's men's and women's national team and club events,"" Montagliani told ESPN.

""I don't believe expanding the men's World Cup to 64 teams is the right move for the tournament itself and the broader football ecosystem, from national teams to club competitions, leagues, and players.""

FIFA will already be testing a new 48-team format for the 2026 World Cup, but Domínguez emphasized more can be done with a larger scale tournament.

""We haven't even kicked off the new 48-team World Cup yet, so personally, I don't think that expanding to 64 teams should even be on the table.""

UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin also expressed dissent for the proposal by Domínguez, labeling the thought of expansion a ""bad idea.""

""I think it's a bad idea -- it's not a good idea for the World Cup itself and it's not a good idea for our qualifiers as well,"" he said. ""So, I am not supporting that idea. I don't know where it came from but it's strange that we didn't know anything before this proposal at the FIFA Council.""

While Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa maintains that growth at this rate would incite chaos.

""If the issue remains open to change, then the door will not only be open to expanding the tournament to 64 teams,"" said Salman at the 35th AFC Congress.

""But someone might come along and demand raising the number to 132 teams. Where would we end up then? It would become chaos.""

The 2026 World Cup will be testing a new format for the first time in tournament history, seeing 48 teams compete for the coveted trophy across stadiums in the United States, Mexico and Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will miss Wendesday's Champions League clash between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich.

This is confirmed by German tabloid BILD, via FCInterNews. They report that the 39-year-old will not recover from a calf injury in time for the crucial knockout match.

Bayern Munich have been without a number of players for their Champions League tie against Inter Milan.

Jamal Musiala is the biggest name absentee. However, injuries to all of Alphonso Davies, Dayot Upamecano, and Hiroki Ito have also decimated the Bavarians' defense.

Meanwhile, Bayern captain Manuel Neuer has been out for a few weeks with a thorny calf injury.

The 39-year-old has not yet managed to make his return to training.

Whilst Neuer has been out, Jonas Urbig has started in the veteran's place.

The young keeper was in the Bayern starting eleven for the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal tie against Inter.

And Urbig will once again start for the Bavarians on Wednesday.

According to BILD, keeper Manuel Neuer will not be able to recover in time for the second leg against Inter.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

He will be 38 by the time the football World Cup rolls in June next year, but Lionel Messi, seems ready to create history by becoming the first man to play in six football World Cups. That is according to his longtime club team-mate and Uruguay's Luis Suarez.

In an interview with Ovación de El País Uruguay, Suarez was asked if he talks about retirement with Messi. “No, no… Yes, we often talk jokingly,” he said at first, before revealing that Messi “has that desire to play in next year's World Cup too.”

“Obviously, after being away from the national team, that's been lost a bit more on my side than on his. But we haven't talked about it yet (retirement). We can talk about it until we're older, and we can make the decision, but we haven't really talked in detail,” Lucho concluded.

Jorge Mas, owner of Inter Miami, had already hinted at it last week, when he said that Messi's contract renewal at Inter Miami that ends in December depends on Messi's “desire, given his health, to play and defend the world cup in the United States with Argentina”.

A fortnight back, after Argentina had qualified for the world cup, their coach Lionel Scaloni had spoken about the need not to pressurise Messi. “”We will see what happens, there's plenty of time,” Scaloni said. “We must go one game a time otherwise [we] will be speaking about the same thing the rest of the year and we need to leave him alone, we will see. He will decide it whenever he wants, let's not drive him crazy with this.”

Over the next two years, Philadelphia will become the world's stage for several international sporting events. In addition to hosting the World Cup during the summer of 2026, a new tournament called the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will be played in Philadelphia this summer.

The city will host eight matches in the new tournament. Group play begins at Lincoln Financial Field on June 16 and concludes with a quarterfinal match on July 4.

On Thursday, April 10, FIFA president Gianni Infantino visited Lincoln Financial Field to announce the tournament. It will bring 32 teams from six international FIFA confederations to 11 U.S. cities this summer, including Philadelphia.

""We have fans from Chelsea, or [Manchester] City, or Real Madrid. They come from all over the world, and they will come to the United States. They will come to Philadelphia,"" Infantino said in a media statement shared with CBS News Philadelphia. ""We thought that Philadelphia is such a great city that we'll bring another World Cup to Philadelphia as well this year."" 

Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said the tournament will help Philadelphia reach ""the next level as being a global hub for entertainment, culture, and sports.""

Soccer isn't the only big sporting event that will take place in Philadelphia. Next year, in 2026, the city will host the MLB All-Star Game at Citizens Bank Park. It's the fifth time that the city has hosted the event. The Wells Fargo Center will be the center of sports action. That's for the first and second rounds of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship. Finally, the PGA Championship will be held May 11 to 17 at Aronimink Golf Club in Newton Square.

Rodri's season-ending injury means he won't be defending the trophy he won in 2024 - so who are the main contenders to succeed the Spaniard?

If you thought the days of the Ballon d'Or generating headlines were over after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's era of dominance came to an end, then think again. After one of the most closely-fought races for a number of years, Rodri came out on top in 2024, beating Vinicius Jr into second place as Real Madrid dramatically boycotted the ceremony in Paris in protest at their star player missing out.

Unfortunately for Rodri, he will be unable to defend his crown in 2025, with the Manchester City midfielder having suffered a season-ending knee injury in September. The door, then, is open for a whole host of players to succeed the Spain star, and the race for the Golden Ball is heating up as we enter the final weeks of the European campaign.

The 2024-25 season doesn't have the same international tournaments as its two predecessors, and so the destination of the Ballon d'Or will be decided solely by club performances. That opens it up to all sorts of individuals who might not share the same success with their countries as others, while there is also the prospect of the new-look Club World Cup to consider.

So, who are the favourites for the most prestigious individual prize in world football? As always, GOAL is here every step of the way to track the contenders and the pretenders with our Ballon d'Or Power Rankings - check out who is in contention...

The Monte Carlo Masters have closed their doors for another year after Carlos Alcaraz won the ATP 1000 tournament.

Alcaraz beat Lorenzo Musetti to win the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time, as he now rises to world number two in the ATP rankings.

Following his biggest title win of the 2025 season so far, Alcaraz has received messages from Novak Djokovic and many other tennis players.

The ATP tournament has been on its own since 1983, with former top 10 player John Isner suggesting a WTA Monte Carlo tournament for the future.

After Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters, tournament director David Massey fielded questions from the media in his post-match press conference.

Massey, who previously worked for the ATP Tour, has been the Monte Carlo Masters tournament director for three years now.

When the subject of whether the WTA Tour could play in Monte Carlo in the future was broached, Massey did not rule it out, but confirmed that there are no talks of it happening in the near future.

“It's a good question. I think at this stage right now there are no concrete plans to change our format,” said Massey. “So for next year we know our dates are already set, so we are on the 4th through 12th of April, a nine-day event with a 56 draw men's singles, so the same format of the other two draws.

“We obviously remain open to introducing the WTA into our competition into the tournament. I believe that would require us to have more days for the event and a shift in date by at least one week to accommodate that.

“Nothing planned at this stage but not to be ruled out in the future either. The best product I believe would be a combined event and not back to back. So we are really, if it does happen in the future, it will be combined.

“Having said that, I think that the format we have right now works extremely well with a men's competition. Intensity that we see with this format I think is really — I think it's one of the best formats in tennis.

“As a reminder, the cutoff to enter this tournament, the top 45 players get into the draw directly, so we had a 48 original cutoff, with very few players actually not able to play this event.

“So we had a very healthy player field overall, and I think that it's very tough to play this tournament, and the first rounds are very, very competitive. We saw this with some big matches from the first day.

“Even the qualifying is very competitive. Players who normally go straight into main draw in Indian Wells, Miami, and other tournaments of 96 draws or Grand Slams, cannot play here directly.

“So it's a format I think that delivers to fans intense and very competitive tennis, very high-level tennis, and for that, I think, you know, we are in a great position for the future, as well.”

The Monte Carlo Masters is one of only two ATP 1000 tournaments that remains as a one-week event, alongside the Paris Masters tournament.

It has previously held a WTA tournament that was last held in 1982, with Romanian Virginia Ruzici winning the title.

That was not the only question that Massey was asked about a potential women's event, with a follow-up question concerning whether the WTA have put any pressure on the Monte Carlo Masters.

Massey shut down the idea of any pressure being put on, but did not say that no enquiries had been made by the WTA Tour.

“I wouldn't say pressure, no. I wouldn't use the word ‘pressure',” said Massey. “But again, we are not in active discussion to integrate a WTA tournament at this stage. 

“There is no pressure; nor are we saying that we would never do that either. It's just not an action item at this point.”

The 2026 edition of the Monte Carlo Masters main draw will take place between April 5-12. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

It's fitting that Roland Garros, the Grand Slam event that requires the most patience and fitness, would also have the longest pre-tournament itinerary. For the King of Clay, Rafael Nadal, the road to the throne was this simple: Kick it off in Monte Carlo and play like gangbusters all the way to the close of business in Paris. Many a year, for example, Nadal would tear his way through Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Madrid and Rome, all preludes to yet another title run at Roland Garros.For others, the proper calibration of effort and output, fitness and freshness, is less certain, the path to Paris lined with many challenging venues and opponents. With the first big event of this epic swing, the Monte Carlo Masters, now in the books, here are a few early clay season plot lines worthy of attention.

For others, the proper calibration of effort and output, fitness and freshness, is less certain, the path to Paris lined with many challenging venues and opponents. With the first big event of this epic swing, the Monte Carlo Masters, now in the books, here are a few early clay season plot lines worthy of attention.

Over the course of one week in Monte Carlo, Alcaraz lost the first set in three of his five victories, including the opener of the final versus an inspired Lorenzo Musetti. But, swiftly overcoming these slow starts, Alcaraz by Sunday night had earned his 18th career title.Over recent months, amid a few surprising losses, Alcaraz's approach to tennis has been extensively dissected. His post-finals press conference revealed a desire to tune out those voices. “So I just realized that I don't have to think about all they talking about and just focus on myself,” he said. “So I'm not gonna say I just proved them, that they're wrong, but I just really happy to be able to refocus the important things and just be focused on myself and the part that I have to follow with my team, with my close people, and just playing for myself. So I'm just really happy that I was able to do it.”To analyze Alcaraz requires new levels of understanding. Akin to such athletic geniuses as basketball star Steph Curry, hockey legend Sidney Crosby, and football great Patrick Mahomes, Alcaraz is a generational talent—someone who has tremendously expanded the dimensions of how his sport is played. With that in mind, my thoughts on Alcaraz's often distinct and seemingly adventurous choices when it comes to shot selection: In the spirit of Curry's three-pointers, it's not reckless if you own it. Alcaraz has repeatedly proven credible by generating significant results, most notably having earned four majors on three different surfaces before even turning 22. That said, having lost earlier than desired during the Sunshine Swing, Alcaraz's Monte Carlo run has put him on a good path towards defending his Roland Garros title.

Nadal built his clay court empire from the same foundation laid down by such clay court greats as Bjorn Borg, Guillermo Vilas, Ivan Lendl, Mats Wilander, Thomas Muster, Jim Courier, Sergei Bruguera, and Juan Carlos Ferrero. It was a highly physical model, predicated most of all on the ability to wear down opponents with depth, consistency, and movement. For all the extraordinary shots Nadal frequently came up with, his success, and that for those cited above, was largely built on patterns and predictability. Exhibit A for the prosecution: Nadal's crosscourt forehand.There are two ways to overcome this highly reliable playing style. One is to do it better, as Borg did when he repeatedly beat Vilas. Consider '24 Roland Garros finalist Alexander Zverev a contemporary version, who in his second round loss to Matteo Berrettini came up on the short end of a 48-ball rally. Monte Carlo semifinalist Alex de Minaur—a citizen of both Spain and Australia—plays somewhat similarly, his game based on tremendous footspeed. While less powerful than Zverev, de Minaur has an ability to take time away by hitting the ball early.Another way to overcome the attrition-based baseliner is to innovate and trot out a wide range of speeds, spins, and shots. Alcaraz, Musetti, Arthur Fils, and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina are just a few of the current crop of stylists who have transformed clay court tennis. While these players can sustain their share of long rallies, they are also eager to explore the dimensions of the court with power and angles, aggression and touch. For these kinds of players, the motto is: Grinding only carries you so far. The time has come to create.

Given that Djokovic will turn 38 in a month, it shouldn't be surprising these days to see him exit early at any tournament. In Monte Carlo, Djokovic lost his opening match to Alejandro Tabilo. Afterwards, Djokovic said, “I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect.” That Djokovic said he knew he'd play poorly makes me wonder if he has a highly troubling injury. As Djokovic pursues a fourth Roland Garros title, will he get in enough match play—say, five matches—prior to showing up in Paris?One-Handed BackhandsOf Monte Carlo's eight quarterfinalists, three have one-handed backhands—Musetti, Grigor Dimitrov, Stefanos Tsitsipas. If on the one hand, clay's high bounces can pose difficulty for one-handers, clay's slow speed provides more time, perhaps most importantly when returning serve. Let's see how this plays out over the clay-court season. Or was Monte Carlo merely an outlier?

The last month had been rough for Andrey Rublev. In Dubai, Indian Wells, and Miami, he'd lost his opening match at each of those events—and all of those defeats came to players ranked no higher than 35. Temperamental as Rublev can be, he's always assessed himself with candor. So it was, seeking new ideas, just prior to Monte Carlo, Rublev added the mercurial Marat Safin to his team. “It was my feelings. There was no logic, no explanation,” Rublev told Tennis.com's Matt Fitzgerald of his decision to hire a man he's looked up to since childhood. That's an explanation straight out of Safin's playbook.During Safin's playing career, I was never sure how much he liked tennis. Then again, what do I really know about the motivations of this Hall of Fame inductee who won two singles majors and was ranked number one in the world? For all that, it surely would be fascinating to be a fly on the wall for any conversations—on any topic—between the persistently clear Rublev and the enigmatic Safin. In Monte Carlo, the Rublev played impressively to beat Gael Monfils, then lost to Fils.

A man with another crowd-pleasing one-hander has announced plans to retire following Roland Garros this year. The 38-year-old Gasquet's career has been a study in expectation and durability. At the age of nine, he was featured on the cover of a French tennis magazine, poised to strike his elegant backhand. The headline read: “The champion that France is waiting for?” That is quite a question to ask of any tennis player, much less a nine-year-old. Gasquet progressed nicely. While still a teenager, he beat Roger Federer in the quarters of Monte Carlo, losing to Nadal in three sets. Two years later, he was a Wimbledon semifinalist. And yet, for all the high hopes France held for Gasquet, he at heart proved more solid than flashy. Gasquet has won 16 ATP Tour singles titles and 22 times reached the round of 16 at a major. Let's hope this spring he sparkles with a few more backhand winners before at last bidding adieu to pro tennis.ATP Seeking New CEOMassimo Calvelli, CEO of the ATP, announced that he will be stepping down in June after just over five years on the job.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Casper Ruud believes he has a big advantage in two upcoming ATP tournaments which could help him climb the rankings","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/casper-ruud-believes-he-has-a-big-advantage-in-two-upcoming-atp-tournaments-which-could-help-him-climb-the-rankings/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Casper Ruud is looking ahead to defending his title at the upcoming ATP tournament in Barcelona.

Ruud is a two-time Roland Garros finalist, having finished runner-up to Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

However, the Norwegian did not make the best start to his 2025 clay court season, with Ruud losing in the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters to Alexei Popyrin.

Ruud did predict Alcaraz to win Monte Carlo though, as he now looks ahead to the upcoming tournaments on his favorite surface.

Ruud's next tournament is the Barcelona Open, where he won the biggest title of his career to date last year after beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the 2024 final.

This means that Ruud, who has already dropped 550 points from reaching the Monte Carlo Masters final last year, has to defend a further 500 points in Barcelona.

However, when speaking in his pre-tournament press conference ahead of the Barcelona Open, Ruud pointed out that he actually has the chance to gain points during clay court tournaments in Madrid and Rome.

“Most of my points come from clay court tournaments,” said Ruud. “I have some other results on hard courts, but honestly, last fall was quite disappointing for me. I didn't win many matches at all.

“Fortunately, I somehow salvaged a few wins for Turin [ATP Finals] and made it to the semi-finals there, so I still have something to fall back on. This week, obviously, I'm the defending champion, but in Madrid and Rome, I have almost no points to defend, so that really helps me relax a little.”

Ruud won only two of his four matches in Madrid and Rome last year, meaning that he only has 110 points to defend across those two ATP Masters 1000 tournaments.

Despite appearing to feel positive about his ranking points total, Ruud still has a lot of pressure during this part of the season.

Ruud has endured a mixed start to the year so far, having won only 11 of his 18 matches and currently sits at 28th in the race to the ATP Finals.

The current world number 10 has 2,490 points to defend until the end of the 2025 season, with 67% of those from clay court tournaments.

Although he has 800 points from reaching the semi-finals of the clay court major last year, Ruud has been predicted to win Roland Garros by a former world number 11.

Before he can even think about Roland Garros, Ruud will first turn his attention towards defending the Barcelona Open title.

Ruud begins his campaign against Colombian Daniel Elahi Galan, who he has beaten in both of their two previous meetings.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emilio Nava is enjoying the form of his life on the ATP Challenger Tour.


The 23-year-old claimed his third consecutive title at that level Sunday when he triumphed at the Elizabeth Moore Sarasota Open in Florida. Nava, seeded fifth, downed Liam Draxl 6-2, 7-6(2) in the final.


Nava is on a 15-match winning streak, including title runs at the South American clay events in Asuncion, Paraguay and Concepcion, Chile. The California native is just the second American to win three clay-court Challenger titles in the same season. Tristan Boyer, who is the same age as Nava, accomplished the feat last year.




Nava and Borna Coric are the only players this season with three Challenger trophies.


A five-time Challenger champion, Nava is up 29 places to No. 140 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Last April, he reached a career high No. 124.

Collignon continues breakthrough season
Another standout player on the ATP Challenger Tour this year is Belgian Raphael Collignon, who captured his second trophy of 2025. The 23-year-old won the Atkinsons Monza Open, having defeated Ukraine's Vitaliy Sachko 6-3, 7-5 in the final.

“It was a difficult tournament with a lot of great players. I just tried to focus on my game, take it match by match,” Collignon said. “Sometimes some tough battles, but I tried to play my best tennis when it mattered and I played good all week. I'm very happy to take the title. I was confident in myself and I think that made the difference.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic's rankings challenge to Taylor Fritz ahead of French Open","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/novak-djokovic-vs-taylor-fritz-battle-top-4-french-open-seeding","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:02:52 GMT","

The clay season is underway and, while there are plenty of big events still to come, it is hard not to already have one eye on the French Open.

Action at Roland Garros begins in the final week of May, and before then, several of the leading stars of the ATP Tour will be looking to get themselves into the best position possible.

That largely involves trying to seal the best seeding and, while Jannik Sinner looks set to be the top seed, things look a little up in the air elsewhere.

Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev are set to battle it out to try and seal the second seeding ahead of Paris, while there is also a crucial battle between world No 4 Taylor Fritz and No 5 Novak Djokovic.

Whether Djokovic is a top-four seed or not could have a significant effect on his hopes of winning a 25th Grand Slam singles title; here, we look at how things could pan out over the coming weeks.

For both Djokovic and Fritz's hopes at Roland Garros, avoiding a meeting against the likes of Sinner, Alcaraz, and Zverev until the semi-final stage will likely be key.

That is where being the fourth seed will provide a huge advantage, as it will ensure that that player – whoever it may prove to be – will be the highest-ranked player in their quarter.

The fourth seed cannot face one of the top three until at least the semi-final stage, while two of the top three players will be on the other side of the draw.

Whoever ends up being the fifth seed will be in the same quarter as one of the top four seeds, meaning they risk meeting one of Sinner, Alcaraz, and Zverev as early as the last eight.

As of Monday's ATP Rankings update, Fritz has a solid cushion as the world No 4 – with Djokovic having lost some ground to the American.

Djokovic lost in round two of the Monte Carlo Masters last week, meaning he failed to match his semi-final showing from 2025, and has therefore dropped 390 ranking points.

In contrast, Fritz, who withdrew from the event due to injury, only dropped 10 ranking points he was defending after he lost in the second round 12 months ago.

Fritz currently sits on 5,280 ranking points, while Djokovic is 1,160 adrift on 4,120 points.

Carlos Alcaraz reveals key lesson he has learned after Monte Carlo Masters triumph

Chasing down Fritz will not be easy, but there is one significant advantage that Djokovic currently has.

The Serbian is defending very few ranking points in the run-up to Roland Garros, with the seedings set to be sorted following the conclusion of the Italian Open – one week before the second major of 2024.

Djokovic missed the ATP 1000 event in Madrid last year and then lost in the third round of the Italian Open in Rome, earning just 50 points.

With the 24-time Grand Slam champion currently set to compete at both events this spring, that potentially hands him a sizeable opportunity to boost his top-four hopes.

And, his hopes will also be boosted because Fritz has significantly more ranking points to defend than him.

The American embarked on a strong clay swing in 2024, with one highlight being a run to the final at the Munich Open in Germany.

However, due to the same abdominal injury that ruled him out of Monte Carlo, Fritz is not in Munich in 2025 – and will drop 165 points as a result.

Next Monday, Fritz will have 5,115 points to his name, decreasing the cushion he has over Djokovic ever so slightly to 995 points.

After Munich, the world No 4 then has 400 semi-final points to defend in Madrid, and 200 quarter-final points in Rome; take those away, and he has 4,515 to his name.

In contrast, Djokovic will only drop to 4,070 with his Rome points removed, decreasing the gap between the two to just 445 points.

While that is still a slight cushion, and the chance of the Fritz dropping all those points is unlikely, the door may be open for Djokovic considering his rival's ongoing injury concerns.

A strong run in just one of Madrid or Rome could prove enough for the 24-time Grand Slam winner to seal a top-four seeding at the second major of the year.

Over the past two decades, one man has loomed large over the clay-court season.

Rafael Nadal may have called time on his career in 2024, but the ‘King of Clay's legacy on the dirt looms large over this part of the year, with the Spaniard redefining dominance with his exploits.

With the first clay season since his retirement now upon us, we look back at the five most dominant clay events of his extraordinary career.

Nadal first won the Madrid Open title in 2005 when the event was held on indoor hard courts, though he would triumph a further four times after the event switched to outdoor clay in 2009.

The Spaniard won his first clay title in his home capital city in 2010, beating Roger Federer in the final, and would later down Stan Wawrinka in the 2013 final.

Nadal lifted the title again in 2014, following Kei Nishikori's retirement in the deciding set, before beating Dominic Thiem in the 2017 final to claim his final title.

He was also the runner-up in 2009 to Federer, in 2011 to Novak Djokovic, and in 2015 to Andy Murray.

One of the most historic clay court events of them all, Nadal won a staggering 10 titles at the Italian Open in Rome.

Nadal beat Guillermo Coria in an epic five-setter for his first title in 2005, before beating Federer in an equally enthralling five-set final in 2006.

After breezing past Fernando Gonzalez in the 2007 final, the Spaniard would regain his crown in 2009 with victory over Djokovic, before defeating David Ferrer in 2010 to claim his fifth title in Rome.

Nadal downed Djokovic for a sixth title in 2012 and Federer for his seventh in 2013, before ending a five-year wait for title No 8 in 2018 thanks to a three-set triumph over Alexander Zverev.

The Spaniard's last two triumphs in Rome would come thanks to victories over Djokovic in the 2019 and 2021 finals, bringing his haul up to double digits.

Nadal was beaten by Djokovic in both the 2011 and 2014 finals.

Nadal's most successful tournament at Masters 1000 level was the Monte Carlo Masters, where he won a staggering 11 titles from 2005 to 2018.

He defeated Coria in four sets to lift his first title two decades ago, kicking off a staggering run of eight straight victories in the principality.

Nadal saw off Federer in three straight finals from 2006-08 and then beat Djokovic in 2009, before further victories over Fernando Verdasco in 2010 and David Ferrer in 2011.

The former world No 1 then defeated Djokovic in the 2012 final for an eighth straight title, though the Serbian ended his rival's dominance with victory in 2013.

However, Nadal bounced back with a further three triumphs later on in the decade, starting with a three-set win over Gael Monfils in 2016.

That was followed by victories over Albert Ramos-Vinolas and Kei Nishikori in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

The ATP 500 event in Barcelona proved to be one of the most special tournaments of Nadal's career, with the ‘King of Clay' triumphing 12 times in front of his home fans.

Nadal downed Juan Carlos Ferrero in 2005 to start a run of five straight titles, beating Tommy Robredo in 2006, Guillermo Canas in 2007, and Ferrer in both 2008 and 2009.

After missing out in 2010, Nadal again beat Ferrer in the 2011 and 2012 finals to bring his haul up to seven titles, and he saw off Nicolas Almagro to capture an eighth title in 2013.

Nadal returned to winning ways in 2016 with victory over two-time defending champion Kei Nishikori in the final, and hit double digits by downing Thiem in 2017 for his 10th triumph.

The Spaniard then beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in both the 2018 and 2021 finals to complete his haul.

Undoubtedly one of the greatest records in sporting history, Nadal won 112 of 116 matches at the French Open – with 14 titles to his name.

Nadal triumphed over Mariano Puerta to lift the title on his tournament debut in 2005, and then beat Federer in three straight finals from 2006-08.

After a stunning loss to Robin Soderling in 2009, Nadal returned to title-winning ways in 2010 – this time beating the Swede in straight sets in the final.

That started a run of five consecutive triumphs for the Spaniard, who beat Federer in the 2011 final, Djokovic in both 2012 and 2014, and Ferrer in 2013.

Nadal was beaten by Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals and withdrew mid-event in 2016, though he thrashed Wawrinka in the 2017 final to become the first man to win 10 titles at any major in the Open Era.

The ‘King of Clay' then downed Thiem in back-to-back finals in 2018 and 2019, before beating Djokovic in the 2020 final – the last Grand Slam final contested between the two.

Djokovic beat Nadal in the 2021 semi-finals, but the Spaniard roared back in 2022, and beat Casper Ruud to claim his final French Open title – and his 22nd and final Grand Slam title.

Carlos Alcaraz fired a warning to Jannik Sinner as the Italian prepares to return to professional tennis next month by winning the Monte Carlo Masters. 

Alcaraz came from behind to beat Lorenzo Musetti and win his second title of the year to go alongside the Rotterdam Open prize he won back in February. 

Musetti fatigued badly after taking the opening set and that is a concern for him after enduring similar circumstances at other stages in his relatively short career to date. 

The win was a big one for Alcaraz, with the Spaniard firing a message to Sinner ahead of his return to tennis next month at the Italian Open event in his home country. 

The 21-year-old has now gone one place behind Sinner on the list of world rankings and now he will have the Italian player firmly in his sights. 

The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has been enthralling so far and the pair are fair and away the most consistent players on the tour at the moment. 

Sinner is a long way ahead of Alcaraz at the top of the world rankings, but it's hard to rule out the Spanish star going on a run and closing the gap further. 

Much like his compatriot Rafael Nadal, Alcaraz simply doesn't know when he's defeated and he will be keen to get another crack at Sinner for a title as the year progresses. 

Alcaraz was quizzed on the world rankings afterwards and he's suggested tennis fans want to see him playing Sinner in extremely big finals going forward. 

He said in his on-court interview: “Well, talking about the things that I learned the last couple of months or the last months is not thinking about anything else but enjoying on court.

“Something that I realized that I had to do is not think about anything else but enjoy. So I'm not thinking about the ranking anymore. Just keep going, making the things that I enjoy, that make me happy. It is a step on the court, showing good tennis, and that's it.

“If I win, it is great. If I don't win, I will learn and just keep going and making the things that make me happy. So the ranking is not my priority anymore, and let's see what's gonna happen in the next month until Roland Garros.

“Jannik and I, yeah, probably the people want that in the final. So let's see.”

This was a great win for Alcaraz even if Musetti did seemingly capitulate on the fitness front towards the end of the match. 

It will be a huge lift for Alcaraz to win the first tournament of the clay-court season and he will now have his eyes on the defence of his French Open title. 

Alcaraz received a one-word message from Boris Becker on X after the ATP Tour posted an image of the player celebrating his win. 

Word https://t.co/BefbctPMjY

The former star player simply said ‘word' and Alcaraz winning titles and smiling on a tennis court is always a sight for sore eyes. 

Alcaraz was always going to be among the favourites in Monte Carlo and it now appears that he's in fine fettle going into other clay-court tournaments this summer. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Alexander Zverev, currently ranked No. 3, seeks a clay-court resurgence after inconsistent form.  His Munich Open win provides hope, but he faces a tough road to the French Open, battling Alcaraz and Sinner for top ranking.

Newsletter

Alexander Zverev, currently ranked No. 3, is facing a crucial period on the clay courts.  After a strong start to the year culminating in the Australian Open final, his form has dipped, leading to early exits in several tournaments.  His first-round victory at the 2025 Munich Open against Alexandre Muller (6-4, 6-1) offers a glimmer of hope, but the road to the French Open remains challenging.

Zverev hasn't shied away from acknowledging his struggles.  ""Of course I haven't played particularly well. I lost to a lot of guys that I should have beaten,"" he admitted to Tennis.com.  His recent loss to Matteo Berrettini in Monte Carlo highlights this inconsistency.  He's using the clay season, particularly the Munich Open, as a springboard for a revival, aiming for peak performance by Roland Garros.

As the top seed at the BMW Open in Munich, Zverev has the home crowd behind him.  This tournament, played on outdoor clay courts from April 14-20, offers a chance to build momentum before bigger challenges.  His first-round win is a positive step, and his next opponent will be either Chun-Hsin Tseng or Daniel Altmaier.

The recent Monte Carlo Masters saw Carlos Alcaraz overtake Zverev in the rankings, solidifying his position as the World No. 2.  This adds another layer of pressure on Zverev. While both players are looking to close the gap on Jannik Sinner, the fight for the number two spot and a favorable French Open draw is intense. Zverev and Alcaraz will have to perform well in upcoming tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid, where they both have crucial ranking points to defend. 

Despite his recent struggles, Zverev remains optimistic about his chances at the French Open.  He aims to make it a hat-trick, and a strong showing in Munich would be a significant step toward achieving this goal.  The clay season will ultimately determine if he can recapture his form and challenge for the Grand Slam title.  His determination and experience will be key in determining whether his clay-court comeback will be successful.

Keywords: Alexander Zverev, Munich Open, French Open, clay court, tennis, ATP rankings, Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, BMW Open,  tennis news,  tennis tournament.

Alexander Zverev is currently ranked No. 3 in the world.  His recent victory at the Munich Open will likely improve his standing, but he faces stiff competition from top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

Zverev won the Munich Open, demonstrating a strong clay-court performance and boosting his confidence heading into the French Open. This victory signals a potential resurgence in his form after a period of inconsistency.

Zverev's primary rivals for the French Open title and top ranking include Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Both players are exceptionally talented and have demonstrated dominance on clay.

Zverev's clay court form has been inconsistent recently. His Munich Open win signifies a potential turning point, but it remains to be seen if he can maintain this level of performance throughout the clay court season and into the French Open.

Zverev's chances of winning the French Open are difficult to predict. While his Munich Open victory provides hope, he will need to maintain peak performance and overcome formidable opponents like Alcaraz and Sinner.  His success will depend on his consistency and ability to handle the pressure of a Grand Slam.

                The 20-time major champion retired in 2022.            

20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer is undoubtedly one of the poster boys in the sport of tennis. Despite not being the outright leader in terms of few statistics, he inspired multiple generations to pick up a racquet and perfect their game with his gracious style of play. After making a heartbreaking retirement decision in 2022, Federer has been away from the game for a while. But now, he has dropped an exciting update that will leave fans jumping for joy.

During his time on tour, Federer won 103 singles titles (second highest in the Open Era) and 8 doubles championships. Winner of a record eight Wimbledon trophies, the Swiss maestro held the No. 1 ranking for 310 weeks – including an unbelievable streak of 237 consecutive weeks at the helm.

“I mean, the guy is great. He's the greatest of all time to be honest. Both on the court and off the court he has such charisma, he's just a wonderful player,” claimed the great Serena Williams on Federer in 2019. There is no doubt that Federer's latest revelation will put a smile on her face, along with the faces of millions of fanatics around the world.

Having hung up his racquet after the Laver Cup in 2022, Roger Federer has been an onlooker in a plethora of matches on tour ever since. Yet, the waver of the magical Wilson wand naturally hasn't made any appearances on the court – which could change very soon.

“I'd like to resume training a little,” revealed Federer in a recent interview. “I hope to redo exhibitions again, fill stadiums around the world. Nothing planned yet, but I miss it. I almost haven't played since my retirement.” Federer went on to admit that his body needed a break – one of the big reasons for his gradual exit was a knee issue that hampered his game for multiple years.

However, he remains optimistic about the future. “I've played a little with my children, but I'd like to take it more seriously again. During my travels, I will get back into it. And maybe you'll see me again on the court soon.”

🇨🇭🥹 Roger Federer says he would like to play exhibitions and fill stadiums again:“I would like to resume training a little, two to three times a week.

Frenchman Alexandre Muller is set to face top seed and home favourite Alexander Zverev in Round-1 of the ATP Munich Open this week. The 28-year-old told ATPTour.com about a memorable story with Federer – not on the greens of the All England Club but on the greens of a golf course.

“He [Federer] had a tee time 10 minutes before mine, so I was behind him for nine or 10 holes,” reminisced Muller. The incident took place in November 2024, when the French World No. 40 was enjoying a relaxed time on the fairways in Dubai. “For the last few holes I was with him, because the guy in front of him was a bit slow. So every time at the beginning of the hole I was with him, and we were talking a little bit. It was cool.”

The Philippine passport allows visa-free or visa-on-arrival travel to only 65 countries and territories, making the global nature of tennis a challenge.ByBaseline StaffPublished Apr 14, 2025 copy_link

Alexandra Eala couldn't be prouder of her heritage, a fact that was on full show last month at the Miami Open, where she became the first player from the Philippines to reach the semifinals of a WTA 1000 event, and with it, crack the Top 100.Having cut her ranking in half as a result of her Miami exploits, where she upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys and world No. 2 Iga Swiatek en route to the final four, Eala will now enjoy the fruits that come with being in that ranking range, includind direct entry to the biggest tournaments.But there's one thing that Eala says is a challenge of being a citizen of the archipelagic nation of nearly 115 million: securing visas with her passport.""What's challenging is being able to travel with flexibility,"" Eala said last week, speaking to Philippene media in the aftermath of her Miami run. ""As a tennis player, you need to be very flexible with your schedule. You're going to make a lot of last-minute choices, and it doesn't allow you time to organize all of this—every single time—to have the visas ready.""As of 2025, the Philippine passport ranks 74th in the Henley Passport Index, which since 2005 has rated travel freedoms for the world. Eala and other citizens of the Philippines are afforded visa-free or visa-on-arrival travel to only 65 countries and territories. Though she is based at Rafael Nadal's namesake tennis academy in Mallorca, Spain, the 19-year-old needs a visa in advance of traveling to the location of the four Grand Slam tournaments (Australia, France, Great Britain and the United States), as well as Asian swing hub China, just to name a few.

The Spaniard passes Alexander Zverev, who dips to No. 3, and closes the gap with No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner.ByJohn BerkokPublished Apr 14, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 14, 2025

Carlos Alcaraz made a perfect start to his clay-court season this past week, winning the Monte Carlo title for the first time in his career.Having missed the Masters 1000 event last year, he adds a clean 1,000 points to his ranking now, going from 6,720 to 7,720.And with that, Alcaraz makes a major move on the new ATP rankings—he rises from No. 3 back to No. 2, passing Alexander Zverev, who lost his opening match in Monte Carlo this year. The German drops from 7,645 to 7,595 ranking points, and dips from No. 2 to No. 3.It's Alcaraz's first time in the Top 2 since the week of October 28th last year, when he was ranked No. 2 (he had spent the 23 weeks in a row since then at No. 3). It's also his 89th career week in the Top 2, having spent 36 career weeks at No. 1 and, now, 53 career weeks at No. 2.He also cuts the gap between himself and No. 1 Jannik Sinner from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720), as Sinner was defending semifinal points in Monte Carlo and missed this year's event as he's currently in a three-month period of ineligibility.The Spaniard can't catch the Italian before he returns to the tour in Rome, but if he goes on to win both Barcelona and Madrid in the next few weeks, he'll cut that gap even further to 720 points, which would mean the No. 1 ranking could be up for grabs in the Italian capital.

Kimi Antonelli had an up and down race in Bahrain after starting fifth. He looked on for points but instead found himself battling hard down the order after a series of interesting strategy calls. In the end the teenager came home 11th, but there were definitely some positives to take away.

Antonelli got his elbows out at several points during the race, fighting hard with Carlos Sainz and even pulling off a move on reigning champion Max Verstappen at one point. The pace was clearly there, but Antonelli found himself in too much traffic to make it count.

Having dropped two places at the start, his problems began with the first pit stops, as he was undercut by a number of rivals. More issues then arose when Mercedes played it safe by trying to undercut him in return with an earlier second stop.

Fitting the soft compound tyres, he pushed too hard in traffic, so that when a Safety Car came out a few laps later, Mercedes opted to pit him a third time – dropping him down the order yet again.

Antonelli pulled off a move on Verstappen midway through the race in Bahrain

“It's a bit confusing because obviously it's the first time I got undercut, and that was fine – I was expecting it,” Antonelli explained.

“But obviously when I put the softs on after the medium, we did two laps and then there was the Safety Car. I felt I could have stayed out – with the Safety Car the tyres would have cooled down anyway and with a bit more free air, it would have been a different story.

“We need to review this with the team, I think on my side I could have probably chosen a bit more wisely the way I was pushing after the pit stop, just to save a bit more tyre.”

Antonelli is continuing to learn fast as he adjusts to life as a fulltime F1 driver 

Antonelli was the only driver to three stop bar the Williams of Carlos Sainz, and pitting an extra time cost him hugely. The likes of Esteban Ocon and Max Verstappen benefitted from staying out under the Safety Car – but Mercedes were worried whether Antonelli's soft tyres would last the distance.

But despite those strategic hiccups, Antonelli can take plenty away from Bahrain – as he continues to improve across the board, from his one-lap pace  to his race management and overtaking prowess.

“The pace is improving especially qualifying. Also, the racing on track is getting much, much better.

HBO just confirmed the six adult leads from its upcoming Harry Potter TV series and pledges a ""faithful adaptation."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Revelio! 


HBO has finally announced the adult cast of its Harry Potter TV series. 




	After months of media rumors and reports of various castings — all previously unconfirmed by HBO — the company broke its silence on the matter to announce six actors for the core adult roles of its adaptation of J.K. Rowling's beloved novels. 


	As expected, Emmy winner John Lithgow (Conclave) will take on the critical role of Hogwarts' wise and warm Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.

	Oscar nominee Janet McTeer (Ozark) will take on the role of stern Transfiguration Professor Minerva McGonagall. 

	











	And as first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Paapa Essiedu (Black Mirror) will take on the role of the sneering Potions Professor Severus Snape. 


	Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead) will play the lumbering Hogwarts gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid. 


	All four will serve as series regulars in the show. 


	In addition, stage actor Luke Thallon will play Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Quirinus Quirrel and Paul Whitehouse (Harry & Paul) has been cast as the curmudgeonly caretaker Argus Filch. 


	“We're delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can't wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life,” said Francesca Gardiner, showrunner and executive producer, and Mark Mylod, director of multiple episodes and executive producer.


	Lithgow has previously confirmed he'd accepted the role, telling one outlet, “It was not an easy decision because it's going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I'm afraid. But I'm very excited. Some wonderful people are turning their attention back to Harry Potter. That's why it's been such a hard decision. I'll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I've said yes.” 


	Essiedu's casting has caused a stir among some fans as Snape has traditionally been viewed as a white character, famously portrayed the late Alan Rickman in the Warner Bros. film series. Mylod has said, “Nobody can replace Alan Rickman, but we can find the next Alan Rickman.”

	











	HBO's plan is to adapt each of Rowling's seven novels into a season of television. 


	No child stars for the equally critical roles of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco have yet been cast. Given the characters are only 11 years old in the first book — Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone — it would make sense to cast the roles as close to the start of production as possible. Last year, HBO said it expected to begin filming in mid-2025 and that 32,000 children had auditioned for the young roles, with a team viewing between 500 and 1,000 auditions per day.


	“We haven't made any final choices, but we're workshopping with a shortlist in January. And there are some crackers,” Mylod has said, adding that they want to focus on “the cream of British acting talent, this incredible tradition of brilliant theater actors, and, of course, we're following the books with the canonical casting.”


	HBO also rereleased a statement about the adaptation and its place in the Harry Potter universe: “The series will be a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter book series by author and executive producer J.K. Rowling and will feature an exciting and talented cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail and much-loved characters Harry Potter fans have adored for over 25 years. Exploring every corner of the wizarding world, each season will bring Harry Potter and its incredible adventures to new and existing audiences and will stream exclusively on Max where it's available globally, including upcoming markets such as Turkey, the U.K., Germany and Italy, among others. The original, classic and cherished films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch around the world.”

	











	HBO boss Casey Bloys previously addressed the controversies surrounding Rowling, who has frequently faced criticism for her anti-transgender sentiments. “I'm totally comfortable with it, and I'm not worried about it,” Bloys said. “Look at the huge success of the Hogwarts video game last year. I'm not concerned about consumer response.”


	The series is executive produced by J.K. Rowling, Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films

Odom will return to the role of Aaron Burr, which he originated Off-Broadway and during the Broadway run. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	Leslie Odom Jr. will return to star in Hamilton this fall as Aaron Burr. 


	Odom, who originated the role Off-Broadway and later won a Tony Award for his portrayal, will return to the show starting Sept. 9, through Nov. 23 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. His return marks nine years since he left the show in July 2016. 




	Odom's return to Hamilton comes as the production prepares for its 10th anniversary on Broadway, on Aug. 6, 2025.“Returning to Hamilton is a deeply meaningful homecoming,” Odom said. “I'm so grateful for the chance to step back into the room — especially during this anniversary moment — and to revisit this brilliant piece that forever changed my life and the lives of so many.”“When I saw Leslie perform ‘The Room Where It Happens' at the first act two workshop of Hamilton, I knew I was witnessing a historic moment. How lucky we are that Leslie is returning to Hamilton and bringing his indelible Burr back to Broadway,” said Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller.

The show, featuring contestants clueless about President Trump's actions in office, will debut next month on Fox News Media's Fox Nation streaming service.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	On Jan. 20, the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, Fox News Media placed four people “in complete isolation in upstate New York, with no contact to the outside world — no phones, internet, television, or social media.”


	90 days later, those four people will come out of their cocoon, but before learning about what happened in the world over the last three months, they have to get through Greg Gutfeld.




	Gutfeld will host a game show called What Did I Miss? for the Fox Nation streaming service, with the contestants having to guess things that actually happened over the last 90 days, while avoiding scenarios invented by the production team.

	The show will see Gutfeld presenting dozens of scenarios featuring real headlines and fake ones, with the contestants having to sort through them to figure out what really happened, and what didn't. The grand prize is $50,000.




			Related Video		







Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss? will tape in front of a live audience with a panel that includes Gutfeld! regulars Kat Timpf and Jamie Lissow. The first episode of the game show will debut on Fox Nation May 12, with episodes two and three releasing on the 13th and 14th, respectively.


	The premise of the show is sure to elicit curiosity, given the nonstop barrage of news that has accompanied Trump's return to office. From the Gulf of America to a global trade war over tariffs, there is no shortage of news events that would surprise people kept in isolation.


	Gutfeld, of course, has become one of Fox News' biggest stars, co-hosting its top show The Five, and hosting his eponymous 10 p.m. program. The former magazine editor and Red Eye host is known for his sardonic humor, which will almost certainly be present on What Did I Miss?


	“Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld,” Fox Nation president Lauren Petterson said in a statement. “We are excited for Fox Nation subscribers to have exclusive access to America's most-watched late night host's game show debut as he informs contestants about what really happened while they were completely off the grid and isolated from the outside world.”


	“For these four contestants to learn what really happened while they were living in isolation, they'll have to get through me first,” Gutfeld added. “Lucky them.”

Kaitlyn Dever enters the story as Abby in the hit HBO show's return as someone with an intimate connection to Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey).


							By 

	Josh Wigler


Contributor


[This story contains spoilers from the season two premiere of The Last of Us, “Future Days.”]


	Over the course of its first season, The Last of Us put forth a variety of villains, from people-eating preachers to people-eating fungi. But with its second-season premiere, the show has introduced its fiercest foe yet, even if it doesn't look like it yet.




	The season two premiere, “Future Days,” begins with a group of characters we have never met before, led by a person with an intimate connection to main protagonists Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey): Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever. Abby is one of just a few surviving members of the Firefly resistance group Joel wiped out at the end of season one, all in an effort to stop them from performing an operation on Ellie that would have ended her life, while potentially ending the cordyceps infection that started everything. Needless to say, while we at home love Joel and Ellie, Abby's not a fan.

	“Slowly,” she says in the opener, in one of the single most chilling words uttered throughout the entire series. “When we kill him, we kill him slowly.” That's how she wants to seek her revenge against Joel, the man who killed Abby's Firefly father. The rest of this episode then jumps ahead and takes place five years later, with Joel and Ellie firmly established in the Jackson, Wyoming, settlement they reached by the end of season one. Things between the veritable father and daughter are strained, and stand to be further tested as Abby and her allies close the hour arriving at Jackson's outskirts.


	As one of the most dangerous and divisive characters featured in the Last of Us video games, Abby enters season two with a bit of a reputation. Played by Dever, however, she also enters the season with extraordinary dramatic weight, a powerhouse actor tasked with bringing a powerhouse player to life. It's not Dever's first dance with the franchise, either. A number of years ago, when Neil Druckmann and his Naughty Dog video game studio were eyeing The Last of Us as a film, Dever was in line to play a different character altogether.


	“I had met with Neil years ago to potentially play Ellie,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter. It didn't work out then, but years later, following an eventual collaboration with Naughty Dog providing voice work and motion capture on Uncharted 4, the right role boomeranged back around — colliding directly into Ellie's story. “I'm still shocked to this day that it happened this way.”

	











	According to Dever, she did not have to audition for Abby; the role was hers, should she choose to accept it. Other new castmembers on season two report a similar story, including Isabela Merced as Ellie's new love interest Dina and Young Mazino as Jesse, one of Jackson's most loyal soldiers. Dever says the way Druckmann, showrunner Craig Mazin and the rest of the team cast their series directly reflects how the show gets made.


	“They're very confident storytellers,” she says. “They know who is right for their story, and they have such confidence in that. It's very helpful when you're making something like this, because it allows for freedom, and for feeling safe to play these characters.”


	Feeling safe does not come easily in the world of The Last of Us, and that extends to every single character, not the least of whom is Abby. While she's a tough survivor in her own right, her story brings Abby into direct conflict with many of our most beloved veterans from season one, and some new fan favorites as well. But she's also a character who stands in direct conflict with viewers, given her dark motivations of revenge and how that stands to play out in the show. 


	“The way into Abby is knowing how grief feels and how loss affects you, especially in the immediate aftermath,” says Dever. “There's just this shock and this desire to make it all go away.”

	











	Dever points to her first scene in the second season as an example of Abby's devastation. There's no doubt about that line of hers (“Slowly”) as an incredibly unnerving moment. “Chilling,” Dever agrees. “She's a chilly ice queen!” Viewed another way, however, it's a moment of grief laid out on the proverbial operating table, raw and exposed for all to see.


	“She just needs something to make it all better,” says Dever. “And in that moment, the only thing she can think about is revenge. She's heartbroken, she's sad, she's lost and she's trying to pick up the pieces.”Reeling from her father's death and hell-bent on revenge, Dever's Abby has something in common with one of the actress' other notable television roles: Loretta McCready, the pot-slinging kid at the heart of Justified's second season, who also sought vengeance against the people who killed her father. 


	“You're the first person to bring that up,” Dever says, noting the similar journeys Loretta and Abby find themselves on, albeit on two very different shows. “I'd love to find some way to bring her back. I should call Graham Yost to see how he's doing….”


	Whether or not a Justified resurgence is in the cards, Dever's got her hands full with Abby, a new horror icon in the making. And no, she's not the scream queen; she's the queen that makes you scream.


	“When she walks into a room, she comes through with this intense strength,” says Dever. “It's what makes her scary and intimidating. But it's all because of how much pain she's gone through.” Lord have mercy on anyone who stands in the way of that pain.


	The Last of Us releases new episodes on HBO and Max Sundays at 9 p.m.

""I had a lot of that stuff to tap into,"" the actor says of episode six's abuse storyline, which surfaced during a surreal exploration of the hero's psyche.


							By 

	Lisa de los Reyes


Senior Copy Editor


[Trigger warning: This story contains a discussion of sexual abuse of children. It also includes Dark Winds spoilers through season three, episode six, “Abidoo'niidee (What We Had Been Told).”]


	If you caught the latest episode of Dark Winds and you need another minute to process it all, you're not alone.




Season three is reaching a fever pitch, with episode six going deep in its exploration of Joe Leaphorn (Zahn McClarnon) and the challenges he faces both externally, as he tries to catch a killer while evading suspicion for his own crime, and internally as he struggles to reconcile his role in B.J. Vines' death with his sense of justice. The tense episode also circles back to events previewed in the season premiere, when Joe was shot in the neck with a dart as he faces an adversary in the desert.

					How Those 'Dark Winds' Surprise Cameos Came Together		
			









	This time, viewers experienced that precarious situation in its full context: Joe is in a fight to save himself and the teenage George Bowlegs from a menacing attacker he believes is the Ye'iitsoh monster. The dart, as it turns out, has been laced with a substance that causes him to have surreal dreams that delve into his psyche, bringing up long-buried memories of a priest who sexually abused Joe's cousin many years ago. In the dream, he also faces the threat of FBI Agent Washington (Jenna Elfman) uncovering his crime, as well as the fallout on his marriage.


	At the heart of the episode, Joe learns that his father, Henry (Joseph Runningfox), killed the priest after Joe revealed the abuse out of despair for justice, much like what Joe experienced when Vines was released from custody after he caused the death of Joe Jr. Their shared heartbreak highlights “the gap between institutional justice and true justice, and the price paid for both,” says Erica Tremblay, who directed the episode.


	“It is a story about the monsters we face, both literal and figurative, and how the strength to face them often comes from the stories our ancestors left us,” Tremblay tells The Hollywood Reporter. When Joe awakes from the dream, he's able to fight off the attacker, wounding him with a gunshot, and realizes that it was never a monster after all.


	Below, star Zahn McClarnon discusses the multilayered episode — which weaves in Navajo mythology with Leaphorn's challenges — touching on why that abuse storyline hit close to home and what Joe has going for him even in his darkest moments. Says McClarnon, “He has a chance to lose everything: his wife, his family, his job, his freedom. How can the stakes be any higher than that?”

	











	***


There's a lot to unpack in this episode, with several different narrative threads happening at once: the mythological story of the Hero Twins taking on the Ye'iitsoh monster; Leaphorn's struggle to fight the attacker that's coming after him and George; and the surreal dream-world that he's navigating. I read that you have a fraternal twin in real life, which is kind of fitting for the twin storyline.


	I do, he's four minutes younger.


The story of the twins is represented by a stage play happening within the episode. Is that based on real mythology?


	It's based on a creation story, the Diné, or Navajo creation story of the Hero Twins, the Monster Slayer and Born for Water. These twins are embarking on a battle of the Ye'iitsoh. The direct translation of “Ye'iitsoh” is essentially something big that creates fear. Today it's kind of a general term that means something with negative energy.


	Then there's the battle. Joe's battling his own monsters throughout this episode, and we include narration woven throughout the amateur production of the kids [portraying the Hero Twins] in this episode. It's Joe's journey.


One of the elements of Joe's journey, which takes up a relatively small amount of time but seems very important, is the interaction he has with his wife, Emma (Deanna Allison), in the dream. After he told her about Vines in episode five, she asked him to move out of the house, which is shocking because they've always had such a loving marriage. Now, in the dream, she says that he's not giving enough attention to the things that she needs, and it seems like they're at a breaking point.












	During the — I call it a ketamine dream — he gets shot in the neck with an animal tranquilizer dart, which usually is ketamine, they use ketamine to tranquilize animals. In this ketamine dream, Joe is exposed to a lot of his inner turmoil and trauma. There are different characters that come through the ketamine, and one is definitely Emma. There's a lot going on there. There's a lot of guilt of how his marriage with Emma is a mess, it's revealed to him subconsciously in this dream, and how he treats her and how Joe puts his job ahead of their marriage. Basically how the job has consumed everything about him, as well as the death [of their son]. For this whole season we're exploring those areas of Joe and Emma's relationship.


	Emma comes in the dream and basically says, “You're not paying attention, you're not here for me.” It's a part of the psychological makeup of Joe Leaphorn and the things he's going through. The whole season is basically a continued exploration of the ramifications of their son's death and the consequences that come from Joe Leaphorn's actions in season two with B.J. Vines, and also how it affects his mental state and his marriage with Emma, as well as [his relationship with] Chee [Kiowa Gordon] and Bernadette [Jessica Matten] — Bernadette's not really around in season three, she's down at the border — but everything around him in his life and how these decisions and his son's death have affected him. We explore quite a bit the inner workings of Joe Leaphorn.

	











I hadn't quite made the connection that ketamine was in the dart.


	Yeah, they use ketamine nowadays a lot in trauma therapy, for people dealing with different issues in their lives. The research nowadays with psilocybin and ketamine for depression and anxiety — they've come a long way with that. We touch on it in 1972. (Laughs)


Maybe there's an accidental benefit for Joe.


	Yeah, exactly.


One of the darkest things that's addressed in the episode is Joe's memories of his youth and how his cousin was abused by a priest, which he knew about at the time, but couldn't stop it. Can you talk about how that is addressed?


	Joe revisits an event in his childhood where he wasn't able to protect his younger cousin when he's abused by a priest. That causes Joe a lot of trauma in his youth, a lot of guilt because he couldn't protect him, and he also mixed the events up in his head as a child — you know how we kind of use those tools in adulthood to deal with the trauma. We rearrange stories in our heads.


	Joe finds out in this ketamine dream that it went differently than he thought. He blamed himself [thinking that he killed the priest, which he wanted to do]; he lived with this guilt his entire life, but it's revealed in the ketamine dream what actually happened to the priest: It wasn't Joe who killed the priest, it was revealed that his father did that to protect him and his cousin, to get “Indian justice.” It was revealed that Henry, Joe's father, also lives with a lot of trauma and guilt because he forced the kids to go to that church, which turned into an abusive situation. So Henry's also dealing with a lot of that guilt and trauma. Joe realizes this about his father, which does bring them closer.

	











Joe tells his father that he did the right thing, and Henry replies that he can tell Joe's not sure. They're both struggling because there really is no right way to respond to a situation where someone is doing something evil, but you have no legal recourse. What do you think of that dilemma that they both face?


	It's a different time period. It's 1972 and a lot of people on the reservations did face that quite a bit, where there's two types of justice: There's one justice one for white people and one justice for Native people. It's that law that Joe has to struggle with as well in his personal life, because he's a cop and also follows his traditions as a Diné man, a Navajo man. He's constantly struggling with colonialism and being colonized and also representing his people, so it's a fence that Joe is continually walking throughout all the seasons.


	And then obviously we have Agent Washington, who comes into the dream saying, “What you did to Vines is immoral.” So Joe is constantly dealing with these moral gray areas throughout the season. What's right and what's wrong when it comes to holding up the law? Are there two different laws, one for Indian people and one for white people? She represents the fact that in Joe's heart he probably does know what he did doesn't square up to his principles, and he has to face that.


Regarding the abuse of Joe's cousin by the priest, Erica Tremblay, who directed this episode, said that “working with Zahn to bring this story to life is an experience I will treasure forever. We were able to lean on each other through the most emotionally challenging scenes, and the result feels true and raw because we trusted each other enough to really explore these painful memories.” How was that experience for you, working with her to create a representation of these things that, sadly, happened?












	Any actor, when he has to be vulnerable, wants a safe place to be vulnerable. We had closed sets on some of the scenes, where it was just the camera and the first AD and Erica and I. Erica made that environment extremely safe — not just Erica, the whole cast and crew made that environment extremely safe for me so I could go to those places and be vulnerable.


	To be honest with you, as actors we all have to tap into personal experiences. Erica made it easy for me to tap into that. I had some very, very similar things happen to me as a child that my cousin went through, and also what Joe went through of not being able to protect somebody. For me, having access to that and being around people who are going to allow me to have access to that and keep me safe, Erica handled it really well. I trusted her and she's a wonderful director to work with. It's all about the safe environment. Not luckily, but fortunately, but I had a lot of that stuff to tap into.


That is really unfortunate to hear.


	Everybody has their — it doesn't define me, some of the things that happened in my childhood. I don't want people feeling sorry for me or anything, because everybody's got their traumas and things that have happened to them. It's just wonderful that as an actor, I allow myself to tap into that stuff, and I think to bring some kind of truth to those situations is very important and I'm always striving to bring as much truth to the scene as I possibly can. It's a lot easier not to have to make it up, that's for sure. (Laughs)

	











Once Joe gets out of the dream, he's still in a bad situation. He's figured out a lot of things and he's able to shoot and wound the suspect, but he's badly injured and stranded in the desert — plus, if he gets out of this, he could be arrested at any time by Agent Washington. What do you think Joe has working for him that he can use to get out of this mess that he's still in at the end of the episode?


	Pragmatically, he's got his experience as a cop, obviously. But Joe comes face to face with himself in this episode and understands how these past events shaped him and why he dealt with them through suppression. It's just a coping mechanism, that's what we do as human beings; and Joe does, finally, as do the Hero Twins in our creation story in the play, he battles the monsters. He's battling the monster himself, and finds out later on that it's not a monster, that this is a man. He's just projected all this trauma and guilt, and it appears to him as a monster, but it's really a man.


	He's put all that guilt and trauma in something that wasn't reality. We do that as human beings, but he comes out of that dream and it's almost a relief to him to realize that this has all been him and his psyche that's been creating this. He has to get his job done. He has to find the killer who killed Ernesto Cata at the beginning of the season. He has a job to do, so he snaps out of it. Knowing that it's a man is a big relief to Joe. It wasn't this monster — but it was a monster, if that makes sense. It was a monster, but it's not a [supernatural] monster.

	











I think that came up in a previous season, too, whether there are really monsters or if it's just people who are monsters.


	Henry talks about that as well when Joe meets up with his father in the ketamine dream. I think that Leaphorn's growth is more about self-understanding. It is about healing and reconciliation of the traumatic past and the choices he's made and how they've affected everybody around him.


Agent Washington clearly knows more than she's letting on about Joe's involvement with B.J. Vines. Joe must realize that on some level, as a police officer himself. So he's in a very tricky spot. And I don't want you to give away any spoilers, but how could he possibly get out of this?


	It definitely raises the stakes. It raises the highest stakes, when Agent Washington comes sniffing around about B.J. Vines and what happened to him. He's a prominent character within the community, the white community, the border town community, the Navajo reservation. She's been sent off from Washington as one of the first women FBI agents in the '70s, I think there were two in 1972. She's sloughed off to the reservation by her bosses, to go take care of this missing persons report on the Navajo reservation. She's getting kind of the shitty work as a woman in '72. She shows up and the stakes become really high for Joe, because he has a chance to lose everything: his wife, his family, his job, his freedom. How can the stakes be any higher than that? It creates a lot of anxiety for Joe in season three. Done by the wonderful actress, and she just nailed this season, Jenna Elfman.

	











What was it like working with Jenna?


	Jenna's just a professional, she's such a pro and such a warm person and easy to work with. I found myself just sitting in some of these scenes and I'm just watching her and I remember, “Oh shit, I have to say my dialogue back to her,” because I'm so amazed at her work. That doesn't happen all the time, but when it does you really have to focus and remember that you're in the scene. I just love to watch Jenna, I'd come [to set] on scenes when I wasn't working just to watch her, see how many different takes she would do and how many different versions. She just never made any mistakes. She's been doing this for so long. Once in a while, you see her flub up, and it's like, “Ah, she's human.”


I'd also like to say that when Leaphorn is injured, like he is in this episode, you play that in such a realistic way. You really feel his struggle, as opposed to action movies where the hero will be shot but he goes on fighting bad guys like nothing happened. I don't know if you think about that or if it's written that way?


	I do, I'm constantly searching for an honesty to the performance. It's so important to me and it does take a lot of focus for me. I have to be that person in that moment, and you know, I've got everybody creating that environment for me. The least I can do is bring an honesty to it and do my job. Everybody's working their butts off to make the environment and create the sets, etc., so I'd better bring everything that I can.

	











	It doesn't matter if I'm getting shot or I'm in a scene where I'm talking, I've got to tap into that honesty. It's a part of the craft that I really enjoy, and when I watch other actors, I want that honesty. You know, the pureness of it. I strive for that as much as I possibly can. It takes work, it takes a lot of focus and that's what I'm there for, I'm there to work. I take it seriously and I want it to be as honest and authentic as possible. I appreciate that compliment, that's very kind.


So much so that in season two, when he had the broken arm, I almost couldn't watch that part.


	There were some scenes there I actually got hurt. There was a moment in season two where Nicholas Logan [who plays the hired murderer that killed Joe Jr.] pulls me off my feet when I got a rope around him, and I landed on my ribs and we kept rolling. I was in a lot of pain. (Laughs.) So some of that's real.


It certainly seemed real. Anything else you'd like to discuss about the season so far?


	Just kind of explaining what the Ye'iitsoh is; authenticity is a big concern for us. We have wonderful consultants, Jennifer and [Manuelito] “Manny” Wheeler, and in a previous season we had George Joe — just making sure they're involved in the ceremonies, the language, the props, the wardrobe, things that are true to Navajo customs. We've got a lot of people behind the scenes that are Indigenous, and we want to make sure that we're showcasing the tribal culture with respect and honor and authenticity.

	











	We don't represent the Navajo people obviously, we're doing a TV show, but one of the positive things is it does open the door to moments of the culture that I hope inspire people to be around Navajo people, to visit the Navajo Nation, to learn more about their culture. That can lead to more people getting involved, environmentally, politically. That's one of the positive rewards about being on Dark Winds.


	The Ye'iitsoh is definitely a part of that oral story, the creation story of the Navajo people. We make sure it's authentic and we have the right people in place to honor that and respect it.


The show centers the Navajo perspective, which of course has always been there, but wasn't represented in mainstream media for a long time. It's a shame it hasn't been done in this way in the U.S. until relatively recently; imagine all the shows we could have had.


	It's definitely a better time in representation in television and film, for sure, because now we have Native writers, we have Native directors, we have Native producers. But we're just at the beginning stages. We've been telling these stories for thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and we're just finally getting the opportunity for other people to see it. The show's perspective, it's got a cultural lean to it, and that's one of the positive things about being involved. And it's connecting with people, people are connecting with it and that's just a win-win for being on a television show.

Monday's NS-31 expedition will mark Blue Origin's 11th human space flight.


	While some have questioned the timing of Perry's space flight so close to her upcoming Lifetimes Tour (which kicks off April 23), it's worth noting that the singer isn't actually staying in space. In fact, the entire suborbital flight is expected to last just 11 minutes, giving Perry and the crew enough time to reach the edge of space without making a full orbit around the earth. Still, they'll hopefully be able to get some once-in-a-lifetime views while also experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness.

Doja Cat was in a generous mood this weekend, giving fans what appears to be the latest preview of her upcoming Vie album. After seemingly sharing the track list in November, when she posted and then quickly deleted a 13-song roster that included the songs “Break My Heart,” “Take Me Dancing,” “Anything,” “Ain't News,” “Turn the Lights On,” “Slow Burn,” “Wood Holly” and “Appreciation,” Doja was at it again on Sunday (April 13).

	This time around the list included 16 songs, some of which matched the earlier roster, with no additional information on a release date or first single. “dont ask me where crack is rn,” she captioned the weekend post, which did not include one of the songs on the earlier roster, “Crack.” While “Turn the Lights On” matched the earlier run-down, other songs appear to have dropped off, including “Break My Heart,” “Take Me Dancing,” “Anything,” “Aint News,” “Slow Burn,” “Wood Holly,” “Did I Lie” and “Appreciation.”

	The new apparent track list includes: “Turn the Lights On,” “Slide,” “One More Time,” “Make It Up,” “Lipstain,” “Kink,” “Jealous Type,” “I Like You,” “Happy,” “Gorgeous,” “Couples Therapy,” “Come Back,” “Cards,” “Amen,” “All Mine” and “Acts of Service.”


	Fans recorded an Instagram live over the weekend in which Doja previewed the bouncy “Jealous Type,” a Janet Jackson-like pop funk jam. “Boy, let me know if this is careless/ I could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide/ Which one is leading me to hell or paradise?/ Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type/ I'm the jealous type,” Doja sings in a breathy register on the song.


	Back in March, Doja also previewed the slow-burn jams “Acts of Service” and “Lipstain.” 


	Doja Cat's last album, 2023's Scarlet, was the follow-up to 2021's hit-packed Planet Her. Scarlet reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and hit No. 2 on the Top Rap Albums chart. She also dropped Scarlet 2 CLAUDE deluxe edition in May and earlier this year teamed up with BLACKPINK's LISA and RAYE on “Born Again” and Jack Harlow on his song “Just Us.”

XG, Ty Dolla $ign, Zedd, BigXthaplug were among those to hit the desert on Sunday (April 13). 


	Weekend one of Coachella 2025 wrapped up on Sunday night (April 13) with Post Malone delivering an inspirational set from the main stage and XG making their desert debut on the Sahara stage. 


	Fans rallied to the desert for a third consecutive day, as Sunday didn't disappoint with additional performances from Megan Thee Stallion, Jennie, Zedd, Ty Dolla $ign and more.


	The weekend send-off had a little bit of everything. Meg rocked the stage but had her set cut short a she appeared to go over on her set time after bringing out a few special guests to make the night memorable, including Queen Latifah, Victoria Monét and Ciara. 


	Jennie held her own as well with her solo Coachella debut. “It feels great to be back here in the desert,” the BLACKPINK star humbly told the crowd before surprising them with a Kali Uchis appearance.


	Ty Dolla $ign performed on Sunday as well, and it doubled as the versatile artist's 43rd birthday. His set was a powerful one, which revolved around a jail cell and prison yard while spotlighting his brother, Big T.C.'s case (he's currently serving a life sentence). 


	Hours before taking the stage for his headlining performance, Post Malone revealed to Billboard he's got a new album on the way and he's “made probably 35 songs; it's just a matter of which one's rock, and which one's sock.”


	Check out the full list of our highlights from day three of Coachella below. 


	In three years, XG went from its first song to hitting one of Coachella's biggest stages to close out the first weekend. The Japanese girl group took the stage in leopard space suits and performed tracks like “XGENE,” “Wake Up,” and “GRL GVNG.” A live band arrangement gave some of the cuts a refreshed feel throughout the set. One thing of note was not just how impressive the dancers were, but that one of them was Dream Academy‘s Emily Kelavos. The girls switched out into some white fluffy track suits and ran through favorites like “Left Right,” “In The Rain,” “Wake Up,” “Mascara (Remix)” and “TGIF.” – MICHAEL SAPONARA




	While everything's bigger in Texas, BigXthaPlug is about to have a massive 2025. Coming off the release of “All the Way” with Bailey Zimmerman, which is expected to make a lofty Billboard Hot 100 debut and be X's biggest career hit to date, the Dallas native made his Coachella debut on Sunday (April 13). X was a crowd favorite as the intimate Gobi Stage was packed to the gills with fans from various backgrounds. One thing's for sure: the next time BigX is at Coachella, he will need a much bigger stage with the trajectory of his career. “This is now 6Chella,” BigX declared in a salute to his 600 Ent. imprint. – M.S.


	Megan Thee Stallion was on the verge of having one of the weekend's best sets before Coachella turned her mics off as she appeared to go over on her set time. The Houston Hottie stepped out sporting a dominatrix cowgirl-themed fit as she showcased hits like “Thot S—t” and “Savage.” There was no shortage of surprise special guests as Queen Latifah joined Meg to perform “U.N.I.T.Y.” Being a student of the game, Megan had Ciara pop out for “Goodies,” which she samples on “Roc Steady.” Thee Stallion even learned the choreography for CiCi's return to the festival main stage. 


	Victoria Monèt was next on the guest list, as the Grammy-winning powerhouses teamed up for “Spin,” and Monèt finished off with her “On My Mama” hit. After “Body,” it appeared Meg's microphones were cut off, but she didn't have any idea as she continued to perform. The set ended shortly thereafter, around 9:28 PM. Who knows, maybe Cardi B was in line for “WAP,” which would've been a Coachella moment. We'll see what happens next weekend. – M.S.




	Addison Rae made a surprise appearance during Arca's set where she performed “Aquamarine.” The bubbly TikTok star bounced around the stage in a lace white dress, but made sure the focus was on her backside before leaving the stage. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that Rae's pink lingerie said June 6 to signify that the emerging singer's debut album will be here just before the summer. – M.S.


	Ty Dolla $ign's brother, Big T.C., is currently behind bars on a life sentence. Even though it was Ty's birthday, he made sure bring more awareness to his brother's legal situation with his powerful stage set-up revolving around the prison yard and a jail cell. Ty and others were outfitted in jail jumpsuits for the set, which saw him delve into his solo discography as well as his collaborative work as one of music's premier features. Vultures tracks like “Fuk Sumn,” “ Back to Me,” “Do It” and the Hot 100-topping “Carnival” rang off without Ye in the desert. Like Mustard on Friday, Ty paid tribute with a photo of Nipsey Hussle as part of the striking stage visual. It wouldn't be a Dolla $ign birthday bash without some friends, as Wiz Khalifa, YG, Tyga, Leon Thomas and more all also brought the party to another level. – M.S.


	Days before making his Coachella debut on the main stage, Shaboozey dubbed his performance “Coachella's Country Hour.” Yet, his celebratory set kicked off a day that honored the genre, with performances from country rapper Jessie Murph and a headlining set from Post Malone (who ventured into country with his 2024 album F-1 Trillion). But it all started with Boozey, who welcomed Noah Cyrus to the stage for their collaboration “My Fault” — and it ended, of course, his Hot 100 No. 1 smash, “A Bar Song.” And this time, everybody in the desert was getting tipsy. – LYNDSEY HAVENS


	It's been almost one year since Post Malone saddled up and dropped his chart-topping country set, F-1 Trillion. But on Sunday (April 13), on Coachella's main stage, his headlining performance felt celebratory and emotional enough to be release night. For the gig, Post fittingly brought a reimagined Forumla 1 racetrack to the desert that extended all the way from the stage through the crowd. He also leaned into his love for pyro, with various trash bins spread across the stage that, of course, would catch fire throughout the set. Because while the night was a celebration, it's clear Post has no plans of slowing down. Rather, having just performed on a makeshift racetrack, nothing is stopping him from continuing full speed ahead. – L.H.


	“It feels great to be back here in the desert,” said Jennie toward the middle of her evening gig. “Thank you for coming to my set.” Such humble remarks are true to form for the global sensation, but the fact that she could use the word “my” spoke volumes to the moment. Because although Jennie has performed at Coachella twice before, including one historic headlining set with BLACKPINK, tonight was indeed hers. 


	On the heels of her expansive solo debut album, Ruby, Jennie's performance prioritized the new material. Songs like “ExtraL,” which included an high-energy dance break, and “Damn Right,” for which Jennie welcomed Kali Uchis to the stage, particularly stood out — did the in-your-face “Like Jennie.” But more than any one song, it was the overall experience that felt the most victorious — and bittersweet, as it could be the last solo set from Jennie before she heads back into BLACKPINK activities this year. – L.H.


	The country rapper's stage design was all pretty and all pink, with chiffon curtains and a ruched satin platform. Even her all male dancers were dressed in baby pink, and her mic was bedazzled in the color as well. And then there was Jessie, dressed in all black (including her infamous snoots, a mix of sneakers and cowboy boots). Her contrasting outfit symbolized the entire essence of her artistry: you can hit hard and be soft. You can come from a town where, as she said herself, “this s–t doesn't happen” and be the one to break that mold. “I feel proud to be representing [Alabama] today,” said Murph, sharing that she cried earlier in anticipating of her debut Coachella set. – L.H.


	Every year, the Outdoor Stage reliably delivers at least one mega dance music moment, and this year that honor belonged to Zedd, who drew one of the biggest crowds we can ever remember seeing in this area of the festival. The producer has many hits to pull from, along with a new arsenal of music from his exceptional 2024 album, Telos. This set took from both, with Zedd welcoming Maren Morris to sing “The Middle,” bringing John Mayer to guest on “Automatic Lover,” bringing out Indian vocalist B. C. Manjunath to perform the incredible Konnakol singing on “Shanti,” along with guests Elley Duhé, The Ollam, Tyler Duncan and Bea Miller. All of it also happened while Zedd (who had himself been a guest on this same stage during a performance by Gustavo Dudamel and the L.A. Philharmonic) rotated between turns at the decks, the drums and the piano. – KATIE BAIN


	A 5:30 mainstage show isn't always the easiest slot to pull off, particularly for an artist who's not necessarily spectacle-oriented. But Beabadoobee's golden-hour performance felt both well-placed and well-timed. Her voice sounded fantastic as she played music both accessible and interesting, drawing a crowd to her and more than carrying Coachella's biggest stage. – K.B.


	The English dance duo's set started nearly 25 minutes late, but if there was anything truncated about the show that eventually happened, it certainly wasn't obvious. The pair pulled out all the stops for a set that featured a sprawling crew of fantastically costumed singers, dancers, brass players, and even someone in a gorilla costume who came out during the inevitable finale “Where's Your Head At.” Altogether, the performance was a reminder that dance music live show maximalism can involve so much more than just lasers and confetti, with the vibe onstage looking like as much of a party as anything that was happening in the crowd. – K.B.


	Electronic music is a foundational genre to Coachella, and most every electronic act on the lineup is able to draw a line connecting their work to that of the genre's pioneers, Kraftwerk. The German group closed out the Mojave Tent, performing iconic hits including “Trans Europe Express,” “Computer Love,” “Radioactivity,” “Tour de France” and “The Robots” with a striking, minimalist stage setup and accompanying visuals. The audience was rapt throughout, cheering especially loudly at the end for Kraftwerk's sole remaining original member Ralf Hütter, who closed his eyes amid the applause, seeming to take in all of the much deserved appreciation. – K.B.

The Australian rocker revealed he has been living with the diagnosis for two years.

	Tyler Jenke



	Rob Hirst, the drummer of Australian rock veterans Midnight Oil, has revealed he is currently battling pancreatic cancer.


	69-year-old Hirst, who co-founded the Sydney rock outfit in the ‘70s, revealed his diagnosis publicly in an interview with The Australian, explaining that he has been living with the disease for two years. Hirst noted he had received confirmation of his condition about six months after Midnight Oil wrapped up the Australian leg of their farewell tour in October 2023, and he's been receiving constant medical assistance since.


	“So it's ongoing,” Hirst told the publication. “I've had pretty much every treatment known to man – every scan, ultrasound, MRI. I've kind of had ‘the works.'”

	Hirst explained that he was diagnosed “early,” with his tumor being caught while at stage three. Upon learning of his condition, Hirst embarked upon months of chemotherapy before an unsuccessful eight-hour “Whipple” surgery to attempt the removal of the tumor. He has since continued with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

	Though initially keeping his diagnosis a secret, Hirst has since gone public to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, noting that it “hasn't really attracted the attention, for example, of skin cancers or breast cancers or others.” According to data from Cancer Australia, the average survival rate of individuals between 2016 and 2020 was 13%, with men given a chance of 12%.


	“Coming up to two years, I thought I just need to get this, literally, off my chest,” Hirst explained. “Also, I think that the lesson for me – and maybe why I've lasted this long – is because, if you do have any of that kind of symptom, where there's something that you feel is wrong, just go and get a simple blood test. It could be life-changing, and life-extending.”


	Midnight Oil first formed in Sydney in 1972 as Farm, before adopting their later moniker in 1976. The group initially released eleven albums before splitting in 2002, with their breakthrough coming in 1982 with 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, which hit No. 3 in Australia. 


	Their following three albums – 1984's Red Sails in the Sunset, 1987's Diesel and Dust, and 1990's Blue Sky Mining – all topped the Australian charts, while the latter gave them a peak of No. 20 on the Billboard 200. Their 1987 single “Beds Are Burning” is often considered a landmark of Australian music, with its message of Indigenous land rights also resonating internationally and peaking at No. 17 on the Hot 100.


	While the band would be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2006, they would reform a decade later in 2016, and following a global reunion tour, they issued The Makarrata Project in 2020 and Resist in 2022. While both albums would reach No. 1 in Australia, the former was released just one week before longtime bassist Bones Hillman passed from cancer at the age of 62.

Neil Young, Joan Baez and Maggie Rogers shared the stage at a Bernie Sanders' Fighting Oligarchy rally over the weekend, delivering a powerful, multi-generational performance of Young's protest anthem “Rockin' in the Free World.”

	The moment took place on Saturday (April 12) at the political rally hosted by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at Los Angeles' Grand Park. The event, which centered on anti-corporate messaging and grassroots political reform, also featured solo sets from all three artists.

	Young, who closed out the rally, began his brief performance with “Rainbow of Colors,” a song from his 2019 album Colorado, before launching into “Rockin' in the Free World.” 


	Midway through the song, Baez and Rogers walked onstage to join him, taking turns on vocals and leading chants of “Power to the people” and “Take America back” between verses.


	Baez, who recently marked her return to public performance following her Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2023, also performed a five-song solo set earlier in the evening. Her selections were all covers, beginning with “Ain't Nobody Gonna Turn Me 'Round,” a Freedom Singers civil rights anthem. She followed with Phil Ochs' “There But for Fortune” and John Lennon's “Imagine.”


	Toward the end of her set, Baez was joined by Rogers for renditions of “America the Beautiful” and Bob Dylan's “Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.” It marked a rare public musical appearance for Baez, who formally retired from full-length touring in 2019.


	Rogers, who released her sophomore album Surrender in 2022, recently teased new music on social media and has continued to appear at benefit concerts and politically focused events.


	Sanders has been very vocal in his disdain for the Trump administration's controversial tariff policies. During a CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Sanders lambasted Trump's pugilistic approach to foreign policy, saying, “We don't have to hate China. We don't have to hate other people. Let's figure out a way to work together.”


	Young, a longtime supporter of progressive causes, first released “Rockin' in the Free World” in 1989 on his album Freedom, and has performed it across decades of political moments. In 2020, the rocker filed a copyright infringement lawsuit over Trump's unauthorized use of “Rockin' in the Free World” at campaign events.

Katy Perry is almost ready for launch — and she's giving fans a peek inside the capsule before liftoff.


	The pop star is set to board Blue Origin's NS-31 mission on Monday morning (April 14), joining a groundbreaking, all-female crew for the company's 11th human spaceflight. 


	Ahead of launch, Perry shared a behind-the-scenes look from inside the capsule, posting a video to Instagram where she appears in full flight gear with her fellow passengers.

	“I think I'm gonna sing,” she says in the clip. “I've got to sing in space!” As the camera pans to show the six-woman team seated together, Perry adds, “These are all of my astronaut girly friends,” flashing a grin as the capsule runs through final simulations.

	Joining Perry on the mission are journalist Lauren Sánchez, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Amanda Nguyen, producer and entrepreneur Kerianne Flynn, and CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King. The crew is scheduled to launch at 7 a.m. CT from Blue Origin's West Texas facility, where they've spent the past several days completing astronaut training.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	This will mark the first all-women crewed mission to space since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963.


	Earlier this week, Perry described the emotional resonance she felt while preparing for the mission, explaining that she experienced what she believed were signs from the universe that confirmed she was on the right path.


	“When I was invited to come on this voyage, I looked up the capsule. On the very front of it is the outline in the shape of a feather and when I saw that it was like a total confirmation because my mom has always called me Feather,” she said.


	“Then they reveal the capsule name… The capsule's name is Tortoise. A wave, just the most energetic wave, just shot through my body. My mom calls me two nicknames. Feather and Tortoise. What are the chances that I'm going to space on a rocket in a capsule with my symbol, the feather, called Tortoise?”


	“There are no coincidences,” she added. “And I'm just so grateful for these confirmations and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me is steering the ship.”


	Perry has embraced the symbolism and style of the mission, joking in a separate post, “There will be lash extensions flying in the capsule… Mine are glued on. They're good.” She added, “Space is going to finally be glam.”


	Lauren Sánchez echoed the sentiment, saying, “We're going to put the ‘a**' in astronaut.”

	











	For Perry, the mission also serves as a message to young women. “I'm motivated more than ever to be an example for my daughter that women should take up space — literally and figuratively,” she wrote on Instagram.


	After the short journey into space — which will include four minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth — Perry will begin her Lifetimes Tour in support of her upcoming album 143, launching April 23 in Mexico City.


	The flight will be broadcast live on CBS with coverage beginning at 7 a.m. ET with a special edition of CBS Mornings, followed by the “Gayle Goes to Space” special at 9 a.m. ET. Paramount+ will also stream the entire Blue Origin launch and flight.

Associate Editor, TV


Max's Harry Potter TV series has officially cast four series regulars and two recurring roles, including four actors Deadline previously revealed: John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid.


	The newly announced cast includes Luke Thallon as Quirinus Quirrell and Paul Whitehouse as Argus Filch. Whitehouse is the only actor cast thus far to have appeared in any of the original films. He played Sir Cadogan in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.


	The franchise follows the life of a young wizard, the titular Harry Potter, whose parents died under mysterious circumstances when he was very young. He was forced to live a life of misery and servitude to his aunt and uncle and their awful son before he was freed when Hagrid extended an invitation that changed his life forever. The adventure begins as Harry and his magical friends Ron and Hermoine become students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, who come of age in a time of extreme turmoil where the threat of war looms close.

	The Harry Potter series comes from writer/showrunner Francesca Gardiner, an executive producer alongside Mark Mylod, who will direct multiple episodes for HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The streamer touts the series as “a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter book series” by J.K. Rowling, who also exec produces with Neil Blair, Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.


	Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO & Max Content, previously said the Harry Potter series would be a deep dive into each of Rowling's novels, of which seven were released. However, he emphasized that the TV series will run for 10 consecutive years. 


	The 8 hit Warner Bros. films released between 2001 and 2011 with the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, split into two features. The two longest novels are Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth and lengthiest book in the series. Potentially, more time could be devoted to these two titles with an extra season for each. However, Max has yet to reveal how much time they will focus on each novel per season. One thing that has been confirmed is that the prequel books under the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise will not be part of the series. Unless they are casually introduced like in the films when the young Hogwarts students read them as part of their curriculum. 

	











	“We're delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can't wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life,” said Gardiner and Mylod in a joint statement.


	Casting is still underway for many major roles, including that of the titular wizard, best known as the Boy That Lived, famously portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe on the big screen. Also up for grabs are the roles of his dearest friends Ron and Hermoine, originally played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, respectively. A casting call revealed that prospective actors should be between 9 and 11 years old as of this month. 


	Production is set to begin this summer at Leavesden Studios, around  20 miles from London, and is the current home of the official Harry Potter Studio Tour and where the films were shot.


	The newly cast actors have received many awards and accolades for their contributions to film and television on both sides of the pond. 


	Lithgow is a six-time Emmy, two-time Tony Award, Olivier winner, and BAFTA and Oscar nominee who will follow in the footsteps of Richard Harris, who played the Hogwarts Headmaster in the first two films, and Michael Gambon, who took over the role following Harris' death. Jude Law played Dumbledore in his early years in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.


	McTeer is a Tony Award, Golden Globe, and Olivier winner, and an Oscar and Emmy nominee who takes over the role of Minerva McGonagall, the transfiguration teacher made famous by Maggie Smith and Fiona Glascott in the Fantastic Beasts films.


	Essiedu is an Olivier, Emmy, and BAFTA nominee set to play the misunderstood Severus Snape, played in the films by Alan Rickman. Essiedu began his career as part of the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company before landing his breakout role in the BBC and HBO production I May Destroy You. He made his film debut in the mystery film Murder on the Orient Express (2017), directed by Harry Potter alum Kenneth Branagh. Additional credits include Anne Boleyn, The Lazarus Project, and Black Mirror on TV.


	Frost is a British Independent Film Award nominee who has starred in many fan-favorite films and is best known for his collaborations with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: House of the Dragon star Emma D'Arcy has joined Tom Cruise in Oscar-winning filmmaker Alejandro G. Iñárritu's untitled feature movie that's shooting at Pinewood Studios in the UK.


	D'Arcy confirmed the news in a comment they released exclusively to Deadline. “I'm delighted to be working with such extraordinary and exacting artists as Alejandro and Tom,” they told us. “They are the masters of their craft, and witnessing them in combination has been a privilege.”


	Back in December, Warner Bros and Legendary Entertainment announced that González Iñárritu's film will premiere on October 2, 2026. Per the synopsis, the movie concerns “the most powerful man in the world [who] embarks on a frantic mission to prove he is humanity's savior before the disaster he's unleashed destroys everything.”

	











	González Iñárritu is once again collaborating with his Birdman co-writers Alexander Dinelaris and Nicolas Giacobone, with Sabina Bierman also sharing a screenwriting credit.




			Watch on Deadline		







	González Iñárritu won Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture Academy Awards in 2016 for Birdman and was honored with a second Best Director Oscar the following year for The Revenant.


	Cruise leads a cast that includes Sandra Hüller (Anatomy of a Fall, The Zone of Interest), John Goodman (Argo, The Big Lebowski), Jesse Plemons (Kinds of Kindness, The Power of the Dog), Sophie Wilde (Babygirl, Talk to Me), Riz Ahmed (Sound of Metal, Relay) and Michael Stuhlbarg (Dopesick, The Shape of Water). Deadline revealed several casting developments back in August, months after we revealed the project is in the works.


	When I spoke to Cruise in February he told me that he was having “the time of my life” working with González Iñárritu and “this cast.”


	Superstar Cruise will join director Christopher McQuarrie for the world premiere of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at the Cannes Film Festival where it will be screened Out of Competition on May 14.


	The eighth picture in the Mission: Impossible franchise will have its stateside theatrical release over the Memorial Day weekend May 23.


	D'Arcy's last feature appearance was in director Eva Husson's 2021 movie Mothering Sunday, produced by Elizabeth Karlsen and Stephen Woolley, opposite Colin Firth, Olivia Colman, Odessa Young, Josh O'Connor, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, Patsy Ferran and Glenda Jackson.

	











MINOR SPOILERS: Of course, D'Arcy's best known, thus far, for their lead role as Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragon, the Game of Thrones prequel adapted from George R.R. Martin's Fire & Blood novel. In the last episode of Season 2, Rhaenyra was proclaimed the true queen of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, and was headed for the mother of all bloody battles, for which fans of the HBO drama will have to wait until Season 3 to see.


	Martin's Fire & Blood chronicles the history of House Targaryen and is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones.


	D'Arcy garnered back-to-back Golden Globe Best Performance for a Female Actor nominations for their role in House of the Dragon. 


The Talent, a superb short film they produced and starred in, received a British Independent Film Awards nomination for Best British Short in 2023.

International Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Cameras start rolling next month in the UK on Aladdin: The Monkey's Paw, a new feature described as a “dark, supernatural reimagining” of the Aladdin story from Empire Studios, Every Entertainment, and 8th Law Pictures


	The film's synopsis read: A modern-day Londoner, Aladdin, inherits an ancient monkey's paw believed to grant wishes, only to discover that every desire comes at a soul-crushing price. As those around him fall victim to its curse, he must confront a growing evil — and the demonic force that feeds on every wish made.


	Production begins in late May 2025, with principal photography taking place in the UK.

	The film stars Nick Sagar (Queen of the South), Ricky Norwood (EastEnders), Montana Manning (Tell Me Everything), and Bradley Stryker (Terrifier 3), who also directs. DOP is Simon Stolland (Marching Powder). 


	The film is produced by Charley McDougall (Moon Quake), Jamie McLeod-Ross (The Reckoning), Nick Sagar, and Bradley Stryker. Screenplay by Charley McDougall. Executive Producers are Rustin Matthew, Terry Bird, and Arthur Corber.


	“We always wanted to explore horror through a personal lens — not just the scares, but the human cost of wishes,” McDougall said of the film. “This story's been haunting us for a while, and it's time to let it loose. The best horror films haunt you long after the credits roll. That's what this story does. It's sharp, emotional, and full of dread in all the right ways. We're not just making another horror film — we're building a world around a truly iconic concept. The paw, the mythology, the characters — it's all there.”


	Stryker added: “This film will be so much fun — it's all about the peaks and valleys; the highs of lows of what we deem our dreams and desires… and then we slam that into a genre film in which the stakes have never been more diabolical and entertaining.”

Gayle King revealed that Katy Perry sang a special song while they traveled together in space. In a live stream, the “CBS This Morning” host revealed that the pop singer belted out part of the Louis Armstrong classic “What a Wonderful World” during their journey into outer space in Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket. Perry previously promised that she would sing while in space.

“The best part was when we got back in our seats after Zero-G's, Katy sang ‘What a Wonderful World,'” King said on the X livestream after the crew returned to Earth.

Perry previously promised a serenade of some sort. In a video shared via Instagram on April 13, the Grammy-nominated singer teased, “I think I'm gonna sing, sing a little bit. I gotta sing in space!”

Perry and King were part of the all-female Taking Up Space Crew, which launched early morning on April 14. They were joined by aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, film producer Kerianne Flynn, and Bezos' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

Perry knew she would not sing one of her own songs during the 11-minute space flight. 

“We'd been asking her to sing the whole time and she wouldn't,” King told reporters, according to Billboard. “Everybody said, ‘sing ‘Roar,' sing ‘Firework,' but she said ‘it's not about me. I wanted to talk about the world.'”

Perry explained that she sang “What a Wonderful World” in lieu of one of her own songs as a way to honor “collective energy” in the all-female spacecraft.

“I think that it's not about me. It's not about singing my songs,” the former “American Idol” judge said. “It's about us. It's about making space for future women and taking up space and belonging. And it's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it. This is all for the benefit of Earth.”

Perry previously performed “What a Wonderful World” for an iHeart Radio Living Room concert. When deciding what song to sing in outer space, something made her turn to the 1967 Armstrong classic.

“I've covered that song in the past and obviously my higher self is always steering the ship because I had no idea that one day I'd be singing that song in space,” she told reporters on April 14, per The Independent.

Media mogul Oprah Winfrey was in tears as she watched her friend Gayle King blast into space.

King was part of Blue Origin's all-female crew that launched into space on April 14, 2025. The crew included Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez and pop star Katy Perry.

“I LOVE YOU,” Perry posted on her X page shortly before the launch.

ABC News aired footage showing Winfrey wiping her eyes as she watched the launch. “Oprah Winfrey appears to have tears in her eyes as her longtime friend journalist Gayle King is launched into space aboard a Blue Origin rocket,” the network wrote on X.

The Blue Origin space flight was streamed live on Blue Origin. Around 8:45 a.m. central time, the space capsule appeared to have landed back safely on Earth.

“New Shepard's 11th human flight, NS-31, will lift off from Launch Site One in West Texas on Monday, April 14. The mission includes Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyễn, Gayle King, Katy Perry, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sánchez,” Blue Origin wrote before the launch.

“The New Shepard launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC,” the page wrote, posting profiles of the crew.

A post shared by CBS Mornings (@cbsmornings)

King's Instagram page shared a video of the lift-off into space. “LIFTOFF: Gayle King, Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, and Kerianne Flynn make history aboard Blue Origin's first all-women flight crew as they lift off from Texas,” the post from CBS Mornings read.

Her page also shared video showing her walking to the rocket.

Oprah Daily shared a photo of King and wrote, “Introducing the NS-31 members going to space today! @gayleking is an award-winning journalist, co-host of @cbsmornings, editor-at-large of @oprahdaily, and the host of Gayle King in the House on SiriusXM radio.”

The post continued, “In a career spanning decades, Gayle is a gifted, compassionate interviewer able to break through the noise and create meaningful conversations. As someone who is staying open to new adventures, even ones that scare her, Gayle is honored to be part of @blueorigin's first all-female flight team and is looking forward to stepping out of her comfort zone.”

King and Winfrey also shared a video showing Winfrey embracing King as she drove with the other women to the launch site.

The Shaderoom shared video on April 13, 2025 of Chris Brown appearing to share a gleeful conversation with his former flame, Karrueche Tran, during the first weekend of Coachella.

A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)

Tran, dressed in a white cropped tank and belted jeans, sported a bandana on her head as she giggled while sharing an exchange with the father of three, who paired a black tee shirt with two gold chains. 

A post shared by karrueche ™ (@karrueche)

Brown, 35, famously dated Rihanna from 2008 to 2009 until the infamous Grammy day incident that left him on felony probation for assault. The pair rekindled their relationship in 2012, and collaborated on the well-received song “Birthday Cake” with Rick Ross. But things went sour after Karrueche Tran came into the picture, and the three were drawn into one of the 2010s' most talked about love triangles.

Many fans believed the “Ocean's Eight” star called out Tran with the line “Sweeter than a rice cake” on the birthday-themed duet.

Brown and Rihanna attended the 2013 Grammys together, three years after Essence says Brown first became involved with Tran, who broke things off with him for the final time in 2015, according to the outlet.

The “Forever” singer appeared to reference his off-and-on relationship with the Fenty Beauty founder in a 2012 vimeo clip titled “The Real Chris Brown” in which he said, “You know, when you share history with somebody, and then you tend to fall in love with somebody else, it's kinda difficult.” He went on to ask, “Is it such a thing as loving to people? I don't know if it's possible but for me, I feel like that.”

In 2017, People reported a judge had granted Tran a 5-year restraining order against the “Loyal” singer after the influencer testified he became aggressive after she refused to return gifted jewelry.

In a 2015 interview, Tran told Iyanla part of the reason her relationship with the singer and rapper fell apart was because she was an “old fashioned traditionalist” who had desires to get married and have children that Brown didn't share. 

The 2017 restraining order seemed to stem entirely from cell tumultuous cell phone interactions, as the two were never publicly spotted anywhere near each other and are not believed to have seen each other since their early 2015 split.

One fan seemed to believe Brown, who recently announced additional dates for his “Breezy Bowl” stadium tour, still had romantic potential with Tran. “I think if they got back together, that would be the only thing that would make Chris Brown get married,” she wrote.

However, other fans weren't feeling a reunion. One wrote, “Let's normalize having peace beyond past relationships.”

A third commenter opted not to speculate on the former couple's relationship status, instead pointing out “Normani minding her business,” referencing the way the former Third Harmony Member sat behind Brown casually holding an electric fan towards her face.

Don't miss Katy Perry & Gayle King launch into space with Blue Origin!

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

The “Teenage Dream” singer has started the countdown and shared a livestream link to her epic space flight!

The mission can be viewed at the below link:

https://www.blueorigin.com/missions/ns-31

Things will kick off at 9:30 Eastern Time, according to Blue Origin.

Jeff Bezos had a special message for the crew, saying, “I love you all and I can't wait to hear how it's changed you when you get back.”

Along with King and Perry, the Amazon founder's fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, is on board the craft.

Four mothers are on board, and even a grandmother.

Gayle King said about the flight, “As excited as I am, I'll be very glad when we come back down.”

She revealed her decision to partake in the daring adventure was inspired in part by some wise words she was once given by LL Cool J: “Dreams don't have deadlines.”

The travelers will accelerate to 3Gs, compared to the 1G we experience her on earth, according to reporters on the Blue Origin livestream.

The women will get to unbuckle and enjoy weightlessness and “insane views” of space for approximately four minutes.

Maximum G forces will be felt on the descent, which will reach 5Gs. The pressure will then ease up before the parachutes are deployed and the astronauts come back down.

The craft is manned by the first all-female crew to go to space.

“I've never been more proud of my friend than today. This is bigger than just going to space,” said Oprah Winfrey.

“Anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap if there's a slight bit of turbulence,” the media mogul explained. She believes her friend is “ovecoming a fear” and the experience will be “cathartic.”

Winfrey went on, “Life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest of yourself. I felt deeply she would regret, and I didn't wanna hear for the next 15 years ‘I wish I had gone.'”

Winfrey said her final words to her friend before the journey were, “Peace be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand.”

The HARPO founder finished with, “None of us will ever forget this day.”

Winfrey, wearing a bright yellow sweater, clutched her chest and stared at the sky as the rocket hurtled towards the atmosphere.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jennifer Lopez & Ben Affleck Are Getting Closer: Report","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-getting-closer/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Actress and singer Jennifer Lopez and her ex-boyfriend Ben Affleck are getting closer, but it's just as friends.

That's according to In Touch, which reported that they are trying to repair their friendship for the sake of their kids. However, In Touch reported, through a source, that the pair are unlikely to ever be as friendly post-divorce as Affleck is with his first ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.

“Let's face it, Ben is never going to be as close with J. Lo as he is with Jennifer Garner, they don't share three kids,” the source told In Touch. “But they are both very sensitive to the fact that [J. Lo's] twins Max and Emme are very close to Ben's kids.”

Garner and Affleck have three kids together. Lopez, a former “American Idol” judge, has two kids with her former husband, singer Marc Anthony.

Despite the In Touch report, Page Six reported that the divorce was hard on Lopez.

“She's actually devastated,” a source told Page Six. “She's keeping it together publicly but she's told everyone around her not to trash Ben. She doesn't want to get down in the dirt with him.”

Yet another source, though, described Lopez as “having a blast” filming her new movie, “Office Romance.”

The source told Page Six that Affleck had been reaching out to Lopez again and noted that Garner and Lopez “are actually friends. They bonded over co-parenting their kids. I don't know why the press feels they have to pit women against each other.” For her part, Garner is dating businessman John Miller.

For his part, Affleck has spoken about the divorce from Lopez in an April interview with GQ.

“There's a tendency to look at breakups and want to identify root causes or something. But honestly … the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting,” he said to the magazine. 

“There's no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue. The truth is, when you talk to somebody, ‘Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no, ‘This is what happened.' It's just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.”

The couple famously were engaged years ago before breaking off their engagement and marrying and divorcing other people. They reconciled and finally married.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Yellowstone Creator Taylor Sheridan's Exit From Sons of Anarchy Changed TV Forever","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/yellowstone-taylor-sheridans-sons-of-anarchy/","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:08:15 GMT","

Before Taylor Sheridan became the mastermind behind “Yellowstone” and his sprawling neo-Western empire, he was a familiar face on “Sons of Anarchy.” For two seasons, he locked horns with Charlie Hunnam's Jax Teller as the upright Deputy David Hale. But in season 3, his character departed the gritty biker drama thanks to a brutal drive-by death. 

This ended up being a career pivot for Sheridan, and ultimately allowed him to reshape his path and craft a legacy that outshines his acting days. Here's how that exit unfolded and why it changed TV forever. 

Sheridan joined “Sons of Anarchy” in 2008 as Deputy Hale, a by-the-book lawman who clashed with the SAMCRO biker gang in Kurt Sutter's Hamlet-on-wheels saga. 

For 21 episodes, Hale was a thorn in Jax's side. The character evolved from a crime-busting idealist to a reluctant ally of white supremacists in season 2, only to betray them by season's end. 

Then, his arc screeched to a halt in the third episode of season 3 when a van mowed him down at a funeral, leaving his fate gruesomely clear. What fans may not know is that there was a very good reason behind his abrupt exit.

“At that time, they were offering me what I thought was a very unfair wage. It was less than virtually every other person on the show and not enough for me to quit my second job,” he told Deadline in 2021.

Fed up with being undervalued and number 11 on the call sheet, Sheridan walked away. This risky move set the stage for a radical reinvention.

Sheridan's departure wasn't just about money, though. It was more of a wake-up call that was sparked by a remark from a business affairs attorney. 

“He's not worth more. There are 50 of him,” is the jab Sheridan heard that flipped a switch in his career and sent him down the writing path. Just three years later, his Oscar-nominated script for “Sicario” was finished and in the hands of director Denis Villeneuve. This launched a string of acclaimed films for Sheridan, which also included “Hell or High Water” and “Wind River.”

But it was the 2018 debut of “Yellowstone” that cemented his vision. His creation of the Dutton family saga, which blended ranch warfare with moral ambiguity, exploded into a cultural juggernaut. The epic western led to spinoffs like “1883,” “1923,” and the upcoming “The Madison.” 

Sheridan's exit from acting wasn't a retreat. Instead, it was a leap into storytelling and proof that he could helm a franchise bigger than Sons ever dreamed. He even snuck a sly nod to his past during “Yellowstone's” third season, when Rip Wheeler trashed a biker gang's motorcycles. It was a cheeky flip of Hale's bloody end.

Sheridan's post-“Sons” career didn't just thrive, it redefined TV's landscape. Beyond “Yellowstone,” he's churned out hits like “Mayor of Kingstown,” “Special Ops: Lioness,” and “Landman.” All of these series have showcased his knack for complex characters caught between right and wrong — a thread he first tugged at as Hale.

While “Sons of Anarchy” peaked with seven seasons and a loyal cult following, “Yellowstone's” finale in 2024 capped a run that averaged 11.6 million viewers per episode, dwarfing “Sons'” audience of four to six million. 

Sheridan's eight TV series and six films have made him a one-man industry, far from the “11 on the call sheet” dig. 

The “Sheridan-verse” is available to stream on Paramount Plus, with the exception of “Yellowstone,” which is available on Peacock.

Cate Blanchett may be looking to diversify her career away from the screen. The acclaimed actress/producer told the Radio Times that she is considering “giving up acting,” however, there is no timeline just yet for a possible exit. 

“My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it: I am serious about giving up acting,” Blanchett said. “[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.” 

IndieWire has reached out for additional comment. 

Blanchett won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2005 for “The Aviator” and Best Actress in 2014 for “Blue Jasmine.” She also was nominated for six other Oscars. The prolific star recently led Guy Maddin's “Rumours,” Alfonso Cuarón's series “Disclaimer,” Eli Roth's “Borderlands,” and Steven Soderbergh's “Black Bag.” Blanchett will next appear in Jim Jarmusch's “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother.”

Blanchett, through her Dirty Films banner, also launched Proof of Concept with Netflix and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative in 2023. Proof of Concept is a program that grants female, trans, and non-binary filmmakers $50,000 for features or TV series. 

In addition to acting and producing, Blanchett also has to weather being a celebrity. She told the Radio Times that across her years of fame, she hasn't escaped the “feeling of being uncomfortable” in the spotlight.

“When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicized, they sound really loud. I'm not that person,” Blanchett said. “I make more sense in motion – it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.” 

Blanchett added, “I've always felt like I'm on the periphery of things, so I'm always surprised when I belong anywhere. I go with curiosity into whatever environment that I'm in, not expecting to be accepted or welcomed. I've spent a lifetime getting comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable.” 

Blanchett further said during Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang‘s “Las Culturistas” podcast earlier this year that she would prefer to go “back to the day” when awards shows weren't televised to the public.

“Bring that back and just have a great party where people can just let go. I mean, the industry is so scattered and at such a point…which I think potentially could be exciting or could really be depressing, but it's at a pivot point, and so we need to gather together and celebrate what it is that we do, without it having to have any public-facing. I mean, the fashion is great, and all of that stuff. We'll find out in the end who won or who didn't win. But it would be so nice [if] that happened behind closed doors. Absolutely a very different evening.”

Two nuclear families — both headed by a pair of sisters — go on a darkly comic family vacation that takes a turn for the suddenly tragic in Laurynas Bareiša's grimly funny “Drowning Dry.” The film was Lithuania's pick for the 2025 Best International Feature Academy Award, and while it didn't make the cut, “Drowning Dry” previously won Best Director and Best Performance for its ensemble at the 2024 Locarno Film Festival. As IndieWire exclusively announced, Dekanalog will release the film stateside on Friday, July 18 at IFC Center with Bareiša in attendance, followed by Los Angeles and other major U.S. cities to be announced.

“Drowning Dry” also played at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and at New Directors/New Films. Written, directed, and shot by Bareiša, “Drowning Dry” tells, per the distributor “the story of two sisters, Ernesta (Gelminė Glemžaitė) and Justė (Agnė Kaktaitė), whose lives are irrevocably altered after a near-tragic accident involving one of their children during a weekend getaway with their spouses, Tomas (Giedrius Kiela) and Lukas (Paulius Markevičius).”

The film eventually seems to take a meta turn as the same events are shown from a slightly alternative-timeline version of the telling, with subtle and offbeat performances from the cast — Ruben Östlund is a fitting reference.

The release marks Bareiša's second collaboration with Dekanalog, who previously distributed his 2021 Venice International Film Festival's Horizons Award-winning debut feature, “Pilgrims.” 

Dekanalog is dedicated to the release of unique filmmaking voices and musical scores from around the world, founded in 2020 by Elijah Drenner, Lysa Le, and George Schmalz. Dekanalog has recently distributed the Independent Spirit Award-nominated C.J. “Fiery” Obasi's “Mami Wata,” last year's Dutch Academy Awards submission Ena Sendijarević's “Sweet Dreams,” and last year's Swiss submission Carmen Jaquier's “Thunder.” 

“Drowning Dry” opens in select theaters July 18. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

The Cannes Critics' Week 2025 selection boasts Best Picture winner Sean Baker‘s latest project.

Baker collaborates once more with his “Take Out” co-director and co-writer Shih-Ching Tsou, who makes her directorial debut with “Left-Handed Girl.” Tsou also produced Baker's “Tangerine” (which she starred in) and “The Florida Project,” and executive-produced “Starlet.” Now, “Left-Handed Girl” incorporates Baker's social-realist approach with the Taipei-set tragicomedy “Left-Handed Girl,” which follows a single mother and her two daughters building a new life in the Taiwanese capital. Baker cowrites, edits, and produces the film.

 










“The film was edited by Sean. It's true that there's a connection, I'm not going to hide it, and I don't think Shih-Ching Tsou will either,” Cannes Critics' Week artistic director Ava Cahen told Deadline. “It's a bit reminiscent of ‘Tangerine' and ‘The Florida Project,' for the way it captures reality, with a form of wonder, or at least a desire for the fabulous. The editing of the film is exceptional, the direction is very powerful, and above all, this film has a frenetic pace, a crazy pace.”

Baker recently won Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director for “Anora.” The film additionally landed lead star Mikey Madison Best Actress. 

“Left-Handed Girl” may be one of the buzziest films debuting during the Cannes Critics' Week 2025, but the sidebar will open with Belgian director Laura Wandel's (“Playground”) child custody drama “Adam's Interest.” The Critics' Week will later close with Japanese director Momoko Seto's animated feature debut “Dandelion's Odyssey”; this will be the first animated feature to screen in the section since Jérémy Clapin's Grand Prize winner “I Lost My Body” in 2019.

More than 1,000 films were submitted for Cannes Critics' Week 2025. The edition will run May 14-22. This year's jury is presided over by Rodrigo Sorogoyen, alongside Oscar-winning British actor Daniel Kaluuya, Moroccan film critic Jihane Bougrine, French-Canadian cinematographer Josée Deshaies, and Indonesian producer Yulia Evina Bhara.

This morning, HBO announced four of the series regulars on its upcoming “Harry Potter” TV series adaptation, comprising most of the adult cast for the first season. Those roles are recent Olivier Award-winning actor John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Oscar-nominee Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, “I May Destroy You” star Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, and “Cornetto Trilogy” favorite Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid. In addition, recent “Hamlet” performer Luke Thallon will guest star as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirinus Quirrell, while five-time BAFTA-winner Paul Whitehouse will recur on the series as Hogwarts caretaker Argus Filch. In a joint statement shared with IndieWire, showrunner and executive producer Francesca Gardiner as well as director and executive producer Mark Mylod said, “We're delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can't wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life.”

Though the new series aims to be an even more faithful adaptation of the “Harry Potter” books than the film franchise that remains popular to this day, author J.K. Rowling and original producer David Heyman remain attached to the project. Heyman likely will have his hands full working on the Bond reinvention taking place at Amazon MGM, but it's unclear how deeply Rowling will be involved. The series is produced by Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. In addition to Rowling and Heyman, the show is executive produced by Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts.

 










Though not an official statement, John Lithgow did seemingly announce this news back in February during an interview with Screen Rant. In regard to being offered the part that was previously played by legends like Richard Harris and Michael Gambon, he said, “It came as a total surprise to me. I got the phone call at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision, because it's going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I'm afraid. But I'm very excited. Some wonderful people are turning their attention back to ‘Harry Potter.'”

Speaking to IndieWire's Vincent Perella on the Emmy's red carpet back in September 2024, Gary Oldman expressed his interest in taking on the role of Dumbledore, as well, though doubted it would happen. He previously played Harry's godfather Sirius Black in a number of the original films and predicted the show wouldn't recycle past players.

“I would bet my money that they will get a whole new cast of people,” said Oldman to IndieWire. “Maybe in a few years, I could do Dumbledore.”

Casting for the young actors who will play Harry and best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger has not been announced.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for ‘The Last of Us‘ Season 2, Episode 1, “Future Days.” For a spoiler-free analysis, read our full Season 2 review.] 

Joel (Pedro Pascal), always fronting with gruff bravado to mask his inconsolable sorrow, likes to keep things simple. When his nephew, Benji (Ezra Agbonkhese), sits on his lap and asks about the maps Joel's looking over, Jackson's slacking-off construction foreman cheerfully quizzes the young boy on where he lives. “What's that?” Joel asks, and Benji replies, “The fence!” “And what's inside?” “People!” “And what's outside?” “Monsters.”

 










See? Simple. The fence protects the people because the fence keeps monsters out.

Except throughout the Season 2 premiere, “Future Days,” writer and director Craig Mazin repeatedly makes clear that the monsters are moving in, if not already here. There's the stretching, straining tendrils of malevolent fungus living in the town's pipes. There's the newly evolved clickers, called “Stalkers,” so sneaky and patient when hunting their prey. There's an obsessive villain in Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) — the former Firefly introduced at the top of the episode, when she swears “slow,” brutal vengeance on Joel — who's now close enough to put Jackson in her crosshairs.

And then there's Joel, floating between monster and man. Episode 1 begins by repeating the very last scene of Season 1. Five years ago, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is suspicious of Joel's story about what happened in Salt Lake City. Were there really other immune people who could help the scientists find a cure? Was the hospital really attacked by raiders? If not, why would Joel lie? But he did lie. His story is a lie, and he lies again when Ellie asks him to swear to its veracity. 

Even when he does, she remains dubious, and reminding us of her reluctant acceptance to kick off Season 2 feels pointed. Sure, it's been two years since the scene first aired. Maybe Mazin just wanted to remind us what's happened. Maybe it's a framework for the season as a whole, rather than this specific episode.

But replaying the scene also tees up the premiere's central, mysterious conflict: Ellie is mad at Joel, and no one knows why. Things seem pretty good in Jackson. The town functions like a town, with electricity and food, contracted workers and a town council. There's even a New Year's Eve party with live music, drinks, and dancing.

 










Ellie has grown from a 14-year-old survivor to a 19-year-old assassin. She trains in hand-to-hand combat with men much bigger than her, led by Jesse (Young Mazino of “Beef” fame). She practices her long-range shooting with her de facto uncle, Tommy (Gabriel Luna). She cherishes her patrol assignments, in part because they get her closer to the action than any town-bound duties would, and in part because they get her closer to Dina (Isabela Merced), her best friend and full-blown crush.

Although Dina recently dumped Jesse — in what's described as an on-again, off-again relationship that's leaning toward staying off — the couple's flirtation is decidedly one-sided: Dina makes up jokes aimed directly at Ellie's sense of humor; Dina moves in for “coincidental” bodily contact while helping Ellie get geared up; Dina makes her move on New Year's Eve, asking Ellie to dance and then going in for the kiss when it's clear her partner doesn't believe there's shared interest.

For any romantic out there, it's enough to dream that “The Last of Us” Season 2 could just go on like this for another six episodes. (Yes, this season is only seven episodes long — consider this your first warning.) Dina and Ellie go on patrol. Dina and Ellie kill a clicker or two. Dina and Ellie go out, get stoned, and fall head-over-heels in love. But obviously that's not where things are headed, just as that's not all that's going on in Episode 1.

 










Yes, life in Jackson is tantalizingly close to normal, but the monsters are knocking on the door. Or… are they already here?  

Ellie seems to think so. When Seth (Robert John Burke) chides her and Dina for kissing at “a family event,” Joel is quick to knock the drunk down and throw him out of the party. But Ellie's not mad at Seth. She's mad at Joel. “I don't need your fucking help,” she shouts at the man who only wants to help her; the man who then retires to his front porch to fix the played-out strings on her guitar; the man (or is it monster?) who saved her life by murdering dozens of innocent people in Salt Lake City.

But does Ellie know about that? The question haunts Joel so much he can't bear to entertain it. When he goes to check on Ellie before the dance, he bails as soon as it's clear things aren't suddenly hunky-dory again. When he talks to Dina about it at the start of the episode, he tries to shrug off their silent feud, using the advice he's been given in therapy. (“I can't hold myself responsible for another person's emotional state.”)

And, hell yeah, Joel is going to therapy! That being said, the excitement in seeing a terse, emotionally stunted, semi-elderly man (after the time jump, Joel is now 61 years old) sit down to better understand his emotions is muted by the fact he's been lying in every session. Clearly, he's been hoping to discover some other random issue Ellie is pissed about; one he could actually make up for, instead of his darkest, most heinous secret.

 










Luckily, Gail (Catherine O'Hara) isn't having it. Turns out, not only is the weed-smoking, whiskey-loving psychotherapist sick of Joel's “boring” cited issues, she's also over-the-moon mad at him because Joel… killed her husband? Even if that yet-to-be-examined wound wasn't still fresh (which it is, since this is Gail's first birthday without Eugene, and she hasn't even moved his boots off the entryway rug), that would be a big hurdle for even the most psychologically sound of us to get over. But Gail tries. To her immense credit, she faces her anger by expressing how she feels. “You can't heal something unless you're brave enough to say it out loud,” she says, as both advice to herself and to Joel.

Joel can't follow her lead. In a scene destined to be replayed any time Pascal's name is batted about awards circles, Joel's eyes become a blazing window to his soul. “Say the thing you're afraid to say,” Gail tells him, and Joel's expression cracks open, ever so slightly, desperate to accept the invitation.

“Did you do something to her?” Gail says, and Joel musters the slightest of nods. 

“Did you hurt her?” Gail says, and Joel quickly shakes his head, steering her away from any conventional assumptions. 

“Then what? What did you do?” Gail says, and Joel's lips part ever so slightly. His face quivers. A tear barely escapes his right eye. And then, as if he's already relived the moment in question and arrived at the same, grim decision, Joel's expression hardens. His eyes go dark, and he stands up. The man who was there a moment ago is gone, and the monster has returned. “I saved her,” he says, less for Gail than for himself. 

 










After the Season 1 finale, I wrote that Joel became the villain. His actions take the form of heroism — a father doing whatever it takes to save his kid — but in that scenario, they're selfish, destructive, and tragic. Ellie told Joel she was willing to die to save others. He refused to let her. It would hurt too much. Specifically, it would hurt Joel too much. Now, with the emergence of Abby and the drop-off in his relationship with Ellie, we can see how his choice continues to create damage, like a fungus all its own, spreading across anything he touches.

So is Joel a monster? Even writing the words “villain” and “monster” sound too harsh for a man who's shown so much vulnerability in trying to grow as a human being, and in a show so disinterested in painting people in pure white or pitch black. Still, “The Last of Us” makes its own case. When Joel gets up to leave his office, he tells his nephew, “You keep shooting those monsters.” And Benji, bless his young soul, takes dead aim at Joel — and fires.

“The Last of Us” Season 2 releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

• For as much as Pedro Pascal stole the show this week, Episode 1 is arguably more focused on Ellie — and one moment stands out: When she's dancing with Dina, she tells her “friend” that every guy in the room is staring at her. “Maybe they're jealous of you,” Dina counters. “No reason to be,” Ellie says. “I'm not a threat.” And then Dina takes a beat. She looks Ellie dead in the eye and breaks from their playful banter. “Oh Ellie,” Dina says. “I think they should be terrified of you.” 

 










In the moment, Dina is telling Ellie she is a threat to those men because Dina does like her — like, she likes her, likes her. But the emphasis Mazin puts on the moment seems to go beyond their first kiss. Should the men of Jackson be terrified of Ellie? Is it because she's so reckless on patrols? Is it because she's immune? Is it because she's with Joel, who's the reason Abby & Co. have come calling? It's hard to say yet, but it's certainly not just because Ellie stole Dina's heart.

• “Are you just going to keep grouching on like this, every session? […] I've done this long enough to know when someone is leaving something out. […] And you want me to validate that? No. Fuck no.” Oh man, I love Gail. Drinking whiskey, payments in weed — how can I book a session? 

• “What do you call a grizzly's ribs? Bear-B-Que.” With the power of puns, Dina won Ellie forever.

Sam Wilkes wasn't happy with “The Fool on the Hill.” The bassist had played the song—one of his favorites—at a gig dedicated to Beatles covers. It didn't go well. Wilkes decided to try again, this time recruiting longtime friends Gregory Uhlmann and Josh Johnson to his cause. The three had never played together as a group, but they booked a concert at L.A. jazz club ETA and trusted fate and chemistry. They started the show with McCartney's song: Uhlmann's guitar picking out a path forward, Wilkes' bass finding its languid way alongside, and Johnson's sax providing the famous melody. The familiarity of the tune gave them a gentle push, but after two minutes, they were borne along by their own momentum, serenely drifting.

The three musicians had good reason to think they would jell. Uhlmann and Johnson found one another as teenagers in Chicago before forming SML; Wilkes and Uhlmann collaborated on an album by Miya Folick; Johnson and Wilkes were session musicians in the Louis Cole Big Band. This type of cross-pollination defines the L.A. jazz scene that has formed around Tortoise guitarist Jeff Parker, whose long-running weekly residency at ETA spurred a resurgence in small-group improvisation across the city. Parker's influence with this trio runs even deeper; he was a music teacher to both Uhlmann and Johnson in their early days (a fact they didn't realize until years later). In retrospect, it seems inevitable that Uhlmann, Johnson, and Wilkes would come together—by the time they set foot on the ETA stage, they had seen one another play enough to anticipate each other's every movement.

Given their pedigree and the location of their album's recording—two concerts at ETA, one session at Uhlmann's house—comparisons with Parker's lauded ETA IVtet are unavoidable. If Parker's group deals in surefooted 20-minute excursions, Uhlmann Johnson Wilkes venture out on quick scouting missions, testing the terrain in two- and three-minute jaunts. They incorporate what they call “landing zones,” pre-written material contributed by each member, as safe havens from which to launch again. The biggest difference is the lack of percussion, but on tracks like “Marvis,” from Johnson's solo album Unusual Object, the trio is so adept at crafting complex polyrhythms with staccato picking, short sax bursts, and muted bass thumping that it's difficult to miss. These busy sections alternate with ambient cooldowns, sometimes within the same song—the frenetic interplay of “Hoe Down” slows to a stutter, then stops, to be replaced by an enchanting if disjointed static lull.

The group's secret weapon is the musicians' array of effects, each player sending their signals through enough pedals to mask their identity completely. On “Fumarole,” Uhlmann's guitar remains recognizable; Wilkes' bass and Johnson's sax have seemingly been replaced by synths more suited to downtempo electronica. Johnson's transformation on “Shwa” is the most remarkable. His sax flits and hovers like a dragonfly, evoking tightly controlled feedback more than a woodwind instrument. Post-production blurs the boundaries further: The melding of improvised live sessions with studio editing isn't new for the group's members, and they deploy their experience here to dizzying effect. On some tracks, like “Rewinded,” which reverses the “Shwa” tape to create a foundation for Johnson's patient one-note solo, the trick is easy to spot. Elsewhere, it's better to let the illusion work its magic, as with the subtle cut-and-paste in “Frica” that makes live syncopation tantalizingly difficult to discern from floating phrases added later.

“The Fool on the Hill” is the last song on Uhlmann Johnson Wilkes, though it was the first they performed together. That it perfectly concludes the album, some of which was recorded nearly two years later, is a testament to the trio's immediate rapport: They've started where most bands dream of ending up. These vignettes only hint at where they might go next.

Walt McClements has never been just an accordion player. Even when the North Carolina native was bouncing around a series of ragtag New Orleans bands, like a hardscrabble early version of Hurray for the Riff Raff or the defiantly scattershot Dark Dark Dark, McClements was more than a guy squeezing the bellows and pressing the keys. He could sing, play piano, and add some trumpet, too, a little like Garth Hudson in search of his best setting. He also had an act of his own, Lonesome Leash, whose songs vibrated, for better and worse, between anti-folk gutters and art-pop escape. When McClements finally debuted under his own name as a solo instrumentalist on 2021's warm and inquisitive A Hole in the Fence, the accordion served as the center but not the whole story. McClements would stretch or refract the sound with sundry effects, forever raising questions about where he ended and his circuits began. How, his music dared you to wonder, could the much-lampooned accordion do all that?

McClements' astounding second album, On a Painted Ocean, does not bother with such borders—or, really, much fealty to the accordion at all. Composed in part on an organ in a Pasadena church, these pieces were ultimately lifted by contributions from explosive New Orleans saxophonist Aurora Nealand and ingenious electronics explorer Rachika Nayar. Fluorescent sounds flicker at the start of “Cloud Prints” like neon light reflecting off dirty glass; by track's end, though, Nealand howls through her horn like Albert Ayler as McClements sculpts a pillow-top drone beneath her. “Washed Up” suggests some oddball Tim Hecker nocturne, interlaced accordion lines spiraling through electronic phosphorescence like the outstretched arms of an octopus. With apologies to Lawrence Welk and Pauline Oliveros, it adheres to no known notion of what an “accordion album” might entail.

Like so much of McClements' past work, On a Painted Ocean remains wide-eyed and big-hearted, bound together by an unflagging sense of candor that makes these seven pieces about much more than what he can do to, or pair with, his accordion. The expanded palette only makes what's here more affecting. On a Painted Ocean has the tonal splendor of Kali Malone's work but the emotional ballast of Popol Vuh and post-rock. It is a rare combination from an unlikely source: the accordion guy from those folk-punk bands who moved to Los Angeles and finally found the setting for his sound.

Opener “A Painted Ship” begins simply enough, with McClements doubling and then tripling an accordion melody that feels innately forlorn, like a sailor's lament. He steadily stretches and warps the tones beneath that main theme, cultivating dread so powerful it conjures slipping into an abyss. The title track, though, offers the inverse. McClements starts with an anxious digital sequence, a snippet of glissando bouncing back and forth like an Atari game cartridge damaged by water. It is too busy to be beautiful, a cracked-mirror representation of a life lived between multiple screens. But McClements cuts in above it with a deep and mighty theme, its bombast evoking some kind of overfed beast staggering into a room to take charge. It marches over the tremulous hum, commanding the space as it guides whoever's listening and whoever needs it a hand toward the other shore.

That safety, though, does not last. McClements groans into “Parade,” the 10-minute masterstroke that sets up the gorgeous and triumphant finale, “Clattering.” Accordion and organ rumble and sigh as if awaking to a barrage of bad news, a feeling that Nealand reinforces when she blows in like some winter gale. She and McClements stand there in righteous rage for a long time, her saxophone contorting and fretting and blaring over his multilayered hums, occasionally so heavy they feel like the crust of the world. They slowly fade away, as if exhausted from exasperation.

But then, for the first time in many years, there's McClements' voice, stammering through a question about what would give someone confidence. He's talking to Casey Leigh, a confidant who has taken classes in administering Narcan. Methodically but tenderly, she talks him through the procedure before assuring him that he can learn how to do rescue breathing, too, to literally exhale someone back to life.

When I first heard On a Painted Ocean, the exchange mystified me, especially the way it seemed to emerge out of nowhere: Had I overlooked earlier dialogue? Had I missed a memo that this entire LP was a memorial for a lost friend? Did it feel like maybe McClements was trading on one grief of the day to add some frisson at the end of an album? But the more I've heard it, the more I've understood that it does what so much of my favorite art does—hands me something to carry into the world, to make my load and hopefully someone else's a little more tolerable. McClements sets a life-saving lesson to an electrifying and affirming sound, then makes his exit with an exquisite accordion piece that limns a new day rising, at least one more time. It is a practical gift from a friend, the kind you keep forever.

Katy Perry has returned from space. The musician boarded Jeff Bezos' space tourism company Blue Origin's spacecraft New Shepard this morning to participate in the first all-female space flight since 1963, when cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space. When she emerged from the capsule, Perry held a daisy to the sky and kneeled down to kiss the ground. 


	“I feel super connected to love. So connected to love. I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, how much love you have to give, and how loved you are until the day you launch,” she said. Perry added that the experience was the best of her life, second only to becoming a mother. “That's why it was hard for me to go, because that's all my love right there. And I have to surrender and trust that the universe is going to take care of me and protect me, and also my family, my daughter,” she added. 


	New Shepard took off from “Launch Site One” in West Texas during a launch window that opened at 8:30 a.m. CT. Perry was joined onboard by fellow voyagers Gayle King, activist Amanda Nguyen, movie producer Kerianne Flynn, and entertainment reporter (and Bezos' fiancée) Lauren Sánchez. Aisha Bowe, a former NASA aerospace engineer, was also on the flight, which marks Blue Origin's 31st overall flight and 11th suborbital flight with humans aboard.

	The voyage spanned approximately 11 minutes. During a livestream of the event, only audio was available from inside the spacecraft. At multiple points during liftoff and landing, the occupants of the capsule could be heard screaming. The women were allowed to unstrap from their seats for about four minutes to experience weightlessness before buckling up for their return. 


	Perry sung “What a Wonderful World” during the flight rather than one of her own songs. “I've covered that song in the past, and obviously my higher self is always steering the ship, because I had no clue that one day I would decide to sing a little bit of that in space,” she said. “But I think that it's not about me, it's not about singing my songs. It's about a collective energy in there. It's about us. It's about making space for future women and taking up space and belonging. And it's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it. This is all for the benefit of Earth.”

	The flight only travelled just above the Kármán line 330,000 feet above sea level, defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale as the edge of space. The spacecraft didn't travel at a speed fast enough to stay in space, instead breaching the barrier just enough for it to count as a visit to outer space before coming back down to Earth. 


	The launch drew a small crowd of celebrities including Oprah, Kris Jenner, and Khloe Kardashian, who came to watch the event. 


	Perry felt something supernatural about the trip before she even took off. On Sunday, April 13, the pop singer shared a video reflecting on receiving the opportunity to go to space, something she has said was a dream she's had for 15 years. “I'm always looking for little confirmations from the heavens, from my guides, from my angels, from my higher self,” she said. “When I ask for it and I'm open to it, it's pretty loud.”

	Perry noted that when she looked up the capsule, she noticed an outline on it in the shape of a feather. “When I saw that, it was like a total confirmation, because my mom has always called me feather,” she said. But the signs didn't stop there. During another round of space training, she continued, she learned the name of the capsule: Tortoise. “The most energetic wave just shot through my body, and I was like, whoa,” she said. “My mom calls me two nicknames, feather and tortoise.” 


	The singer added that she doesn't believe in coincidences, especially not when “I'm going to space on a rocket in a capsule with my symbol, the feather, called tortoise, and my mom calls me tortoise.” She even shared screenshots of messages her mom sent her using the nickname. “I'm just so grateful for these confirmations, and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me steering the ship,” Perry said.

Mickey Rourke isn't pretending to be surprised that he was asked to leave Celebrity Big Brother house. On Sunday, the U.K.-based reality series shared footage from when the actor was confronted about his “inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior,” which he owned up to with a few deflections.


	“I stepped over the line, and I take responsibility for doing the wrong thing. Because I lost my temper, and I've been trying to work on it my whole life,” Rourke said. “And I wish I would have had better self-control. I'm very sorry. I'm ashamed of myself for losing it for a few seconds there.”


	The specific instances referenced in his eviction included “threatening and aggressive” language towards housemate Chris Hughes and “inappropriate sexual language” towards Ella Rae Wise, which Rourke claimed he wasn't aware of. “Nobody got touched or hurt, or maybe some feelings got hurt, or maybe others have feelings about someone getting upset,” he said. “But, you know, I'm just sorry about that.” Rourke said at the end of his exit interview that he intended to leave the day prior, but wasn't chosen. “I'd like to leave now, actually,” he said.

	











	His departure from the series comes after he was issued a warning that “further language or behavior of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.” The notice followed an “offensive and unacceptable” interaction with Jojo Siwa in which he asked her if she was interested in boys or girls, to which she responded, “Girls. My partner is non-binary.” Rourke then said, “If I stay longer than four days, you won't be gay anymore.”

	Rourke followed this with a number of homophobic comments, including one instance when he exclaimed “I need a fag” — British slang for a cigarette — while heading to the smoking section, but then pointed to Siwa and said, “I'm not talking to you.” This came in addition to his competition strategy, which including a goal to “to vote the lesbian out real quick.”


	“I apologize. I don't have dishonorable intentions,” he said at the time. “I'm just talking smack, you know. I wasn't taking it all so serious. I didn't mean any bad intentions and if I did, sorry.”

	In the 2004 series premiere of The Apprentice, the reality competition show that laundered Donald Trump's reputation as a tacky sleazebag and launched his presidential aspirations, the billionaire real estate mogul reintroduces himself to America with a glossy, vague little anecdote about overcoming financial adversity. In a preamble to the show, he narrates over sweeping aerial shots of New York City — “my city,” he calls it — and footage of him flying over his own shiny buildings in his Trump-branded helicopter. “It wasn't always so easy,” he says. “About 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back and I won, bigly. I used my brain, I used my negotiating skills, and it worked it all out.” 


	In reality, Trump had climbed out of that $3-plus billion debt in the early 1990s reportedly by taking out loans from his wealthy father and siblings and evading federal taxes. But he doesn't get into those details; instead, he moves right into introducing the 16 twentysomething Ivy League grads and entrepreneurs who will be competing each week for a chance to “work for the Donald” and potentially, maybe, become a billionaire themselves.

	











	Cut to the first morning of competition. The gaggle of young, conventionally attractive contestants gathers in the New York Stock Exchange and gazes up adoringly at Trump, who addresses them from a high royal balcony. He's 20 years younger than we see him now — his hair darker and fuller, his makeup less cartoonishly orange, his demeanor more reasonable and even charming. “This is really and truly the center of the world for big business,” he bellows down at his apprentices like some kind of benevolent finance deity. And then he separates the men from the women and shoos them out into the streets of Manhattan to compete at selling lemonade. 


	WHEN TRUMP FIRST THREW his hat into the Republican presidential primary in 2015, I was a young politics reporter at the Huffington Post. And I remember us all thinking at first that his candidacy was some kind of joke or reality TV bit — to such an extent that our editorial director and Washington bureau chief issued a joint statement in July of that year announcing that we had decided to cover Trump's campaign in our Entertainment section, rather than in Politics with the other candidates. “Our reason is simple,” they wrote. “Trump's campaign is a sideshow. We won't take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.”

	We took a lot of flack for that decision, obviously, and came to regret it as it became clearer by the week that a whole lot of voters were dead serious about electing Trump. Five months later, Arianna Huffington announced in a new statement headlined “We Are No Longer Entertained” that we would be covering him as a politician going forward. What we had failed to appreciate at the time was the extent to which Trump's hit reality show and the “business genius” persona it created had essentially propagandized tens of millions of viewers into believing he was the only man strong and savvy enough to solve the nation's problems and deliver them the American dream. Producer Bill Pruitt later admitted that this was by design — that show creators “played fast and loose with the facts” and “conned” us all about our future president. “By carefully misleading viewers about Trump — his wealth, his stature, his character, and his intent — the competition reality show set about an American fraud that would balloon beyond its creators' wildest imaginations,” Pruitt wrote for Slate last year.


	“Our job was to make him look legitimate, to make it look like there was something behind it, even though we pretty much all knew that there wasn't,” producer Jonathon Braun, who'd also worked on Survivor, told The New York Times a few months later. And it worked: While the most recent Gallup poll before The Apprentice aired found that 58 percent of people had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, half of Americans had a favorable view of him in the same survey 18 months later.

	That fraud has ballooned now, of course, into a second presidential term for Trump. In a full-circle moment, tech billionaires are now openly competing and humiliating themselves for Trump's favor the way his 25-year-old Apprentice cast members did in his fake boardroom in the mid-aughts. Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, to that end, bought The Washington Post and turned its opinion pages into a conservative echo chamber. And Amazon Prime Video announced earlier this month that it would be streaming the first seven seasons of The Apprentice for the first time, kicking royalties back to Trump, who not only starred in but was a producer of the show. (Amazon has also paid $40 million for a vanity documentary about Trump's wife Melania that no one asked for.) 


	For someone such as myself who had never watched The Apprentice during its original run (and even for some who had), its arrival to streaming presented a terrible but useful opportunity: to examine at close range the cultural moment that made Trump a viable public leader, and the person he showed himself to be. I lasted through the first three seasons.

	











	WHAT'S MOST JARRING, straight away, is how utterly different Trump is as a man on this show from the villainous buffoon we now see in the news. He comes off as savvy, fair, and even empathetic. In Episode Seven, he pulls one of the contestants aside after a board meeting to ask her about her ailing mother's health and offer what appears to be genuine support and concern. “I felt like I was talking to a friend as opposed to talking to this mogul billionaire,” she gushes after the conversation. 


	He has genuinely funny banter with the contestants, and they actually seem to enjoy being around him, even when he's deciding which one of them to fire. In one such boardroom meeting at the end of Episode Six, Trump asks Omarosa Manigault, who's framed as the villain of the season, how she thinks her teammate Heidi did in that day's challenge. “Heidi was fantastic!” Omarosa responds with a big smile. “And I will tell you that I haven't always been the biggest fan of Heidi. I haven't always thought that she was professional, nor does she have much class or finesse…” 


	“That was very nice,” Trump interjects sarcastically, making the whole room laugh, including Heidi and Omarosa and his two advisors. “This is one of the worst compliments I've ever heard.” 


	In Season Two, a cast member named Ivana has Trump making ex-wife jokes throughout the first few episodes. “Ivana, ay-yi-yi,” he intones upon hearing her mentioned in the boardroom in Episode Two, getting big laughs again. “Every time I hear that name.” 


	Trump also makes some unexpected decisions about whom to fire each episode that do make him seem pretty sharp and insightful, zigging when you think he's going to zag. When the whole team gangs up on one person to try to get them fired, as with eccentric Sam in Season One and restaurateur Stacie in Season Two, Trump sees right through the plot and shuts it down. In Stacie's case, every person in the boardroom, including one of Trump's henchmen-advisers, recommended that she be fired after an ice cream challenge in which she stood on the wrong block the whole time. The second obvious option to be fired was Ivana, the team leader who everyone agreed was indecisive and disorganized. In a shock decision, Trump went his own way and fired Bradford, the best performing member of the team, because Trump said he'd made a “stupid, impulsive, life-threatening decision” by waiving the immunity he'd won in the previous challenge in a show of self-confidence. Bradford thought Trump would respect his self-confidence; Trump instead was just mind-blown by a man putting his job on the line for no reason. (Producers later admitted that some of Trump's decisions came so out of left field — sometimes presumably being the only cast member's name Trump could remember in a particular moment — that they had to go back and comb through the footage to make whomever he fired look bad in the episode.) 

	











	OF COURSE, GLIMPSES of the Trump we know shine through in little ways. He makes a show of loathing interpersonal “disloyalty” and “weakness” among the candidates more than anything having to do with business acumen. After the exchange he has with Heidi and Omarosa in Episode Six, for instance, he lights into Jessie, another teammate that Omarosa had insulted in the boardroom, for failing to punch back. “I hated the way you took so much crap from Omarosa,” he tells Jessie, adding that he found it “repulsive” how she let herself be treated “like a dog…To me that was a form of weakness.” He fires Jessie instead of Omarosa for that reason, despite Omarosa being a rude bully right in front of him, the leader of the losing team, and the obvious choice to send home. 


	Trump also uses the show — whose opening theme song is “Money” by the O'Jays — to cast himself as both the embodiment and the arbiter of the American dream, convincing these wide-eyed hopefuls that his billionaire “lifestyle” is actually within reach for them and for anyone who masters negotiating like he did. (At the same time, he tells them in the first season that negotiating “is not really learned. It's in the genes. A negotiator is born.” He's half-right, if “in the genes” means starting out with a half-a-billion-dollar inheritance from your dad.)


	He brings them to the Wollman Ice Skating Rink in the middle of Central Park midway through Season One, in one of these displays of prowess, and claims that his business genius is the only reason it's there. “It's one of the things that frankly I'm the most proud of,” he says. “The city spent seven years and 21 million dollars and couldn't get an ice skating rink built. I got tired of watching and went to the mayor and said, ‘I wanna build the rink.' I got it built in three months for less than 20 million dollars.” In reality, Trump convinced a construction company to do the job at cost in return for the promise of massive publicity, and then he refused to mention them at all after they finished it.


	And after flexing his big dealmaking muscles for the contestants each episode, he sends the winning team either to drool (or pretend to drool) over one of his personal properties or experience a taste of his obscenely wealthy lifestyle. The first group of winners, the all-women team who made more money than the men peddling lemonade (by recognizing that “sex sells,” Trump observes), are rewarded with a private tour of Trump's Manhattan penthouse — a gaudy marble and gold eyesore that looks like the entrance to a Russian oligarch's private spa. “This is like…..rich,” one cast member tells the camera of Trump's apartment, apparently coming up empty on other adjectives. 

	











	The Episode Two reward is a private jet trip to Boston, which a young blonde named Kristi describes as a “teaching tool.” “You have to want those things and aspire to those things if you wanna be like Trump,” she explains. 


	Later in the season, Trump sends the winning team to Seven Springs, his opulent, 230-acre private estate that span three towns in tony Westchester County, for “the best picnic you've ever had” in “the most beautiful house in New York State.” It's certainly not; the place has zero character and comes off as cold and severe. But the players have to sit on a blanket on this comically large, flowerless lawn and pretend like this awkward picnic is some kind of orgasmic bacchanalian feast.

	That, if anything, is the throughline in The Apprentice — every single cast member, including two of Trump's real-life advisors, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross, kissing his ass and treating him like royalty. In Season Two, Trump enters rooms to literal fanfare. The women on the show, in particular, always seem to gaze at him with little hearts for pupils. 


	It's no wonder that after 14 seasons of The Apprentice Trump expected to be treated like a king when he entered the Oval Office. But the stakes are so much higher now. There are still sycophants and acolytes, but no savvy producers to make his head-scratching moves appear to make sense. Instead of fake-firing fake employees from a fake boardroom, he is firing thousands of real government workers. Instead of making arbitrary decisions about the futures of a handful of fame-thirsty reality stars, he's making them about immigrant families who came to America for a better life. Instead of blustering about his business savvy from a soundstage, he's doing it from the presidential podium, using tactics that nearly every economist has warned against to move the United States into an economic “Golden Age” that's shaping up to look more like a recession. None of this should be a surprise, really. After all, just two seasons into The Apprentice, Trump no longer felt the need to introduce himself to America with an anecdote about personal struggle. “My name is Donald Trump,” he says in the Trump helicopter over Manhattan in the Season Three premiere. “You know everything about me.”

	The House's passage of the SAVE Act last week is the culmination of Donald Trump's election-denial movement, which has pushed hundreds of laws around the country targeting non-existent voter fraud based on Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. 


	The SAVE Act — which requires documentary proof of citizenship like a certified birth certificate or passport to register to vote — could disenfranchise tens of millions of voters or prevent them from voting in future elections. The act requires last names on documents like drivers licenses to match those on birth certificates, and could prevent millions of women who have changed their names after being married from registering to vote. The bill must pass the Senate before Trump can sign it.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who brought the bill to the floor last week, said at that time the legislation “ensures you gotta have identification, you have to prove your identity, because only U.S. citizens should vote and decide U.S. elections.” He noted that noncitizens are already prohibited from voting in federal elections, but claimed “there's no mechanism currently to ensure that [the] law is always followed.” 

	











	The legislation is part of a broader attack on Americans' voting rights. On March 25, Trump signed an executive order that sought to require the same proof of citizenship as the SAVE Act, would effectively eliminate voting machines and drastically reduce mail-in and absentee ballots, and calls for bogus Republican investigations of voter fraud. Republicans in state legislatures have introduced more than 2,000 election-related bills since legislative sessions began in January. Across the country and in Congress, Republicans have worked with key figures in the election-denial movement as it has gone from a fringe right-wing belief to a key plank of the Trump-led GOP. Last week, they rejoiced together.

	“I'm proud to work with my friend Cleta Mitchell, who had a significant hand in what we're doing here,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said Thursday before House Republicans voted to approve the SAVE Act.

	Mitchell, a lawyer who tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results, is head of the Election Integrity Network (EIN), which has become one the most influential organizations in supporting Trump's lies about widespread voter fraud. She and members of EIN were in the gallery when the House voted to pass the SAVE Act on a nearly-party line vote. Four Democrats joined House Republicans in approving the legislation, which the Brennan Center and other pro-democracy groups have warned could prevent 21 million Americans — many who are poor or minorities without access to certified birth certificates, passports, or other necessary documents — from voting in future elections.

	











	“The House has just passed one of the worst pieces of voting legislation in American history. The Senate must stop it,” Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center, said in a statement. “The SAVE Act would put voting out of reach for millions of American citizens. It should not become law.”


	The SAVE Act, Trump's executive order (titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections”), and the more than 2,000 bills across the country are largely based on conservatives' false claims about widespread voter fraud, including by undocumented immigrants, neither of which have ever been proven to occur in any significant manner. 


	In virtually all aspects of Republican attempts to change the rules and functions of election administration, the election-denial movement's fingerprints — and those of more mainstream conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) — are visible, including on Trump's executive order.

	The order contains many of the demands of the election-denial movement, including an attempt to force states to do away with voting machines and conduct elections only with paper ballots; robust restrictions on mail-in and absentee ballots; and calls for Trump's Justice Department, Homeland Security, and even Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access voter information to find nonexistent widespread voter fraud and pursue politically-motivated prosecutions of state and local election officials. 


	In December, Mitchell led a panel at a meeting hosted by ALEC, the watchdog group Documented reported. One of the outcomes of the gathering was the drafting of a document called the U.S. Citizens Elections Bill of Rights. The document called for many of the provisions included in Trump's order. At the top of the list of demands was requiring “documentary proof of citizenship” in order to register to vote — an idea that's one step closer to being codified into law after the House's passing of the SAVE Act.


	Max Flugrath of the voting rights group Fair Fight tells Rolling Stone and American Doom that the requirement to have a certified birth certificate or passport to register to vote has roots in the Jim Crow South. 


	“It's a modern poll tax designed to silence Black, young, and working Americans. Forget dog whistles — this is a siren,” Flugrath says. “They're telling us they'll rig the system to win, no matter how many Americans they silence.”

	











	The SAVE Act enacts policies that the election-denial movement has been calling for for years, while Trump's executive order is an attempt to force states to comply with its provisions under threat of withholding federal funding for elections or prosecution from the Justice Department and other agencies. Trump's executive order would also make every voting machine currently in use in the country obsolete, and is based on election-denial conspiracies that the machines are susceptible to hacking and fraud. 


	The order appears to have been, in large part, a back door to the SAVE Act. Its key provision was a requirement of documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, which the SAVE Act accomplished. But Trump's executive order is also part of the president's aggressive attempts to expand his constitutional power by attempting to dictate to states how to run elections.


	Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner last week, Trump expanded on what legal experts have said is the blatant unconstitutionality of his executive order.


	Individual “states are just an agent of the federal government,” Trump said, adding that Republicans should “demand paper ballots” (meaning an end to voting machines) and “one-day elections” (meaning an end to early, absentee, and mail-in voting). These are two of the most important election changes sought by Mitchell and the election-denial movement.  


	These goals — doing away with voting machines, ending mail-in and absentee voting, and only allowing votes to be counted on a single Election Day — are in line with the provisions in Trump's order, the SAVE Act, and scores of bills across the country. 


	All are based on the myth of widespread voting, and especially illegal voting by undocumented immigrants, says Rob Weiner, a former Justice Department civil rights lawyer who is now a director at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights. Trump and Republicans have used claims of widespread voter fraud — which has never been proven to affect the outcome of any major election — and voting by undocumented immigrants to make it more difficult to register to vote, restrict access to non-Election Day voting, and purge millions of people from voter rolls under questionable claims about ineligibility.


	There “is the notion that there is a problem with people who are voting who are not citizens. That's just not the case. It is an exceedingly rare event,” Weiner tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. 

	











	THE TRIO OF Republican efforts to change election rules and laws — the SAVE Act, Trump's executive order, and the 2,000-plus bills introduced by state GOP lawmakers — are merely attempts to call future elections into question or rig them in favor of conservatives, pro-democracy groups say. All three efforts have been in the works for years. 


	“They think that by controlling the process that they're going to control all of society,” Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. “What they don't understand is that this society is much more diverse and complex than any other society that has fallen to autocracy, so we're not going down like that.”


	Following Trump's loss in 2020, election deniers took over local election boards and won seats in state legislatures, pushing measures that would support his claims of widespread voter fraud and, in their minds, stop it from happening again. Many of those efforts were successful; some were not. 


	The trend continued in 2023 and 2024, with state legislatures introducing thousands of bills aimed at curbing voter fraud — efforts that critics say are simply voter suppression laws. In the final weeks and months of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump-aligned groups and the Republican National Committee filed dozens of lawsuits seeking to purge millions from the voter rolls, on the false basis that noncitizens had registered to vote, and stop the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots.


	Following Trump's win in November, Republicans have only doubled down.


	So far this year, Republicans in state legislatures have introduced more than 2,000 bills related to election administration, voting rules, and voter registration — already surpassing the total number of election-related bills in 2022 and nearing the total for 2023 and 2024, according to Ballotpedia. In 2024 and so far this year, lawmakers in 21 states have introduced measures requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, with three states — New Hampshire, Wyoming, and Louisiana — passing such legislation. 


	These efforts, taken together, could create a chaotic election period for next year's midterms in which the rules of the election are still being debated in statehouses and courtrooms across the country as votes are being tallied. 


	Combined with the possible disenfranchisement of tens of millions of voters thanks to the SAVE Act, plus Trump's executive order that seeks to make every voting machine currently in use in the country obsolete, last week's win by House Republicans and the election-denial movement could be just the beginning of sustained electoral turmoil. 

	











	If the Senate passes the SAVE Act, it will be up to states to enforce the law's key provision of requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote. States will also have to decide whether to comply with the demands of Trump's executive order. 


	If states do comply — or pass laws that mandate some of the order's demands — it would throw election administration into disarray, according to Larry Norden, vice president of elections and government for the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. 


	Norden and others warn about provisions in the executive order that call for the discontinuation of all voting machines in use across the country, to be replaced by machines that comply with new guidelines. Those machines have not yet been constructed by any manufacturers, meaning states that seek to comply with the new guidelines in Trump's order might have to switch to hand-counted paper ballots in future elections. This would slow the processing of results and add more fuel to the fire of an election-denial movement that claims vote-counting is rife with fraud, Norden and others say. 


	“They would have to buy systems that aren't on the market, which they can't do, so they'd have to hand-count ballots, which would cause all kinds of chaos in an election,” Norden tells Rolling Stone and American Doom.


	Currently, 11 states have laws that require their election equipment to comply with what's called the Voluntary Voting Systems Guidlines 1.0 (VVSG). Trump's order demands that states comply with the new version of those guidelines, VVSG 2.0, for election equipment like voting machines.


	Mark Lindeman of Verified Voting, which advocates for secure election technology, notes that there are currently no voting machines on the market that comply with VVSG 2.0.


	“It is possible to interpret this EO as an attempt to fulfill the fantasies of election deniers by basically abolishing all existing voting systems and requiring all hand-counts,” Lindeman tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. “Encouragingly, no state has passed a bill that requires impossible voting systems.”


	Completely eliminating voting machines has been at the top of the list of priorities for the election-denial movement since 2020. Trump and others have spread conspiracies that voting machines are susceptible to hacking and fraud. At a Cabinet meeting on Feb. 26, Trump said “We have to go back to paper ballots.”


	“I wish the governors would do it, because the paper ballots will cost” less than machines, Trump said.

	











	At a Cabinet meeting last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Trump that she has found evidence of fraud related to voting machines.


	“We have evidence of how these electronic voting systems have been vulnerable to hackers for a very long time, and vulnerable to exploitation to manipulate the results of the votes being cast, which further drives forward your mandate to bring about paper ballots across the country so that voters can have faith in the integrity of our elections,” Gabbard told Trump.


	TRUMP'S ORDER ALSO requires the Justice Department and DHS to prosecute state and local election officials for not complying with the order's demands, would withhold federal funds to states for elections, and gives agencies and DOGE access to private voter information on state voter rolls. 


	“The attorney general shall take all appropriate action to align the Department of Justice's litigation positions with the purpose and policy of this order,” the order states.


	Prosecution of local election officials is part of the Heritage Foundation's infamous Project 2025, which has served as a playbook for Trump's second presidency. Project 2025 proposes using a portion of U.S. code — Section 241, known as “conspiracy against rights” — to prosecute state and local election officials who follow state election laws that conflict with federal law. The law was first used to prosecute members of the Ku Klux Klan who were attempting to prevent freed slaves from voting. 


	Gene Hamilton, a former lawyer in Trump's first administration who is now at the White House, wrote in Project 2025 that the law should be used by the Trump administration to punish election officials who don't run elections in the exact manner prescribed by Republicans. 


	Hamilton complained in the document that the Justice Department's Criminal Division had “ceded substantial discretion concerning voter suppression to the Civil Rights Division.”


	“This is a mistake,” Hamilton wrote. “Only by moving authority for 18 U.S. Code § 241 investigations and prosecutions back to the Criminal Division will the rule of law be appropriately enforced.”


	Trump's executive order seeks to implement similar policies to those outlined by Hamilton in Project 2025, requiring the Justice Department and DHS to sue election officials who don't hand over records the agencies demand, and even giving subpoena power to DOGE in order to find ineligible voters on voter rolls. The order also calls for the Social Security Administration to share Americans' personal information with the DOJ and DHS in the Trump administration's attempt to prove widespread voter fraud exists. 

	











	Already, a Musk ally working for DOGE, Antonio Gracias, has used SSA data to propagate false conspiracies about widespread voting by undocumented immigrants.


	In the first Trump administration, the president's Commission on Election Integrity failed to find any evidence of widespread voter fraud and was disbanded within a year of Trump taking office. Similar to last month's executive order, the commission had demanded voter registration information from state election officials — who largely rebuffed the demands, according to Weiner of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights.


	“This is sort of a reprise of that commission, and I don't think that states will be any more anxious to provide all this information,” Weiner tells Rolling Stone and American Doom.


	Weiner, Norden, and others say that Trump's executive order is obviously unconstitutional. Norden says it is simply “an unlawful power grab,” pointing to Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution, which makes it very clear that elections are the purview of the states or Congress, not the president. 


	“The Constitution is pretty clear about who runs our elections — and it's the states,” Norden tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. “Congress has some power, but the president is not mentioned at all when it comes to elections in the constitution and I think that was very deliberate.”


	MEANWHILE, REPUBLICAN-LED states continue to aggressively pursue election-denial legislative priorities. In Michigan, the state chapter of Mitchell's Election Integrity Network has pushed state legislators to introduce a constitutional amendment requiring documentary proof of citizenship, two voting-rights advocates tell Rolling Stone and American Doom. Elsewhere, Republicans are trying to eliminate or limit early-voting locations, enact mass purges of voters from rolls under specious ineligibility claims, and drastically reduce mail-in voting.


	In North Carolina, the state's Supreme Court has thrown out thousands of votes that were counted after Election Day as part of a bid to reverse the results of an election for a seat on the court itself. Jefferson Griffin, who is seeking to overturn his election loss to Judge Allison Riggs, has argued that 65,000 votes shouldn't be counted because they didn't comply with new voter ID requirements. 


	The implementation of more strict voter ID rules and laws; the targeting of mail-in voting, drop boxes, voting machines; and voter roll purges are just some aspects of Republican efforts to change election administration. In 16 of the 23 states that allow ballot measures, Republican lawmakers are trying to make it more difficult for voters to get voter referendums on the ballot, says Kelly Hall of the Fairness Project, which has been tracking ballot measure laws. Those efforts follow successful ballot measures to protect abortion rights in several red states.

	











	“What they're saying is, ‘We care so little that we want to undo what you voted on and make it harder for you to do it in the future,'” Hall tells Rolling Stone and American Doom. “It's one of the purest forms of disdain for direct democracy, and it's pure, unadulterated hypocrisy. ‘We want to get our way regardless of what the public votes for' is what we're hearing from political leaders.”


	Republican lawmakers in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington state have introduced 151 bills in 2025 alone that would make it more difficult to enact ballot measures, according to Hall.


	“The level of overreach they're comfortable with is completely inconsistent with their views on other issues,” Hall says of Republicans. “When we see Trump say, ‘I want to send the issue of abortion to the states,' at the least, what you would expect is that the politicians in power would respect voters' decisions on the issue.”


	With the SAVE Act now closer to becoming federal law, and as red states introduce and pass scores of voter suppression laws, the Trump administration has also been gutting election security at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which protects election systems and infrastructure like power grids from cyber attacks. 


	On March 27, the agency's former leader warned at a forum hosted by the bipartisan election integrity group Keep Our Republic that the Trump administration's dismantling of CISA increases the risk of foreign interference in elections.

	At Keep Our Republic's recent online meeting, former CISA lead Suzanne Spaulding, warned that the Trump administration's gutting of the agency is setting the stage for unfettered foreign influence in future elections. 


	“The robust efforts at foreign interference continue, from Russia, from China, from Iran, from others — it was documented, well documented, by the intelligence community, by CISA, by the FBI, by private sector companies who have visibility, like Microsoft,” said Spaulding, who served as a DHS undersecretary for CISA under President Biden among other executive branch positions across Republican and Democrat administrations. “It is no longer really being monitored, analyzed, or countered by those entities, as far as we can tell.”

	The busiest politician in America over the weekend was not President Donald Trump, or any of his cronies, but Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who spoke before crowds of tens of thousands in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and at this year's Coachella music festival as part of his Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 


	“When it comes to standing up to Trumpism there is no such thing as a red state,” Sanders wrote Sunday on X. “20,000 people came out in Salt Lake City tonight to say NO to oligarchy, NO to authoritarianism, and NO to massive tax breaks for billionaires.” 


	At the rally, Sanders highlighted the turnout in red states over the course of the tour. “I mentioned a moment ago that we were in LA yesterday, and we had 36,000 people out. But in many ways, the 20,000 we have out today is more impressive,” he told the audience. “We're here in so-called conservative Utah, and tomorrow we're going to be in Idaho. Because we believe that in every state in this country, people are prepared to stand up and fight back.” 

	











	In Utah, like at the other jam-packed rallies Sanders and AOC have already held, the pair excoriated Trump and his alliance with the wealthiest echelons of American business. “We do not want a government of the billionaire class by the billionaire class for the billionaire class,” Sanders said. “We want a government that represents all of us […] not just the one richest guy running all over Washington, D.C., throwing tens of thousands of dedicated federal workers out on the street.”

	In a video released Saturday, Sanders highlighted that his events in Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Colorado, and Arizona had produced a combined turnout of over 100,00 people — and that he now wants to focus on conservative states: “Most of these events will be held in congressional districts that are represented by Republicans. And there is a reason why we are doing that.”


	The senator noted that Republicans were — even if glibly — taking note of the turnout at his rallies. Sanders called out Musk's insinuations that attendees at the rallies were “paid protesters,” and Trump's long-standing obsession with crowd sizes.

	“I want people in the communities that we visit and people throughout the country to understand that they are not alone when they feel outraged by what Trump is doing to our country, in fact, when they stand there amidst thousands and thousands of their neighbors in opposition to oligarchy, opposition to authoritarianism and xenophobia and attacks on the working class, they very quickly understand that they are not part of some fringe minority who are opposing Trump, but that they belong to a strong majority of Americans who want this country to move in a very different direction than where Trump is taking us,” Sanders said.

	On Saturday, Sanders made an appearance at the Coachella Music Festival alongside Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-Fla.). As the surprise opener for the artist Clairo, Sanders told the gathered crowd of festival goers and influencers that “the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation. Now, you can turn away and ignore what goes on but if you do that, you do it on your own peril. We need you to stand up and fight for justice, to fight for economic justice, racial justice and social justice.” 


	Earlier that same day, Sanders and AOC spoke before a crowd of 36,000 in Los Angeles, in what seemed almost like a music festival of their own. Bernie-chella — as it was dubbed by supporters online — featured performances and statements from Joan Baez, Maggie Rogers, and Neil Young. The rally was the largest event yet on the Fighting Oligarchy Tour.

	While the track also features a verse from Childish Gambino, the rapper didn't join the pair on the Coachella stage. Instead, Jennie and Uchis put their honeyed vocals on display as they traded the R&B-inspired verses.


	The last time Jennie took the Coachella stage was with Blackpink in 2023. With their performance, Blackpink made history as the first K-pop group, and first girl group, to headline the festival. In March, Uchis reminded the 2025 Billboard Women in Music audience of this fact when she presented Jennie with the Global Force Award at the event. “It's a big deal,” she said as the crowd roared at Blackpink's achievement. Uchis also took the oppurtunity to thank Jennie for inviting her to collaborate on Ruby. Now, the moment has come full circle for Uchis and Jennie as their Coachella performance marked the first time the pair sang “Damn” together live.

A now declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report has recently been making headlines detailing how aliens reportedly attacked Soviet soldiers during a training exercise. 

The CIA report was created following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, enabling the organization to get its hands on a 250-page (Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB) report on the event.

The report was originally declassified in 2000 and initially reported on by Canadian Weekly World News and the Ukrainian paper Holos Ukrayiny. Since then, it has remained mainly of interest to the unidentified flying object (UFO) obsessed community.

However, such reports surfaced once again in the public domain following the establishment of the UAP Task Force by the Department of Defense in 2020. Not to mention the release of large amounts of new files around mysterious flying objects recorded by the federal government to “detect, analyze and catalog” the UAPs.

According to the bone-chilling report, a group of Soviet soldiers were turned to stone as an act of revenge for shooting down a UFO somewhere in Ukraine. The report also includes eyewitness accounts and, allegedly, images of the event's aftermath.

According to the CIA report, one agent describes the event as “a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.”

The CIA report claims that the event occurred during a training exercise in Ukraine. The soldiers spotted a “low-flying spaceship [shaped like] a saucer.” At some point during the exercise, a surface-to-air missile was released, striking and bringing down the UFO. 

The UFO “fell to Earth not far away, and five short humanoids with ‘large heads and large black eyes' emerged from it,” the report claims. According to the declassified CIA report, eyewitnesses recalled that some beings could escape the debris of the ruined ship.

Once free, according to the report, the crash survivors took action to take revenge for the destruction of their ship. The “beings” allegedly then huddled together and “merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape,” the surviving soldiers recalled.

“In a few seconds, the spheres grew much bigger and exploded by flaring up with an extremely bright light. At that very instant, 23 soldiers who had watched the phenomenon turned into… stone poles,” the report states.

“Only two soldiers who stood in the shade and were less exposed to the luminous explosion survived,” it continues.

The CIA report explains that following the incident, the ruins of the ship and the petrified soldiers were transported to a secret location near Moscow. After some investigation, it was found, according to the CIA report, that the soldiers' living tissue was somehow turned into a substance near-identical to limestone. 

“If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case,” the CIA concluded. “The Aliens possess weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions,” it added. “They can stand up for themselves if attacked,” the report adds.

The timing and precise location of this attack are not detailed in publicly released information, but they certainly make for chilling reading.

The CIA has released a previously classified report about a possible encounter between Soviet troops and a UFO, including an alleged alien attack on soldiers, according to Fox News.

Reports about this document were previously covered by the Canadian publication Canadian Weekly World News and the Ukrainian newspaper Holos Ukrayiny, first published in May 2000.

The Canadian Weekly World News speculated that the alleged incident occurred between 1989 and 1990, with the first publication dating back to 1993.

Now, the corresponding document has been released on the website of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States.

The document details an alleged incident in which Soviet soldiers reportedly encountered extraterrestrials after shooting down a UFO. According to the report, the aliens emerged from the wreckage and merged into a single object that ""exploded"" with a bright light. Following this, all but two soldiers turned to stone. This was supposedly documented in a report from the Soviet KGB.

The report, citing an unnamed CIA official, states that if the KGB dossier is accurate, it is a highly alarming case, suggesting that extraterrestrials possess weapons and technologies far beyond human understanding. The aliens were capable of defending themselves if attacked.

According to the CIA document, intelligence gathered by the US revealed a ""low-flying disk-shaped spacecraft"" over a Soviet military unit conducting exercises. For reasons unknown, Soviet soldiers fired a surface-to-air missile at the unidentified object, causing it to crash near a military base. The report further describes how five small humanoids with ""large heads and big black eyes"" emerged from the spacecraft, merged into a single ""unified object,"" and emitted a loud buzzing sound. The object then reportedly exploded in a blinding flash of light.

Witness accounts mentioned in the document state that 23 soldiers suddenly ""turned into stone pillars,"" with two soldiers surviving because they were sheltered from the full effect of the light. The remains of the ""petrified soldiers"" and the spacecraft were supposedly transported to a secret research facility near Moscow, where scientists discovered that the soldiers' molecular structure matched that of limestone. The document also claims that scientists believed the source of energy involved was something unknown to humanity.

Western media add that although the original context of the document remains unknown, it likely comes from open-source information.

The CIA and the Pentagon did not respond to requests from the American media for comments on the document.

In 2020, the US Department of Defense announced the creation of a special task force on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPTF) aimed at “detecting, analyzing, and cataloging” unknown objects that could pose a threat to national security.

The program was established after many years of government efforts to study unidentified aircraft.

At the end of 2020, former CIA Director John Brennan made a statement about the existence of aliens. He suggested that there may be other forms of life in the universe.

Additionally, in the summer of 2021, a government intelligence report on unidentified flying objects was released. The Pentagon report mentioned 144 reports of unidentified aerial objects recorded since 2004, all but one of which remain unexplained. US intelligence officials stated that UFOs pose a threat to national security.

Red Army soldiers were allegedly turned into limestone pillars by extraterrestrials in revenge for shooting down their spacecraft over Siberia, according to a declassified document

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

A declassified CIA report about an alleged UFO attack on Soviet soldiers in the dying days of the USSR has gone viral after being posted to the agency's website.

The document is a single-page summary of newspaper articles from Canadian Weekly World News and the Ukrainian paper Holos Ukrayiny dating back to March 1993, which describe a hostile encounter between the Russian Army and a flying saucer that is said to have taken place in 1989 or 1990.

The story – headlined “Cosmic Revenge” in the Ukrainian source and said to derive from an extensive 250-page KGB file, complete with witness testimony and documentary photographs – recounts how 25 Soviet troops were participating in training drills when a “low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer” passed over their base in Siberia. 

The sighting prompted the men to react “for unknown reasons” by launching a surface-to-air missile at the craft, which they successfully brought down.

“Five short humanoids with ‘large heads and large black eyes'” emerged from the wreckage, the file reports, before fusing together into a “single object”: a spherical shape that emitted a sinister buzzing sound.

The sphere then burst in an explosion of brilliant white light, leaving 23 of the men “turned into stone poles” while the remaining two, shielded from the blast by virtue of being stood in the shade, escaped unharmed.

The bodies of the victims were reportedly recovered by the Red Army and taken to a secret research laboratory outside Moscow, where it was discovered their molecular structure was now identical to that of limestone, with the light that petrified them attributed to a “source of energy” not currently known to humanity.

“If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case,” an unnamed CIA analyst is quoted as saying in response to the tale.

”The aliens possess such weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions. They can stand up for themselves if attacked.”

Ex-CIA agent Mike Baker, for one, has expressed skepticism about the encounter, which reads like a scene from a pulp science fiction novel or 1950s B-movie.

“If there was an incident, regardless of the nature of the incident, I suspect that the actual report doesn't look much like what has now come out from five or six or seven iterations of what originally was [written],” he told Fox News Digital.

“I'm sure there's something out there. I just don't think that they landed decades ago, turned Soviet soldiers into limestone, and we're just now hearing about it. I don't think that's the case.”

UFOs nevertheless continue to be a subject of huge fascination in the United States and around the world.

President Donald Trump said he did not believe in extraterrestrials when he appeared on Logan Paul's podcast during last year's presidential campaign. However, in the first few months of his presidency, he signed an executive order demanding that all federal documents pertaining to them be declassified to expose or dispel rumors of any “cover-up” that may or may not have taken place.

The Pentagon, meanwhile, issued a report last year detailing the 757 tip-offs it had received from members of the public between May 2023 and June 2024 regarding unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena, ultimately conceding that none had delivered proof of life beyond the stars.

That said, among the hundreds of misidentified balloons, birds, and satellites it received, there were also a number of episodes that defied easy explanation, including a near-miss between a commercial airliner and a mysterious object off the coast of New York.

 Declassified CIA files reveal Cold War-era Soviet UFO incident where aliens allegedly turned soldiers into stone.

A declassified Cold War-era CIA document has gone viral for detailing a chilling encounter between Soviet soldiers and a UFO, in which extraterrestrial beings allegedly turned 23 troops into stone.

The 250-page report, originally compiled by the KGB and later obtained by the CIA following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, describes a bizarre and deadly incident during a Soviet military training exercise in Ukraine. According to the document, soldiers fired a surface-to-air missile at a low-flying, saucer-shaped craft, causing it to crash nearby.

Eyewitnesses claimed that five short humanoids with large heads and black eyes emerged from the wreckage. The beings reportedly grouped together and morphed into a glowing spherical shape, which then exploded in a bright flash of light. The blast allegedly petrified 23 soldiers into stone, leaving only two survivors who were partially shielded from the explosion.

The report states that Soviet scientists concluded the blast somehow altered the cellular structure of the soldiers, turning their bodies into a material similar to limestone. The KGB is said to have transported both the ""petrified soldiers"" and the wrecked UFO to a top-secret facility near Moscow.

An American CIA operative described the findings as ""a horrific picture of revenge"" by alien forces, warning that the technology displayed by the extraterrestrials far exceeded human understanding. “They can stand up for themselves if attacked,” the report ominously concluded.

Originally declassified in 2000, the incident was first reported by Canadian and Ukrainian outlets and later gained renewed attention on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. As government interest in UFOs continues to rise with the U.S. UAP Task Force, this Cold War case remains one of the most unsettling alien encounter stories ever documented.

Paranormal beliefs create a sense of control, predictability and comfort in uncertain times, according to academic studies. That doesn't explain why some people find them more appealing than others, though recent studies are starting to offer explanations about why some people feel so drawn to the paranormal.

Paranormal beliefs are convictions in notions beyond what mainstream science can explain, like ghosts or psychic abilities. Surveys show that a large number of people in the US and UK – between about one-third and 50% – hold these beliefs.

Our recent study found that people who feel powerless or uncertain are more likely to believe in the supernatural. This is probably because of the way our brains process uncertainty. When faced with events we cannot control, our minds look for patterns and explanations.

Paranormal beliefs create structured stories that make random events seem intentional. For example, astrology connects planetary movements to personal experiences, giving believers a way to understand their lives. People put their faith in conspiracy theories for similar reasons.

One major reason people turn to paranormal beliefs is to deal with anxiety about life. Realising that life is unpredictable and has an end can be unsettling. Supernatural beliefs provide comfort by suggesting that a higher power controls human destiny.

This perception gives life a sense of purpose and meaning. Stories about ghosts and communication with the dead help people feel connected to lost loved ones. In this way, supernatural thinking helps people cope with fears about the unknown.

Believing in the paranormal can provide comfort for some, but it can be unhelpful in some situations. For instance, a deep belief in supernatural forces might cause someone to blame their problems on supernatural forces instead of looking for practical ways to address them. Indeed, our recent research identified that belief in external supernatural forces that exert control, such as gods or fate, is associated with distress. This type of belief reflects a lack of personal control.

Conversely, our recent study showed that belief in paranormal phenomena centred on personal spirituality, such as astrology or manifesting, is not associated with stress. This seems to be because these kinds of belief emphasise personal control and meaning.

Paranormal beliefs are also influenced by mental shortcuts that shape perception of the world. Pattern recognition is a good example, where people see connections in random events. This explains why people see faces in clouds or someone thinks a series of bad events means they are cursed.

Another common bias is when people believe they can influence things that are beyond their control. Often referred to as the illusion of control, a 2024 study showed that this bias also applies to health, like believing in false medical treatments or cures. The researchers found that illusory health beliefs correlated positively with a belief in pseudoscience and negatively with scepticism.

Culture and society can strengthen paranormal beliefs. The way the media depicts supernatural events affects how people see them. Horror films and TV shows frequently portray supernatural beings interacting with the real world. Social media further amplifies these ideas, with people sharing personal stories, videos and experiences online. These shared posts can reinforce beliefs in the paranormal.

When people are surrounded by others who believe in the supernatural, they are more likely to see these ideas as true. Social norms shape these beliefs by setting expectations about what is considered acceptable or real within a culture. If a society widely accepts paranormal ideas, people are more likely to adopt and reinforce them.

Understanding the role of paranormal beliefs can help researchers create a balanced view of the people who subscribe to them. Instead of dismissing such beliefs, it is important to recognise their emotional and personal significance. Particularly, how beliefs shape people's perspectives and coping mechanisms. While they may not align with logic or evidence, the comfort they afford is deeply meaningful to those who hold them. A 2024 study found that paranormal beliefs were not necessarily associated with negative wellbeing and were connected to a sense of meaning in life.

Research has shown that teaching critical thinking and scientific literacy can help people tell the difference between helpful spiritual practices and harmful misunderstandings. Encouraging scepticism and rational thinking allows people to engage with the world in a way that balances hope with reason.

Paranormal beliefs persist because they meet deep psychological needs. Understanding why people believe in the supernatural can lead to more compassionate discussions and help them find better ways to handle uncertainty. Whether or not someone believes in ghosts, the need for stability and comfort is something all humans share.
