                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of Bitcoin hovered around $85,000 on Monday as investors weighed whether the White House's message on tariffs was tailored enough to avoid a recession. A survey released on Monday underscored consumers' inflation worries, as economists fear the U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could ignite price pressures. Representing the highest levels of economic angst since April 2020, 44% of survey respondents also believe the unemployment rate will be higher a year from now. Among households with annual incomes below $50,000, there was a notable increase in the perceived probability of losing one's job. Still, Bitcoin's price rose this weekend after the White House indicated computer chips and smartphones would be exempt from “reciprocal” levies. It softened on Sunday after Trump clarified that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook'” and other levies still being applied to electronics. Market participants will be listening attentively to Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, according to Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at crypto market maker GSR. They are eager to know where the central bank now stands on a potential recession, he told Decrypt. Still, market participants are pricing in more  cuts now than before Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement, Guzman noted. “If the economic situation globally looks bad, we'd likely see more stimulative policy from central banks,” he said. “That might be more positive for crypto medium-term, maybe not short-term, with all this [recent] volatility.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts say Bitcoin price could soar to $137,000 if the US Treasury General Account continues pumping money into financial markets. The US Treasury has injected $500 billion into financial markets since February by drawing liquidity from its Treasury General Account (TGA), funding government operations after a $36 trillion debt ceiling was hit on Jan. 2, 2025. Macroeconomic financial analyst Tomas said that this liquidity surge boosted the net Federal Reserve liquidity to $6.3 trillion, and it may support Bitcoin's (BTC) price in the future, even though risk assets have reflected minimal growth so far. If debt ceiling talks extend to August, net liquidity could hit a multi-year high of $6.6 trillion, which could cause a bullish tailwind for Bitcoin. According to a study by financial analyst Lyn Alden, Bitcoin has historically moved 83% of the time in line with global liquidity in a given 12-month period. The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index with respect to global liquidity. Past TGA drawdowns in 2022 and 2023 have fueled speculative assets like Bitcoin. Thus, a $600 billion boost, plus billions more added over Q2-Q3, could lift BTC's value if market conditions remain stable.

However, before pushing chips into a long conviction play, BTC must break and retain a position above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). A collective reclaim above each moving average on a higher time frame chart could further strengthen the bullish case, allowing the crypto to retest its six-figure targets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new wave of smartphone-based attacks is draining crypto wallets without victims ever realizing it. According to researchers at Doctor Web, a surge in malware-laced Android phones has exposed a coordinated operation where attackers are embedding spyware directly into the software of newly sold devices. The goal is to intercept cryptocurrency transactions through a hijacked version of WhatsApp. But beneath the surface, they're running older software despite claiming to have the latest Android version, and they come with malicious software within. The infected devices ship with preinstalled, modified versions of WhatsApp that operate as clippers, which are malicious programs designed to replace copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's own. Once installed, this fake WhatsApp quietly swaps out wallet strings for popular coins like Ethereum and Tron whenever users send or receive them through chat. Even more worrying, victims never see anything suspicious. Not Just WhatsApp The attackers didn't stop at one app. Web's report, researchers found nearly 40 fake applications, including Telegram, crypto wallets like Trust Wallet and MathWallet, QR code readers, and others. This method not only evades detection but also lets the malicious code survive updates. What makes this campaign particularly dangerous is the supply chain angle. Many devices originate from smaller Chinese brands, with some models linked to a label called “SHOWJI.” Others remain untraceable. Web to be malicious Beyond Message Hijacking The spyware doesn't just swap out wallet addresses; it digs through targeted devices' image folders like DCIM, Downloads, and Screenshots, looking for pictures of recovery phrases. A lot of people snap screenshots of these for convenience, but those phrases are the master keys to their crypto wallets. If attackers get their hands on them, they can drain the account in minutes. So far, Doctor Web has identified over 60 servers and 30 domains used in the campaign. Some attacker wallets linked to the operation have already received more than $1 million, with others holding six-figure balances. And because many addresses are generated dynamically, the full financial scope remains unclear. How to Stay Safe Cybersecurity experts at Dr. They recommend avoiding Android phones from unverified sellers, particularly if the price feels too good to be true. To make sure a device is legit, tools like DevCheck can help verify hardware specs since fake models often manipulate system details, even in well-known apps like CPU-Z or AIDA64. Experts also advise against storing recovery phrases, passwords, or private keys as unencrypted images or text files, which can be easy targets for spyware. Installing reliable security software can help catch deeper system-level threats. Although the campaign is currently targeting Russian-speaking users, pre-installed malware on cheap Android devices, including smartphones and TV boxes, has already been used to target unsuspecting users worldwide. Therefore, regardless of your location, if your Android phone isn't what it claimed to be or if you've recently bought one off-brand device, it might be worth checking what's running under the hood.

A Pennsylvania man could spend up to six years in prison after pleading guilty to concealing over $13 million in NFT sales from tax authorities. What Happened: Waylon Wilcox, 45, admitted to filing false individual income tax returns in 2022 and 2023, according to a Department of Justice statement released Friday and reported by Fortune on Monday. Lawyers representing Wilcox did not respond to Fortune's request for comment. Read Also: Bitcoin Surges Back To $85,000: What Does The Technical Analysis Show? Why It Matters: The case comes during a transitional period for cryptocurrency tax reporting. Earlier this year, the IRS issued Notice 2025-7, providing temporary relief that allows crypto holders using centralized exchanges in 2025 to have more flexibility in their accounting methods rather than defaulting to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method. However, this relief doesn't exempt traders from reporting cryptocurrency transactions. CryptoPunks, created in 2017, is one of the oldest and most valuable NFT collections, with individual pieces once selling for as much as $23.7 million. The floor price for a CryptoPunk currently sits at 42.42 Ethereum ETH, approximately $70,000. The case serves as a reminder to cryptocurrency investors  that while the IRS has temporarily eased some reporting requirements for 2025, the fundamental obligation to report all cryptocurrency transactions remains unchanged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading market infrastructure company LSEG is among the first to open an account. Its SwapAgent division and global commodities firm Trafigura will are the first to open London-based blockchain accounts, which aim to streamline 24/7 real-time payments and foreign exchange (FX) settlements across global financial centers. This roll-out expands upon earlier Kinexys launches — most notably, the EUR-denominated blockchain accounts in Frankfurt — and underscores the firm's push to increase operational efficiency and reduce transaction friction for multinational corporations. SwapAgent, an LSEG Post Trade Solutions business, plans to leverage these new accounts for its digital post-trade services pilot project, with a view to broadening its blockchain adoption. “Integrating the innovative Kinexys Digital Payments blockchain deposit accounts into our SwapAgent offerings could allow us to operate beyond traditional branch cut-off times and manage settlements in a programmable manner in the future,” said Nathan Ondyak, CEO at SwapAgent. Meanwhile, Trafigura, one of the world's largest commodities suppliers, plans to harness the London-based accounts to support 24/7 global payments across financial hubs in New York, London and Singapore. Chris McLaughlin, Global Head of Group Treasury at Trafigura, said the collaboration “will enable us with 24/7 near-real-time payments across major global financial centers” and offer greater efficiency for real-time cross-border transactions. This move positions Kinexys as a key player in the landscape of digital cross-border payments and foreign exchange. This is expected to significantly reduce FX settlement risk and accelerate trade settlements, potentially revolutionizing how businesses manage international payments.

The documentary “Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,” which is set for global release April 15, tries to give us a peek into those aspects of Buterin, following his early life and childhood in Russia followed by immigrating with his family to Toronto, Canada, where his love for computers and technology began in his high school years. While thinking how he could apply those concepts to other aspects of life, Buterin set out to write a whitepaper on creating the blockchain version of the internet. Toronto has strong ties to Ethereum's early days. It was home to some of the first Ethereum developer hackathons and meetups organized by Ethereum's Canadian co-founders in the city. This year, CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 takes place in Toronto May 14-16, highlighting Canada's vibrant crypto community. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Why did you want to make a documentary about Ethereum? Zach Ingrasci [ZI]: So Chris and I have been making documentaries together for 15 years now. So I really love those human stories that give us insight into the emotions and motivations of people in really interesting places. But when we met Vitalik in 2021 I think he immediately clicked something in our brains like: “oh, here's a story that kind of breaks the stereotypes that mainstream audiences have of this space.” We raised basically the full budget of the film, and it allowed us to create this independent story and approach to follow Vitalik around the world, as, he lives out of a 40 liter backpack How did you guys decide what parts of Ethereum's history to include in Vitalik's story? ZI: This is the challenge of making these films. We had a very broad mandate, following the community, not just focused on Vitalik. And then after two years of filming, we realized that the kind of narrative structure would only make sense if you were able to follow one person and then get to meet the community through his eyes. The DAO hack is very confusing to explain, and so there's an element of just what at its essence is important. If the movie is aimed for a mainstream audience, why first decide to release it on-chain, instead of a streaming platform where more of those folks can access it? The documentary industry is broken, so to have an independent film premiere on a mainstream platform doesn't even mean anything, unless you have real marketing. Chris Temple [CT]: People love the film, and have rallied behind it and been interested and been sharing it with their moms, being like: “Hey, this is what I do for a living.” And I think empowering people with it at that first step, and using the technology that the film was all about felt very right to us. How did you convince Vitalik to do the film? ZI: I think we got really lucky in some ways. I think he was motivated to speak up about what he believed the future of Ethereum should look like, and how to build it, and people should focus on building things that have real world value. This is something that he's uncomfortable with, and something that's taken a long journey for him to even find where his voice is and how it should be. CT: It was a very challenging production, more than any film we've ever made, because Vitalik is nomadic, he's all over the world, and he says, “I'm going to be tomorrow in Montenegro…If you want to come.” We have to immediately try to scramble and get everybody there just to get those moments, even if it's just a couple of hours with Vitalik. The movie shows how uncomfortable Vitalik can be in stepping into that leadership role and having to make core decisions like whether the EF should be a non-profit vs for-profit organization and going against some co-founders. Given all the key decisions he's had to make over the past few months and a key leader in Ethereum, what do you think went through his mind, and has he become more comfortable in his leadership role? ZI: I really can't speak for Vitalik, but I do think that's why this film has never been more relevant. Because if we are looking for insight into how Vitalik thinks and what he cares about, I think the thing he cares most about is that Ethereum will be useful in the world. There's an important quote in the film about “if Ethereum is only used for speculation, that's a huge missed opportunity.” So it's not surprising that Vitalik didn't go to the White House [to meet with President Trump]. Vitalik cares about how this tool will be used in the long term for real, positive change in the world. So I can't imagine this has been an easy process for him. But you can definitely tell that he's begun to understand how to use his voice in this ecosystem and use his kind of soft power.Read more: Ethereum Foundation Picks New Co-Executive Directors, Following Leadership Reshuffle And why does Vitalik feel so connected to that cause? ZI: We have some experience filming on the borders of war zones. Luckily, at that time Kiev was relatively safe. It really was Vitalik's idea, he always wanted to support the hackers there. There's a deleted scene where he's playing chess with Fedorov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine. But you know, Fedorov was talking about how 1000s of their military were saved because of that $100 million Vitalik raised in crypto was quickly mobilized. What are you hoping that your audience takes away from this film? If we can inspire an audience to be more savvy and think more critically about technology, not just in these extremes of it's all bad or it's all good, but to understand a bit of that spectrum along the middle there, and look at both the positive and negative consequences of technology. Helping anybody apply those lessons, whether it's within crypto, within AI, because technology is just going to continue to shift and impact our lives. I think that's where Vitalik has been successful because he is not Ethereum. Margaux Nijkerk reports on the Ethereum protocol and L2s. She holds BTC and ETH above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>14 April 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, announced today its intention to deploy both existing and future hashrate on OCEAN, a leading Bitcoin mining pool focused on decentralization and launched by long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. This strategic move strengthens Tether's ongoing commitment to supporting the resilience, transparency, and decentralization of Bitcoin's foundational infrastructure. OCEAN empowers miners to build their own block templates using their open source DATUM protocol, reducing dependency on centralized intermediaries and enhancing censorship resistance within the Bitcoin network. Tether's deployment leverages OCEAN's DATUM Gateway software, designed to deliver high-performance mining operations even in bandwidth-constrained environments. “As a company committed to financial freedom and open access, we see supporting decentralization in Bitcoin mining as essential to the network's long-term integrity,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. Tether will roll out OCEAN's DATUM Gateway across its mining operations worldwide, including in rural and underserved areas such as parts of Africa. Its architecture allows us to achieve reliable connectivity even in low-bandwidth regions, expanding the reach and resilience of our infrastructure.” Their participation underscores the value of open, censorship-resistant mining protocols.” Mark Artymko, OCEAN's President, added: “This alignment reinforces our shared belief that financial inclusion and decentralization go hand-in-hand.” Most recently, Tether collaborated with Quidax on a major crypto literacy initiative across Nigeria and other African nations aimed at equipping millions with the tools to access and benefit from digital assets. By combining mining operations with educational programs, Tether is driving financial empowerment and digital resilience throughout the continent. “T3 FCU is reshaping how the industry responds to illicit activity—enabling cross-border collaboration with a level […]</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Savvy investors are already positioning themselves in altcoins that show the best possibility for exponential development as the cryptocurrency market gets set for what many anticipate to be another historic bull run. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most often used cryptocurrency, several less well-known initiatives show even more promise. Among them, Cardano (ADA), XRP from Ripple, and Rexas Finance (RXS) stand out as three cryptocurrencies with an irresistible climb in the following months, most likely. Strong technology, valuable applications, and rising acceptance support these projects. These altcoins could see notable breakouts as institutional investors and retail traders hunt for fresh prospects to set new all-time highs (ATH) in 2025 and beyond. Let us investigate why Cardano, XRP, and Rexas Finance are positioned for notable expansion and why they could be the best choices for the next bull market. Attracting developers and businesses, the Hydra scaling technology and Plutus smart contracts make Cardano more fit than ever to handle enormous transaction volumes at low cost. ADA is prepared for a significant comeback in the next bull cycle with its expanding network of DeFi apps, NFT markets, and tokenized assets. Analysts estimate Cardano might surpass $5 if the market conditions match or approach $10. Unlike many speculative crypto ventures, XRP is helpful in the real world as a bridge currency for international payments and remittances. The unresolved case has made it difficult for XRP to increase prices and reach new heights. If Ripple gets regulatory clarity and keeps growing its alliances with financial institutions, XRP might quickly surpass $5 or even $10 in the next bull market. XRP is among the most exciting cryptocurrencies for long-term investors as worldwide demand for cross-border payments rises, and its adoption could be explosive. Although Cardano and XRP are well-known projects, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a newly developed altcoin that might yield enormous returns for early investors. Rexas Finance is leading the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), enabling users to own and trade assets, including real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property, on the blockchain, unlike conventional cryptocurrencies. One of Rexas Finance's main benefits is its capacity to democratize investment. Conventional financing only makes high-value assets like fine art and real estate available to the rich. Rexas Finance is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting blockchain initiatives in asset management, having already raised over $47,624,594 in its presale and sold over 458,120,680 tokens. Purchasing fractional real estate shares, precious metals, and other valuable assets allows investors to democratize their wealth-building chances. CertiK has thoroughly audited Rexas Finance to guarantee that its smart contracts are safe and free from flaws. Given its strong fundamentals and market demand for real-world asset tokenization, RXS has the potential to reach $10-$20 in the next cycle, delivering 50x to 100x returns for early investors. With the next bull market horizon, Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the top altcoins that could experience unstoppable rallies. Cardano's smart contract and DeFi growth could push ADA toward $5+. XRP's regulatory clarity and banking partnerships could drive it to new highs of $5-$10. Rexas Finance's RWA tokenization revolution could see RXS explode past $10-$20. These three cryptos provide the best risk-to-reward potential for investors hoping to position themselves for enormous returns in the following market cycle. With blockchain technology revolutionizing industries and new opportunities emerging, it is time to accumulate these promising assets before they take off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With this shift, two crypto topics are capturing widespread attention: crypto mining software and the rise of politically-themed meme coins like the trending Trump Meme Coin. While the UK is not typically associated with large-scale crypto mining (compared to countries with lower electricity costs), it remains a hub for blockchain innovation and small-to-mid-scale mining operations. Crypto mining software allows individuals or businesses to validate transactions on blockchains like Bitcoin using their hardware. Even with the UK government's increasing focus on green technology, local innovators are exploring how mining software can be optimised for sustainable performance. More importantly, software developers in London and across the UK are beginning to create hybrid applications, combining mining functions with portfolio tracking and energy usage analytics. As discussions about crypto's carbon footprint grow louder, British tech companies are expected to lead the way in eco-conscious mining innovation. Despite being rooted in American politics, the Trump Meme Coin has found curious traction among British investors, largely thanks to its online virality and the UK's ongoing interest in U.S. politics and pop culture. The coin, styled around former President Donald Trump, is a digital token that merges satire with speculation, much like previous meme coins such as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. While experts advise caution, especially due to lack of regulation and high volatility, the Trump Meme Coin offers insight into how internet culture and decentralised finance (DeFi) are influencing British investor behaviour. British crypto miners, whether casual hobbyists or small-scale entrepreneurs, often face challenges such as high electricity costs, regulation uncertainty, and limited access to industrial-scale hardware. This makes choosing the right mining software especially important for efficiency and sustainability. With smart mining software, UK users can remain competitive in a global crypto landscape, even without access to industrial-scale infrastructure. Though many start as jokes, their impact on internet culture and financial habits is real. Take the Trump Meme Coin for example, it's more than just a token. UK traders and younger investors in particular are drawn to these digital assets not just for profit, but also for the shared sense of community they create. However, concerns remain about stability, rug pulls, and market manipulation. Still, with proper risk management and awareness, meme coins continue to attract attention from a broad spectrum of the UK's tech-savvy population. This context has inspired local developers and companies to rethink how mining software operates. Several London-based blockchain startups are developing AI-integrated mining dashboards that reduce energy waste and improve efficiency. Some are even exploring ways to integrate carbon-offset tracking into mining platforms, aligning with the UK government's broader environmental goals. Moreover, recent reports from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology indicate growing interest in supporting green blockchain infrastructure. While large-scale crypto mining may not be feasible in the UK due to cost and environmental constraints, mining software is rapidly evolving to suit a smaller, greener, and smarter approach. British culture has always embraced satire, from the pages of Private Eye to comedy classics like Spitting Image. It's no surprise, then, that meme coins resonate with a UK audience attuned to irony, humour, and quick-turn trends. As for coins like the Trump Meme Coin, their success lies in striking a balance between entertainment and finance. Some analysts even suggest that the rise of meme coins has democratised crypto investing in the UK, making it more appealing to people outside of traditional financial hubs like Canary Wharf. With mobile apps and user-friendly exchanges, even novice investors can participate, though they must tread carefully in this volatile space. As meme coins continue to intersect with art, politics, and fintech, they may increasingly reflect the diverse cultural narratives of modern Britain. For UK residents, from London tech startups to individual crypto investors, the future of digital assets holds both promise and unpredictability. What's clear is that understanding the nuances of these technologies, alongside a healthy dose of scepticism and curiosity, will be essential for anyone hoping to navigate crypto space successfully in Britain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JP Morgan has launched its blockchain-based bank account service, Kinexys Digital Payments (formerly JPM Coin), in a third currency, GBP. As a result, it can now provide 24/7 support for corporate payments and foreign exchange for dollars, euros and pounds. Kinexys has processed more than $1.5 trillion in cumulative transactions across all its services which include payments, intraday repo, collateral management and other offerings. It now averages around $2 billion in transactions daily. SwapAgent, the derivatives margin and settlement service that is part of LSEG's LCH, will be using Kinexys Digital Payments via JP Morgan's London subsidiary for its  post trade services pilot, which is independent of the UK's Digital Securities Sandbox. It will then consider a broader adoption of the service. “Integrating the innovative Kinexys Digital Payments blockchain deposit accounts into our SwapAgent offerings could allow us to operate beyond traditional branch cut-off times and manage settlements in a programmable manner in the future,” said Nathan Ondyak, CEO at SwapAgent, part of the London Stock Exchange Group. Trafigura is using Kinexys for 24/7 cross border payments between its New York, London and Singapore divisions. But corporates and some non bank financial institutions may not have access to central bank money, so Kinexys could be one of the digital solutions that fills the need. Most of the UK's largest banks are also working on the Regulated Liability Network, a tokenized deposit payment solution, but that's not yet live.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) found support around their key levels last week, suggesting a recovery is in the cards. Bitcoin price broke and closed above its descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple high levels since mid-January) on Friday and rallied 2.22% the next day. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000. If BTC fails to close above $85,000 and continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $73,072. If ETH continues its recovery and closes above $1,700, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $1,861. It points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. Conversely, if ETH closes below its daily support level of $1,449, it could extend the decline to retest its important psychological level of $1,300. XRP price recovered by 14.28%, breaking above its 200-day EMA at $1.95 on Wednesday. If XRP breaks and closes above $2.23, it could extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50. On the other hand, if XRP closes below its 200-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.77. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.
