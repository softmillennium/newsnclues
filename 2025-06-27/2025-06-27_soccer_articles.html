                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FORT LAUDERDALE, FL — Will we see a happy Lionel Messi or a vengeful one when he leads Inter Miami against his former team, Paris Saint-Germain, in their FIFA Club World Cup round of 16 match Sunday in Atlanta? It's been two years since Messi unceremoniously left Paris to join Inter Miami in the twilight of his legendary career, but it's unclear if any residual feelings remain for the Argentine World Cup champion. Messi's two-year spell at PSG was complicated, particularly upon his return to Paris from the 2022 World Cup triumph – having led Argentina to victory over France in the final. Fans voiced their displeasure with Messi, who was also suspended by the club in May 2023 for taking an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia the day after a match. “It's clear that for us it's better if he plays angry, because he's one of those players who, when he has something on his mind, gives an extra effort,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said to ESPN about Messi, after the club's 2-2 draw against Brazilian side Palmeiras that placed them into this knockout match against the reigning UEFA Champions League winners. Messi was all business and locked in during Friday's training session – two days before he'll take center stage inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium at noon ET in perhaps most enticing matchup in this summer's tournament. Messi smiled widely in photos he and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, shared on social media from his 38th birthday party this week. Inter Miami is hopeful Messi, who is under contract through the rest of this MLS season, will re-sign for at least next year – when they open their new stadium at Miami Freedom Park. His adoring fans globally are also hopeful he plays with Argentina again in next year's FIFA World Cup, hosted in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But those decisions are for another day. And it's a decision we made with time. It wasn't something we decided one day to the next. … That makes everything much easier and simpler,” Messi said during his only press conference with Inter Miami in August 2023. I didn't want to leave Barcelona. In some ways, it was one day to the next. But that's totally different from my experience here.” Messi joined his old Barcelona teammate Neymar, and French 2018 World Cup champion Kylian Mbappe at PSG from 2021-23, forming one of the best attacking trios soccer fans could ever dream about playing together. “I know the feelings he has towards Barca, where we played together. I was not there with him at PSG, he was there for two years and only he knows what happened.” Ousmane Dembélé, one of the frontrunners for this year's Ballon d'Or as the world's best player, had two assists in the Champions League final but hasn't played in the Club World Cup due to a quad injury. "It will be nice to meet Messi again. There were many beautiful moments,” PSG defender Achraf Hakimi told reporters after a win against the Seattle Sounders. “But then, on the field, there are no friends. Another storyline: PSG is led by Luis Enrique, who coached Inter Miami's former Barcelona tandem of Messi, Alba, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Mascherano from 2014-17. They won the Champions League in 2015 together. Inter Miami is the biggest underdog of any team in the Club World Cup round of 16: They have +1150 odds to beat PSG, the heavy favorite at -450, according to BETMGM. “This is not over for us yet. Beyond the face that we are going to face possibly the best team in Europe – the Champions League champions – we will try to go with the same seriousness and try to play a great game, and see what possibilities we have,” Mascherano said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Freeman has been asked about Antonio Freeman lately – including what's the favorite highlight of his dad from the NFL days. The younger Freeman readily answers, saying it's his dad's famous game-winning catch in overtime on Monday Night Football from 2000 that even got play-by-play announcer Al Michaels to exclaim "He did what?!" But Alex is also making his own impression – it's just on a different type of field. And he was named this week as This USMNT squad is missing several key stars at the Gold Cup for various reasons. Playing in the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup. But that's given rising talents like Freeman the chance to make a big impression on U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino. Here's what he had to say about his burgeoning soccer career, his dream about reaching the World Cup – and yes, his Super Bowl-winning dad. What was it like to get your first USMNT call-up, and to have it be for something as important as the Gold Cup? It's an honor to get called up and represent the country at this high-level tournament. It's just something that pushes all of us each day in training and especially in the games, to be able to win and try to get a trophy out of this. I was just grateful to be on the [60-man] preliminary roster. Knowing that I was chosen for that final roster was a very big surprise for me and something that I'm forever grateful for. Alex Freeman has made a big impression on U.S men's team coach Mauricio Pochettino at this Gold Cup. What has the USMNT camp and the tournament experience been like for you so far? Freeman: It's been good getting to know all the guys. We have a good group here, but also just being able to build chemistry with these guys in practice and everything like that. It's something that, you know, going into this camp that I really wanted to do was be able to get to know the guys' stories, where they come from and all that. Freeman: When I came in, I was just going to work and see what Pochettino wanted and how I could fit his playing style. What's your favorite highlight from your dad and how many times have you watched it? Freeman: (laughs) My favorite highlight is probably the Monday Night Football catch when he's on the ground and [the ball] hits his shoulder and he kind of catches it and gets up and scores the winning touchdown. I'd look up ‘Top 10 catches' and it would always be there. It was just a big moment for him and something that I admire. What is your dad's favorite highlight of your career and how many times has he watched it? Freeman: It's probably the one when I had my first start [at Orlando] and scored a goal against Toronto. I think you could just tell in that moment that he was excited and happy. I saw him after the game and he actually couldn't believe it. Freeman: It wasn't tough to tell him because he just wanted me to do something that I was passionate about and be able to excel at something. Obviously, it's weird telling your dad, who played another sport, that you want to play [a different sport]. But I feel like at the end of the day, he accepted it and just supported me. Does he come to all of your games? He's just making this his own little vacation. Even in Orlando, he comes to a lot of the games. My mom, my stepdad, and then I have my two little brothers and I feel like they're really the ones that I play for the most because they're the ones who look up to me as an example. And I feel like for them, it's just being able to be that good role model. [Tyler, 15, and Josh, 13] are both soccer players as well and just want to do what I'm doing. They must think you playing for the USMNT is pretty cool then? Whenever I go home, I watch them play and they tell all their friends [about my career]. It's good they're able to brag about me a little bit (laughs). Alex Freeman has started all three games for the U.S. men's team at the Gold Cup. Who is the coolest person you've met through your dad? Freeman: I've met a lot of cool people through him. The most notable one I'd say is Scottie Pippen. When did you realize your dad was a Super Bowl-winning wide receiver? Freeman: When I was younger you'd hear about it, but you don't really understand it fully. Like in sixth grade I actually started doing research on my dad — it's funny. I realized how inspirational he was not just in Wisconsin, but to football in general. And so I think that was when I really realized how much of an impact he made on the game and in Green Bay. Freeman: Yeah, the Packers are my favorite team. But my second favorite team is probably the Steelers because my stepdad is a big Steelers fan. Freeman: I've been getting into golf a lot. Right now I'm reading this book called ‘Win The Day' [by Mark Batterson]. The U.S. women's national team loves to get on TikTok during training camp. Is that something this younger USMNT group does too? Freeman: We don't really post, but we're the type to see a trend on TikTok and do it. We'll make little jokes about it or stuff like that. What would it mean to you to be on the U.S. World Cup roster next year? Freeman: It would mean the world to me. And I feel like it's something that everyone wants to work towards and be able to get there. And so right now, it's just about putting your head down and putting in that extra work to be able to show the coaches here and to show the world that you're ready to compete at that level against the best.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On it, Brazilians clubs have shocked some of European soccer's best — Botafogo toppled French powerhouse PSG before Flamengo took down England's Chelsea — and off of it, supporters of teams such as Palmeiras and Fluminense have fueled an exciting atmosphere for the reconfigured tournament. And the party continued during a weather delay during one match with fans packing the concourse, banging drums and continuing to chant. All four of the Brazilian clubs — including Palmeiras and Fluminense, which each played a pair of games at MetLife Stadium during the group stage — advanced to the knockout round beginning Saturday. “I like how all the games are tight, except one or two, and people are surprised, European teams lose. The strong support has been bolstered by fans willing to travel to the United States to follow their favorite clubs, along with a strong base of support already in North America. Palmeiras, for example, has a club-recognized group called Palmeiras Consulate in New York, which has organized a number of events since the start of the Club World Cup earlier this month. Adriano Branco helped create the group two years ago after he relocated from Brazil to the New York area for work. In a conversation with The Post, he called helping to bring together so many fans from so many backgrounds a “rewarding experience.” Branco hasn't been surprised by the support the South American clubs have had — Palmeiras in particular — but the sheer number of fans that have shown up has been eye-opening. He estimated that 30,000 of the 45,000 fans announced for Palmeiras' first match against Porto on June 15 had been there to support the Brazilian side. The Club World Cup has allowed other fans to come together as well. “It's incredible,” said Flobatir Abdou, who drove down from Massachusetts to see Al Ahly face Palmeiras last week. “Coming from Egypt, soccer is one thing that unites everybody together and having everybody support the same club, same badge, it's a whole [different] feeling, especially in a stadium like this with a team like this, and a moment like this.” It's a lot of people from different states coming together,” said a Palmeiras fan who identified himself as Guilerme. The Club World Cup Round of 16 begins Saturday with an all-Brazilian clash between Palmeiras and Botafogo in Philadelphia. Sunday's slate includes a showdown between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and his former club PSG, as well as Brazil's Flamengo taking on Bayern Munich. All matches are streaming for free on DAZN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid expect defender David Alaba to miss the remainder of the Club World Cup after he suffered a fresh injury set-back. Alaba, 33, underwent assessments which revealed an injury to his left calf muscle and the club anticipate he will be sidelined for around three weeks. The Austria international has missed Madrid's opening three Club World Cup group stage fixtures as he continues his recovery from a meniscus injury in his left knee that he sustained in April. He is yet to be named in a matchday squad at the tournament in the United States but was expected to be able to play a part in the latter stages before his latest set-back. Injury restricted Alaba to just 14 appearances across all competitions during the 2024-25 campaign after returning from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in January, which he suffered in December 2023. He then suffered a meniscus injury in April that required minor surgery, ruling him out of the remainder of the campaign. Madrid beat Red Bull Salzburg in their final Club World Cup group game on Thursday and will play Juventus in the last-16 on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Victor Maciel Furtado's representatives have now reacted to rumblings that Manchester United are interested in signing the Botafogo player this summer. John Victor started in all three of Botafogo's Group B matches, with the Manchester United-linked player seeing out the full 90 minutes in each Club World Cup clash. The Brazilian Serie A outfit will play fellow Brazilian side Palmeiras on Saturday at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, with kick-off slated for 5pm UK time. However, John only has a £5.8m release clause in his current deal with the Brazilian side and United have been tipped to sign a new ‘keeper in the summer window. However, John's camp has shut down the speculation over a move to Old Trafford and Goal reports that they have ‘denied any contact' from the Red Devils so far. READ MORE: Man Utd star who played under Ruben Amorim and Erik ten Hag is convinced Old Trafford spell ended with ‘perfect finish' The verdict is still out if United will actively pursue a new ‘keeper this summer amid the need to strengthen other key areas of Ruben Amorim's first-team squad. Andre Onana has retained his place as United No 1, but the former Ajax and Inter Milan star's future remains uncertain amid another disappointing season. Altay Bayindir, much like Andre Onana, left United fans deeply frustrated at times last season with howlers and the Red Devils have looked weak between the sticks. Ruben Amorim could see the arrival of a new shot-stopper this summer and Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez has been linked with United in recent months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The group stage has featured some great games and indelible moments, thanks mostly to the participants who took things seriously. Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson here But it's in there somewhere, a good soccer tournament, cloaked by all the avarice and bombast, in spite of itself and those responsible for it. It's true: the Club World Cup and its new summer format haven't been all bad. The group stage, which concluded on Thursday, offered fun and competitive teams. It served up a few genuinely enthralling games, especially in the clashes between the European and South American sides. We've even seen some kit design excellence – thank you, Botafogo. We saw the European champions Paris Saint-German savage Atlético Madrid 4-0, only to turn around and lose to one of those pesky Brazilian sides, Botafogo. Like many World Cups, there was a European giant that disappointed in not making it past the groups. While the Brazilian delegation offered up good teams and good fans, the Argentinian mission only sent good fans, bringing color and noise as both River and Boca were knocked out in the group stage and looked decidedly overwhelmed even by mediocre opposition. Borussia Dortmund was held scoreless by Fluminense and almost embarrassed by Mamelodi Sundowns, flirting with giving away a 4-1 lead. The only group not to yield compelling theater was G – which was dominated by Manchester City and Juventus (until City smashed Juve 5-2), at the cost of Al Ain and Wydad – since Group H saw Real Madrid stunned by a Al-Hilal in a 1-1 tie. A great many things are still wrong with the unwieldy Club World Cup. Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer The impact of good crowds was diminished by Fifa's insistence on playing in America's biggest arenas. Another 14 games drew fewer than 20,000, suggesting using Major League Soccer facilities for a lot more games might have been a good idea. It was also a grind, with four games a day for most of the group stage, and requiring a finalist to slog through seven matches on the back of, or in the midst of, the punishing domestic club seasons. There was Fifa's cowardice in removing anti-racism signage, and then bringing it back for a single day. For 63 games, we must suffer the ludicrous spectacle of bored players ambling through the thin puffs of smoke and shimmering lights as an announcer gives them the full heavyweight-championship-of-the-world boxing match treatment during pre-game introductions. Also, whatever the hell that was in the Oval Office with Donald Trump, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, and the bewildered Juventus players and executives – hopefully a nadir in Infantino's persistent cozying up to Trump. It's a lot – probably too much – of everything. And in failing to meet its own impossible ambitions, the Club World Cup has made no imprint whatsoever on the culture. There is a more modest, pared-down version of this competition that could be a success, with an emphasis on the competition rather than the revenue and the overplayed stakes. If it was brought along slowly and nurtured as a growth play, rather than announced as the biggest thing to ever happen right at the outset, there is an event there that could enrich the sport. This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. This week's is on Friday to coincide with the end of the Club World Cup group stage. We'll be back in your inbox every Monday from then on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On "The Football Reporters" podcast, James Olley shares his frustrations with the Club World Cup tournament as it currently exists. We've reached the knockout rounds of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, and the tournament has given us so much to talk about, celebrate and criticize since Inter Miami and Al Ahly battled to a 0-0 draw at Hard Rock Stadium. We've had shocks, surprises and stunning scorelines; we've also had difficult weather, uneven attendance and some lackluster pitches, too. So, with the knockout rounds set to start Saturday in Philadelphia when Palmeiras take on Botafogo, we asked our Club World Cup reporters for their thoughts on the good, bad and ugly of the 2025 tournament so far, as well as their picks for who will win it all at MetLife Stadium on July 13. The South American teams and their fans have made it a spectacle. It was obviously never going to compare to a World Cup, but there has at least been a flavor of it. It's also important to remember that this is the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup: Attitudes might be very different in eight years. But the football itself has been reasonably good. Other than Auckland City (but they made up for it in the third game), the only team to really get blown out were Atletico Madrid. Fans of African and South American teams brought a ton of color and proper tifo, so their games, at least the ones I attended, felt very much like "real" games. Maybe my expectations weren't very high, but I think they showed it's a viable competition. That may still happen and we might end up with a Champions League quartet in the semifinals, but Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and River Plate have all risen to the occasion -- so did South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns -- and it's made this competition feel like a genuinely global event. But we can't escape the fact that attendance has been worse than anticipated. Had more games been staged at smaller MLS venues rather than huge NFL stadiums, the games might just have been played to a full house, making for a better spectacle. Now, after witnessing Boca Juniors supporters at Hard Rock Stadium and Inter Miami's shocking victory over FC Porto, this feels like an actual competition. This isn't the pre-season tournament or Europe-dominated competition many anticipated. Though FIFA can continue to improve certain aspects of the Club World Cup, maybe considering a different point in the year to avoid player exhaustion and weather concerns, this first edition proved international interest for these matchups. But a lot of the games have been really fun to watch, and the sight of Brazilian, Argentinian and Mexican sides going up against -- and often competing with -- European teams has been refreshing. It's the first edition of this tournament in this format, and given that, it's gone about as well as could reasonably be expected. And it should get even better in the knockout stages, with more at stake. South Americans, especially Brazilians, have reason to celebrate. James Olley: Elements of it have surprised me, but overall the tournament has been more or less what I expected: mixed attendance figures, complaints about the heat and the pitches, tired European players, and a lukewarm domestic reception. The tournament was always too big at 32 teams, but there have still been moments that will live in the memory, perhaps creating continental rivalries that can give the Club World Cup a proper heritage in time. What has surprised me, though, is the lack of exposure in some cities. It varies, but in many cases, marketing of the tournament is minimal and finding the games on in a bar isn't as straightforward as it should be. Craig Burley explains why you can't use the Club World Cup to determine which sides are stronger than others. Ricardo Carino, ESPN Mexico: It's been 100 percent better. It's a fact that European teams are on the right track, but their stars and their million-dollar salaries haven't been fully reflected on the pitch, nor in some of the results we've seen these past few days. Dawson: I think Thembinkosi Lorch has impressed for Wydad AC. The 31-year-old South African forward caught the eye in his first game against Manchester City and gave Pep Guardiola's young back four a number of nervous moments. Marcotti: Don't know about the best, because the stupid way TV rights were assigned means that it was actually difficult to watch most of the games on anything other than my phone or laptop (which sucks), but I'll mention two guys who stood out. Al Ahly's Danish-Palestinian striker Wessam Abou Ali, who got a hat trick against Benfica, and Boca Juniors' Miguel Merentiel, who looked great in the first two games only to fluff his lines in the third. Ogden: Michael Olise (Bayern Munich), Jobe Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus) and Igor Jesus (Botafogo) have all impressed, but my pick at this stage is Angel di Maria. At 37, he is still going strong with Benfica and his performance in the group stage 1-0 win against Bayern Munich, which secured top spot in Group C for Bruno Lage's team, was incredible considering his age and the searing temperatures in Charlotte. Di Maria was all energy in driving his team on, but it was merely a continuation of his earlier performances in the competition. He has already scored three goals in three games, living up to his pedigree as a World Cup winner with Argentina and a player who has spent his career at the highest level with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Becherano: Angel Di Maria is waving goodbye to European football by inspiring Benfica to a first-place finish in the group stage, surpassing Bayern Munich, Boca Juniors and Auckland City to qualify for the round of 16. He's one of five players tied for tournament lead with three goals scored, with every goal important: Di Maria kicked off the come-from-behind draw against Boca Juniors with a penalty in the first half, propelling Benfica to the crucial point. After an emotional goodbye to the Argentina national team last summer, it seems he wants to make this year memorable as well. Kirkland: The best team performance I've seen was Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atletico Madrid, and the star at the Rose Bowl that day -- ahead of other candidates like Fabián Ruiz, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi -- was Vitinha. After PSG's Champions League win, everybody knows how good the Portuguese midfield maestro is, so it's no surprise: it's been more of the same here. It's not easy to stand out in a team of average quality like Fluminense, but the Colombian attacker shows great technique and intellectual wisdom on the field. Olley: This is a bit of left-field call, but what about Jorginho? Intelligent use of possession is vital in sweltering temperatures, and Jorginho has slotted straight into Flamengo's midfield since his arrival from Arsenal on a free transfer, seemingly developing an almost instant understanding of his new teammates. He completed 52 of his 59 passes in Flamengo's 3-1 win over Chelsea, registering eight ball recoveries -- more than any other player on the pitch. This tournament is so far proving he can still do it on the field, too. The statistics point to Bayern Munich's top scorers, Jamal Musiala or Michael Olise, though another standout is Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid goalkeeper has become his club's best player. Madrid picked up seven points in the group stage, but they haven't been brilliant and their results could have been a lot different were the Belgian not between the posts. Real Madrid were decisive and won 3-1, but Courtois was instrumental in maintaining the result. Eleven shots on goal and five shots saved against Pachuca are the difference between lost or remaining unbeaten, and he followed that with three good saves in Thursday's 3-0 win over Salzburg. Dawson: The weather is clearly an issue, and not just that. It's summed up best by Manchester City's schedule. World Cup schedulers will have to look at that before deciding which games are played where in 2026. The heat and humidity in certain venues are really an issue if games are going to kick off at noon or 3 o'clock local time, and they sort of need to kick off at those times -- partly for TV purposes, partly because there are a ton of games, and you can't play them all at night. I guess you can figure out how to play the early kickoffs in Canada or the Pacific Northwest or domed stadiums, but it's going to be tricky. We had three games delayed in the group stage alone due to "adverse weather." The poor attendances so far at the Club World Cup won't be repeated next summer -- that's a totally different ballgame -- but the unpredictable and severe weather that has led to several games being suspended for long periods is a concern that won't go away. It may be too late to make all the necessary changes to help minimize the weather disruption next summer, but things can still be done. For instance, more games could be scheduled for stadiums with retractable roofs and climate control to make life easier for players and spectators and kickoff times should be reassessed to ensure there are no games starting at midday. It will be hot throughout the host nations (U.S., Canada and Mexico) next summer, regardless of where games are staged. With only four of the 16 venues having a retractable roof, FIFA should reevaluate whether some cities / stadiums are really up to the requirements. The "Futbol Americas" crew discusses how Inter Miami should feel after late goals from Palmeiras result in the MLS side facing off against PSG. Becherano: Between the dangerous weather conditions and unsatisfactory pitches, FIFA must address these concerns heading into the 2026 World Cup. Even when winning, players cite the climate as upsetting. While spectators tune into these tournaments to be entertained, FIFA must consider accommodating the players first. Pictures of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich substitutes watching their matches in their locker rooms to stay out of the sun are one thing, but expecting fans -- some of whom have paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, and are attending games with their families, with young children -- to sit in the stands at midday, in a stadium with no roof, and no protection from the summer sun, is unacceptable. We all know TV audiences are the priority, but match-going fans need to be treated better. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Imagine during the group stage, one team has to play in 40C heat while another is in an air-conditioned stadium. There is a delicate balancing act to be found between sharing the use of those stadiums around and finding late kickoff times, doing their best to avoid any team being unduly affected by the heat. Carino: Schedules have been one of the main issues in this tournament. Dawson: You can argue as much as you like about whether Auckland City -- essentially an amateur team -- deserve their place in the Club World Cup alongside the likes of Real Madrid and River Plate. But after they were smashed 10-0 in their opening game against Bayern Munich, surely no one can deny that their 1-1 draw against Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their final group game was the feel-good story of the group stage. Marcotti: I'll go with Mamelodi Sundowns for the way they nearly came back against Borussia Dortmund, losing 4-3, and held Fluminense to a draw in their final game. They more than lived up to their Brazil-inspired jerseys. Julien Laurens explains why he thinks River Plate's exit from the FIFA Club World Cup is a "huge failure" for the club. Ogden: Christian Gray's goal for Auckland City in their surprise 1-1 draw with Boca Juniors epitomized what this kind of tournament should be about: a part-time player scoring a goal that he and his teammates will remember forever. Gray, a PE teacher in New Zealand, and the majority of his Auckland squad had to take time off from their day jobs to participate in the Club World Cup, and it had been a chastening experience due to a 10-0 defeat against Bayern Munich and a 6-0 loss to Benfica. With Argentine giants Boca needing a big win to have any hope of qualification, another hammering seemed to be inevitable for Auckland in Nashville. But despite falling behind in the first-half, the Oceania champions fought back with Gray earning them a draw with his goal. Inter Miami was practically written off against the European side, but that moment from the Argentine forward seemed to silence all that doubted in the stadium and from afar. Kirkland: It didn't matter if it was on the beach, at a nightclub, or in Walmart: Boca Juniors fans were everywhere in south Florida during this Club World Cup. Sadly, on the field, their team didn't come close to living up to that backing, crashing out thanks to an embarrassing 1-1 draw with amateurs Auckland City, a result which was another highlight. Cobos: The South American fans' party, which saved FIFA from total failure in this Club World Cup in terms of the football atmosphere. He was shoehorned into this tournament in a typically cynical way by FIFA -- Inter Miami were awarded a spot as "hosts" -- but his free-kick against Porto was the social media viral clip they were desperate for in return. Messi turned 38 this week and any chance to see him on a major stage like this is of significant value. Oh, and Inter Miami's surprising level of performance has earned him what nobody thought possible: a reunion with Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16. Any Mexican team can feel like the home team in Los Angeles, but the Rayados fans have organized their own party before their matches, and the passion of Los Millonarios was also on full display. Dawson: It's hard to look past Real Madrid. If there's a club who are all about earning the title of world champions it's Real Madrid. They're still a bit of an unknown while they get used to life under new manager Xabi Alonso, but it would be typical of them to turn up in the knockout rounds and win it all. Marcotti: I think Manchester City are really well equipped. Luis Enrique's team are full of belief after their Champions League success and they have enough youth in the side to be able to cope with the physical demands of the competition. They will be far too strong for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in the Round of 16, and they should also overcome Flamengo or Bayern Munich in the quarters, so I'm backing them to add the Club World Cup to their Champions League title. Rob Dawson believes Pep Guardiola will be happy with his team after their impressive display vs. Juventus. Becherano: Between group stage performances and the path forward to the final, Bayern Munich stand as my top contenders. They've got a very winnable last-16 tie against Inter Miami. It gets trickier after that, with a possible quarterfinal clash with Bayern Munich or dark horses Flamengo, and maybe Real Madrid in the semifinals, but PSG are a better team than any of them. Olley: It would be very Manchester City to put recent difficulties behind them and find a way to win. Manager Pep Guardiola has heavily rotated his teams to this point and they are still bedding in new signings, but they've looked as strong as anyone so far. Carino: History dictates that this spot has to be reserved for Real Madrid. Controversy or not, they're the favorites to advance and win. Dawson: You probably can't be classed as a "surprise team" if you come into a tournament as champions of Brazil, but Botafogo have got the opportunity to go deep. Marcotti: I guess it comes down to what we define as a "surprise" team. I didn't think they'd qualify ahead of River Plate, and their Round of 16 game against Borussia Dortmund is manageable. Their performance in the 1-0 win against Bayern Munich highlighted Benfica's quality, but also their ability to cope with the demanding conditions. Bruno Lage's team will be underdogs to beat Chelsea in the Round of 16, but they look a more cohesive unit than the Premier League side and I expect them to emerge with a win and book a quarterfinal against Palmeiras or Botafogo. Once it gets to the quarterfinal stage, every team still involved will believe they can go all the way and Benfica will face a tough challenge against either of the Brazilian teams. But they have been a surprise package so far and Benfica look capable of extending their stay in the U.S. for quite a while yet. Ale Moreno reflects on Real Madrid's win over RB Salzburg in the Club World Cup and how the players are adapting to Xabi Alonso's new system. Becherano: I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as a surprise after their victory over PSG, but Botafogo could be the Brazilian side to stun most opponents from here. Kirkland: Do Flamengo, the best team in Brazil right now, count as a surprise? They've got one of the best young coaches around in Filipe Luis, and their win over Chelsea showed they can beat top European opposition. Sunday's last-16 game with Bayern Munich will tell us how seriously they should be taken -- win that, and they can go all the way. They advanced in the most difficult group and even beat the Champions League champions, Paris Saint-Germain, which was a feat. Without a doubt, they are my bet among the surprises to go furthest. Igor Jesus scored the famous winning goal against PSG and has impressed with his physicality. On paper, their portion of the bracket offers hope of further progress given after Palmeiras, they would face either a Chelsea side still searching for rhythm and Benfica, who were surprise winners of their group. The Brazilians have caused European clubs to suffer and while they've lost some of these games, I think this competition has caused UEFA to look at Latin American soccer with a bit more respect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's Take Two for Mauricio Pochettino in tournament knockout rounds for the United States men's national team when the Yanks face Costa Rica in a 2025 Gold Cup quarterfinal in Minneapolis on Sunday. Pochettino led the Yanks to the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals before they bowed out earlier this year, and he's engineered a near-perfect group stage at the Gold Cup. The USMNT have won all three of their matches, conceding a single goal to win Group D and set up a showdown with Costa Rica. Los Ticos were hard-luck runners-up in Group A, beating Dominican Republic and Suriname but drawing Mexico to finish behind El Tri on a single goal in goal differential. Led by former Mexico manager Miguel Herrera, Costa Rica should prove the toughest test of the tournament so far for the Yanks after Pochettino oversaw wins over Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti. It's been a breakout tournament for Malik Tillman, and the USMNT's midfield is deep and strong even without several key names. Tim Ream and Chris Richards have proven solid at the back, though Pochettino has to choose his man behind them. Los Ticos are a threat with 23-year-old Spartak Moscow star Manfred Ugalde leading the line, and he scored three goals in the group stage after leading the Russian top flight in goals this season. Young Rio Ave midfielder Brandon Aguilera has also been excellent on this stage, and Westerlo 20-year-old Josimer Alcocer has bagged a pair of goals. Questions were raised off three conceded goals to Suriname and another one to the Dominican Republic, but a nil-nil over 90 minutes against Mexico shows that Keylor Navas and his back line are no slouches. The Yanks are due for a scare, and Costa Rica are their toughest foe since the friendly losses to Turkiye and Switzerland. Keylor Navas was solid in a 0-0 draw against Mexico, but Los Ticos back line is not what it's been in the past. Herrera's tournament nous is a wild card here, but Pochettino has looked more and more comfortable with both his Best XI and this tournament. Should the USMNT be on upset alert?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All three Gotham FC call-ups made the USWNT Starting XI as Rose Lavelle returned to the lineup with a Player of the Match performance, and Lilly Reale earned her first cap. It was a dream night for Rose Lavelle, who made her return to the US women's national team on Thursday in Commerce City, CO. Defender Avery Patterson opened the scoring – with an assist from Lavelle – for her first international goal, followed shortly by a second goal from midfielder Sam Coffey. Gotham FC's Lilly Reale made her USWNT debut, along with Claudia Dickey and Jordyn Bugg. Both Reale and Dickey were in the Starting XI, providing a glimpse of US women's head coach Emma Hayes's vision for a new US national team following the departure of several veteran players. After nearly seven months out recovering from an ankle injury, Lavelle is officially back. Rose Lavelle scores for the USWNT | Courtesy NWSL "It feels really great," Lavelle said in a pre-match press conference. Lavelle is the 19th player in USWNT history to attain more than 25 goals and 25 assists. It's a moment of triumph for the Gotham midfielder as she continues to make her way back to regular play. There's something to be said about Hayes's vision for the USWNT squad. That's in stark contrast to national teams of the past. The intent is clear: Hayes is molding a team from the ground up, prioritizing youth and long-term development rather than a reliance on established veterans. Under Hayes, 17 players received USWNT call-ups for the first time. "One thing about the US is that we always have young talented players coming up, and I think you're seeing that now," Lavelle said before the game. Another is having her younger players continuously face high-level opponents to "determine if [they] are world-class." "I don't believe in perfection," Hayes said press conference prior to last night's friendly. Hayes's experiment paid off in last night's win, but only time will tell if her youthful squad can sustain their momentum. Lavelle, Reale, and defender Emily Sonnett started for the team in last night's game. Reale joined Bugg, Dickey, Izzy Rodriguez, Sam Meza, and Angelina Anderson in earning their first caps. The 21-year-old made her debut with a position in the starting lineup as a left-back, notching her first international goal contribution by providing an assist to Alyssa Thompson with a pass up the left flank. Alyssa Thompson scores on a Lilly Reale assist | Courtesy USWNT Sonnett made her 57th international start out of 109 caps, playing as a defensive center for all 90 minutes, while Lavelle made her first start since December 2024. Sonnett and Lavelle were one of three players older than 25 in the starting lineup, bringing World Cup and Olympic experience to a team with an average of 31.9 caps. "I have been one of the more experienced players now for a little bit," Lavelle said before the game. I always say I had a lot of really really great older players to look up to to help usher me into the position where I now can be that for the younger players." Veterans Rose Lavelle and Emily Sonnet will be joined by 21-year-old national team debutant Lilly Reale. A poacher's goal from Talia DellaPeruta in Target Stoppage Time seals the win for a US Women team that outclassed North Carolina Courage. The behind-the-scenes World Cup doc is a little light on fresh insights or revelatory footage. A struggling Montréal looks to bounce back from a 3-1 loss at home to Cincinnati on Wednesday by beating New York City FC for the second time this year — and log the first season sweep in club history. Four goals scored in 12 minutes by San Diego's Iloski in his first MLS start earned him our vote for Player of the Matchday. Longtime assistant Mehdi Ballouchy will take over as head coach for the June 28 game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past few years, women's sports have gained popularity. Now, the world's oldest sport is taking Colorado by storm. A new Nielsen Sports report shows that women's soccer is set to reach 800 million fans by 2030, which would make it the fifth largest sport in the world. On Thursday night, there was a glimpse of what that could look like as excitement erupted at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, as fans witnessed the best of the best in women's soccer take the pitch. While the U.S. Women's National Soccer team dominated 4-0 in Thursday night's international friendly against Ireland, it was more than just a game for glory for fans in attendance. "To not only inspire young generations, but to also remind all of us who are more adult and aged, that we can all be women who support women, that we can all be people who support women," said Erika. A visible fervor for women's soccer in the metro, the Denver NWSL President Jen Millet says, will soon translate into a permanent club presence in Colorado. "This is really where it started, where there was a group of fans, women's soccer fans in Colorado, that campaigned the NWSL to get a club here, and they succeeded," said Millet. "We talk a lot about women's sports being important for girls, but it is equally important for boys to see female athletes on the pitch competing at the highest level," said Millet. While every spectator had a different player, they were excited to see that it is the love for the game that continues to bond this soccer fan base. "I think it's really cool to see how much these women have bonded over the years, and how far women's sports has come," said Brower. As for next year's NWSL team in Denver, Millet says they plan to unveil a team name and logo in the coming months. Your Reporter Gabriela Vidal specializes in coverage of Adams County.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Before the U.S. Women's National Team beat Ireland 4-0 in front of thousands of fans at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park Thursday night, Denver7 spoke with several girls' soccer players from the Denver metro area who were in attendance. Denver7 spoke with several other young players inspired by the USWNT. “I'm a full-time goalkeeper, and I hope to play in college and then maybe extend my career farther than that,” said Lucy Crandall from Arvada. Friends and soccer players Maisie Tolle, Laine VanDyke and Emery Unruh also couldn't wait to get to the seats Thursday, arriving more than two hours early. “So it's really special that they're coming here, and I get the opportunity to watch them.” “I love how they're like role models for younger kids,” said Keira Butler, a high school sophomore who also plays soccer. Denver7 has covered the city's National Women's Soccer League team starting play next year, and what it will mean when it comes to financing a new stadium and how local businesses are hopeful for a boost. But for these young players, the new team has already made a difference. Butler said her family already has season tickets for the new squad. “I love that so much because I've been waiting for it for so long, and it's going to have more, even more people that we can actually connect with,” said Tolle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One side of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup knockout-round bracket looks significantly easier to manage than the other. Manchester City sits on the easier half of the draw, where Inter Milan, Chelsea and Benfica also reside. Erling Haaland and Co. have an easy round-of-16 match on paper with Al-Hilal. At minimum, City's knockout-round opener looks far easier than what Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Juventus have in store for them. PSG, Bayern, Real Madrid, Juve, Inter Miami, Monterrey, Flamengo and Borussia Dortmund reside on the bottom half of the bracket. Whichever team emerges from the bottom half will be battle-tested and potentially worn out, while Man City could cruise into the final. The available odds and Club World Cup futures can be found on DraftKings Sportsbook City has one of the best strikers in the world in Haaland plus a loaded attack around him that includes Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden and Savinho. City proved just how strong it can be against a top opponent during its 5-2 rout over Juventus to close out group play on Thursday. Man City is more than comfortable with playing Chelsea, Benfica or Inter Milan at any point of the competition, and if its attack is firing like it did against Juve, it will be hard to stop no matter the opponent. The bottom half of the bracket is a who's who of world club soccer powers, which makes that bracket more difficult to predict. PSG owns the easiest matchup on paper against Inter Miami, but the Major League Soccer side has Lionel Messi to its advantage. The Messi-Luis Suarez combination might at least make life difficult for the newly-crowned UEFA Champions League winner. Bayern-Flamengo, Real Madrid-Juventus and Dortmund-Monterrey are powerhouse matchups on paper. Do not be surprised if one, or both, of the German clubs fall in the round of 16. Real Madrid should pull away from Juventus, and you could make the case Los Blancos have a relatively easy path to the semifinals since it will be heavily favored against the Dortmund-Monterrey winner. Staying fresh in the American summer heat is a factor to longevity in the tournament as well. Man City and Real Madrid could be poised to rest their stars in second halves due to the stature of their matchups. PSG probably will not have that luxury because of the Messi matchup and a quarterfinal clash with either Flamengo or Bayern. A Man City-Real Madrid final might be boring because it's a matchup we see all the time in the UEFA Champions League, but that's what the bracket could produce.
