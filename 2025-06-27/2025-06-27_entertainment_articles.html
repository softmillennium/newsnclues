Gavin Newsom's plan to woo Hollywood productions back to their cultural home got the green light on Friday, with a budget bill that significantly auguments the state's entertainment tax credit program passing both houses in the state's legislature. Century-Old Hollywood Soundstage Complex Up for Sale at $45 Million Texas Makes Its Bid With Major Film Incentive Expansion Hollywood production advocates aren't breathing a sigh of relief yet, though: They are currently racing to implement programmatic changes to the tax credit program — which would bump the base credit to 35 percent — before a July 7 deadline. Other changes the legislation will realize include expanding the category of productions that qualify to include shorter TV shows, sitcoms, animated titles and “large-scale competition” shows, excluding reality, documentary programming and game or talk shows. It also ends a requirement for a separate incentive for the construction of soundstages requiring the recipient to own more than half of the stages or enter into a lease of at least 10 years. One example: Earlier this month, Texas passed a law that increases by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years. Currently, California is the only major production hub that bars any portion of above-the-line costs, like salaries for actors, directors and producers from qualifying for incentives. “The program not only pays for itself but generates economic activity,” said Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to Newsom, at the UCLA Entertainment Symposium on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: As Netflix gears up for the conclusion of its hit series Stranger Things later this year, Matt and Ross Duffer are eyeing their next project. Hilary Leavitt will also EP with the Duffers through their Upside Down Pictures. The crime-thriller centers on Babs Dionne, a proud Franco-American, doting grandmother, and vicious crime matriarch, who rules her small town of Waterville, Maine, with an iron fist. She controls the flow of drugs into Little Canada with the help of her loyal lieutenants, girlfriends since they were teenagers, and her eldest daughter, Lori, a Marine vet struggling with addiction. When a drug kingpin discovers that his numbers are down in the upper northeast, he sends a malevolent force, known only as The Man, to investigate. At the same time, Babs's youngest daughter, Sis, has gone missing, which doesn't seem at all like a coincidence. In twenty-four hours, Sis will be found dead, and the whole town will seek shelter from Babs's wrath. Father-Son Endurance Race Tandem 'Team Hoyt' Land Netflix Film; Nat Faxon & Jim Rash Direct, Kevin Walsh, Tom Brady & Gotham Chopra Produce The Penguin Random House title was released in late March and has made multiple Best of 2025 lists, including NPR, Amazon, Apple Books, The Guardian, and Barnes & Noble.

As a screenwriter, he worked most recently on the Apple TV+ series Extrapolations. Mohr has authored several books, including Damascus and Some Things that Meant the World to Me, and he's won the Northern California Book Award twice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. A lone woman is shopping in a crafts store, pushing her half-filled cart lackadaisically down an aisle lined with wooden birdhouses and wicker baskets, when she sniffs the air and stops. Looking up, she sees a curtain of smoke rising toward the rafters. Related Stories ‘Afternoons of Solitude' Review: The World's Greatest Bullfighter Struts His Stuff in Albert Serra's Ballsy and Transfixing Documentary ‘The Comeback' Is Back: Lisa Kudrow Comedy to Return for Long-Awaited Third Season When the woman escapes, stumbling into a door that explodes the second she pushes through it, there's a sense of relief. As she stands there staring at it, too horrified to move another inch, the smoke now rises from her. This scene, from the premiere episode of Dennis Lehane's new Apple series, “Smoke,” is one of the most upsetting in recent memory. The grounded set-up turns into a living nightmare with such harrowing speed that it almost feels cruel when her shocking survival plays out like a bait and switch: She survived the fire, sure, but her anguish is just beginning. The body horror aspect is disgusting enough by itself — I have not, nor will I ever see “The Substance” — but it's the blink-of-an-eye contrast between carrying out a boring daily chore and having the rest of your life ruined that really sticks. But when I looked back on the scene after seeing all nine wild episodes of “Smoke,” it's clear this moment is designed for more than shock value. Not that “Smoke” is about to flip into a full-on horror show (it doesn't), but that the series is operating in a pulpier, more sensationalized mode than Lehane's previous collaboration with Taron Egerton, “Black Bird.” While examining similar issues through a similar dual-portrait dynamic, “Smoke” isn't the solemn, serious drama series it first presents itself to be. It's straight-up sicko shit, and it drops just enough clues to signal the turn before shedding its refined, respectable skin. Inspired by true events but very much its own thing, “Smoke” starts with a self-edit. Dave Gudsen (Taron Egerton) is trying to describe his infatuation with fire, and he can't get it right. “Every fire starts small,” he narrates, before cutting himself off and starting over. Eventually, he settles on a simple question: “Who would you be in a fire?” When it comes to Dave, the answer is simple: He sees himself as a the hero. Chief of which is the fact that he's been chasing not one, but two serial fire-starters for over a year with zero leads. All they have to go on is how each arsonist goes about burning things down. The one they call “Divide and Conquer,” or “D&C,” likes to start a small fire in one location while setting another fire on a time delay at a second location in order to spread the firefighters thin, making it harder to control the second, bigger blaze. To help out, the police send over a troubled (or troublesome?) Calderone is a Marine who trains hard every morning and renovates her house with a sledgehammer most nights. She can go drink for drink with anyone, and she has no problem meeting Dave's early challenges, whether he's pushing her to give up details about her personal life or questioning her ability to tail a suspect. The two form a familiar partnership, and for its two-part premiere, “Smoke” wants you to think it's going to be a fairly routine mystery-thriller where Dave and Michelle run through fire to catch the uncatchable bad guys. But, well, there are these nagging curiosities that don't seem to fit. There's Freddie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine), a fast-food worker at a chicken shack whose scenes don't seem to connect with the others. And then there's the little embarrassing details about Dave that don't fit with the heroic image he paints for himself. He can't keep up with Calderon, a true badass, while on the clock, and he can't get it up with his wife while off of it. When we find out he doesn't show up for department-wide celebrations — the kind of bar-closing nights out he loves to conduct on his own terms — it's clear there's more to Dave than the vision he has for himself, and once “Smoke” kicks down the trap door he's hiding behind, the explosions just keep coming. Not all of them burn with equal brightness, and there are a number of moments where the series feels like it takes things too far, whether it's in the minor details or major plot twists. Egerton chews up the scenery in ways he's rarely been allowed to do. Smollett is, once again, pure dynamite, Mwine handles a tricky part with grace and vibrance, and the supporting cast — which comes to include John Leguizamo as a sleazebag with a heart of gold, Greg Kinnear as the kind but conflicted captain, and Rafe Spall as the exact opposite role from his other Apple show, “Trying” — is uniformly strong. Premiere director Kari Skogland (“The Handmaid's Tale”) sets a visual template that's crystal clear, never allowing the dark subject matter or environments cloud what's going on, and Thom Yorke's original song over the opening credits sets an eerie tone that becomes a sturdy backbone amid the madness. Best of all, as Lehane is wont to do, the roaring excitement carrying episodes forward is laced with an unmistakable critique of misguided masculinity, especially as it applies to a world becoming more and more accepting of self-delusion. “Smoke” premieres Friday, June 27 with two episodes on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale (Episode 9) on Friday, August 15. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Nat Faxon & Jim Rash have been set by Netflix to direct Team Hoyt, based on the true story of how Dick Hoyt turned himself into a triathlete and marathoner so he could lug with him son Rick—a non-verbal quadriplegic whose strength and spirit helped galvanize a movement. Dick and Rick became an iconic father-son racing team, with Dick pushing and pulling his son through more than a thousand endurance events, including 32 Boston Marathons and six Ironman Triathlons. Off the course, Judy Hoyt carried the baton for inclusive education, playing a pivotal role in drafting Chapter 766—the groundbreaking Massachusetts law that became a model for federal special education legislation. 'Squid Game' Ends Its Three-Season Run With Surprise Oscar Winner Cameo The film will be produced by Kevin Walsh's The Walsh Company, Gotham Chopra's Religion of Sports, Ryan Stowell, and NFL icon Tom Brady, latter of whom hatched Religion of Sports with Chopra and another gridiron great, Michael Strahan. Russell Hoyt will co-produce in collaboration with the Hoyt family estate, honoring Rick and Dick's legacy in the racing and disabled people's community. Dick's completely Boston-flavored speaking voice probably also appealed to the New England Patriots legend QB. If you have a beating heart, you'd be hard pressed to hold back the waterworks watching footage of the bond that developed between a non-athletic father and his son, a young man robbed of mobility and the ability to speak when his umbilical cord strangled him in the womb. Dick got himself off the couch, worked his way into shape, and found that his son enjoyed being part of the race, where they motivated one another. The script was written by Grant Thompson (McFarland, USA). They won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2012 for The Descendants, directed by Alexander Payne and starring George Clooney and Shailene Woodley. Walsh (The Instigators), is repped by WME and Johnson, Shapiro, Slewett & Kole. Chopra and Brady's Religion of Sports, which has done acclaimed docuseries on Aaron Rodgers, Serena Williams, Simone Biles and Kobe Bryant, is repped by WME, as is Brady along with Latham & Watkins.

The first few pictures show Perry excitedly posing with a small marsupial, which she name drops in her caption: “mood: Quokka,” she wrote. Other clips show Perry and her team boating out to Rottnest Island, a place that Perry declares she and her crew's “brain rot can run free.” In a final clip, fans can see Perry playing a card game with her crew as she slams her cards down on the table and declares, “I won!” 1 & 2 Reasons That the Hot 100 Has Been Historic This Month The latest snaps and clips come as multiple outlets confirmed that Perry and her partner of nine years have split up. Rumors had circulated for a few weeks claiming that the couple was struggling in their relationship. Stateside shows kick off on July 10 in Denver, and will see Perry travel to cities including San Francisco, Seattle, Detroit, Boston and New York City before closing her U.S. run in Miami on Aug. 23.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lopez got his fans' attention on Thursday, June 26, when he posted a throwback photo of himself and Taylor Swift on Instagram. A post shared by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez) The photo on Instagram shows Lopez smiling while looking at Swift, but it was his caption that had fans reacting. “I was looking at ⁦@TaylorSwift like I look at tacos… Luckily she's always a sweetheart & good sport 🙂 #TBT #TaylorSwift,” he wrote. “Mario what is this caption?” a fan questioned. Other reactions include, “I think you wanted to borrow her hat,” “Truly absolute legends,” and “Let me call Kelce real quick.” The last comment is about Swift's boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce. A post shared by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez) Fans of Lopez and Swift will know this is not the first time he has posted a photo of her on social media. On July 28, 2022, he posted another throwback photo of himself and Swift. Lopez has made no secret of his admiration for Swift, and he has previously praised her personality and success. I've gotten to interview her a bunch of times. Lopez has also commented on Swift and her relationship with Harry Styles. In 2012, Lopez said on his radio show “104.3 MyFM” that he had seen Swift and Styles together at her “The X Factor” rehearsal, USA Today reports. “Taylor Swift was the special guest performer, and a little inside scoop for you: During rehearsals, Harry from One Direction came and slapped me on the back and said, ‘Hey, Mario, how ya doing? “And I said, ‘What are you doing here?' And he sort of [pointed] toward Taylor.” Lopez then confirmed that they left the rehearsal “hand in hand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a radio interview Thursday, New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand appeared to suggest that Zohran Mamdani had condoned “global jihad.” Her office tells Rolling Stone she “misspoke,” as she responded to a caller who provided a lengthy list of claims against Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday. Gillibrand probably should have stopped the caller right there — she could have said there is no evidence that Mamdani poses any threat to the Jewish community. But Gillibrand didn't do that, and the caller, Gabe, went on: “There was a bill that I was reading about that unfortunately, he wants to target synagogues and Jewish institutions which donate to nonprofits which are medical institutions like United Hatzalah and Magan Davod David Adam, which is like the Jewish Red Cross.” Gabe continued: “How do we make sure that Jewish institutions are protected from his plans to punish and fine our institutions which fundraise the medical non-profits, which do work both here in the United States and in Israel and other countries in the world? And also, how can we hold Mr. Mamdani accountable for his glorifying association of Hamas and other terror bombings of the Intifada in 1990s, where over 1,000 Jewish Israelis were killed, to his revisionist Holocaust knowledge, to the Warsaw ghetto uprising where Jews were mass exterminated and faced threats. The show's host, beloved New York icon Brian Lehrer, immediately broke in with a disclaimer: “There's a lot in there, senator, some of which may be inaccurate. Lehrer went on: “But do you know any of that to be inaccurate or accurate, including the original premise that he would somehow target synagogues, if they were contributing to groups like Hatsala Ambulance Services in a way that he could hurt the synagogues? I just don't want to give out information that's false, but I also don't want to shrink from information that's true.” They are alarmed by past positions — particularly references to global jihad.” Lehrer was soon forced to clarify, live on air, “On Mamdani, I just feel compelled to say, we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or supported violent jihad,” asking Sen. Gillibrand: “Can you?” Laura Loomer Demands Trump Charge Mamdani Over Made-Up Terrorism Claim “Senator Gillibrand misspoke in that instance as she sought to address the caller's assertions. Lukaske added, “She also highlighted that Mr. Mamdani assured her he would protect Jews and all residents of New York City, if elected.” : Ending New York funding of Israeli settler violence act,” which was introduced in 2023. Mamdani was a sponsor of the bill, which sought to prevent tax-exempt nonprofits “from engaging in unauthorized support of Israeli settlement activity.” Israeli settler violence, particularly in the occupied West Bank, has increased in recent years, and a number of people have been injured and killed — including multiple Americans — as tensions have risen in the area. “Funding war crimes is not a charitable purpose,” Mamdani said at the time, adding that many of the charities in question were “openly fundraising for that very activity.” Once best known as a fierce and outspoken advocate for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, Gillibrand was among the number of Democratic lawmakers who called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after at least 13 women accused the former governor of sexual misconduct. One woman who was targeted by Cuomo after speaking out about his behavior told Rolling Stone what a bitter disappointment it was to hear Gillibrand, whom she says had called her personally to convey her support. “An equal treatment of women has been a core issue for you.

We never see them for ourselves, but they're all that his crew of hypemen can talk about. “Such great balls!,” a member of Roca's entourage insists. “Your balls are bigger than the whole fucking arena!,” another concurs. The dominant subject of conversation in a documentary where almost nothing else is ever discussed, the size of Roca's nuts is remarked upon so often — and with such grim sobriety — throughout Albert Serra's transfixing “Afternoons of Solitude” that I started to worry if the world's greatest torero might have a serious medical condition of some kind. Related Stories Matt Reeves Shares Photo of Script for ‘The Batman Part II' ‘Smoke' Review: Taron Egerton's Apple Series Is a Sicko Pulp Thriller Driven by Dark Truths Where Roca was born, why he committed his life to the performative slaughter of horned cattle, and what he does with his time outside of the bullring are just a few of the many basic facts that “Afternoons of Solitude” elides in their entirety; if not for the opening title card that announces him as the movie's star, we might not even know his name. Has he ever felt a moment of pity for the animals who are only bred so that he can stab them to death for a cheap thrill? Serra estimates that he shot roughly 600 hours of footage in order to cut together this 120-minute documentary, and yet it's fair to assume that none of his rushes even hinted at the answers to those questions. Like the most resonant of Serra's fiction works (namely, “Liberté” and “Pacifiction”), the Catalan director's first documentary is set in a pocket universe too insular and solipsistic to care if it's shrinking — a liminal space that pathologically obeys its own logic as a form of self-protection against the threat of obsolescence. This is a film defined by a tunnel vision so intense that we seldom even see the crowds that come to Roca's events, as the torero's audience is reduced to abstraction over the soundtrack, their voices heard cheering and jeering him on like an ego at war with itself. Indeed, “Afternoons of Solitude” doesn't tell us a single thing about the waning popularity of bullfights, nor does it include any explicit comment on the pre-Roman custom's struggle to survive in a world more sensitive to animal cruelty. On the contrary, Serra's ambivalent long shots — zoomed in from afar to offset the film's in-your-face intensity with an equally palpable sense of distance — build on themselves to create a perspective on the practice unlike any that have been captured on camera before in movies like Rouben Mamoulian's “Blood and Sand” and Francesco Rosi's “The Moment of Truth.” It's a guy dressed in sequins mugging at an animal that's covered in its own blood; it's the naked reality of a dance between man and beast, for all of the danger, excitement, cruelty, and embarrassment that match-up provides. Serra's approach is especially rewarding because the conclusions it encourages you to draw are ultimately just as irrelevant as the ones that he arrived at himself. Some might come away from this movie with a newfound respect for the monastic focus required of the world's remaining toreros, while others might laugh at the not so latent homoeroticism that allows Roca to feel like a man among men (see: the part where one of Roca's crew members is forced to hoist the boss into his skin-tight traje de luces, or “suit of lights”), or find themselves re-enraged by the slaughter of animals for sport. Whatever your own reaction, the open-ended nature of Serra's approach flies in the face of what people have been conditioned to expect from today's non-fiction cinema, much of which exists to challenge the audience for their provincialism while flattering them for their empathy. And while I tend to suspect that Serra had to stifle a few smirks behind the camera (“What you did today is not attainable by others nowadays,” one of Roca's hype men says to the torero after he and his team of sequined performers ganged up to stab a confused animal, “it causes envy among the mediocre, and that is why some spurn you”), “Afternoons of Solitude” is less concerned with the judgment we pass on its subject than it is with the judgment its subject refuses to pass on himself. The film's poise and structure create a perfect vacuum of self-reflection. “You killed those two bulls so truthfully,” Roca is assured, but the “truth” of those deaths is only maintained by the ritual and pageantry of staging them. For Roca to question why he does this for a living would be a fatal blow to the reality that he must (a reality that falls apart in the one scene without him in it, during which his distressed crew openly discusses their helplessness in preventing him from being gored). I don't mean to be skeptical towards the size of his balls, which I'm assured are large enough to have their own magnetic fields, but it's possible that the undeniable fearlessness Roca displays in the bullring stems from the mortal terror he feels at having to prove — or even know — himself in an environment of any other kind. “Afternoons of Solitude” is now playing in select theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Formula One movie, directed by Joseph Kosinski of Top Gun: Maverick fame, has already banked a hefty $10 million in previews at the domestic box office before officially opening everywhere Friday. The film has a huge advantage in having a lock on Imax screens for three weeks, in addition to playing other premium large-format screens, including Dolby Cinema, for part of that time. One major caveat: the movie sports a hefty production budget of at least $200 million before marketing. How 'M3GAN 2.0' Star Violet McGraw Kicked Off a Wave of Good Fortune for Blumhouse F1, starring Brad Pitt opposite Damson Idris, is a seminal moment for Apple as it tries to jump-start its theatrical ambitions after getting driven off the road with box office misses Killers of the Flower Moon, from Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. In Kosinski's film, Pitt plays an injured former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to team up with a younger driver, played by Idris. Taking on Formula One is a bold move since it has never been the marquee sport in the U.S. that it is overseas (top Apple exec Eddy Cue is a lifelong fan and sits on the board of Ferrari NV). F1‘s preview gross is well ahead of racing pic Ford v. Ferrari, a biographical action drama set against the backdrop of Europe's famous Le Mans endurance contest. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that film earned $2.1 in previews on its way to a decent three-day opening of $3 million in North America. F1 will run laps around Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's M3GAN 2.0, which earned $1.5 million in Thursday previews. Jason Blum‘s Blumhouse and James Wan's Atomic Monster reteamed to make the follow-up, which launches amid a saturated market for horror fare. Nevertheless, pundits say the sequel is all but guaranteed to be a profitable piece of business, considering the budget was a scant $15 million. Universal believes the movie will serve as counter-programming for younger women who have no interested in F1. M3GAN 2.0 is set two years after the AI doll went on a murder spree to protect her young human charge (Violet McGraw) and was subsequently shelved. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returned to direct the sequel from a story he wrote alongside Akela Cooper, and based on characters created by Cooper and James Wan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The North American leg grossed more than $250 million — and it's only halfway done. On June 18, Kendrick Lamar and SZA wrapped the North American leg of their co-billed Grand National Tour. That makes it the highest grossing reported co-headline tour ever. It's a narrow victory, surpassing Beyoncé and Jay-Z's On the Run II Tour (2018) by less than $3 million, or just 1%. While Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour still looms in the distance among the highest grossing tours by R&B artists ($579.8 million), Lamar now has the biggest stadium tour ever among rappers. The Grand National Tour kicked off on April 19 in Minneapolis and then hit 18 more cities in the United States and Canada. On May 21, 23 and 24, the Grand National Tour grossed a collective $40.4 million from 147,000 tickets. The June 4 show in SZA's hometown of St. Louis (The Dome at America's Center) was just as well attended as any of the L.A. dates (48,600) on a gross of $8.8 million. But beyond the simple math of combining these rap and R&B superstars, both acts are riding buzzing momentum. Add to that, both shared the stage during the Super Bowl LIX halftime show following Grammy wins for 2024 hits “Not Like Us” and “Saturn.” Lamar and SZA will kick off the tour's European leg on July 2 in Cologne, Germany. It's the first of 16 shows, including double-headers in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Then, they hit Latin America for five dates before two nights in Australia December, when the tour will hit Sydney and Melbourne. Both artists are bigger earners in the U.S. than overseas, which is to be expected for any American act, especially in hip-hop. Still, a 15%-20% dip in nightly grosses in Australia and a 35% drop-off in Europe and Latin America would put the Grand National Tour on track for a $400 million finish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kurt Vile has announced a new EP that he made with Nashville songwriter Luke Roberts. The new five-track release, Classic Love, is out July 25 via Verve. “I always thought ‘Classic Love' was the epitome of a song that belonged on the radio,” Vile said in a press statement. “When I heard Luke and Kyle [Spence]'s recording of this (they even got Kyle's old Harvey Milk bandmate, Creston Spiers, to play some on it) it just floored me: Like, this could be old or new, just a timeless track.… I figured the best way I could help it reach the masses was to just get myself up in that track as well and move 'er through the KV / Verve machine. I believe in Luke so much, and, yeah, this song in general has been my and Kyle's religion for some time. Now it can be immortalized in the canon of classic songs!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But as a new piece from The Hollywood Reporter points out, some of Derek Dixon's claims—like the fact that he didn't report the accusation because Perry's studio supposedly doesn't have an HR department—echo criticisms of Perry that have been floating around for a while. THR explores the workplace Perry has cultivated, from multiple copyright infringement claims to repeated clashes with unions (for instance, he's still on Equity's Do Not Work list after casting only non-union actors in his 2018 stage play Madea On The Run). His latest release, the Taraji P. Henson vehicle Straw, was reportedly shot in just four days (A Fall From Grace was shot in five). Then on a [TV] show, it would be 25 pages.” Another insider described the pace as “insane,” recalling shooting days THR calls “long and punishing even by industry standards.” Entertainment labor scholar Kate Fortmueller (a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, where Tyler Perry Studios is based) said that Perry's productions are known locally as “a closed universe. You don't bounce from there to Stranger Things—or the reverse. The universe is only likely to get smaller, as Perry has stated an interest in technology like generative AI that would help him eliminate even more production costs. He's already begun using AI to save him “hours” of time in the makeup chair (and presumably, paying a makeup artist), and even paused an $800 million expansion of his studio in the hopes that AI tools will make the need for those practical spaces irrelevant. Yet he's seemingly able to accomplish this by eschewing collaborations with other writers and running production below typical industry standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soldiers in the Israeli military have told the Israeli news outlet Haaretz that aid distribution centers in Gaza have become “a killing field,” with military leadership ordering soldiers to fire on unarmed Palestinians. Massacres at aid distribution sites have become a common occurrence in recent weeks as the Israeli military ever so slightly loosened its blockade against humanitarian aid into Gaza, and tasked itself with  aid management under the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, estimates that 549 have been killed and several thousands injured near aid sites since late May, when the foundation first began operations. The United Nations estimated that least 410 had been killed at aid sites over a similar time frame. “They're treated like a hostile force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Another enlisted officer acting as security for a GHF aid center said that “it's neither ethically nor morally acceptable for people to have to reach, or fail to reach, a [humanitarian zone] under tank fire, snipers and mortar shells.” But as the over 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza become increasingly desperate for life-sustaining resources, their efforts to secure what limited amounts of food they can are being met with gunfire. “Firing mortars to keep hungry people away is neither professional nor humane. “This is Vach's policy,” they said, “but many of the commanders and soldiers accepted it without question. [The Palestinians] are not supposed to be there, so the idea is to make sure they clear out, even if they're just there for food.” Another soldier, a tank operator, told the publication that while technically tank fire was supposed to be used as a warning, “firing shells has just become standard practice. Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths, and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there's never a good answer.

What concerns everyone is whether it'll hurt our legitimacy to keep operating in Gaza. No one stops to ask why dozens of civilians looking for food are being killed every day.” Trump Admin Plans to Re-Deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia as Criminal Case Falters Trump and Hegseth Are Melting Down Over Leaked Iran Strike Intel Liver King Will Undergo Mental Health Evaluation, Faces Restraining Order After Joe Rogan Arrest The truth is, most people don't even stop to think about it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For its second outing, The Golden Bachelor revealed it would be skewing a little younger than 72-year-old Gerry Turner, selecting 66-year-old former NFL linebacker Mel Owens for its title role. And then younger still for its contestants—at least, if Owens had his wishes, according to a podcast interview he gave earlier this month. After having finally gotten the gig, producers on the series asked Owens—who, we'd like to reiterate, is 66 years old—what his “preferences” for candidates would be, and he made it clear he was looking to TV-date women between 45 and 60. (“Just being honest.”) Owens said he later doubled down on this stance in conversations with the show's executive producers, despite reassurances that all the women selected for him would be “hot.” “I”—the “I” in question being Mel Owens, a man 66 years of age—”said, ‘If they're 60 or over, I'm cutting them. Owens, 66, said producers did push back against this take, reminding him, “This is not The Silver Bachelor, it's The Golden Bachelor.” (They also apparently weren't wild about him using football terminology like “cut” to describe sending his fellow sexagenarians home.) Talking in the interview, Owens went on to describe his ideal woman, saying she's a “lifetime learner” (aw!) So, yeah: Mel Owens, our new Golden Bachelor, saying the quiet part extremely loud.
