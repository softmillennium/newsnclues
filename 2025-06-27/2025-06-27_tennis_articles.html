                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From a record attendance exhibition match in Africa to a money-spinning streaming show in Las Vegas, modern tennis might be expanding its horizon. When the freshly cut green of the 1868-founded All England Club meets its sternest test of modern day battle-hardened baseliners. When players trade the flashy outfits for crisp whites. And when a gush of nostalgia hits Indian tennis, awakening a sport currently in slumber of its more stellar past. It's here that a teenager made the world sit up and take notice by reaching the singles quarter-final. It's here that a fire-and-ice doubles combination blazed through the men's championship. It's here that a trailblazing woman left her mark on the hallowed Centre Court as a doubles champion. And yet, it is here, at the SW19, that India will not have a player in the main single's draw this year. And even in the juniors championships, it has been 10 years since an Indian boy or girl claimed the title. Once, generational greats — from Ramanathan Krishnan, to Ramesh Krishnan and Vijay Amritraj, to Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza — carried India's flag at Wimbledon, and all of them left a mark at what many call the mecca of tennis. Today, that flag is left without a worthy bearer. “Most academies and clubs, especially in India, have a lot more hard courts now,” Yuki Bhambri, India's former top 100 in singles and current doubles world no. The grass courts at Wimbledon have changed too and are a lot slower, which only adds to the challenge.” In 1947, Sumant Misra won his first two singles matches and also made the doubles quarter-finals. India's flavour, though, truly and richly blended on those grass courts in 1954, when Ramanathan Krishnan captured the boys' singles title. In 1961, Ramanathan produced one of the most memorable results by defeating Australian Roy Emerson, a 12-time Grand Slam singles champion, in the quarter-final. The legendary Rod Laver up next would prove a bridge too far. Not least his son Ramesh, who also won the Wimbledon junior singles title in 1979 and, seven years later as a pro, reached the quarter-final. “I grew up with the aura of Wimbledon all around, and with my father's achievements there in the background. So, very early on, I learnt about the importance of Wimbledon,” Ramesh said over phone. “It was 50 years ago that I made my first visit to SW19. I also remember watching the great Ken Rosewall play at Wimbledon. Flaunting a big serve and a style that suited grass, Amritraj motored along the draw and into the last eight in 1973. Amritraj would repeat the run in 1981, only to be stalled by Jimmy Connors. India's Wimbledon momentum was picked up again in the next decade by two doubles stars who came together to form one sparkling combination. Coming fresh off their doubles triumph on Parisian clay, the Indian duo also lit up the grass courts of London with their contrasting games and personalities. Bhupathi bagged two more titles there in mixed doubles. Sania, the only Indian woman to make Slam runs a routine in singles and then doubles, also had Hingis for company for among her most cherished moments — lifting the 2015 women's doubles Wimbledon title. Sania and Paes lifting trophies there a decade back is, incidentally, the last time any Indian did that at Wimbledon. Almost fitting, thus, is Ramesh's fondest Wimbledon story from his playing days and Indian tennis' heydays: “We had reached Southfields tube station and asked someone, “How do we get to Wimbledon?” And he answered, “Practice, mate, practice”.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We talk about players coming into events with momentum. Well, here comes an entire sport, thundering into the year's third major with all that propulsive energy. Three weeks ago, tennis wrapped up a sensational Roland Garros—featuring No. 2 in both finals, no real controversies, emerging stars, veterans hanging on and a generationally spellbinding last match. Wimbledon 2025 kicks off Monday morning at the All England Club, all bangers and mash. Will Carlos Alcaraz defend his title and win a third straight, something neither Serena Williams nor Novak Djokovic ever did? Will Jannik Sinner avenge his defeat from the jaws of victory at the French Open? But first, our men's seed report: (And lost to the indomitable Alexander Bublik heading into Wimbledon.) The half-full outlook: In just his third tournament of the year, Sinner came within a point of winning. He has won half of the past six majors held. And we know his game translates fine to grass. Coming off his exhilarating title in Paris, and then a fine showing at Queen's Club, he now goes for his third consecutive Wimbledon (and fourth straight tournament) title. He'll be the center of attention. It doesn't take much to rewrite a script and reset a reputation—21 sets, in fact. But there's a hard-to-shake feeling that the window is closing fast on that elusive major for Zverev. (This is the rare German who's better on clay than grass.) The game is there, more an issue of handling the moment and not letting nerves affect him physically, which—by Draper's own admission—has been a challenge in the past. Other players will get $4.1 million or so for winning. A handsome, young, charismatic, homegrown champ? But he's on the grass and snapping back, winning in Stuttgart and looking closer to 100% physically. While it was hard to ignore his poignant departure from Roland Garros and wonder how long the show continues, the truth is that he has a better shot of winning major No. Djokovic came within a match of winning Wimbledon in 2023 and '24. One wishes he were a bit more durable, but he is now at a career high ranking. One hopes there are no ill effects from the groin injury that caused him to retire from the French semifinals. His game is built for grass, and Rune has won seven of his past nine matches at the All England Club. Is it folly to take a player seriously based on one point? (Less optimistically, he's still too prone to tapping out on days he gets frustrated, especially against lower-tier opposition.) Medvedev has shown some signs of life on grass, but it's been a rough few years for an exceedingly capable player. Wimbledon semifinal runs in 2023 and '24 bode well, but the GPS coordinates on his brain tennis can vary greatly. The lefty serve should, alone, make him worthy of a second week appearance. He played well here in 2024 (before encountering Sinner), and I wouldn't read too much into his tune-up defeats. And he's a fastest-man-in-the-sport candidate, which helps on grass. But De Minaur's modest weaponry will always be a concern. Tiafoe is coming off a strong Roland Garros run (quarterfinals), and his game translates well to grass, even on the forehand side which requires more time. He takes a lot of losses week-to-week, but he comes to play at the big events. You wonder about his health first and foremost, specifically the abdominal injury that hampered his (nonetheless successful) Roland Garros. And here's a weird fact: At 28, he's only played Wimbledon three times. Sadly, one wonders if this is a mere slump or if Rublev, 27, is a declining asset. He was a first-round loser here in 2024. Menšík sneaks into the top 16 with Arthur Fils's withdrawal. Typically, Czech flat hitting can translate to grass. But he doesn't have a lot of experience on the surface and had a tempestuous early round loss at Queen's Cup. A first round loser in Paris, Cerundolo heads to a major where he's won one match for his career. Let's go out of order to highlight one of the hottest players … who might be at his best on grass. You know who is thrilled to see him seeded? Keep your eyes on this sneaky good grass court player. He is dangerous at full health, but that's seldom the case. Credit Dimitrov for remaining this relevant at 34 years old. Wow, is that a big number next to his name. He heads to the All England Club with coach Goran, a former Wimbledon champ, in his box. Health is always a concern with Berrettini. Any player 6'6" and above: Reilly Opelka, Gio Mpetshi Perricard (a Week 2 player in 2024 who barely missed a seeded slot) and Gabriel Diallo, the hard-serving Canadian just won Hertogenbosch. What nightmare early opponents, especially on grass. Zizou Bergs: He's coming off a career high ranking (No. 49) after reaching the final in Hertogenbosch. Though given the EKG movements of his career, who knows? João Fonseca: Playing his first Wimbledon. Not exactly from a grass court hotbed … but covering our bases all the same.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis' oldest tournament gets a couple of significant updates this year. Proceedings will be judged by an automated electronic system, rather than historically dapper humans, and the traditional 2 p.m. start time for the men's and women's singles finals will be pushed back two hours to maximize viewership. Here's all you need to know for the early action. Sinner and Alcaraz produced an all-timer at the last major. What could possibly be on tap for the follow up? Predictably, the world's top duo are favored to reach the July 13 men's final, followed by Djokovic and then British breakout Jack Draper. Playing in his home country at the age of 23, Draper was expected to advance far into this tourney. He won it all at Indian Wells in March, and his No. 4 Wimbledon seeding allows him to avoid Sinner and Alcaraz until at least the semis, but the draw has handed him a tough path. The women's game is headlined by Sabalenka and Gauff, who are coming off their duel in the French Open final. 2 women's title match at Roland Garros in 12 years, and Gauff's triumph made her the first American champion since Serena Williams in 2015. Sabalenka withdrew from last year's Wimbledon due to a unfortunate shoulder injury. Barbora Krejčíková of Czechia is the incumbent Wimbledon champ, notching her second Grand Slam title as a stunning 31st seed last year. She defeated seventh-seeded Italian Jasmine Paolini in three sets. 17 in the WTA rankings; Paolini is up to fourth. Singles play begins Monday, while the doubles bracket gets going on Wednesday and Thursday.

Credit: AP LONDON — Just in case anyone might have wondered whether there was any lingering animosity between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka after their French Open final, the two tennis stars offered proof that all is well by dancing together at Wimbledon on Friday and posting videos on social media. “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together,” Sabalenka wrote on her Instagram feed below a clip of the duo showing off their moves on the Centre Court grass to the strains of the 1990 hit “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory. Gauff wrote: “the olive branch was extended and accepted! we're good so you guys should be too.” 2-ranked Gauff held a practice session together at Centre Court ahead of the year's third Grand Slam tournament, which begins on Monday. Afterward, Sabalenka drew criticism from some for saying Gauff “won the match not because she played incredible; just because I made all of those mistakes from ... easy balls.” Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, right, and Coco Gauff of United States dance during a practice session ahead of the Wimbledon Championships in London, Friday, June 27, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend John McEnroe created a big stir when he suggested Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could have beaten a prime Rafael Nadal at the French Open, but Stefanos Tsitsipas has suggested that comment was not misplaced. McEnroe admiration for Alcaraz and Sinner saw him claim the duo may have had a chance to dethrone the 14-time Roland Garros champion on a court he made his own, in comments that sparked a huge debate among tennis fans. “You would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best,” the American said on TNT Sports. “The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.” Yet the idea that Nadal's Roland Garros levels have already been bettered by the players currently holding the top two positions in men's tennis is hard to imagine when we are talking about a player who has a statue to mark his greatness at the Paris venue. Patrick Mouratoglou issues verdict on whether Alcaraz or Sinner would beat Nadal at his peak John McEnroe offers an intriguing take as he answers Carlos Alcaraz question Several leading names have dismissed McEnroe's comments, but former French Open finalist Tsitsipas has told Tennis365 that they carry plenty of weight. Having played against Nadal, Alcaraz and Sinner on clay court, the Greek star is in a great position to evaluate McEnroe's statement and his verdict may be seen as a surprise. “I have played both of them,” Tsitsipas told Tennis365 as he spoke about Alcaraz and Sinner. “Both of them are great ball strikers, both on clay and hard, but I would favour, as a creative player more, more of a creative player on clay, I would favour Carlos. And I would favour obviously Sinner on hard courts. I'm not saying he would have beaten him, but he would have had chances to create something special against him.” “It's not annoying that these two guys are playing so well,” he added. I'm telling you, in the next five years, we'll see more superstars enter the game and more players that have a different identity from those that are playing now.” Mats Wilander has compared Carlos Alcaraz to grass court king Roger Federer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian Open winner is ready for another tilt at Wimbledon after her injury heartbreak in last year's tournament Before she won her first grand slam tournament at the Australian Open in January, Madison Keys had spent more than a year talking to a therapist about her life rather than just her tennis career. “So being able to talk to someone about broader life philosophies helped me get to the root of why I was feeling that way instead of just being uber-focused on decisive moments in a match.” The 30-year-old American, who is ready for another tilt at Wimbledon, remembers some of the wayward suggestions that specialist sports psychiatrists would advise her to follow at crucial stages of a match. “It would be, like: ‘Make sure you look at your strings and do this specific thing and that'll just help the nerves go away. Keys pauses when I ask if it was hard to open up to a stranger about her deeper and usually more hidden emotions during a therapy session. Those are the kind of things that live in the back of your head you don't ever really pay attention to.” She still talks to the same therapist and says: “One of the biggest things I've learned about myself is that, because of our sport, and our constant striving to be better, there's always something else [to do]. You just put your head down and keep going into the next thing. The best tennis players are so consumed by their careers, and life on tour, that it often seems as if their true selves, as people, are forgotten. “The hardest part about focusing on your mental health is that you've never done it [completely]. Keys faced a difficult draw in Melbourne and had to win five three-set matches, beating four opponents in the top 10, including Iga Swiatek, world No 2 at the time, in an epic semi-final, and then the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka. “I was so focused and never got ahead of myself. Playing all these hard matches against top players really allowed me to focus and keep persevering. Eight years had passed since her only previous slam final when, at the 2017 US Open, she was crushed 6-3, 6-0 by her friend Sloane Stephens. The pressure of the occasion had been too much against Stephens and, in Melbourne, Keys said: “I've obviously thought of that match endlessly for the past eight years.” So, did her recent therapy help in those clutch moments of her first slam victory? “I was able to force myself to be a little braver in those moments instead of being careful and tentative, and just go for it. “I don't know if that was the exact moment, but obviously it was a tough loss,” Keys says of what prompted her to seek therapy. Keys also switched from using a Wilson racket to the larger Yonex and she tweaked her serve, but she admits that, apart from working on her mind, the most positive change in the past two years has been the appointment of her husband, Bjorn Fratangelo, as her coach. “At the time it was supposed to be short term but then we immediately had success. I think the biggest hurdle for him was being comfortable in telling me what to do. Coupled with the fact that we obviously know each other very well and know how to communicate, he's able to see some things that I'm not seeing on the court. He then communicates in a way that I can actually do it.” Sometimes it's harder to do than say but, for the most part, we've done a good job.” “I was able to watch the last set,” Keys says, “and it's so amazing for Coco. But at the same time it gives you a lot of confidence.” In 2015 she beat Petra Kvitova and Venus Williams before losing to Serena Williams while, eight years later, she lost to Sabalenka in the quarters. Last year was even more painful when, in the fourth round, she was 5-2 up in the third set and two points from victory against Jasmine Paolini. “I then tore my hamstring,” Keys says with a grimace. She retired at 5-5 and Paolini went on to make the final. “Hopefully this is the year I make it past the quarters because Wimbledon has always been something that I dreamed of. It's hard to believe that Keys, a teenage prodigy, has been playing professionally since she was 14. But it's been nice to see a different part of London. I'm notorious for being stuck at Wimbledon all the years I've been here, so it's fun just to be in another part of the city.” What would she most like to do in London? “When I'm in a big city I've always really loved doing that touristy bus thing where you can kind of see everything in one trip. If I have an afternoon off that would be the one thing I'd love to do – just hop on a bus and see all of the sights at least once.” Kindness Wins is the non-profit foundation she set up in 2020 and its very name offers insight into her character and philosophy of life. “It means a lot to me,” she says, “because tennis has brought so much into my life and it's opened so many doors for me. The world seems short of kindness right now so how does she feel as an American living under Donald Trump? “Sometimes it's hard to shut it off enough that you don't pull your hair out but also not being oblivious to what's going on and the realities of everything. Keys smiles ruefully when I say that there are just three and a half more years of Trump's presidency to survive. Keys grins more broadly when I ask if the reality of winning her first grand slam lived up to the dream she had pursued for so long. “It was great,” she says with another pealing laugh. “Being able to do it with that group of people around me was really special.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexandra Eala overcame Varvara Gracheva in a three-set semifinal between qualifiers at the Lexus Eastbourne Open to become the first Filipina player ever to reach a WTA final. Alexandra Eala became the first Filipina player in history to reach a WTA final after battling past Varvara Gracheva 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 in a high-quality semifinal between two qualifiers at the Lexus Eastbourne Open. The final will be the youngest title match in terms of combined age at Eastbourne since 1981, when an 18-year-old Tracy Austin triumphed over a 16-year-old Andrea Jaeger. Eala, 20, burst on to the tennis scene by defeating three Grand Slam champions -- Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek -- to reach the Miami semifinals in March, but lost four of her next five tour-level matches. However, her flat, left-handed strokes have thrived on grass. In the main draw, she has bested Lucia Bronzetti, Ostapenko (via retirement), Dayana Yastremska and now Gracheva. Even as Eala's fame -- particularly back at home in the Philippines -- has gone stratospheric this year, she has been a composed presence in interviews. But after completing the 2-hour, 22-minute victory over Gracheva, she was emotional and almost lost for words in her on-court interview. "There were tough moments where she was playing well, and I didn't know how to get out of it," she explained. "It was a challenge for both of us, physically and mentally. So the fact that I was able to stay there and wait for my opportunities was a big achievement for me." 51 Joint, and the latter will be seeking a second career title following her maiden WTA trophy in Rabat on clay five weeks ago. Momentum had swung back and forth between the pair as they had responded to every shift in the other's favor by raising their own level. Eala made the first move, leaping out to a 4-1 lead -- only for Gracheva to hit back with a four-game run and serve for the first set at 5-4. Eala denied her, reeling off five games of her own to snatch the first set and lead 2-0 in the second. Next, it was Gracheva's turn to hit a hot streak, seizing six games in a row to take the second set and level the match. She was more clinical on break points, particularly in an opening set in which she converted three out of three, compared to Gracheva's two out of eight. Eala also managed to protect her vulnerability more effectively. She was able to win just 26% of her second-serve points throughout the match, but raised her first-serve percentage to 77% in the third set.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top seed and seven-time champion land in same half Two-time defending men's singles champion Carlos Alcaraz is the No.2 seed and he'll open proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against Italian veteran Fabio Fognini. Meanwhile, reigning women's champion Barbora Krejcikova is the No.17 seed and she'll kick off Centre Court action on Tuesday against Filipina rising star Alex Eala. Before he can get to a potential semi-final against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic must navigate a tricky path that includes possible meetings with in-form American Alex Michelsen in the third round, Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur in the last 16, and fourth-seeded Jack Draper, or Halle champion Alexander Bublik, or Czech big-serve Jakub Mensik in the quarter-finals. The seven-time Wimbledon champion will open his campaign on Tuesday against France's Alexandre Müller, whose reaction to the draw on social media was classic. Sinner will begin his quest for a maiden Wimbledon crown and a fourth major title against fellow Italian Luca Nardi in round one. Alcaraz arrives at these Championships riding an 18-match winning streak that includes title runs in Rome, Roland-Garros, and Queens. The first seed Alcaraz could bump into in the draw is Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is having a decent run on grass in Mallorca this week. Besides Rune, Frances Tiafoe and Jiri Lehecka are also possible quarter-finalist opponents for Alcaraz, while the likes of Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev or Matteo Berrettini are all potential match-ups for the Spaniard in the semis. It would be remarkable if he pulls this off! Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka will open her Wimbledon account against Canadian Carson Branstine, who dispatched Roland-Garros semi-finalist Loïs Boisson and former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in the qualifying rounds this week. Vondrousova has a tough opener though against Nottingham champion McCartney Kessler. Sabalenka could face her Australian Open final conqueror Madison Keys in the quarter-finals, and has last year's Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini, or fifth-seeded Zheng Qinwen as potential semi-final opponents. Reigning Roland-Garros champion Coco Gauff has a difficult opening match against Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska, who handed the American a bagel in their most recent meeting in Madrid before Gauff rallied back to win. Sofia Kenin, the No.28 seed, possibly looms ahead for Gauff in round three, before a potential quarter-final against 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina or five-time major champion Iga Swiatek. Third-seeded Jessica Pegula, defending champion Barbora Krejcikova, and seventh-seeded Mirra Andreeva are all possible semi-final opponents for Gauff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I've always been a fan of [Brilliant Earth] from the very start. The American tennis star joined forces with the global leader in ethically sourced jewelry, Brilliant Earth, as a new brand ambassador, with a launch of new styles coming later this summer ahead of the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, New York City, where Keys will compete. Even before she joined Brilliant Earth as an ambassador, Keys always admired the company's vision and mission. “I like the very clean and simple but modern style that they've always had. Harry Kane Lends His Signature to Skechers' First Athlete-led 'Off Pitch' Lifestyle Sneaker Drop “It was just kind of all these things that I already feel so strongly about. When I got the opportunity to partner, it just felt like the easiest partnership.” From the start of her professional tennis career, which began when Keys was just a teenager, the athlete used jewelry as a “way to express my personality and kind of show my personal style a little bit more, just because on court we obviously have our match kits that are scripted,” she said. “I'm a big believer that anyone and everyone deserves sparkly things. For [Brilliant Earth] to be, basically, the first company to offer that was always something that I was really excited about,” she said, referencing Brilliant Earth's ethically sourced and lab-grown gems. I'm really excited that so many of the things that I talked about and were really important to me — not only just my journey within tennis but my entire life — we were able to put that into this launch,” Keys said. “Venus is the reason that I started playing tennis,” Keys added. “On top of that, her having such a huge role in equal prize money for women on our tour…we're all so forever grateful for both of them.” Now a Grand Slam champion herself after winning the 2025 Australian Open Women's Singles title in Melbourne last January, Keys is trailblazing her own path through tennis history. “Australia was obviously the biggest thing that I've done in my career. I think the reason that it still is probably going to be really hard to top as my most brilliant moment is just because of the people that I had around with me,” Keys said. Keys had come close to winning a Grand Slam on previous occasions, but to have her “favorite people” by her side in January to lift the Australian Open trophy was a “truly raw, emotional experience and we were just all so happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She'll play Jessica Pegula, the top seed, in Saturday's final Iga Swiatek earned a significant breakthrough by reaching a career-first grass-court final, breezing past second-seeded Jasmine Paolini 6-1, 6-3 to reach Saturday's showpiece at the Bad Homburg Open. In a repeat of last season's Roland-Garros final, the contest played out much the same as an irrepressible Swiatek simply overawed last year's Wimbledon runner-up, breaking five times in total compared to just the single break for Paolini. Simply formidable on clay and already a hard-court Grand Slam champion, Swiatek has never make it past the quarter-finals of Wimbledon and her grass-court trophy cabinet remains empty. A painful semi-final exit at her beloved Roland-Garros to arguably her biggest rival in Aryna Sabalenka brought a difficult year full circle with no titles to the Pole's name. Since arriving on her less favoured grass courts, however, Swiatek has looked like she has received a fresh lungful of air, sweeping past three talented opponents without dropping a set. But this semi-final was one-way traffic from start to finish. Swiatek broke three times without reply en route to taking the opening set comfortably. A couple of games later and Swiatek had wrapped up an unexpectedly straightforward victory to move into her first final since Roland-Garros last year. With hopes of a fourth straight Roland-Garros title dashed, perhaps this year Swiatek can attack Wimbledon with more purpose than in previous years, where she has often looked stuck in the aftermath and fatigue of her recent French Open triumphs. A maiden grass-court title in Bad Homburg would provide a huge boost of confidence and momentum in the Pole's ongoing quest to conquer SW19.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you didn't see the men's final at this year's French Open, you likely heard about the match that was almost instantly dubbed one of the best of all time. After holding three match points on his serve against Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner saw the next two sets slip away until Alcaraz seized victory with a fifth-set tiebreak win. We called the three-time Grand Slam champion to find out. Jannik Sinner: I went home to my parents' place [in the South Tyrol region of northeast Italy] and spent some time with them and with my friends and doing just normal stuff. We made barbecue, I played some table tennis with my friends—it was some good time off, and then after some days, I came to prepare for the tournament here. I'm sure you're eager to move forward from the French, but if I could just ask: Is it easier to deal with this kind of loss when everyone's saying it's one of the greatest matches in recent tennis history? Does that make you somehow more proud to be part of that—or does it make it even harder to deal with? No, no—look, when I see how people talk about this match, I'm honestly happy to have been a part of it. People will, of course, remember who won and who lost, but they will also remember how good the match was—and to make a good match, you need two players, and I was one of them. When I was a kid, I would have never expected to play a final of a Grand Slam, or to be in the position I am in, so everything now is just positive. I understood the potential I have, but on the other hand, you just have to keep working, keep believing, keep searching for things you have to do better if you want to become a better player. These are all things I'm trying to learn, and at 23 years old, you cannot know everything. It's maybe more important to have people around you whom you can trust completely—and that's exactly what I'm trying to do. At the moment, I have such great people around me—I have an amazing family, I have amazing friends who give me the possibility to be safe around them. For me, it's the only thing that matters. And with the right values off the court, having good people around you is going to help you, especially in tough moments. This was, for sure, one of the tougher moments I've had in my career. Losing in a Grand Slam final, having had match points? Sinner during his men's singles final against Carlos Alcaraz at the 2025 French Open. No—everyone was just very proud of how I handled the situation: how I played tennis, yes, but also how I handled the situation after the loss. Do I understand it right that at that time, when you were 13 and you decided to leave home to pursue tennis, you were actually only playing maybe twice a week? I never really played tennis until I was basically 12 years old, but then I put away the skis and started to play more football and also more tennis. I lived my childhood how I wanted to, and this is also thanks to my parents, who gave me the possibility to ski and play tennis—and I come from a normal family. As I said earlier, we never would've thought to be in the position we are in now. Does coming to tennis so relatively late mean that when you were very young, your childhood sports dreams had nothing to do with tennis? No—when I was young, my dream was always to become a Formula 1 driver, but we never had money, and we understood straightaway that Formula 1 is so expensive, so we didn't even try. Later, when I started playing tennis, you could say my dream was to win some tournaments on the pro tour or whatever, but that was just not realistic: It was just a dream, not a goal. I never said my goal was to become number one in the world; most likely, that could only be a dream. Your highest ranking as a junior was 133rd—and in 2018, you only played one juniors event. That same year you decided to go pro anyway. For me, it was not important if I was a good junior player—I always wanted to see myself competing with the real players, and that's why I decided to try some Futures tournaments. I also had a couple of wild cards on the Challengers tour. Juniors are for experience, for trying to have some matches under your belt, but I wanted to see what I could learn if I played against the best players and older players with more experience. Everyone thinks differently, but that was my vision. Why did you pick Halle for your Wimbledon warmup tournament, versus, say, Queens? Halle is nearer to my hometown—and if I had gone to Queens, I would be staying in London for so long. But also, this tournament helped me so much when I was young—when I was 17 and basically nobody, they gave me a wild card and we started this good relationship, and I like to come to places where I've built up a kind of relationship. It's all very simple, and I like that. This conversation has been edited and condensed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight-time Grand Slam winner André Agassi has spoken of the deep “trust” he shares with wife Steffi Graf, a fellow tennis legend. André Agassi has spoken of the “trust” that underpins his relationship with his wife, fellow former tennis star Steffi Graf. Talking on the Action Plan financial podcast, Agassi lifted the lid on the multimillionaire couple's estate planning, telling host Rich Roll that he and Graf know exactly what each other's needs are. “Because she knows what I care about and vice versa. So there's a lot of trust in that.” Just are you better off for the time spent? They married in October 2001 and share two children: son Jaden, born the year of their wedding, and daughter Jazz, born in 2003. Agassi, who won eight Grand Slam titles during his tennis career, has frequently spoken publicly about his devotion to Graf, a 22-time major winner. Notably, the American paid a memorably heartfelt tribute to the German during a 2004 speech at her International Tennis Hall of Fame induction ceremony. “As I attempt to find words worthy to introduce the person that has changed my life, I realise the words have yet to be invented that are large enough, colorful enough, or true enough to express the heart and soul of this woman that I love,” Agassi said.

She stated that the couple followed an “exclusivity ritual,” in which they only had eyes for each other. “Their togetherness signals do seem to be becoming less inhibited [for Kelce], but it is still Taylor doing the heavy lifting in terms of showing their love and their romantic narrative off to the world,” she said. Additionally, Swift made sure that she got Kelce's “undivided attention” on the dance floor. The NFL star looked “a little more diffident but happy to be led.” Kelce and Swift were also spotted grooving to her 2008 track, “Love Story,” at the same event. Their PDA-packed moves have again sparked engagement and wedding rumors, with fans highly anticipating the same.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON — Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff are helping usher in a new era for tennis. The sport's most recent Grand Slam singles champions are Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and Gauff, a 21-year-old American, each at No. 2 in their respective tour rankings and coming off French Open titles secured in riveting finals against the sport's No. 1 Iga Swiatek on the WTA Tour, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner on the ATP Tour, Gauff and Alcaraz offer a bright future for tennis. The timing couldn't be better for a sport with a fan base that in recent years saw all-time greats Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal walk away and currently might be pondering how much longer Novak Djokovic will contend for the biggest prizes. We are so fortunate to have not only Coco, not only Carlos, but a deep bench of young stars that are just propelling the growth of our sport," said Stacey Allaster, the director of the U.S. Open, a hard-court major in New York that is played in September and caps the Grand Slam year. "We have had the exact opposite during this transition. One key for a sport — especially one mostly based on individual success — to gain attention and grow popularity is to have rivalries that demand buy-in. Alcaraz and Sinner, a 23-year-old Italian, added a chapter to their rivalry earlier this month at the French Open. The five-set, 5 1/2-hour men's singles final on the red clay of Roland-Garros was as full of momentum swings, terrific tennis and athleticism as anything the greats that came before them conjured. "The level was insane," said Alcaraz, who will be seeking a third straight Wimbledon title and sixth major championship overall. "Having these two guys fighting for big trophies — I think we have to be very happy about it in the sport of tennis," said Juan Carlos Ferrero, who was the men's singles champion at the 2003 French Open and currently serves as Alcaraz's main coach. "For them, for sure it's something that they raise their level every time that they go on the court. It sure does seem as though Gauff versus Sabalenka could provide that sort of dynamic and buzz, too. And consider that, like those other two, both own multiple major titles. Plus, their latest meeting, at Roland-Garros less than a month ago, came with some added spice because of Sabalenka's comments after the match that were seen as less than fully gracious toward Gauff. It became such a thing that the 27-year-old from Belarus felt the need to issue a pair of apologies: one privately via writing to Gauff, and one publicly in an interview at her next tournament. Add that sort of off-court intrigue to the on-court interest, and if there are rematches at the All England Club a couple of weeks from now, no one who is invested in tennis will be displeased. "There's incredible momentum and wind in our sales as we think about the sport, in total," said Lew Sherr, who is about to leave his role as the CEO of the U.S. Tennis Association. "We've had five consecutive years of participation growth ... and that certainly is being, in part, fueled by the great talent and inspiring players we have at the professional level, and also is feeding record attendance, record interest, record viewership. Barbora Krejcikova's bid to repeat as Wimbledon women's singles champion is in doubt after the 29-year-old from Czech Republic withdrew Thursday from the Eastbourne Open on Thursday due to what she described via a released statement as "soreness" in her right thigh. Krejcikova, who gave Varvara Gracheva a walkover win in the quarterfinals at Devonshire Park, initially felt pain on Wednesday during her second-round victory over Jodie Burrage. The problem worsened overnight, and she was going for a medical scan as part of further testing. Her opening match at Wimbledon is scheduled for Tuesday. "I think it's better with Wimbledon in the next couple of days just to rest it and to see what's going on and to resolve that," Krejcikova, current ranked 17th in women's singles, added in her statement. Krejcikova beat Jasmine Paolini in last year's Wimbledon final, adding a second major titles in singles competition to her resumé after winning the 2021 French Open for her first. She is a seven-time major champion in women's doubles with a career Grand Slam, and she has won the Australian Open in mixed doubles three times. Two-time Wimbledon men's singles champion Andy Murray will help design a statue of himself to mark the tournament's 150th anniversary in 2027. "He's got to rightly be very involved in that, and him and his team will be," All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans said. The Scotsman won a second title — and his third Grand Slam singles title overall — in the 2016 final against Milos Raonic. An inspiration for the statue project is the way Nadal was honored, with Murray in attendance, this month at Roland-Garros, where he won 14 French Open men's singles titles. "We looked at Rafa Nadal having that sort of plaque unveiled to him at Roland-Garros, which was all very special," Jevans said. A bronze statue of Fred Perry, the previous British men's champion before Murray in 1936, was put up at Wimbledon in 1984, marking 50 years after his first singles title at the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After having some choice words about Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open, Channel Nine sports anchor Tony Jones of Australia will not be on the job for Wimbledon. The channel will instead “utilize its London bureau and fly in tennis experts Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic for commentary duties,” according to GB News. “Welcome back to Melbourne Park, where you can see the Novak Djokovic fans, they're in full voice. The chants are quite extraordinary,” Jones said live for Channel Nine in front of Djokovic's chanting fans at the Australian Open in January, which was won by Jannik Sinner. Tony Jones who disrespected Novak Djokovic and his fans at the Australian Open this year, has been reported that he won't be covering Wimbledon for Channel 9 this year.Good news. Jones then chimed in with a chant of his own: “Novak, he's overrated. Djokovic, a 24-time major champion, didn't tolerate the disrespect, as he swiftly denied interviewing with Jones and Channel Nine while demanding an apology. “Channel Nine here in Australia made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments towards me,” Djokovic said. Jones' “kick him out” comments particularly struck a chord for many, as Djokovic was deported from Australia over his vaccination status in early 2022. “If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd ‘kick him out,'” Jones said in his apology.</p>
