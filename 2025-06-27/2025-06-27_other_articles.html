                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an ironic twist several years ago, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works, the supersecret lab that developed stealth technology and that has been implicated in many UFO conspiracy theories, wound up getting a mysterious, possibly extraterrestrial metal fragment from the military. It had been sent for evaluation after the Army struck a deal with (I kid you not) Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge's UFO-research organization To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, who had bought the fragment in 2019. The Army legitimately wanted to find out if it could defy gravity. If this sounds absolutely bizarre, then you should read part two of a Wall Street Journal dive into the con-jobs-within-con-jobs that have defined the obsession with UFOs for decades. Part one explained that Unidentified Aerial Phenomena and the lore that has surrounded them was an psyop designed to distract the public and intimidate military insiders into keeping quiet about advanced weaponry. Part two chronicles DeLonge's debris — which was supposed to have come from a crashed alien craft in Roswell, New Mexico, and was according to the Journal acquired for $35,000 — and the efforts of a Department of Defense investigator to figure out whether it was legitimately not of this world. The report also shows that UFO mythology has taken on a crazy, some might say unhinged, life of its own. He then sent it to a Department of Energy lab, where it was traced to an earthbound World War II-era project. Meanwhile, Kirkpatrick and his team were running down all manner of other UFO allegations, many of which involved the Skunk Works and people who claimed to know what had really gone on there. There was an FBI raid of what wound up being an empty safe that was supposed to contain secret alien data. There was an actual Russian laser program that probably entailed UFO disinformation. As Kirkpatrick pursued all this stuff, he predictably ticked off some of the people he had investigated, who clearly had a stake in keeping the UFO narrative from being debunked. The UFO gravy train, however, shows no signs of ending. Whoever dreamed it up is likely long gone, but their work is being carried on by a generation of opportunists who are more than happy to insist that we ignore the laws of physics. And believe that the government still has something to hide. Secrets involving technology that you might have thought came from outer space. Just imagine what real-world inventions the ongoing UFO myth is still distracting us from.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But from my early years working as an engineer at NASA, now to leading as a cofounder and Chief Technology Officer of an early-stage biotech startup, Delve Therapeutics, I've learned that there's more connections than many may think, and that by looking at the links between the two, we can help to develop new treatments in a way that can make a meaningful change for millions of people impacted by cancer. While many at JPL were focused on unmanned rockets exploring outer space, my team was largely focused on trying to find and receive signals that may be coming from extraterrestrial life. The work we were doing was aiming to reach through billions of miles or more, to try and pick up just the faintest trace of a signal. When I was ready for my next opportunity, I joined Bell Labs which at that time was pioneering advanced communications between mobile phones and cell towers. After Bell Labs, I was CTO at Arieso, a UK-based startup where we developed innovative, location-based products to help mobile service providers answer the question: based on signals from my customers, where am I having problems in my network? We know that the body has the underlying tools it needs to ward off cancer, but cancer is a cunning opponent skilled at evading its enemies. So, for targeted cancers, we can give the body's immune cells a boost in detecting where the cancer cells are and help them destroy their tumor targets more effectively. So, while it may seem like I made a change from deep space research, shifted into working in mobile communications, and then into a completely unrelated field of pharmaceuticals — I have actually built my career around finding and interpreting signals. I just started at the biggest scale in our universe, from between solar systems, and have been working my way down ever since, now focusing on the sub-microscopic space in and around cells. The difference, from my perspective, is that a scientist will look at a phenomenon and wonder what's going on and try to understand it, while an engineer will look at it and wonder how that same phenomenon can be used to achieve an outcome. This isn't to say that the industry doesn't need basic research and traditional academic contributors, it certainly does, but there's also a significant opportunity for the unconventional. The path taken may not look like the usual one on paper, but it's one that can lead to real-world results, and I think any industry can use more of that type of thinking. Naturally, that's easier said than done, but a good start can be coming from outside the traditional route. Coming from an engineering and deep-space background has given me a different perspective from many of my peers, and it is one that I'm excited to share in the name of creating a meaningful change in the lives of people living with cancer. Dr. Mike Flanagan is the Cofounder and Chief Technology Officer of Delve Therapeutics, an early-stage biotech startup researching engineered cell therapies to treat certain forms of cancer. Based at the New Jersey Bioscience Center, a leading incubator in the region dedicated to life sciences and biotechnology companies, Dr. Flanagan is leveraging his background in deep space exploration and telecommunications to track down cancer's signals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a certain color palette that springs to mind whenever talk of UFOs, aliens, or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) comes up. It owes a lot to the 1947 Roswell Incident in New Mexico. Early sci-fi movies added to this with their black & white aesthetic, which leaned on grey tones to portray their aliens. As color films reached the mainstream in the Fifties and Sixties, little grey men became little green men. Now, you can give this paranormal world of conspiracies, sightings, and abductions your own color palette with Andy Price's The Alien Encounters Coloring Book, set for a July 1st release date courtesy of Adams Media (an imprint of Simon and Schuster). Price is the illustrator behind the Extreme Horror Sticker Book and The Cryptid Creatures Coloring Book, both of which showcase a deep knowledge of both topics with drawings that homage classic movies and monster designs. Some are reminiscent of movie posters for old sci-fi flicks (like The UFO Attack on Washington, DC in 1952) while others come across as classified case files with top secret pictures of aliens and spaceships spread out over someone's desk (as in illustration for The McMinnville UFO case in 1950). One very clever detail that makes the coloring book stand out is its decision to offer brief narratives of each encounter on the back of every page. It's not unlike the small paragraphs you'd find in museums next to art pieces, providing information on context and method. It's essentially a crash course in extraterrestrial phenomena. Adding to this is Price's smart selection of encounters for the book. While the many testimonies surrounding these cases tend to share in some very similar details between them (i.e. big heads, silvery oval eyes, and long arms), there's an aim to emphasize the things that differentiate them. Some aliens have long hair and suits, while others are smaller but with bulging eyes. The same extends to spaceships, which is where Price really stretches his ability to create unique variations of a core design. Ever since Roswell, movies and TV series have largely stuck to the flying saucer as the standard for alien spaceships. Nineties kids, for instance, grew up with them thanks to The X-Files and the many docuseries that cropped up around that time with a focus on seeking answers to unexplained phenomena. Even Jordan Poole's 2022 Nope resorts to the visual for its sci-fi horror tale, albeit with a special twist on the flying object that opens up new avenues for experimentation. Price takes a like-minded approach, clearly relying on extensive research to give each spaceship its own identity. The 1977 Petrozavodsk Sightings page is a great example of this. Initial reactions to it suggest the ship might be the alien itself, a living creature fused with high tech. Coloring this one is a reward unto itself, and it can spark enough curiosity to learn more about the sighting. Simply put, Andy Price's illustration will make you want to believe in aliens. And you'll do so one color at a time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"She was being fed fake information," the 24-year-old British student told AFP, saying their mother "was against her daughter seeking medical treatments that could have saved her". Gabriel's twin sister, Paloma fell ill in 2023 aged 22, shortly after graduating from university, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, a type of cancer which is in most cases "very treatable" according to the UK's National Health Service. But Gabriel told AFP his sister opted not to start chemotherapy treatment advised by an oncologist, influenced by her mother's distrust of conventional medicine. Paloma died one year later at 23 after opting for a controversial treatment called "Gerson therapy", involving vegetable juices and coffee enemas. Australian "wellness" influencer Jess Ainscough died from cancer in 2015 after trying the therapy. She released a statement on X saying Paloma was "never coerced" and presented a written statement signed by her daughter in April 2024. "I have suffered no abuse from my mum," Paloma wrote, describing her cancer diagnosis as not definitive. Paloma said she questioned medics about survival rates on her mother's advice, before discharging herself from the oncologist and moving in with Kate. Paloma said she was "delighted with her chosen treatment plan". But she died in July 2024 after suffering a heart attack at home. Kate blames her death on "a chain of gross medical failings, breaches of consent law, falsified medical records, and reckless emergency drug use". The brothers are awaiting an inquest on July 28, and hope a police investigation will follow. Many wellness influencers like Kate, who calls herself a "natural nurse", are accused of touting unproven treatments that are promoted by algorithms to ill people. Kate was struck off as a NHS nurse after her speeches at anti-vaccine rallies made her a public figure during the Covid lockdown. "My mum's a national conspiracy theorist who called for doctors and nurses to be hung," said Gabriel. The student at London School of Economics says he grew up hearing conspiracy theories from his parents and once believed "the royal family were all lizards". Gabriel is estranged from his mother, who he said "needs to feel important. While these figures "aren't actually huge", she is "definitely a prominent figure," said Stephanie Alice Baker, a sociologist researching health and wellness misinformation at City St George's, University of London. Gabriel is urging tighter social media controls on those making such unproven health claims. Baker said she had seen a surge in content creators "selling unregulated products like soursop tea, apricot kernels and horse and dog dewormer". "This is something I feel very concerned about, and I think needs to be seriously regulated, both from social media companies, but also in terms of government regulation."

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a notable shift in Steven Spielberg's filmography after his unprecedented success in 1993, in which he both won the Academy Award for Best Picture with Schindler's List and created the highest-grossing film of all-time with Jurassic Park. Schindler's List seemed to indicate a new direction in Spielberg's career, in which he would emphasize important stories of world history, including Amistad and Saving Private Ryan. Topping his own success would prove to be challenging, as The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a disappointment that suggested Spielberg no longer had interest in four-quadrant entertainment. Spielberg's talents seemed better reserved for more “intellectual” fare; Catch Me If You Can was a deep character study about lonely people, and even a sci-fi thriller like Minority Report dealt with serious themes of restorative justice and predestination. Spielberg had nothing left to prove by making a blockbuster intended for a mass audience, particularly when it came to stories about extraterrestrial visitors. Ironically, War of the Worlds would ultimately prove to be one of Spielberg's most profound films about humanity; within the ashes of catastrophe, mankind is revealed to be selfish, unorganized, and incompetent as it faces an existential threat. As urban centers are decimated and fear takes hold of society, there is little time to be anything but reactive. A talking point perpetrated within the months after 9/11 is whether an attack so destructive was inevitable; America had been a superpower that has inflicted catastrophic damage upon other nations, and its citizens have never felt trepidation about an attack of the same magnitude on their own soil. Spielberg suggests a similar anxiety within the opening moments of War of the Worlds, in which Morgan Freeman's narrator describes the dominion of Earth that has caused extraterrestrials to desire its control. Although War of the Worlds does incorporate aspects of anti-capitalism that have become integral to Spielberg's 21st century canon, the film does not place blame on humanity for its indulgence. Rather, it suggests that in their sustained supremacy, mankind has taken for granted everything they should have cherished. Spielberg's complex childhood, which he would go on to unpack in his semi-autobiographical film The Fabelmans, spawned recurring themes of broken families, divorced parents, and lost boys within nearly all of his work. examined the complexities of adolescence, War of the Worlds sought to empathize with a divorced, bitter father who is forced to step up in his responsibilities. Unlike a character like Robin Williams' Peter Pan in Hook or Sean Connery's Henry Jones Sr. in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ray Ferrier isn't a misunderstood, whimsical hero who rediscovers a childlike sense of wonder. While Tom Cruise's casting in Minority Report provided him with one of his best roles, it wasn't necessarily a performance that challenged the audience's perception of his star persona; his role as a wrongfully accused Precrime officer had the same sense of authority and bravery that made him so perfect for the Mission: Impossible franchise. War of the Worlds, on the other hand, asked Cruise to be pathetic, needy, and at times aggravatingly ignorant; although his complaints about disappointing work hours and an ungrateful ex-wife are relatable, it's odd to see such banal rhetoric coming from someone as world-renowned as Cruise. Cruise had certainly played dark, complicated characters before, but never someone as unexceptional as Ray; there's a hint of romantic tragedy within Eyes Wide Shut's Bill Harford or Magnolia's Frank T.J. Mackey, but Ray's entire life has little significance within the devastation of Earth at the hands of Martian invaders. Bill is a Hitchockian hero in the sense that he is “an ordinary man caught within extraordinary circumstances,” and Cruise serves as an appropriate audience avatar as he experiences the chaos that emerges. Spielberg's portrayal of domesticity is rich with irony, as Ray is tasked with taking care of his children, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), as a result of a devastating thunderstorm that separates him from his ex-wife, Mary Ann (Miranda Otto). A prolonged, aggressive game of catch between Ray and Robbie is the perfect summation of their fruitless relationship; later, the scream Rachel makes as they drive along the East Coast could only be given by a child who does not believe that they have a competent guardian. The Ferriers haphazardly travel from New York to New Jersey, then back to Boston, fleeing as each supposed safe haven is decimated. It's often more chilling to examine the aftermath of a conflict, as the devastated suburbia Ray and his children trek through bears a striking resemblance to war-torn China in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. It would have been unwise to mask the aliens for too long, but Spielberg complicates their revelation with a scarier component- the tripods have protective shields, which make a majority of humanity's defenses completely useless. It inspires yet another instance in which Ray must admit to his children that he doesn't have an actual solution, as the planet is not equipped to protect them from such advanced technology. Those stepping up to serve as Earth's defense aren't altruistic, emboldened heroes, but angry young men like Robbie, who see violence as the only means of finding purpose. Robbie may still contain shards of innocence, but he chooses to take up arms with knowledge that the battle is futile. It's among Spielberg's most crushing observations about the collapse of the “nuclear family,” that many would rather choose to face their likely demise than be vulnerable in front of their loved ones. It was bold of Spielberg to initially present Ray as a miserable, spiteful character, then steadily reveals him to be more virtuous than many of the other humans scavenging in the aftermath. As the survivors crawl over one another for any source of food or medical supplies, Ray and Rachel must place their faith in Tim Robbins' Harlan Ogilvy, an unstable ambulance driver who offers them temporary shelter. Although Harlan isn't malevolent, his inability to cope with the body horror of the aliens' harvest of human flesh results in a mental breakdown, in which a reluctant Ray must kill him. It's among the darkest moments in any Spielberg film, as it presents an impossible scenario in which Ray must commit an unthinkable act for the sake of his daughter's life; although it's suggested that Ray made the only rational choice within the circumstances, it doesn't make the visual of America's leading A-lister brutally executing a mentally ill man any less disturbing. The 1953 film by Byron Haskin details how Doctor Clayton Forrester (Gene Berry) found a means of wounding the alien invaders, which prompted him to bring his findings to a group of military scientists in Los Angeles. Though Ray does find a way of destroying the tripods from within, his strategy is only used by a relatively small group of soldiers and civilians in Boston. Ray's defining act of bravery is intertwined with his own survival, but does not have any lasting consequences that impact humanity as a whole. The alien invaders are killed as a result of latent microbes that humanity has adapted to, but it was never intended to be an uplifting finale in the vein of Independence Day's rousing conclusion. It's rather disturbing that an invading race incapable of surviving on Earth would be able to supersede humanity's mightiest defenses before its inadaptability is revealed, as Spielberg suggests that the survival of either species is quite fragile. It's also an indication that mankind itself would turn on itself before the inevitable cure was found, as none of the inflammatory rhetoric ended up mattering. The final moments of War of the Worlds struck another parallel with Munich, which rather infamously ended with Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) becoming so haunted that even intimate moments with his wife (Ayelet Zurer) are disrupted by dark visions. Although it may have been impossible during its initial rollout to distance War of the Worlds from its aggressive marketing campaign, the film's technical achievements have aged rather well, particularly when compared to other Spielberg ventures of the last two decades. Spielberg's first son, Max, was not born until June of 1984, and there's a notable difference within the ways in which he depicts children in the immediate aftermath; it is unlikely that Spielberg would have depicted the brutal death of a young boy in Jaws, the enslavement of children in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or the peril of kids in Poltergeist had he already been raising a family of his own. Although some have pointed to Spielberg's parenthood as the reason he often slipped into sentimental storytelling, War of the Worlds evokes the kind of horror that could have only been conceived by someone terrified about the world that they would leave behind for their children. Only a filmmaker of Spielberg's imagination would have been able to craft War of the Worlds into such a nightmare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The moment Darian DeVries took the Indiana job, many around West Virginia began to speculate on his decision to leave WVU after just one year at the helm. Is this something he had in mind from the jump? Did he sit out to retain a year of eligibility? Only a select few people know the answers to most or all of those questions, and WVU athletic director Wren Baker is one of them. While Baker has commented on DeVries' departure in the past, he never really dove deep into it, mainly because he was conducting a coaching search and eventually introducing DeVries' replacement, Ross Hodge. “I think the first thing I would say is one, Coach DeVries did a really good job coaching the basketball team this year. We should have been in the NCAA Tournament, still don't know how that didn't happen. I believe that for whatever reason, he felt like Indiana was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it was one of the few he would probably leave for, and it just happened to open at the wrong time. I think you look at the recent history, this job has performed as well or better than Indiana. "Felt like we were set up and building something special here, but ultimately, I think there's two things that you walk away from. It was not my decision to make. It was his, and I have to respect that. There's nothing I can do to change it. "I think the other thing that I would say is you can go down these rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, but what good does that do? I know what he articulated to me throughout the season. I've got lots of things going on. I'd rather probably not spend my time trying to speculate on conspiracy theories because the outcome of that, no matter what, would not be favorable anyway.” Baker also mentioned that everything happens for a reason.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 has been an epic year for the horror genre, and with the year only halfway through, there's still plenty for fans to look forward to. It's worth noting that horror films have recently done more than preserve the genre's popularity; they've elevated it by leaning into strong storytelling rather than relying solely on cheap thrills. While recent hits like Bring Her Back and Longlegs have played a big part in this revival, it's the low-budget titles that remain the genre's unsung heroes. Without flashy marketing campaigns or star power attached, these films often face a 50/50 shot at success—yet they're the ones most likely to achieve cult status. Ashley Greene's new supernatural horror, It Feeds, fits right into that tradition. It may not boast the visibility of a mainstream blockbuster, but it's exactly the kind of atmospheric gem that even casual horror fans can appreciate. Despite the title's uncanny resemblance to 2014's hit horror flick It Follows, It Feeds is a standalone movie that doesn't need to lean into pre-established lore heavily. It Feeds is directed by Chad Archibald, a prolific horror movie producer and director, who tends to bring unconventionality through eerie and intense stories. Ashley Greene's newest supernatural horror may not be a commercial success or the hot new thing in town, but it surely isn't a disappointment either. Her clairvoyant abilities allow Cynthia to physically travel into the patient's mind to pinpoint the exact location and reason behind their trauma and suffering. Although the prospect might seem redundant and awfully close to what Elise did in Insidious, rest assured, her approach has a refreshing twist to it. Cynthia is supported by her 17-year-old daughter Jordan, who works as an assistant and screens patients before setting them up with her mother. The 2020s have seen some excellent releases, and fans continue to hope for sequels to films like Don't Worry Darling and The Substance. Therefore, there's only so much she can do for every patient, and that's where the story begins. Riley doesn't waste any time building the film's supernatural elements, as instead of slow-burning into the dread, she straightaway lays it all out. It Feeds is neatly paced around a psychiatrist and her gift that brings the very evil to her doorstep, to which she lost someone close. However, before she could get to the bottom of it, Riley's short-tempered father took her away, but that didn't satisfy Jordan's curiosity, and she persistently annoyed her mother to help Riley. From there on, viewers can pretty much detect predictable patterns in terms of a fiercely independent teen and a reluctant mother whose differences usually end up inviting the very evil they ought to avoid into their lives. The undeniable appeal of low-budget horrors lies in their ability to be dependent on a strong narrative. With no subsequent star power or space to feature extravagant backdrops, it boils down to how strong the script and its execution are. Instead of retracting from progress every chance it gets, It Feeds puts everything on the table and continues at an appreciable pace, whether it's the discovery of Riley's dark secret or the escalation that Jordan's encounter was meant to bring. Many horror films, though flawless, slip under the radar due to overshadowing by mainstream hits or limited marketing. They don't have to waste time unraveling the overused semantics of a generic supernatural concept that's already been stretched too thin. There's an evil force at hand, the characters are in trouble, and the heroine knows what to do - nothing more or less than that. The movie doesn't take up much of its length to get to the point, and surprisingly, everything takes place in a matter of only two days. In other words, It Feeds is a crisp and simple yet effective movie that delivers what it should: dread, anxiety, intensity, and scares. Both Ashley Greene and Shawn Ashmore get plenty of time to shine despite their standard ‘parental' roles. Surprisingly, the twist in the fold allows Ashmore to showcase his talents as he transitions from a suspicious and hot-headed single parent to an overprotective one whose questionable actions don't stem from malicious intent. Things quickly escalate when Jordan discovers that Riley's description of a dark entity haunting her wasn't metaphorical. As a cherry on top, Julian Richings' brief yet impressive cameo helps fill in the blanks without frustrating the audience too much. Richings played a doctor who treated Riley's mother, aka patient zero. He implies that Riley's mother must have picked it up during her long stretches overseas as a humanitarian nurse. Needless to say, besides these cleverly crafted moments and the subtle jump scares, one other interesting aspect of It Feeds is Cynthia's point of view within the other person's mind. She travels into the mind's layers of consciousness by compartmentalizing every level that tells its own story. It's safe to say that while the movie treads on familiar ground and embraces conventional horror elements, it still manages to inject a healthy dose of originality into the premise. Viewers might feel that they can practically narrate the whole scene in some instances, but those are just fleeting moments that surprisingly connect sequences quite smoothly. Even with all its flaws, It Feeds should be on a horror enthusiast's list as it's a welcoming deviation from recycled rituals and hollow Latin chants. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. If DreamWorks is making more live-action reboots after How to Train Your Dragon, this underrated animated movie should be first on their list. War movies stay popular because they tell moving stories, but films like Apocalypse Now and Pearl Harbor struggle to stand the test of time. Scream is almost 30 years old, and still iconic, with a special ability to make fun of itself, and apparently spoil its own twist in the first scene. Superman director James Gunn discusses how Superman's life consists of "work friends" and "play friends" and making a cast this big feel accessible.</p>

Since 1999, she has been playing Detective Olivia Benson, and now, 574 episodes later, the show is still going strong with its 27th season slated to premiere this fall on the 2025 TV schedule. Now, the actress has shared a “fun story” about a psychic predicting that she'd get famous for playing a character just like Benson, and my mind is blown. While stars come and go from SVU, Hargitay has been there and stayed there since day one. I was 34, and I come to New York, and a friend of mine said, ‘Oh my gosh, Mariska, you have to go to this psychic on Long Island.' I didn't even know where Long Island was. So, I drive out to this guy's house on Long Island. While she went along for the ride, Hargitay wasn't having it. She has famous parents – her mom is Jayne Mansfield – and she figured the psychic could easily look her up. However, when they started talking, the psychic said something that wound up being very true, he said: – I have this on recording – ‘You see that face right now?' Well, considering you know where this story is going, it's easy to draw the parallels between this prediction and her eventual role on SVU. However, hindsight is 20/20, and in the moment, she didn't believe it. The actress wanted to be in the world of comedy, and she lived in Los Angeles, with no plans of moving. However, this psychic was convinced she'd star in a drama based in New York, as she said: And he says – this is my favorite thing anyone has ever said to me – he goes, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you think. You're gonna be famous for that face.' Well, that all proved to be true, obviously, but the real kicker is how fast it came true. After telling this wild tale, the woman behind Olivia Benson revealed that she auditioned for SVU alongside Christopher Meloni and booked the gig not that long after this run-in with the Long Island psychic: You can get access to the shows airing on NBC, the old favorites, and Peacock originals all in one place for as little as $7.99 per month. Well, that's absolutely bananas, and now, nearly 30 years later, we can look back on this and relish in how right this guy was. I wonder if he had correct predictions about the various actors who appeared on L&O who went on to have big careers? Now, this psychic can say “I told you so,” and Hargitay will continue to play the beloved and very serious Detective Olivia Benson on SVU. Riley Utley is the Weekend Editor at CinemaBlend.
