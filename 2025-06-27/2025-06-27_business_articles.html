                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's safe to say no one is underdressed at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding. From animal prints and florals to a three-dimensional heart, check out some of the most eye-catching looks Bezos and Sánchez's wedding guests have worn so far. He brought a fun pop to his look with $650 sunglasses from Louis Vuitton. Gates kept his black ensemble simple, but his black bow tie was slightly oversize, adding dimension to the look. He wore his signature glasses with the formal outfit. The star of Winfrey's monochromatic ensemble was a pink, off-the-shoulder ball gown. The dropped-waist bodice hugged her figure with ruched fabric before flowing into a floor-length skirt. The long sleeves were made of semi-sheer lace, and Winfrey accessorized the look with sunglasses and a matching clutch. A sparkly flower sat on the hip of Trump's strapless dress, with petals extending across the gown in a circular pattern. Brady wore dark colors for the wedding, pairing his suit jacket with a navy shirt and tie. Usher wore a classic double-breasted jacket, but its black-and-white pattern made it fashion-forward. A bow tie and white pocket square completed his look. She wore a massive diamond pendant on her neck and chunky sunglasses. The garment was a light-silver shade, which almost looked white in some lighting. She also wore black sunglasses and big diamond studs. Her strapless dress came from the fashion house's Icarus couture line. Bezos kept his outfit simpler, wearing a charcoal suit and $975 Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses. It also had crisscross straps down its front. The TV star waved at photographers from a water taxi, showing off her massive diamond cuff and designer sunglasses in the process. It was her bedazzled mesh gown, however, that really deserved attention. The piece was see-through and covered in stripes of silver sparkles. Its neckline was also so low that it revealed the bra-style top of her undergarment. While Gamble sported an all-black suit and layers of pearl necklaces, Jenner chose a tulle gown with puffy sleeves, a rose-embellished belt, and long diamond earrings. Her halter dress was originally made for the designer's 2002 runway collection. She wore a sheer, body-hugging dress crafted entirely from yellow lace. To complete the look, she added a black leather bag and round sunglasses. Poonawalla, an Indian businesswoman, boarded the boat behind her in a red AZ Factory piece created for the brand's 2022 spring runway. It was strapless and made from a mix of fabrics, including velvet, with massive 3D hearts attached all over. She took a water taxi on Thursday with her husband, Jared Kushner. She wore an Oscar de la Renta minidress embellished with white and pink ombré sequins and an assortment of white floral pieces. The straps were also created to look like stems. Winfrey and King caught a water taxi together on Thursday. King, who joined Sánchez in space in April, wore a yellow and white dress, while Winfrey chose a maroon and white floral look. Winfrey's dress had subtle cutouts on the waist, giving it a daring edge. Diagonal stripes of sparkles covered the dress, making it stand out. Khloé Kardashian supported her sister with her first look for the Bezos wedding, wearing a Skims x Dolce & Gabbana catsuit in cheetah print. She paired it with brown, open-toe heels and big sunglasses. Chunky sunglasses and white, printed boots completed the loud-luxury ensemble.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is asking some managers to evaluate employees based on how much they use AI internally, and the software giant is considering adding a metric related to this in its review process, Business Insider has learned. Julia Liuson, president of the Microsoft division responsible for developer tools such as AI coding service GitHub Copilot, recently sent an email instructing managers to evaluate employee performance based on their use of internal AI tools like this. "AI is now a fundamental part of how we work," Liuson wrote. Liuson told managers that AI "should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact." Microsoft's performance requirements vary from team to team, and some are considering including a more formal metric about the use of internal AI tools in performance reviews for its next fiscal year, according to a person familiar with the situation. This person asked not to be identified discussing private matters. These changes are meant to address what Microsoft sees as lagging internal adoption of its Copilot AI services, according to another two people with knowledge of the plans. In Liuson's organization, GitHub Copilot is facing increasing competition from AI coding services including Cursor. Microsoft lets employees use some external AI tools that meet certain security requirements. Staff are currently allowed to use coding assistant Replit, for example, one of the people said. Competition among coding tools is even becoming a sticking point in Microsoft's renegotiation of its most important partnership with OpenAI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday said the United States is immediately "terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada" in response to Ottawa's decision to impose a digital services tax on American tech firms. Trump's surprise announcement on Truth Social accused Canada of "copying the European Union" with the "egregious" tax. "We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period," Trump added. "We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country. They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The office of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The president's angry declaration suddenly imperils America's trade relationship with a close ally that has long been one of its top two global trading partners. U.S. goods trade with Canada totaled roughly $762 billion last year, according to the office of the U.S. trade representative. The first payments from Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year and applies retroactively to 2022, are set to be collected Monday. The tax would hit both domestic and foreign tech companies, including U.S. giants such as Amazon, Google and Meta. Canadian officials said this month that they would not pause the digital services tax, despite ferocious opposition from the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike stock soared 17% on Friday after the company said the worst of its struggles are behind it, following a better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. Nike on Thursday reiterated it would take the biggest financial hit from its turnaround plan during the quarter, soothing investors who worried President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on key Nike manufacturing hubs like China and Vietnam would derail the company's comeback. Nike posted a poor fourth quarter, as sales dropped 12%, net income plunged 86% and profit margins dwindled. "From here, we expect our business results to improve. By the end of an hourlong call with Nike executives and Wall Street analysts, the stock had surged more than 10% in extended trading. Beyond assuring investors that the turnaround plan is working, Hill shared promising updates on new product launches and Nike's efforts to win back wholesale partners, which have been key areas of focus since he took over in October. Hill shared details behind Nike's decision to begin selling on Amazon for the first time since 2019 and its push to win over female shoppers, another priority for the company. During the quarter, the company launched products in more than 200 women's led shops, including Aritzia, and released its collection with WNBA star A'ja Wilson, which Hill said sold out in three minutes. HSBC also raised its price target to $80, implying 28% upside from Thursday's close. "Long in the making but we think the inflection is finally here," analyst Erwan Rambourg wrote in a research note. "We think there is more than tangible evidence that Nike has a path to see its sales rebound in the not-too-distant future, and its margins to be repaired, and this despite an unfavorable tariff headwind." Nike's results show the company is rebounding on a timeline Wall Street likes. But don't call it a comeback just yet. The sneaker giant is trying to grow again at a shaky time for the economy, as weaker consumer sentiment, rising debt, tariffs and mass deportations raise questions about spending and GDP. Nike still expects sales to decline in its current quarter by a mid-single-digit percentage, in line with Wall Street expectations of a 7% drop, according to LSEG. It also has more work to do to clear out stale lifestyle inventory from its classic Dunks and Jordan lines. Those efforts to liquidate old inventory have hit profit margins and sales because Nike has had to rely on deep discounts, clearance channels and the off-price sector to clear out that glut. In fiscal 2025, which ended last month, sales for classics like the Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and Dunks declined more than 20% compared with the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, that accelerated to 30%, which impacted sales by nearly $1 billion, finance chief Matt Friend said. Air Force 1 inventory levels have started to stabilize but Nike is still working to clear out supply of its Dunk franchise, which will affect the company's profits through the first half of its current fiscal year, said Friend. Both Hill and Friend said Nike's profits will be under pressure through the first half of fiscal 2026 as it works through its inventory and contends with higher costs from tariffs. However, when it comes to actual sales growth, it's still too early to tell when the company will stop shrinking. When asked if there are any scenarios where the company could get back to revenue growth this year, Hill declined to share a timeline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding week, of course. Their wedding has been a long time coming, as the billionaire and former journalist first went public with their relationship in 2019 and got engaged in 2023. From local protests to celebrity sightings, it's already been an eventful week. Take a look at photos of Bezos and Sánchez's wedding so far. Although they officially arrived in Venice on Wednesday, the couple appeared to be celebrating early. On Sunday, Bezos and Sánchez were photographed hosting a foam party on his superyacht Koru off the coast of Croatia, though it wasn't clear if the event was related to their wedding. Bezos and Sánchez were all smiles as they waved to photographers, seemingly unbothered by the demonstrators who took to the streets of Venice to protest their wedding in the days ahead of their nuptials. The couple has kept details of their festivities under wraps. However, luxury wedding planners told Business Insider that the nuptials would likely cost eight figures and that no detail would be overlooked. Their A-list attendees arrived in waves throughout the week, with many being photographed leaving the Venice airport via water taxi. For instance, Ivanka Trump and her family arrived in Venice on Tuesday, while Kris Jenner's longtime partner Corey Gamble and billionaire Barry Diller arrived on Wednesday. Her form-fitting gown had one shoulder, and silver embellishments covered the dress in a pattern of diagonal stripes. Before she entered the seating area of the boat, Sánchez blew a kiss to those around her, showing off a massive diamond ring on her right hand. She arrived with Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner in tow. The Kardashian family has become close to Sánchez in recent years, and Jenner and Kim Kardashian both attended Sánchez's bachelorette party in May. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King were spotted waiting for a water taxi after taking Winfrey's private jet to Venice, as many of the wedding's attendees did. King notably went to space with Sánchez in April. Tom Brady and Queen Rania of Jordan were also photographed arriving on Thursday, as was Domenico Dolce, the cofounder of Dolce & Gabbana, a brand Sánchez has frequently worn to public events. Sánchez wore her hair in a high ponytail with beachy waves. They also kissed each other as photographers captured them leaving the Aman. The longtime friends walked together to a taxi boat, wearing sunglasses and printed dresses. Winfrey's maroon dress had daring cutouts on the waist. Like Bezos, Bloom wore a suit with no tie for Thursday's gathering. Bezos, Sánchez, and their guests arrived at the medieval church on Thursday evening. Jenner, Gamble, and the Kardashian sisters shared a water taxi to Thursday night's gathering. Jenner took a photo of her daughters on the boat, who both raised their hands in peace signs as they floated along the canal. Gamble sipped on a drink and adjusted his lapel. For instance, Usher and his wife, Jennifer Goicoechea, were photographed enjoying a boat ride. Sydney Sweeney, who attended Bezos and Sánchez's event on Thursday, was photographed walking through the city in an all-black ensemble. Bill Gates and Paula Hurd were also spotted sightseeing in Venice on Friday. Tommy Hilfiger escorted his wife, Dee Ocleppo, through the city, and she carried a large bag from Hermès as they strolled. Sánchez was spotted sans Bezos on Friday afternoon, leaving the Aman in a retro white set, headscarf, and sunglasses.</p>

GOP Tax Bill:

The US Capitol in Washington.

Silicon Valley's favorite tax break may be getting an upgrade.

Venture capitalists, along with successful tech founders and early startup employees, already pay no taxes on billions of dollars of gains annually, thanks to a lucrative and complicated provision called Qualified Small Business Stock, or QSBS. Now the carve-out could get even more generous in changes included in Senate Republicans' proposed tax and spending bill moving through Congress. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. personal saving rate — the percentage of disposable income that U.S. households save, after they pay taxes and spend money — has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data released Friday. Some consumers may be changing their financial habits from so-called "revenge spending" — the trend of splurging after the pandemic — to "revenge saving," as they focus more on building savings and spending less. "No buy" challenges are going viral on social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit, as consumers vow to limit their discretionary spending, cut back on subscriptions and travel, and rebuild their savings. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. A recent Vanguard survey found 71% of Americans polled plan to shift their savings approach this summer to prioritize emergency savings and flexibility. Financial advisors typically recommend consumers aim to set aside three to six months' worth of living expenses as a cash cushion. But you might benefit from having more in some circumstances; for example, if you're a one-income household or your pay is variable, experts say. Having ample cash reserves improves overall financial wellbeing, according to Vanguard researchers. "American workers are spending, on average, nearly seven hours each and every week thinking about their finances," said Dina Caggiula, head of participant experience at Vanguard. "But if you have sufficient emergency savings, we can cut that number nearly in half." Several factors are prompting consumers to be cautious and cut back, including fluid tariff negotiations, the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates lingering at higher levels longer than some expected, financial advisors and researchers say. Many Americans are also concerned about geopolitics and social unrest. Some of the "revenge savings" trend is consumers wanting to amass cash to help shield themselves from unexpected cost increases in the future. I may not need the money today, but I'm going to get access to that money in case I need it a few months down the road," said Charlie Wise, senior vice president and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion. Workers are also increasing the share of pay they contribute to retirement savings plans, which has boosted the 401(k) savings rate to a record high. When you add matching contributions from employers, the savings rate for those plans rises to 14.3%, edging closer to Fidelity's recommended retirement savings rate of 15% a year. Meanwhile, another report from Vanguard shows the average savings rate for employee deferrals was 7.7% in 2024, matching record-high levels from the previous year. More retirement plans are making it easier for workers to enroll and contribute through automatic enrollment and automatic escalation features.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Friday limited federal judges from issuing universal injunctions, which had been used to block President Donald Trump from implementing his executive order ending birthright citizenship. The 6-3 decision, which divided the conservative-majority court along ideological lines, helps clear the way for the Trump administration to push forward with its efforts to unilaterally upend long-standing U.S. citizenship rules and other major policies. The ruling also bolsters Trump's frequent claims that his expansive use of his executive powers has been unfairly thwarted by judicial overreach. "GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!," Trump wrote on social media after the opinion was released. The case centered on nationwide injunctions that federal district court judges had granted in three separate lawsuits challenging Trump's citizenship order. But on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that, "Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts." "But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them," wrote Barrett. "When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too," she wrote. In a blistering dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor decried the government's efforts to end birthright citizenship, while criticizing her conservative colleagues for "shamefully" permitting judicial "gamesmanship" by the Trump administration. "No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates," wrote Sotomayor in the dissent, where she was joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. "Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship," Sotomayor wrote. The "patent unlawfulness" of Trump's executive order "reveals the gravity of the majority's error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case," she wrote. "As every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land." In a separate, equally vehement dissent, Jackson added, "The Court's decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law." The bid to quash universal injunctions is essentially "a request for this Court's permission to engage in unlawful behavior," Jackson, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote. "But, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Nation of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to deny it."

Nvidia:

Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp. announcing new chips.

Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion.

After the emergence of China's DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anders Kurtén, the 54-year-old CEO of Fraser Yachts, based in Monaco. I became the CEO of Fraser Yachts in 2023. We're the world's largest yacht brokerage with dual headquarters in Monaco and Fort Lauderdale. Growing up in Finland, our summers were spent on the Baltic Sea. I didn't consider turning that passion into a profession at first. I then worked in New York during the dot-com boom and returned to Finland for a brief stint at Accenture. BI's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine. In the mid-2000s, I was headhunted to run a small yard manufacturing performance cruising sailboats. In 2019, I entered the superyacht industry as CEO of Baltic Yachts. My primary role at Fraser now is serving the needs of our clients with the help of my 230 colleagues. Here's what a typical day in my life looks like. I roll out of bed around 6 a.m., get ready, and head to the office. The 22-minute trip can stretch to two hours during rush hour. I generally run west, starting from Monaco harbour. Our office is opposite the Formula 1 circuit's La Rascasse turn. During the Monaco Grand Prix, if I had a fishing rod, I could tap the drivers on their helmets as they drive by. Our reception area showcases impressive scale models of 6-foot-long superyachts. My mornings are for strategic work and clearing my inbox unless I'm traveling for events like the Palm Beach International Boat Show. When traveling, I rely on my team to triage incoming emails and calls. I spend the mornings taking internal meetings and catching up with my team. Many charter our yachts for vacations, while the wealthiest among them buy vessels outright. We manage 338 superyachts, sell about 50 yachts annually, and book thousands of charter days. There are only about 6,000 to 7,000 superyachts in the world. Several new superyachts easily exceed that price tag. I have a small 30-foot outboard powerboat and a 28-foot sailboat at my summer cottage in the southwest archipelago of Finland. However, I'd need more than one boat for my dream yacht. For sailing, I'd want something like the Baltic 47 Elsa. For motor yachts, I lean toward a classic gentleman's yacht like the Feadship Santa Maria. Both would pair well with a vintage chase tender like the Monte Carlo Offshorer 32. The afternoons get busy around 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. Monaco time, when our Florida team starts their day. We catch up on recent developments and sync projects to ensure seamless handoffs across time zones. This global coordination is especially critical for our yacht owners' new-build projects and crewing needs. After dinner, I help the kids with homework and play music until bedtime. It's almost like a rock band at home. After the kids are asleep, my wife and I unwind with Netflix. Depending on my workload, I might hop on a call or respond to emails from our US or Australia teams. I reserve weekends for family time, unless there's a yacht show or an urgent client matter that needs my attention. In winter, we head to the southern Alps, where our children ski competitively while my wife and I ski at a more leisurely pace. We also occasionally travel together for business trips and take short getaways to places like Florence or Northern Italy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xiaomi launched a car just slightly cheaper than Tesla's Model Y, and it has already attracted hundreds of thousands of buyers. In a Weibo post on Thursday, the Chinese smartphone and electric vehicle maker said it received over 200,000 orders for the YU7 within three minutes of its launch in Beijing. Within an hour of the sale starting, it had more than 289,000 orders for the car, Xiaomi wrote in a second post. Xiaomi's founder and CEO, Lei Jun, repeatedly took jabs at Tesla during the launch event. Today we officially take up Tesla's invite to compare," Lei said on Thursday. Tesla and CEO Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Xiaomi's stock rose 8% to a record high on Friday in Hong Kong following strong order demand. It ended the day up about 3.6% at almost 59 Hong Kong dollars. "YU7 seems to be selling like hot cakes despite slightly higher pricing" than estimated, Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee wrote in a note on Thursday. "YU7's pricing is slightly below that of Tesla Model Y, but it offers much better specs/performance," the analysts wrote. "Model Y is the main target of YU7, and thus we expect YU7 would be able to take market share from Model Y." It's also attracting some big-name fans in the US. In October, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said he didn't want to give up the Xiaomi SU7 he had been driving for the past half year.</p>
