                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stolen funds from the ChainSaw collections remain idle, while most Favrr proceeds have already passed through Gate.io and several nested services. On June 23, the same address took over three additional ChainSaw contracts: Peplicator, Hedz, and Zogz. He subsequently mapped many smaller monthly deposits from unrelated projects into the same exchange wallet. Two GitHub accounts, “devmad119” and “sujitb2114,” list wallets that intersect the stolen fund trail. Both accounts share indicators that ZachXBT associated with North Korean IT workers, including Korean language system settings, Astral VPN sessions, and Asia-Russia time zones, despite résumés that claim US residency. A second incident surfaced on June 25, when the freelance services token project Favrr lost more than $680,000 following its listing on a DEX. Gate.io deposit address 0xab7 received part of the stolen Favrr tokens, and was previously funded by the suspected developer behind “sujitb2114”. Favrr announced that it would refund all initial decentralized offering participants, cancel its MEXC listing, and initiate a thorough audit of its codebase. ZachXBT reported that Favrr's chief technology officer, listed as Alex Hong, deleted his LinkedIn profile after the exploit. Attempts to verify his work history with previous employers were unsuccessful. The investigator plans to release aggregate data on payroll flows to wallets tied to the same North Korean cluster, contending that basic due diligence checks would have flagged the hires. The stolen funds from the ChainSaw collections remain idle, while most Favrr proceeds have already passed through Gate.io and several nested services. ZachXBT said he has not reached the teams because their direct message channels are closed, and official Telegram or Discord rooms do not provide contact options. The incidents bring renewed attention to the risks of “shadow hiring” in crypto projects that outsource development through gig-work platforms. Investigators continue to follow the on-chain trails, and affected communities await formal statements from Furie, ChainSaw, and Favrr.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is backing Bitcoin, calling it a vital American asset that the US must continue to dominate. Today, Former President Donald Trump has voiced strong support for Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry, calling it a vital American asset that the US must continue to dominate. “So I became a fan of crypto, and to me it's an industry,” Trump said. “I view it as an industry and I'm president and if we didn't have it, China would or somebody else would, but most likely China.” Trump emphasized the economic resilience and strategic importance of Bitcoin, pointing out its relative strength during recent market downturns. “In fact, when the stock market went down recently, crypto and Bitcoin and all of that went down much less than anybody else as a group,” he stated. I mean, people are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar. And it's a great thing for our country, so I don't care about investing, you know.” He concluded by asserting that under his leadership, the US has built a critical industry in Bitcoin and crypto. They do believe in it, but I'm president and what I did do there is build an industry that's very important and you know if we didn't have a China would,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite recent volatility and decline in the market, a crypto analyst observes that Bitcoin Dominance remains firmly elevated, signaling that capital is still concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend, they argue, is preventing any meaningful breakout for altcoins and could persist unless a decisive shift in market structure occurs. According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin's market cap dominance has reached 65.72% with both monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings pushing above the critical 70 level. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin's command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin's ongoing upward momentum. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70—effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin's growing market dominance relative to altcoins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>June 2025 – Global — The Eyes Are Always Watching, a 21,000-piece digital art collection inscribed on Bitcoin using Ordinals, is now live with over 1,000 pieces already permanently embedded on-chain. The project is free to mint and aims to create a mirror for humanity, one that lives on Bitcoin forever. Created by the pseudonymous artist Mr. Black, the collection uses Ordinals — Bitcoin's method of assigning digital content to individual Satoshis — to ensure each artwork is immutable, decentralized, and preserved as part of the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Art that lives on Bitcoin is the truest form of art, for it stays in its original state for eternity,” said Mr. Black. The project features 21,000 unique portraits, capturing the vastness of humanity from iconic figures and cultural touchstones to quiet moments and forgotten stories. Some pieces honor those who shaped history; others challenge injustice or give voice to the unseen. With global themes and rich diversity, The Eyes Are Always Watching offers a profound reflection of our world, where every viewer can find a piece of themselves, and perhaps, something they've never seen before. The goal: a decentralized art archive for all 8 billion people on Earth. Unlike NFTs on traditional platforms, this collection uses Ordinals — a method that inscribes digital media directly onto Bitcoin without the need for external servers or centralized platforms. Each inscription is stored natively on the Bitcoin blockchain, offering unmatched permanence. The project gained visibility across Rome, Jerusalem, and major U.S. cities, where mobile billboards and public installations promoted the message: Fear God, Not Man. Most recently, the project sponsored and attended Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, engaging with the global Bitcoin community and further cementing its presence as a cultural and technological statement within the Ordinals ecosystem.

A couple of U.S. macroeconomic data points Friday morning — though nearly two months old at this point — might have added to the modestly negative tone for BTC and gold. Maybe of more import to markets, the core PCE price index in the US, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the Federal Reserve's chosen gauge of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in May compared to expectations of a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE prices rose 2.7% versus 2.6% expected. Noted goldbug and no-coiner Peter Schiff: "Traders continue to sell gold even as this morning's release of weak economic data and stronger-than-expected inflation data pushed the dollar index to new lows. Stagflation and a tanking dollar are bullish for gold, regardless of any superficial trade deals 'negotiated' by Trump."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Ethereum's price has surged above $2,500, marking a significant milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This upward movement has been driven by a combination of factors, including strong bullish sentiment and a shift in funding rates on major exchanges. However, analysts are cautioning that this rapid ascent could be followed by a short-term correction. However, caution against potential short-term volatility has also appeared as it began consolidating in the $2,400–$2,500 range. This indicates that leveraged long positions are aggressively betting on a continued ETH price rise. However, this also raises concerns about the market turning into “overheating,” where further increases could precede with a short-term correction. On-chain data presents a cautionary note, despite the recent strong price action. The data reveals that Binance witnessed an inflow of 177,000 ETH over three consecutive days. This movement of ETH onto exchanges has higher odds that some large holders may be preparing to take profits or reallocate their assets, potentially leading to selling pressure. Even popular analyst Degen Hardy noted with caution that he will stay long on ETH as long as it remains above the $2,400 mark. As he believes in the short term, if $2400 is taken out, it will mean that bulls are struggling to reclaim untapped weekly highs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A payments company backed by African political leaders has launched a blockchain-based marketplace for trading local currencies, in a bid to make it easier for companies to repatriate their profits and reduce the continent's dependence on the dollar in regional trade. PAPSS partnered with Interstellar, a Cameroon-headquartered blockchain infrastructure company, to create the exchange. Demand for the marketplace comes from international companies that do business across Africa and struggle to move money, said PAPSS chief executive Mike Ogbalu III, who spoke to Semafor on the sidelines of Afreximbank's annual meeting in Nigeria. The roughly 80 companies that trialled the service include multinational insurance companies who operate in multiple African countries and often can't access foreign exchange to repatriate their earnings, Ogbalu told Semafor. An estimate by global airlines trade group IATA suggests more than $1 billion of their members' revenues remains trapped or blocked in Africa. The exchange is the newest feature PAPSS has produced to fulfill its broader mandate: to create a central instant payments platform that enables transactions that begin in one African currency and end in another. It currently completes these transactions in seven seconds on average, Ogbalu said. After a formal endorsement by African heads of state in 2019, PAPSS launched local currency instant payments across English-speaking West Africa and Guinea four years ago. Since then it has expanded to 16 countries covering other regions including North Africa. But at the moment, nearly half of commercial payments going out of Africa are dollar transactions, according to the SWIFT payments network. The aim is to remove tariffs and other trade barriers to ease the movement of goods in a continent of around 1.5 billion inhabitants. Reducing transaction costs incurred in major international currencies will help to improve trade within Africa, analysts say. While PAPSS could lower trade and currency conversion costs in Africa by $5 billion, its utility stretches beyond savings, said the AfCFTA secretary-general Wamkele Mene. “Trading in the United States dollar or any other currency has no business between African countries,” Mene told an audience at the Afreximbank meeting. “We must use our own currencies and ensure the economic sovereignty of our continent, guarding ourselves against the ever-shifting geopolitical tensions which have an impact on payments,” he said. Previous attempts to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments for intra-Africa trade have stumbled due to the absence of political will, said Kenneth Ugwuanyi, head of transaction banking at the United Bank for Africa Group which operates in 20 African countries. The backing of African leaders for PAPSS has given commercial banks a strong institutional basis to more easily carry out transactions within the continent, he said. GCB Bank, Ghana's largest lender by assets, saw both its cross-border trade transactions and small and medium-scale business client base grow last year by “about 25% and a significant portion of that was driven by PAPSS,” said George Fuachie, its head of investor relations. A marketplace for African currencies presents a chicken and egg problem because “you need more trade within Africa to boost demand for African currencies,” Amaka Anku, head of the Eurasia Group's Africa practice, told Semafor. “You can only have a market when there is supply to meet demand,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Codex, a new blockchain network for stablecoins that secured $16 million earlier this year from Dragonfly Capital, Coinbase, Circle Ventures, and other notable investors, has officially launched its mainnet to help make digital dollars more practical for everyday finance. The network went live today, June 24, with native support for USDC, which means the stablecoin can move across Codex without needing a cross-chain bridge or wrapper. Per a press release shared with The Defiant, the goal of Codex is to offer a smoother way for businesses and institutions to use stablecoins just as their global capitalization has recently climbed above $250 billion. “In our view, neither TPS nor latency are really the bottlenecks for stablecoin adoption today,” he said. To address this, Codex is working on licenses, partnerships with payment ramps, and banking relationships, Li says. The developers plan to roll out features like instant currency swaps, atomic off-ramps that don't leave users' money stuck due to compliance issues, and more reliable cash delivery systems in regions where existing off-ramps are slow or untrustworthy. Codex's swap platform — called Codex Avenue — already offers trades between stablecoins and fiat, including large trades close to 1:1 pricing, the team revealed in the press release. “This is why Codex will be where the stablecoin future will happen, and why we are proud to work with stablecoin issuers such as Circle,” Li said. When asked about on-chain privacy features, Li said Codex is working with top teams in crypto to allow some parts of transactions to stay private, while still meeting compliance standards. The chain will use new zero-knowledge and encryption tools to offer this kind of confidentiality at scale. “More to share soon,” he hinted, without diving into technical details. While Codex launches with USDC, Li confirmed the team is planning to support all major stablecoins, including Tether's USDT and Circle's euro-backed EURC. Earlier this month, another stablecoin-focused blockchain, Plasma, saw overwhelming demand for participation in its $50 million token sale, while Circle's long-awaited IPO was also oversubscribed and, it turned out, undervalued — both signs of strong demand for exposure to stablecoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article explores how NFTs are evolving from hype-driven collectibles into infrastructure-level tools for digital ownership, access, and utility—far from dead, and very much maturing. Why NFTs Got a Bad Reputation The backlash isn't unfounded. According to Web3 pioneer, entreprenuer, Alessio Vinassa, this phase was inevitable. “What we witnessed was an attention bubble—not a failure of the core technology, but a failure of how it was communicated and applied,” he explains. Alessio Vinassa, who has helped incubate several real-world NFT utility platforms, believes that the collapse of the hype is what Web3 needed to develop and grow up. A university can issue diplomas that are tamper-proof and transferable. A concert ticket can be verified, resold, or revoked with transparency. A gamer can own in-game assets that persist across platforms. “These use cases have nothing to do with speculation,” says Alessio Vinassa. “They're about efficiency, trust, and removing middlemen from digital value exchange.” Real-World Applications Emerging Now Event ticketing: Prevents fraud and allows creators to earn resale royalties. Supply chains: Tracking the lifecycle of physical goods using digital twins. One promising area is dynamic NFTs, where metadata can change based on real-world inputs—ideal for credentials, reputation systems, or gaming progress. Alessio Vinassa's current ventures are exploring NFTs as “access keys”—a form of digital membership for internationally gated communities, decentralized platforms, or exclusive physical experiences. Alessio Vinassa acknowledges the skepticism but frames it as a design challenge: “We don't need to convince people that NFTs matter—we need to show them. In the early days, it was clunky and mostly used by tech hobbyists. Now it's invisible—just a layer of communication we rely on every day. They'll be used.” Key Takeaways NFTs are not dead—they're evolving beyond speculation into real infrastructure. Alessio Vinassa is a key voice in reframing NFT narratives toward utility and user empowerment. Conclusion “NFTs are dead” might make a great headline, but the truth is more nuanced. Like all emerging technologies, NFTs are undergoing a transition—from misunderstood to indispensable.
