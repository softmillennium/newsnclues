                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Dunne hailed his Formula 1 practice debut with McLaren, for the Austrian Grand Prix, as "something pretty special." Alex Dunne has hailed his Formula 1 practice debut as "something pretty special" after finishing only fractionally slower than the sister McLaren of Oscar Piastri during FP1 ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix. Although Dunne previously sampled McLaren's 2023 challenger and underwent simulator running, this was his first time in an official F1 session. Despite his relative lack of experience, Dunne posted the fourth fastest time at the Red Bull Ring in FP1, less than a tenth behind championship leader Piastri in the sister McLaren, and just over two tenths down on George Russell's session-best. "I don't even know where to start," said Dunne after the session. "So to have the pace that I had and show what I'm capable of on the F1 stage is something pretty special, so massive thank you to McLaren and everyone for the opportunity. McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was impressed by Dunne's performance, not only because of his speed but also that he was able to help the team develop the car, which featured a new suspension set-up. This in turn helped regular driver Lando Norris once he got back behind the wheel of his car, before topping FP2 ahead of Piastri. "I think we have to acknowledge that he [Dunne] has gone through quite an extensive plan of testing with some new parts, with some rake work, some adjustments on the steering wheel that we don't see on TV but definitely keeps the drivers very busy," Stella told Sky Sports F1. "I think we need to be a bit careful looking at the lap times because his time came later on in the stint when the fuel was down but I think encouraging and impressive in terms of Alex himself and also I think a good session for McLaren."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Russell has topped the timesheets during Friday's opening practice session ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver continuing his run of good form as he led the way from Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri. There were a couple of new faces joining the action for FP1 at the Red Bull Ring as two teams opted to run a rookie; Formula 2 standings leader Alex Dunne stepped into Lando Norris' McLaren – making him the first Irish driver to take part in an F1 weekend for 22 years as he finished an impressive fourth – while fellow F2 driver Dino Beganovic was at the wheel for Ferrari in place of Charles Leclerc. Also seemingly struggling in the sister Red Bull was Yuki Tsunoda, who experienced a wide moment of his own as he continues in his mission to get to grips with the car. A yellow flag briefly appeared following a spin for Fernando Alonso, with the two-time World Champion running onto the grass thanks to a moment at the final corner. “That was the worst out-lap we can do – good to do it in FP1!” the Aston Martin driver commented. As the majority of the field switched to the soft tyres and the times started to tumble – with Ferrari also getting both cars back out on track – Esteban Ocon sparked another yellow flag after locking up and going straight on at Turn 1. The Haas driver was able to rejoin, albeit with a flat spot on his front left tyre. With Russell still leading the way from Verstappen and Piastri as the session entered its final quarter, Dunne caught the eye by going fourth fastest, his time just seven-hundredths away from Piastri's. “A few small raindrops,” Russell reported as the last 10 minutes of FP1 approached, with clouds hovering above the Red Bull Ring. Verstappen – who has won at this track a record four times – was 0.065s adrift in P2, while Piastri and Dunne held third and fourth for McLaren ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in fifth. Gabriel Bortoleto slotted into an impressive sixth for Kick Sauber, while the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz, Hamilton and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the top 10. Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli claimed 11th – off the back of completing his school exams – ahead of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg (12th), Aston Martin's Lance Stroll (13th), Alonso (14th) and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson (15th). Franco Colapinto put his Alpine into P16, while Tsunoda, Beganovic, Ocon and Haas' Ollie Bearman classified P17 through to P20 respectively. The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Williams pace ‘better than it looks' after Friday practice, insists Sainz With James Vowles extending his stay as Team Principal of Williams, Alex Albon believes that this is a positive sign for the squad. Alex Albon has hailed James Vowles' new contract with Williams as a “great vote of confidence for all of us”, with the Thai driver praising the Team Principal for being a “good leader”. Albon went on to praise Vowles' leadership skills as he reflected on how the Briton has most greatly impacted the team since his arrival. “He tells us the direction and we follow.” Upon joining Williams in 2023, Vowles set his focus on transforming the team's fortunes – and things definitely look to have improved in recent times, with the 2025 campaign marking the outfit's strongest start to a season since 2016. Pushed on whether there might be the chance for a podium during this campaign, Albon said: “We have a better chance than previous years, if the time ever comes to get a podium. “I don't think we can get a podium on pure pace, but it does feel like the podium chances often happen to the top midfield team of that weekend, and we're in that position quite often. “To be honest, Canada should have suited us too and it looked like it was, we just fell a bit short come Saturday and Sunday,” the 29-year-old conceded. I think this weekend does suit our car, Silverstone more so, but we're seeing now the other teams with their upgrades – they're definitely catching up.”</p>
