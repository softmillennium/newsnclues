                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have found that even after recovery, individuals who previously experienced depression may retain a heightened sensitivity to negative cues and face challenges in regulating responses to potential punishment. The findings from the new study in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier, could lead to better ways to identify individuals at risk for relapse and help develop more targeted interventions to improve long-term recovery and prevent future episodes of depression. Depression is characterized by high relapse rates, with up to 80% of individuals experiencing a return of symptoms within five years, demonstrating that recovery does not always guarantee lasting resilience. Lead investigator Henricus G. Ruhé, MD, PhD, Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, and Donders Institute for Brain-Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, Netherlands, says, "The high relapse rates observed in depression suggest that there must be ongoing processes in the brain that continue to make individuals vulnerable to future episodes, even after symptoms have improved. Prior research has shown that people with depression often remain sensitive to punishment, even after remission. This led us to focus on aversive learning—a type of Pavlovian classical conditioning where a person learns to avoid a stimulus or behavior by associating it with an unpleasant outcome. We wanted to find out whether abnormalities in this system persist even after someone has recovered from depressive symptoms." For this study, researchers used functional MRI (fMRI) to assess brain activity during an aversive learning task in 36 patients with recurrent depression and 27 healthy controls. Participants learned associations between a picture and an unpleasant bitter taste while undergoing the fMRI scan. Imaging revealed evidence that individuals with remitted depression showed increased habenula activity specifically during the expectation of punishment, along with reduced connectivity between the habenula and the ventral tegmental area, an important midbrain nucleus responsible for producing the reward related neurotransmitter dopamine and an area thought to be regulated by habenula activity. Editor-in-Chief of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine, concludes, "While much is known about how depression affects brain function during active illness, we have little understanding of whether these changes persist after recovery. This study highlights that even when individuals no longer show obvious symptoms of depression, they may still experience heightened sensitivity to negative cues, which could contribute to relapse risk. Understanding these lingering effects could lead to better ways to identify at-risk individuals and help develop more targeted interventions to improve long-term recovery and prevent future episodes of depression."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team led by Associate Professor Ayako Okado-Matsumoto from the Department of Biology at Toho University has made a significant finding that sheds new light on Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). This study was conducted in collaboration with Professor Ryuji Sakakibara from the Department of Neurology at Sakura Medical Center, and Professors Hitoshi Nukada and Soroku Yagihashi from the Department of Exploratory Medicine on Nature, Life and Man at Toho University. The team discovered a notable change in a specific protein found in the blood of patients with DLB. Their research revealed that individuals with DLB have significantly lower levels of α-synuclein in their red blood cells, compared to healthy individuals and patients with other neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. α-synuclein is a protein known to play a role in the development of several neurodegenerative disorders when it accumulates abnormally in brain cells. This finding may contribute to improving the diagnosis of DLB, which is often difficult to detect at an early stage. The possibility of developing a simple blood-based biomarker for early detection could offer meaningful benefits for both patients and their families. Lower α-synuclein levels in DLB patients: The study revealed that individuals with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) have notably lower levels of α-synuclein in their red blood cells compared to healthy individuals or patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Elevated α-synuclein in plasma extracellular vesicles: The researchers also found that α-synuclein levels are elevated in small membrane-bound particles called extracellular vesicles-released by cells and present in the plasma-in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and DLB, compared to healthy individuals. Implications for early diagnosis: These findings may contribute to the development of a blood-based test that could enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis of DLB, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes and better patient care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. "It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork," she said. Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. "There's too much abuse in the system," she said. President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption. Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid "for people who rightly deserve" coverage, "not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games." Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work. Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance. A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage. The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage. "We're making it easy" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities. "We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month. "This is not a conversation America should be in," said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility. Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance. The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid. But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF. He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said. Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption. Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program. Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF. Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program. Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults. "Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons," he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another phase 3 trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of the dual-neurokinin receptor antagonist elinzanetant in controlling hot flashes in women on adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This time, the sample included younger and older patients with less frequent and severe episodes than patients in the previously published trials had experienced. “Elinzanetant is the first neurokinin-targeted therapy to demonstrate efficacy in reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS)” — otherwise known as hot flashes — “in women with breast cancer,” Fatima Cardoso, MD, MSc, said as she presented results from the OASIS 4 trial at the breast cancer oral abstracts session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. “It is important to treat VSM because they can negatively impact quality of life and lead to women prematurely stopping their breast cancer treatment,” Cardoso, director of the breast cancer unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center and president of the ABC Global Alliance in Lisbon, Portugal, told Medscape Medical News. OASIS 4 enrolled 474 women aged 18-70 years who were receiving endocrine therapy for HR+ breast cancer or as prevention in those at high risk for breast cancer and had 35 or more moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms a week. All participants were evaluated for 4 weeks after a year of treatment. By week 12, the patients receiving elinzanetant had almost twice the reduction in overall frequency of VMS: 7.8 vs 4.2 fewer average daily episodes than baseline, respectively. She characterized the safety profile of elinzanetant as favorable, during her interview with Medscape Medical News. “Very low rates of serious side effects were seen.” Fewer TEAEs were reported in both groups after the 12-week placebo period ended, she said. Elinzanetant “was very well tolerated,” Cardoso said as she presented the results. The OASIS 4 results are consistent with other phase 3 trials of elinzanetant in women on adjuvant endocrine therapy with VMS, JoAnn Pinkerton, MD, director of midlife health at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, told Medscape Medical News. Pinkerton was principal investigator of the OASIS 2 randomized trial of elinzanetant in postmenopausal participants with more frequent and severe VMS symptoms than those in OASIS 4. “It is worth noting that the treatment did not have any adverse effects on the endometrium, and there were no significant changes in bone density that were not expected due to aging,” Pinkerton said. OASIS 4 is significant because it enrolled patients from 90 international sites, including Europe and Canada, and well as women aged 18-70 years with 35 or more moderate-to-severe VMS a week while on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, Pinkerton added. “OASIS 4 showed significant relief in menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer, precisely the population that needs an effective, Food and Drug Administration-approved medication to treat their bothersome menopausal symptoms,” Pinkerton said. Cardoso reported financial relationships with Amgen, Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, GE Healthcare, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, IQVIA, Macrogenics, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merus, Mundipharma, Mylan, Novartis, Pfizer, Pierre Fabre, Prime Oncology, Roche, Samsung Bioepis, Sanofi, Seagen, Teva and touchIME. Pinkerton reported having financial relationships with Bayer, Pfizer, and Merck. Richard Mark Kirkner is a medical journalist based in Philadelphia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a kitchen spice help stop colorectal cancer before it starts? New research shows curcumin selectively attacks the stem-like cells that fuel early tumors, pointing to a promising, low-risk addition to current prevention strategies. In a recent study published in the journal Cancer Letters, a group of researchers investigated whether physiologically achievable curcumin can inhibit colorectal tumor initiation by inducing cancer stem-like cells in adenomas and early cancers to exit self-renewal and differentiate. Lifestyle shifts mean incidence is climbing fastest in adults under 50, amplifying the need for prevention. Most tumors arise from benign adenomas that evolve over decades, offering a long interception window. Evidence links daily aspirin to risk reduction, yet bleeding risks and incomplete protection leave many people unserved. Plant-derived compounds with proven safety, such as the kitchen spice curcumin, intrigue researchers but often fail because their mechanisms remain vague. However, further research is needed to confirm efficacy in at-risk populations, particularly for sporadic CRC (distinct from familial forms, such as FAP, where trial results have been mixed). Investigators collected fresh colorectal adenoma, carcinoma, and matched normal tissues from 66 consented patients for initial cancer stem cell (CSC) profiling (with additional samples used in subsequent assays). They dissociated samples into single cells, then quantified aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and epithelial surface antigen expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cancer stem-like cells. Cells grew as three-dimensional spheroids in serum-free media containing 0.01–10 μM curcumin or vehicle for four weeks, mirroring chronic oral intake. Parallel patient-derived explants (PDEs), intact micro-tissues, incubated for 24 h, assessed short-term responses. To gauge in vivo relevance, researchers implanted 2,000 ALDH-high cells subcutaneously into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice pre-fed a phytosomal (Meriva®) 0.2% curcumin diet. Tumor onset, size, and survival were tracked for 20 weeks. Western blotting, affinity pull-down with linker-conjugated curcumin beads, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays probed direct curcumin binding to the transcription factor NANOG. Finally, RNA sequencing of NANOG-overexpressing HCT116 spheroids after 24-hour and 72-hour exposures followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed pathway shifts toward differentiation. Curcumin suppressed stem-like behavior across various laboratory models, although its efficacy varied by patient sample and dose. In human spheroids, curcumin concentrations of 0.1–5 μM reduced sphere numbers by up to 95% in responsive patients and halved the ALDH-high fraction, with activity spanning multiple molecular subtypes, including those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Adenomas harbored the greatest baseline load of ALDH-high/CD133-negative cells (11.8% vs. 4.8% in normal mucosa), a population specifically enriched in premalignant tissue and highlighting a prime prevention target that curcumin efficiently depleted. Treated tumors exhibited 50–83% fewer ALDH-high and CD133-positive populations, indicating durable stem suppression in vivo. Importantly, curcumin trimmed doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-marked tuft stem cells in ApcMin/+ mutant mice yet spared normal intestines, underscoring selectivity. Mechanistically, curcumin bound the homeodomain and C-terminus of NANOG, a master regulator of colorectal cancer stem-like cells, and disrupted its DNA interaction. Low-dose exposure halved NANOG-driven luciferase activity and downshifted the focal adhesion kinase and BMI1 proto-oncogene pathways, without altering overall NANOG phosphorylation, suggesting a direct transcriptional blockade rather than protein destabilization. Patient-derived explants mirrored these effects after only 24 hours: curcumin eradicated the proliferative NANOG-positive/Ki67-positive compartment in 5 of 20 cases and reduced it by more than 35% in 8 additional cases; however, four samples showed no response or an increase in NANOG⁺ cells. Notably, effects were non-linear, with stronger responses at lower doses (0.1–1 μM) in some tissues. Furthermore, long-term spheroid culture demonstrated no acquired resistance to curcumin, with sustained sensitivity over repeated exposures spanning 142 days. Within 72 hours, with effects intensifying by 72 hours compared to 24-hour exposures, curcumin down-regulated embryonic stem gene signatures and up-regulated intestinal differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition brake pathways. These changes aligned with an emerging population of non-stem proliferating cells, supporting the idea that curcumin pushes aggressive precursors to mature into less dangerous lineages rather than merely killing them. To summarize, clinically attainable curcumin reprograms colorectal cancer stem-like cells, especially within early adenomas, steering them away from endless self-renewal and toward differentiation. By directly disabling NANOG, the spice depletes the proliferating stem pool associated with poor survival, prolongs life in xenografted mice, and leaves healthy intestinal stem cells intact. Dosing effects were complex, with U-shaped responses in some systems. These findings connect a familiar culinary ingredient to cutting-edge precision medicine and suggest that regular low-dose curcumin could complement existing measures, such as colonoscopy and aspirin, where bleeding risk or genetic background limits their use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) has identified a new brain imaging benchmark that may improve how researchers classify biologically meaningful changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, especially in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations. Using an advanced brain imaging scan called tau PET, the research team studied over 675 older adults from HABS-HD, aiming to identify the optimal brain signal that distinguishes individuals with clinically-relevant biological markers of AD from those who are aging normally. With these scans, researchers can establish tau cut-points, a new type of biomarker used to determine whether a scan shows an amount of tau protein in the brain high enough to suggest possible early signs of Alzheimer's disease or related conditions. This new benchmark could eventually inform the way clinicians interpret tau PET scans and better identify who may be at risk for AD. In this study, researchers compared tau PET scans of study participants who were cognitively impaired with those who were not impaired based on cognitive tests to establish a tau cut-point that would indicate a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. They found one-but it was only effective in certain circumstances. Our tau cut-point was able to distinguish whether study participants had cognitive impairment – but only when another abnormal protein, amyloid, was also present in those with cognitive impairment, and only in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White participants. In non-Hispanic Black participants, the tau cut-point did not perform as expected. Our study is an important step toward better understanding how tau relates to cognition in diverse populations and has important implications for future clinical trials that aim to target tau." They found that when tau levels in the medial temporal lobe­-a region deep in the brain-exceeded a certain threshold, it strongly indicated cognitive impairment related to AD. "While our findings support prior research linking medial temporal lobe tau to cognitive impairment, establishing a cut-point in this region using 18F-PI-2620, marks an important step toward defining tau positivity for both research and clinical applications. At the same time, the limited reliability of tau as an indicator of cognitive impairment in non-Hispanic Black participants highlights the need for more diverse populations in research and for future studies to examine both biological and social determinants of Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Victoria R. Tennant, a PhD candidate in USC's Neuroscience Graduate Program. The findings reflect a growing focus in AD research on making sure diagnostic tools work for everyone-not just in narrow clinical trial populations. Alzheimer's disease is known to affect the brain in stages. While amyloid plaques often build up early, tau tangles are more closely tied to memory loss and other symptoms. "This type of imaging is critical for understanding who is at risk and how the disease develops," said Stevens INI director Arthur W. Toga, PhD. "These findings are just the latest to come from HABS-HD, which is the most comprehensive study of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in diverse communities. We hope this work will lead to more personalized care and better outcomes for all communities." Establishing tau-PET cut-points for cognitive diagnosis with 18F-PI-2620 in a multi-ethnoracial cohort.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antibiotics are one of the greatest triumphs in the history of medical science - but these lifesaving tools have a dark side. Their persistent use can produce "superbugs" - drug-resistant microbes that pose a danger to humans, animals and the environment. In a first-of-its-kind pilot project, researchers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture and Arizona State University tested the novel integration of a handheld DNA sequencing device within Indonesia's national antibiotic resistance surveillance system across six chicken slaughterhouses in the Greater Jakarta area. They collected samples from both wastewater and surrounding rivers. The goal: to determine whether portable DNA sequencing could improve national efforts to track drug-resistant E. coli, a key indicator of antibiotic resistance. The study found signs that antibiotic-resistant bacteria from slaughterhouse wastewater may be reaching nearby rivers. In many cases, downstream sites had higher levels of resistant E. coli than upstream, pointing to a possible route for resistance to spread from animal waste into the environment. However, the study also showed how portable DNA sequencing can strengthen national surveillance efforts - making it easier to detect antibiotic resistance hotspots and paving the way for more targeted, cost-effective solutions to reduce its spread. Resistant E. coli strains can cause a range of illnesses, including diarrhea, especially in children, older adults and immunocompromised individuals. In certain settings, diarrhea isn't just uncomfortable - it's life-threatening." Lee Voth-Gaeddert, senior author, researcher with the ASU Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes He is joined by his Biodesign Institute colleagues and international collaborators. The mobile sequencing approach could be expanded to farms and wet markets, or adapted to track other pathogens such as bird flu. When people are infected with these bacteria, the usual antibiotics won't help. In 2021 alone, antibiotic resistance was linked to nearly 5 million deaths. The new project tested a device called MinION, which uses portable nanopore DNA sequencing to rapidly analyze genetic material at the point of collection. This strain of E. coli is often used as a proxy for detecting the presence and spread of other dangerous resistant bacteria. "It's not the nastiest one, but it is on the CDC list of pathogens of concern," said Voth-Gaeddert, who is also a senior Global Futures scientist with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory. "We often use it as a primary indicator of antibiotic resistance." Most of the E. coli found in wastewater was antibiotic resistant. "A lot of these slaughterhouses are positioned right next to rivers. The study documented large differences in how facilities managed their waste. Some had treatment systems in place, while others released their waste without treating it. Although the researchers did not assess how effective the treatment systems were, they detected antibiotic-resistant bacteria in both treated and untreated samples. Globally, wastewater from households, hospitals and agricultural runoff is a major source of antibiotic residues in rivers - especially in Southeast Asia, according to a recent study. When antibiotics linger in the environment, they create conditions that allow bacteria to develop new ways to resist them, making high-quality surveillance even more urgent. Many of the resistance genes they found were located on plasmids - small mobile pieces of DNA that can move between bacteria and spread resistance across species. Using the MinION device, the researchers identified these genes as well as virulence factors and specific bacterial strains with up to 100% agreement compared with traditional lab methods. The findings show that high-resolution genomic surveillance is feasible even outside elite research settings. "If we only use a narrow lens, we miss a lot of potential leverage points to control the spread of antibiotic resistance," Voth-Gaeddert said. That's why there's been such a big push to promote One Health." Indonesia's environmental diversity and experience with antibiotic resistance surveillance made it an ideal location for piloting new tools. But the insights are globally relevant as antibiotic resistance spreads across borders and ecosystems. Fast, affordable and locally accessible tools like the MinION may significantly advance our efforts to track and control a broad range of microbial threats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cup and a half of leafy green vegetables could go a long way to addressing atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ASVD's), new research from Edith Cowan University (ECU), the University of Western Australia and the Danish Cancer Institute has found. ASVDs are a subgroup of cardiovascular disease, which are current leading causes of death world-wide, primarily due to heart attacks and strokes. ECU PhD student Ms. Montana Dupuy noted that in Australia, cardiovascular diseases claim the life of one person every 12 minutes. Leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, like spinach, kale and broccoli, contain Vitamin K1 which may assist in preventing vascular calcification processes that characterize cardiovascular disease. The great news is that these vegetables can be easily incorporated into your daily meals." In addition to its' potential role in vascular calcification inhibition, Vitamin K may also be beneficial for musculoskeletal health, through its impact on bone strength. ECU Senior Research Fellow Dr. Marc Sim noted that a cup and a half of such vegetables is an easy way to increase our daily vitamin K intake and may lower our risk for cardiovascular disease". "This research found women who consumed approximately 30% higher intakes of Vitamin K1 than currently recommended in the Australian Dietary Guidelines had lower long-term risk of ASVD," he said. The work led by Ms. Dupuy and Dr. Sim on the impact of Vitamin K to vascular health, as well as musculoskeletal health, will now help to inform future research at ECU's Future Foods and Digital Gastronomy Lab and to deliver specialised meals as part of clinical trials to improve population health. "This research has provided key evidence to support our future studies. These novel foods can be used in communities with special nutritional and dietary requirements, such as aged care residents," said ECU Post Doctoral Research Fellow Dr. Liezhou Zhong. "We are consolidating all our epidemiological data and converting that into a tangible product that would benefit the community," he added. Higher vitamin K1 intakes are associated with lower subclinical atherosclerosis and lower risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease-related outcomes in older women.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in the European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience has shed light on the brain structure differences associated with psychopathy - a condition known to be one of the strongest predictors of persistent violent behavior. Using advanced neuroimaging and the Julich-Brain Atlas, researchers from Forschungszentrum Jülich, RWTH Aachen University ,Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Georg August University, (Germany) and University of Pennsylvania (USA) have identified specific brain networks that appear to be structurally altered in individuals exhibiting psychopathic traits. The study examined structural MRI data from 39 adult male participants diagnosed with psychopathy, compared with matched control subjects. Researchers assessed psychopathic traits using the Psychopathy Check-List (PCL-R), a well-established diagnostic tool that evaluates two key dimensions: interpersonal-affective traits (factor 1) and lifestyle-antisocial behaviour (factor 2). Results revealed that higher scores on factor 2 - related to antisocial tendencies - were linked to reduced volumes in multiple brain regions. These included subcortical areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain, as well as parts of the brainstem (pons), cerebellum, and cortical areas in the orbitofrontal and insular regions. These areas are known to play roles in emotion regulation, decision-making, impulse control, and social behaviour. In contrast, associations with factor 1 traits, such as pathological lying and lack of empathy, were weaker and more variable. Some volume differences were noted in the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral-frontal and left hippocampal areas, but the patterns were less consistent across individuals. The study's authors highlight that the findings suggest a particularly strong neurobiological link between antisocial behaviour and reduced brain volume across widespread regions.
