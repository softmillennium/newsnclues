Kirsten Gillibrand (New York) went on an Islamophobic rant against New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a radio interview on Thursday, spewing lies about Mamdani and suggesting that he would represent a threat to public safety if elected. In an appearance on WYNC's “Brian Lehrer Show,” the senator repeated numerous lies about Mamdani, echoing oft-repeated bigoted statements made about Palestinians and the pro-Palestine movement. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Her statements were completely removed from reality, and clearly informed by some of the worst hatred spread against Arabs, Muslims, and Palestinians in particular over the past decades. When you use a word like intifada, to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that means you are permissive for violence against Jews,” Gillibrand said. Her statements ignored the many times that Mamdani has denounced antisemitic violence — instead suggesting that Mamdani made an explicit call for violence when he did not. “I would be very specific in these words, and I would say you may not use them again if you expect to represent everyone, ever again, because they are received as hateful and divisive,” she said, discounting the many Arabic speakers for whom the word simply means “uprising.” “I just feel compelled to say, we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or has supported violent jihad, as the caller was asserting,” Lehrer said. Never once did she acknowledge the Muslim and Arab communities that she represents as senator of New York, who may feel alarmed by her blatant Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian bigotry. Directly following her comments, the conversation shifted to President Donald Trump's strikes on Iran, which Gillibrand criticized for being unauthorized by Congress but praised for their supposed strength. Many commentators noted the shocking nature of Gillibrand's bigotry, with some calling for her to resign. “I think she should resign for falsely smearing [Zohran Mamdani] as a terrorist,” said Zeteo Editor-in-Chief Mehdi Hasan. After a recording of the interview spread widely on X, Gillibrand's communications director claimed in a post that the senator “misspoke.” “She also highlighted that Mr. Mamdani assured her that, if elected, he would protect Jews and all residents of NYC,” her spokesperson said. But Gillibrand delivered her rant with confidence, without stuttering or hesitation, and went on for nearly six minutes. While she did offer scant acknowledgement of Mamdani's commitment to equal rights for all, those comments were nestled in between other parts of her rant. Gillibrand joins a large chorus of those on the right who spewed Islamophobia after Mamdani's landmark win on Tuesday, inciting violence against the Muslim politician. This bigotry has been taken to an extreme by some Republicans, with one, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tennessee), calling Mamdani a bigoted nickname while calling on him to be denaturalized and deported on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court punted on Friday in a major legal challenge to Louisiana's long-litigated congressional map, taking the unusual step of holding the case over for a second term. Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, dissented from the decision to hold the appeal over until next term. Louisiana filed the appeal, arguing that it was caught in an impossible position: At first, a federal court ruled that the state had likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority Black district out of six. When the state sought to comply with that decision by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of self-described “non-Black voters” sued, alleging the state violated the Constitution by relying too much on race to meet the first court's demands. “Congress requires this court to exercise jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to congressional redistricting, and we accordingly have an obligation to resolve such challenges promptly,” Thomas wrote in his dissent. Related article Supreme Court presses Louisiana on use of race during 2022 redistricting The Voting Rights Act requires that states not dilute the power of minority voters during the once-a-decade redistricting process, such as by “packing” those voters into one district or “cracking” neighborhoods of color up into many districts to spread out their influence. And yet the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause demands that a state not draw a map predominantly based on race. Because of that inherent tension between the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause, the Supreme Court has tended to give states some “breathing room” in drawing their maps. One of the central questions in the case, Louisiana v. Callais, was exactly how much room state lawmakers should have. The high court's conservative majority has grown increasingly skeptical of policies of any kind that, in the court's words, pick “winners and losers” based on race. In the most notable example, a six-justice majority ended affirmative action in college admissions in 2023 – a decision the Trump administration has used to justify attempts to curb diversity, equity and inclusion programs in both the government and private sector. Related article Supreme Court guts affirmative action in college admissions But in a surprise decision a decade later, the high court went in the other direction, bolstering a key provision of the law by ordering Alabama to redraw its map to allow for an additional Black-majority district. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, penned the opinion for a 5-4 majority, siding with the court's three liberals. Part of what was at issue in the Louisiana case is whether race “predominated” the redistricting process. State officials have said that, while they were responding to the first court's order about a second Black district, they also were focused mainly on politics – specifically a desire to draw the boundaries in a way that would retain incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. During oral arguments in March, Roberts described it as a “snake that runs from one end of the state to the other.” Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat, won the seat in last year's election – adding a second Democrat to the state's delegation.</p>

In the final sprint leading up to Zohran Mamdani's historic win on Tuesday, the New York City mayoral primary took on an unusually refreshing tone: one of cooperation. Shortly before early voting started, Mamdani, a state assemblymember and unabashed democratic socialist, cross-endorsed with City Comptroller Brad Lander. In spots where 33-year-old Mamdani's political resume was thin, Lander, a longtime local progressive leader, could add gravitas. And by appearing side-by-side at rallies, in social media videos, and on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” the two could work to dispel the lie that Muslim and Jewish New Yorkers need be divided. Their overarching message was clear: Vote for both of us, but keep disgraced former Gov. This collaborative approach to campaigning was enabled by New York City's ranked choice voting system, which voters overwhelmingly adopted for primaries and special elections in a 2019 ballot referendum. New York's system allows voters to rank their top five candidates rather than choose just one. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Advocates began pushing for ranked choice voting after the 2013 Democratic primaries for city council, when multiple candidates were elected with less than 40 percent of the vote. And proponents argued that, by eliminating the winner-takes-all approach, ranked choice voting could help lesser-known progressives band together to box out corporate-backed establishment candidates. During that election, it was two moderates, former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and businessman Andrew Yang, who formed a failed last-minute alliance in the hopes of keeping Adams out of city hall. But Garcia ultimately finished second, and Maya Wiley, a progressive candidate endorsed by the Working Families Party, trailed in third. Ranked choice voting might not seem relevant to this year's primary. After all, while ballot tabulation is still continuing in rounds, Mamdani's incredible grassroots campaign earned him a clear plurality of the vote right off the bat. Before election night was over, Cuomo had already conceded. It's a remarkable feat for Mamdani — a young socialist loudly opposed to Israel's genocide in Gaza — to beat out Cuomo's multimillion-dollar, super PAC-funded campaign, which fought tooth and nail to paint Mamdani as a radical antisemite. He is not the present or future of New York City. So, no, ranked choice voting didn't hand Mamdani his victory. It wasn't just Lander: Michael Blake, a former New York state assemblymember, also cross-endorsed with Mamdani and ramped up television ads in the days before the primary, urging his supporters not to rank Cuomo. The Working Families Party, a progressive group, encouraged its supporters to rank its slate of endorsed candidates and leave Cuomo off their ballot. Perhaps even more than “Vote For Me,” the message to New Yorkers before Election Day became “Don't Rank Cuomo.” “People were really excited about a politics that doesn't feel so selfish,” Lander told New York Magazine in an election postmortem on June 25. “I thought it was interesting yesterday that both Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo went out of their way to say, ‘I'm only voting for myself.' This collaborative approach made possible by ranked choice voting is not only ideologically aligned with the progressive left, but it also presents a materially different opportunity for candidates. Since the candidates never stopped running their campaigns, they could, in a way, pool their resources — and each reach their respective voting blocs with messaging they knew would ultimately help propel Mamdani, the clear progressive frontrunner, to victory. Plus, if ranked choice voting wasn't a threat to the status quo, then the Republican National Committee probably wouldn't have adopted a formal resolution calling to ban it. Ranked choice voting presents an exciting and underexplored opportunity for a more deeply democratic process. While Lander has a serious track record of policy wins for New York City's working class, he is also a self-described liberal Zionist who opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. His role, should he be elected in the November general election, will be to better the quality of life for working-class New Yorkers through social democratic policy-making. But within the political machine, let's think of this election as a first step — an example of how our democratic processes can more adequately represent the will of the people — and take what lessons we can to strategize for more solidarity in action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 150 pro-Palestinian activists have broken into a storage facility and damaged military equipment intended for Ukraine, the Belgian news outlet 7sur7 reported on June 26. The facility belongs to OIP Land Systems, a company that produces military equipment for Ukraine. The protesters, armed with hammers and grinders, first entered the company's offices, where they smashed computers, and then broke into the hangars, where they severely damaged some vehicles, Freddy Versluys, CEO of OIP Land Systems, said. That's all these Hamas sympathizers will have achieved with their action," Versluys said. Yet, the OIP Land Systems CEO claimed that his company has not produced defense systems for Israel for over 20 years. OIP Land Systems has provided defense products to Ukraine on several occasions, including Leopard 1 tanks, which are manufactured at the Tournai plant. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Ukrainian manufacturers will supply four million drones to the front line this year, while the Ukrainian army has already received up to 1.5 million drones as of the end of June, according to Umerov. Unlike Ukraine-skeptic Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Slovakia has not previously attempted to block EU sanctions. Governor Serhii Lysak said most of the injured were hospitalized. Active fighting is still taking place around the village of Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, home to one of Ukraine's largest lithium deposits, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces told the Kyiv Independent on June 27, denying reports Russia had occupied the village. Fiber optic cable now used to connect drone operators to FPVs ensures a perfect image and control experience all the way to the target — and cannot be spotted by enemy drone detectors. A day earlier, EU member states' leaders gave their political consent to extend the sanctions previously imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine. "Russia decided to plunge Kherson Oblast into darkness," Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on Telegram. He said the attack has disrupted electricity supply to multiple settlements. "After completing discussions on humanitarian issues, Ukraine plans to move forward to the topic of a leaders' summit for substantive dialogue," Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said during a press briefing on June 26. "We saw them on the battlefield — and it's truly motivating," Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday conferred a presidential award on  Mitsuo Ohashi, former chair of the Japan-Taiwan Exchange  Association (JTEA), in recognition of his contributions to  Taiwan-Japan relations. During a ceremony in Taipei, Lai presented the Order of  the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon to Ohashi, who led the  JTEA for 14 years, praising him as “a model of Taiwan- Japan friendship,” according to a Presidential Office news  release. Ohashi, who was on a short visit to Taiwan on Thursday  and Friday, said he would continue to promote peace in his  role as head of the Japan branch of the World Federalist  Movement, an organization dedicated to advancing global  cooperation and democratic governance. Ohashi was succeeded by Shuzo Sumi, the former head  of Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc., as the JTEA chair -- a  primarily ceremonial role -- on June 20. China might accelerate its strategic actions toward Taiwan, the South China Sea and across the first island chain, after the US officially entered a military conflict with Iran, as Beijing would perceive Washington as incapable of fighting a two-front war, a military expert said yesterday. The US' ongoing conflict with Iran is not merely an act of retaliation or a “delaying tactic,” but a strategic military campaign aimed at dismantling Tehran's nuclear capabilities and reshaping the regional order in the Middle East, said National Defense University distinguished adjunct lecturer Holmes Liao (廖宏祥), former McDonnell Douglas Aerospace representative in Taiwan. Prosecutors in New Taipei City yesterday indicted 31 individuals affiliated with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for  allegedly forging thousands of signatures in recall  campaigns targeting three Democratic Progressive Party  (DPP) lawmakers. The indictments stem from investigations launched earlier  this year after DPP lawmakers Su Chiao-hui (蘇巧慧) and  Lee Kuen-cheng (李坤城) filed criminal complaints  accusing campaign organizers of submitting false signatures  in recall petitions against them. The two cases were a Taiwanese and a foreign national who both arrived from Indonesia, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Lee Chia-lin (李佳琳) said. A 23-year-old Taichung man vowed to drink more water after his heavy consumption of sugary tea landed him in hospital with a kidney infection and sepsis. The man, surnamed Lin (林), used to drink two cups of half-sugar oolong tea while working at a food stall, where he often had to wait a long time before urinating. Lin developed kidney stones and noticed blood in his urine, but ignored the issue after taking medication for three days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nato chief Mark Rutte derided for calling US president ‘daddy' and showering him with praise over Iran The summit had concluded on Wednesday with a joint press conference in which Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte, after showering the US president with compliments over his actions on Iran, bizarrely referred to him as “daddy”. Rutte was now being widely derided for the summit's “orchestrated grovel” and attempting to row back on his choice of language. “Daddy's home!” trilled the video, which mixed clips of Trump's handshakes with world leaders with footage of crowds awaiting his motorcade, soundtracked by a 2010 song by Usher: “And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day …” The tone of Rutte's public bootlicking had been muted compared with the text messages he had sent to “dear Donald” before the summit – “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, it was truly extraordinary … you will achieve something NO president in decades could get done” – and which the president had immediately leaked. “I think he likes me,” smirked Trump later, while his cabinet giggled behind him. What is more cringeworthy, after all – the clips of Trump's cabinet members taking turns to parrot praise of his leadership and vision, or the fact that his fragile ego demands lavish compliments before he can get down to work? No doubt all the president's yes-men believe that lavishing him with praise can lead to lavish rewards. Take the former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who in 2020 presented him with a “bookshelf-sized” bronze model of Mount Rushmore, portraying Trump's face next to those of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Stephen Miller, who called Trump “the most stylish president in our lifetime”, is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Understood in those terms, he argues, performative upsucking is all. He points to Keir Starmer's first visit to Trump's Oval Office, when the UK prime minister theatrically brandished a letter from King Charles inviting Trump to a second state visit, saying, “This is really special, this is unprecedented.” “But in the longer term, he gets the Nato partners to sign up to 5% expenditure on defence, which is something he wants as much as Trump wants. “Mr Rutte, he's trying to embarrass you, sir,” Trump's former director of communications Anthony Scaramucci said earlier this week. “He's literally sitting on Air Force One laughing at you.” David H Dunn, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, agrees that licking Trump's boots doesn't earn his favour but his disdain. “There is a lot of evidence from the first term that Trump doesn't necessarily respond to flattery,” Dunn says. “It sends a signal that this is not an alliance of equals. What it looks like is fealty to the king.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 21 people and injuring more than 300 others, local officials reported. "Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere," he said. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition. "As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: "The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase." Lysak reported on June 27 that the death toll in Dnipro rose to 21. Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat. Active fighting is still taking place around the village of Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, home to one of Ukraine's largest lithium deposits, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces told the Kyiv Independent on June 27, denying reports Russia had occupied the village. A day earlier, EU member states' leaders gave their political consent to extend the sanctions previously imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine. "Russia decided to plunge Kherson Oblast into darkness," Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on Telegram. He said the attack has disrupted electricity supply to multiple settlements. "After completing discussions on humanitarian issues, Ukraine plans to move forward to the topic of a leaders' summit for substantive dialogue," Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said during a press briefing on June 26. "We saw them on the battlefield — and it's truly motivating," Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. "It's a crime," Ukraine's ambassador to India, Oleksandr Polishchuk, told Reuters. "We will share our investigation with our European Union colleagues, and we will kindly ask them to take the appropriate measures." Governor Serhii Lysak said most of the injured were hospitalized. "These are soldiers specially selected based on physical, psychological, and other criteria," Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov was officially named a suspect on June 23 in what Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau called a "large-scale" illegal land grab case. Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, local officials reported. According to acting Kursk Oblast governor Alexander Khinshtein, 63-year-old reporter Lu Yuguang from the Chinese television network Phoenix TV was wounded in a Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Korenevo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the last few years, Starbucks pulled out 30,000 comfortable seats, installed hard wooden stools, blocked electrical outlets and turned stores into takeout counters for customers picking up orders off its mobile app. Now Starbucks is trying to win back customers looking to sit down for a cup of coffee by renovating 1,000 stores — 10% of its company-owned US locations—with comfy chairs, couches, tables and power outlets in the next year. The company aims to make changes to all of its US stores within the next three years for an undisclosed price tag. “It's creating comfortable seating where people want to come in. It's not just the quick grab and go concept,” Mike Grams, Starbucks' chief operating officer, said in an interview with CNN last week at one of the first remodeled stores in Bridgehampton, New York. “Maybe over past years, we lost our way a little bit on that.” Starbucks redesigned four stores in the Hamptons and plans to remodel New York City locations next quarter. The design was minimalist, with a mix of light and dark-brown wood tones, dark-green walls and soft lighting. Plants and bowls of coffee beans were placed around the store. At the Bridgehampton store, people were having conversations in low, cushioned armchairs, orange booth seats and high-top tables for two. Other customers were sitting in wood chairs on their laptops at small tables. The big question is whether these changes go far enough to reverse Starbucks' slide. The company is getting squeezed by independent coffee shops, growing chains like Blank Street Coffee and Blue Bottle Coffee and drive-thru companies such as Dutch Bros. Customers have also balked at Starbucks' prices. But I think it makes a psychological difference,” said Joseph Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons, who criticized Starbucks for “commoditizing itself” through mobile orders in a Harvard Business Review article last year. “It sends a signal to sit down and spend some time here,” he said. Despite a riser and a dedicated pickup shelf for mobile orders, customers piled up near the counter, waiting for their pickups and hovering near customers sitting down with their coffee. Starbucks said it's soon implementing technology that more efficiently sequences orders and a new staffing model that will help alleviate congestion at the counters. Since arriving from Chipotle last year, Niccol, the Mr. Fix-It of the fast food industry known for leading turnarounds at Taco Bell and Chipotle, has brought back a Starbucks tradition of baristas doodling on cups in Sharpie pens; reinstated self-serve milk and sugar stations; cut 30% of the menu; and ended its open-bathroom policy. “‘Back to Starbucks' is bringing Starbucks back to the brand that we all grew up with,” said Grams, who was the president of Taco Bell and took over as Starbucks' COO in February. “It's just making sure that you keep everything balanced and you create that sense of real comfort in our cafes.” The new leadership team is trying to position Starbucks' coffee shops as a “third place” again. Starbucks' longtime leader Howard Schultz envisioned the company's stores as a location where people could relax that wasn't their workplace or their home, designing stores for people to spend hours in plush purple armchairs, socializing and connecting. The third place idea became part of Starbucks' corporate mythology. But Starbucks struggled to maintain this identity as it built drive-thru stores and catered to the rise of mobile orders, which now make up more than a third of Starbucks' sales. Starbucks tried to serve customers looking for both a local coffee shop vibe and those who prioritized speed at the same time. The company ended up alienating both, said RJ Hottovy, an analyst who covers the restaurant industry at data analytics firm Placer.ai. “People want more third place options out there,” Hottovy said. Starbucks is trying to return to its past, but stores won't look like they did 20 years ago. Starbucks said the fabric was easily worn and hard to keep clean. “You will see something similar to it returning to our stores,” said Meredith Sandland, a former Taco Bell executive who became Starbucks' chief coffeehouse development officer in February. Each redesign will look slightly different, she said, but they will all include new lighting, colors, better acoustics and other improvements across more than 10,000 company-owned US locations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO's summit declaration makes no mention of its open-door policy for the first time in three decades; the Serbian Parliament seeks to probe into alleged arms exports to Ukraine; and the EU summit in Brussels indicates that Moldova, not Ukraine, is currently poised to move forward with accession negotiations. For over 30 years, this provision had consistently appeared in all of the alliance's concluding documents. Experts believe the omission was a tactical decision aimed at avoiding provoking US President Donald Trump, who opposes Ukraine's accession to the bloc. Russia is firmly opposed to NATO enlargement, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia. "Everything at the NATO summit was done so as not to antagonize Trump. The alliance has outlasted many politicians and will outlast Trump. However, some experts do not rule out that NATO's enlargement policy may shift in the future. After all, opposition to Ukraine's accession is not limited to Washington - several European nations, primarily Hungary and Slovakia, are also against it. But many in Europe also don't want to admit Ukraine. So, a tactical move could evolve into a strategic one," Andrey Kortunov, an expert with the Valdai Discussion Club, told Izvestia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has already halted arms exports and pledged to establish oversight of future shipments. Experts believe Vucic will make good on these commitments. "We have initiated a hearing within the Defense Committee in Parliament on this matter. Our parliamentary group ‘We - Voice from the People' made a statement in Parliament in which we included two matters: arms deliveries and Vucic's trip to Odessa to meet with Zelensky (on June 11, for the Ukraine-Southeast Europe Summit)," Stanojevic told Izvestia. The issue of the Moscow-Belgrade-Kiev triangle gained prominence in late May, when the press office of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service reported that, contrary to Belgrade's declared "neutrality," Serbian defense enterprises continued supplying munitions to Kiev, Izvestia writes. These actions, according to the report, were being disguised through schemes involving falsified end-user certificates and intermediary countries, primarily the Czech Republic, Poland, and Bulgaria. On June 23, Vucic announced the suspension of all munitions exports. "There has been a certain degree of tension in bilateral relations, but both sides have promptly engaged in addressing the sensitive issues. The Serbian side pledged to strengthen its oversight of military-industrial exports to ensure they do not reach the Kiev regime. In turn, Moscow affirmed that it trusts Belgrade on this matter but will continue to monitor the situation independently," the expert noted. The two-day European Union summit that opened on Thursday, June 26, in Brussels confirmed that Ukraine should not expect swift progress toward European integration. European leaders are unlikely to make any such promises while the Russian-Ukrainian conflict continues, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Among all post-Soviet states, Moldova currently holds the strongest prospects for entering substantive negotiations on EU accession. In the meantime, the European Union is bracing for a prolonged standoff with Russia - a confrontation that, according to one summit participant, may extend at least through 2028. It is within the EU, more so than at NATO meetings, that critical decisions are now made on supplying military aid to Ukraine, and it is there that the West's strategic posture toward Russia is increasingly defined. As a result, the first day of the EU summit was heavily focused on security matters - albeit in a distinct context. Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly stated, from various platforms, that the only reliable guarantee for his country's security lies in membership in NATO or the EU, ideally both. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reassured other summit participants that Budapest's stance is unwavering. Speaking to journalists ahead of the summit, Romanian President Nicusor Dan stated that negotiations are underway across 33 chapters, and at the summit scheduled to take place in Chisinau on July 4, talks will also take place along these lines. According to the newspaper, it is now clear there will be no further delays, and Moldova, which had previously advanced toward the EU at the same pace as Ukraine, is now poised to outpace its neighbor. The global price of platinum has climbed to its highest level since September 2011, surpassing $1,400 per troy ounce, according to data from Comex, a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). At its peak during trading, platinum touched $1,418 per ounce, representing a 5% gain. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti attribute platinum's sharp price rally to a persistent global supply deficit exacerbated by declining production and geopolitical tensions. According to the June report from the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), the primary driver behind this price rally is geopolitical instability, particularly ongoing trade wars that continue to disrupt global commerce, including supply chains. An additional 1.6 mln ounces are expected to enter the market through recycling, which is 3% higher than last year, WPIC data show. Platinum is one of the rarest naturally occurring metals. It is highly resistant to corrosion, has a very high melting point, and is widely used as a catalyst in chemical processes. Alexander Potavin, an analyst at Finam Investment Group, noted that a "strong price rally" has begun due to the persistent supply deficit amid shrinking output. He pointed out that in recent years, platinum prices have significantly lagged behind gold and silver. India, one of the key buyers of Russian thermal coal, increased its imports from Russia in May to the highest level in two years. While a significant increase in Russia's market share in India is unlikely due to rising domestic production and high port inventories, experts believe that maintaining current shipment levels is entirely feasible. Since June 2023, monthly exports from Russia had not exceeded 1 mln tons. India's total thermal coal imports in May increased seasonally by 10% month-over-month to 17.4 mln tons, the highest level since June 2024, CCI noted, citing data from Bigmint. Russia accounted for approximately 7.5% of India's total coal purchases. "In India, the monsoon season began earlier this year, which means hydropower generation will put pressure on thermal generation and coal consumption," he noted. According to Nariman Taiketayev, Director of the Corporate Ratings Group at National Credit Ratings (NCR), favorable market conditions prompted India to reduce its imports of lower-calorific-value Indonesian coal in favor of higher-grade Russian coal, which is offered at competitive prices. Russian suppliers, he added, are generally more amenable to flexible pricing. He also emphasized that India's future demand for coal will depend on a combination of price dynamics and weather-related factors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Environmental groups, immigration advocates and Native Americans decry idea to set up the outdoor detention camp Environmental groups, immigration rights activists and a Native American tribe have decried the construction of a harsh outdoor migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades billed by state officials as “Alligator Alcatraz”. Crews began preparing the facility at a remote, largely disused training airfield this week in support of the Trump administration's aggressive goal of arresting and incarcerating 3,000 undocumented migrants every day. Florida officials say the Everglades camp, which has been criticized by the Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost as “a cruel spectacle”, will open in the first week of July – a month in which south Florida's daily heat index regularly exceeds 100F (37.8C). Initially, about 100 Florida national guard troops will provide “security” at the base, a spokesperson said on Thursday, a number likely to increase as its detainee population grows. It now faces staunch opposition from an alliance of groups. These groups say housing up to 5,000 detainees in tents in the heat and humidity of the Florida summer, at a site surrounded by marshes and wetlands containing alligators, Burmese pythons and swarms of mosquitoes, amounts to inhumane treatment. We are swamp creatures,” he told the conservative podcast host Benny Johnson in a reveal of the scheme on Monday that bordered on mockery. People get out, there's not much waiting for them other than pythons and alligators.” The airfield's 11,000ft runway, he said, was perfect for large planes bringing in scores of undocumented persons detained by Ice from all over the US. “The state would save substantial taxpayer dollars by pursuing its goals at a different location with more existing infrastructure and less environmental and cultural impacts to the Big Cypress and Tribal lands,” Talbert Cypress, chair of the Miccosukee Tribe, said in a statement posted to social media. She said the project would have a “potentially devastating impact to the Everglades”, and noted that the state and federal government had invested billions of dollars in Everglades restoration efforts, some of which she fears could now be undone. “We continue to have concerns about how a facility at this scale can operate without impacts to the surrounding ecosystem,” she said. Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said the site was found unsuitable for development in the 1960s, when ambitious plans to make it a six-runway Everglades jetport with monorail service ferrying tourists to Florida's east and west coasts, was thwarted by environmental activism. “All the reasons this was terrible back then still exist today,” she said. “These are really valuable and protected Everglades wetlands, and if we move forward with a thousand-bed prison detention facility, whether it's temporary or not, there will be impacts from ancillary development, water and sewer impacts, water supply needs, traffic impacts. Those impacts were analyzed a half-century ago, and we know that they would be negative. Neither the Florida department of emergency management, which is managing construction of the camp, nor Uthmeier's office responded to requests for comment. The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said. Immigration advocates, meanwhile, say the Everglades camp represents a sinister ramping up of the DeSantis's already vigorous endorsement of Donald Trump's agenda. “There's no adequate running water or plumbing facilities. Uthmeier is out there saying we don't need to build brick and mortar because we'll just throw some tents up in the middle of the swamp, in July, in hurricane season, with the heat, no proper infrastructure and the mosquitoes. “Donald Trump, his administration, and his enablers have made one thing brutally clear: they intend to use the power of government to kidnap, brutalize, starve, and harm every single immigrant they can,” he said. “They target migrants, rip families apart, and subject people to conditions that amount to physical and psychological torture. Now, they want to erect tents in the blazing Everglades sun and call it immigration enforcement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week's ceasefire follows one of the largest air campaigns in Middle Eastern history.Leo Correa/The Associated Press Eliot Pence is the founder of Tofino Capital and the former head of international growth for Anduril Industries. Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday committed to the biggest defence-spending increase in generations: a bump to 5 per cent of the economy by 2035. We have not seen such a number since the Second World War. How exactly should we go about this spending? The newly paused war between Israel and Iran offers some lessons. Over a span of just 10 days, Iran launched roughly 1,000 drones and more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel – the largest direct strike ever by Tehran. In response, Israel conducted a sweeping counteroffensive: it pre-emptively destroyed nearly 950 drones before launch, struck over 120 missile launchers, and reportedly intercepted 90 per cent of incoming missiles. Carney commits Canada to biggest increase in military spending since Second World War, doubling budget by 2035 This exchange didn't escalate into a broader regional war, but it could have. More importantly, it exposes two parallel – and increasingly divergent – modes of modern conflict. But it also required deep stockpiles and industrial resilience. The pace and scale of intercepts raised uncomfortable questions: how long could such a defence be sustained if the barrage had continued for another week? Houthi drone attacks on shipping in the Red Sea launched from Yemen, rocket fire from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and years of militia activity in Syria and Iraq all represent this slow-burning form of conflict. It doesn't seek rapid escalation but instead applies continuous pressure – stretching logistics, fraying political cohesion, and forcing costly deployments over years, not days. As Mr. Carney looks to upgrade Canada's Armed Forces, this duality of modern warfare we recently saw in the Middle East should be instructive. What the war in Ukraine began to prove – that attritable systems such as loitering munitions, quadcopters, and off-the-shelf electronic-warfare kits are not auxiliary but essential –the Iran–Israel conflict has now reinforced: even technologically advanced countries are constrained by their ability to produce and replenish at speed. Exquisite systems like the F-35 or submarines take years, billions, and vertically integrated supply chains. But attritable systems require speed, iteration, and commercial adaptability. Canada's defence posture must therefore evolve to accommodate both. We need a force that can deter state-level threats and respond to proxy engagements; one that can deploy the $50-million jet and the $5,000 drone in complementary fashion. But if we succeed, we can combine speed with precision, resilience with sophistication, and field a force ready not just for one kind of war – but for both. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to jets that cost $5-million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serbia's political establishment will not be able to maintain good relations with the Russian authorities if they supply ammunition and weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces, as they can't be on both sides at once, Natalia Nikonorova, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs and former head of the DPR Foreign Ministry, told TASS. On June 24, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced that his country had ceased all exports of ammunition and that all domestically-made arms would now be reserved for the country's own military use. According to him, weapons will only be exported in exceptional cases and only with special government approval. He also claimed that, following the decision to suspend arms and ammunition exports, Belgrade came under serious pressure, including threats to organize protests at defense industry enterprises. There's no sitting on the fence in this situation. The Serbian politician will have to make a concrete choice. Only actions, not words, will show what that choice is," Nikonorova said. "With regard to the Russian-Serbian alliance, we are referring to genuine bonds that have united our peoples for decades. On June 23, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) reported that ammunition produced at Serbian defense enterprises, mainly for heavy long-range systems, "is sent to NATO countries in the interests of Ukraine in the form of complete sets of parts for assembly."
