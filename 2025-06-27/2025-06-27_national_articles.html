Todd Sawhill provides analysis of the B-2 bomber strikes aimed at destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites. President Donald Trump is not like his predecessors. Confronting a hostile regime in Tehran that has played American presidents for 35 years, the commander in chief took decisive action on Saturday to keep his promise that he would never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Operation Midnight Hammer was a success — America's fine men and women in uniform destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities and came home safe. In the aftermath of the war between Israel and Iran, President Trump will need to employ all his dealmaking acumen to maintain a fragile ceasefire and — most importantly — to keep his promise to prevent America from being dragged into another forever war in the Middle East. Recent history has taught us that it won't be easy. In the Balkans, President Bill Clinton laid the groundwork for liberal interventionism — boots on the ground for "peacekeeping," moral preening, and no plan for what comes next. Then, in the wake of the devastating attacks on 9/11, instead of confining himself to destroying the terrorists who had used Afghanistan as a base, President George W. Bush implemented this same playbook: launching an invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein while prolonging the U.S. presence in Afghanistan to nation build. At the time, I supported it, as did more than 70% of Americans and almost 90% of Republicans. But soon, Iraq devolved into a sectarian nightmare that led to thousands of dead soldiers and decades of regional instability. Meanwhile, the "good war" in Afghanistan went sour as dreams of a liberal democracy ran up against the reality of the "graveyard of empires." America's experience in Iraq and Afghanistan transformed my view of foreign policy. So much so, that by the time President Barack Obama pursued a disastrous intervention in Libya, I was decidedly opposed to it. Millions of conservatives, bitter at being sold a bill of goods by their own party, had this same experience. They wanted a new type of national security policy focused on their needs and interests. And when President Trump — whose longstanding opposition to the Iraq war was well known — announced his campaign in 2016, they rallied behind him. Throughout his first term, President Trump rewarded their confidence time and again — and proved what the Art of the Deal could achieve on the world stage. He dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb used in combat by the United States on Afghanistan, ruthlessly decimated ISIS, and took out Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani. But he always prevented these aggressive actions from becoming protracted conflicts, and he never allowed the Middle East to absorb his attention to the detriment of more important national security priorities: securing our borders and deporting illegal immigrants, pushing our allies in NATO to pay their fair share for our common defense, and confronting America's number one adversary, China. No doubt, the current conflict between Iran and Israel is more serious than any that occurred in the region during Trump's first administration. And the United States' involvement is more direct, more dangerous, and more likely to escalate into a wider war if not checked by firm, prudent leadership, capable of completing the President's stated mission to deny the Iranian regime a nuclear weapon without drifting into other lanes, notably regime change. But that's entirely in President Trump's wheelhouse. This is why millions of Americans, disheartened by the surrender of Afghanistan and grinding war in Ukraine overseen by President Joe Biden, went to the ballot box in November to bring him back to the White House. And if he can now keep us out of war and focused on the various domestic challenges that confront us — from our falling birth rate to our failing schools — it will be one of the greatest accomplishments in modern American history. Because President Trump is not like his predecessors. He is a statesman who makes deals on behalf of the American people. And in this uncertain moment, as we are poised to celebrate America's 249th Independence Day, that's exactly what we need. For America's freedom is hard-won and easily squandered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate. On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that parents with religious objections to books with LGBTQ+ characters must be allowed to opt their children out of any public school instruction that uses those books. The Mahmoud case highlights the Republican justices' impatience to remake constitutional law in a more socially conservative image, especially in cases involving religion. It is certainly possible for public school instruction to violate a religious child's constitutional rights. The Constitution, for example, forbids government institutions like public schools from coercing students into violating their religious views. But, as a federal appeals court which previously heard the Mahmoud case warned, we don't actually know whether the Constitution was violated in this case. Although Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ+ characters for use in public schools, the lower court found that the record in this case contains no information “about how any teacher or school employee has actually used any of the Storybooks in the Parents' children's classrooms, how often the Storybooks are actually being used, what any child has been taught in conjunction with their use, or what conversations have ensued about their themes.” Nevertheless, Alito handed down a fairly broad opinion which is likely to impose substantial new burdens on public schools, and he did so without waiting until the record in this case was more fully developed by lower courts. The plaintiffs in Mahmoud include Muslim and Christian parents who do not want their children exposed to these books. And their lawyers came to the Supreme Court with an audacious request — seeking a broad decision that parents who object to any form of classroom instruction on religious grounds must be notified in advance, and be permitted to opt their child out of that instruction. In the past, parents have sued school districts objecting, on religious grounds, to lessons that touch on topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, and “immodest dress.” They've objected to books which expose readers to evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” Courts have historically been very cautious about ruling in favor of parents who raise these sorts of objections, in part due to concerns that schools would be overwhelmed by administrative burden. Nevertheless, the Court's decision in Mahmoud largely embraces the plaintiffs' request — Alito orders the school board to notify parents “in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.” Alito's opinion does not discuss how this rule should apply to parents with more uncommon religious beliefs, but the Constitution forbids the government from treating people with idiosyncratic religious beliefs differently than people with more common beliefs. The upshot is that a school may also need to warn parents if a teacher wants to read from a Harry Potter book (because those books are about magic), or if they want to teach a lesson about a famous pacifist like Martin Luther King Jr. Schools may even need to warn parents if any of their children's teachers are women, just in case a parent objects on religious grounds to women having achievements outside of the home. That said, Alito's opinion is slightly narrower than the Mahmoud plaintiffs' proposed framework. Alito argues that the books at issue are objectionable, not just because they feature LGBTQ+ characters, but because they suggest that certain aspects of queer culture should be “celebrated.” One of the contested books is a medieval fairy tale about a prince who marries a knight. Thus, Alito claims, this book is objectionable not because it includes a same-sex wedding, but because it portrays this wedding as a good thing. Similarly, Alito would likely permit women to work as teachers without warning parents of their femininity, so long as the teacher does not do anything to celebrate their womanhood or suggest that being a woman who works outside the home is a good thing. Mahmoud is likely to impose a Florida-style “Don't Say Gay” regime on every public school classroom in America. Nor is it clear when a book crosses the line from merely mentioning a gay character to celebrating some aspect of gay culture. Lawyers, meanwhile, have a financial incentive to sue schools that behave more boldly. And suits enforcing Mahmoud are considered civil rights cases because they arise under the First Amendment's religious liberty provisions. So, lawyers can search for schools that teach books with LGBTQ+ characters, find a parent who objects to those books, and then sue and demand that the school district pay their client's bills. School districts that don't want to be treated like an ATM for anti-LGBTQ+ lawyers, meanwhile, will only be able to avoid these lawsuits by excluding queer-themed books from the classroom entirely. The Supreme Court, in other words, has decided that in order to accommodate one identity group — religious conservatives — schools should be hypercautious about teaching books that feature members of another identity group — LGBTQ+ people. Given the Court's Republican majority, that decision is not a surprise. The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿ The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justice Amy Coney Barrett dismissed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent to a new Supreme Court decision that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against the executive branch, a problem that the Trump administration has faced for months. Jackson claimed lower courts do not have limits on their authority to issue universal injunctions, writing that the executive branch should always comply with said injunctions. Barrett did not entertain her liberal colleague's argument. “We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,” Barrett wrote in the 6-3 majority opinion. The Supreme Court ruled Friday that district courts exceeded their power by issuing universal injunctions against President Donald Trump's executive order to take away birthright citizenship for children of those who entered the country illegally. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh joined Barrett in the majority opinion. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Jackson in the dissenting opinion. Barrett continued critiquing Jackson's reasoning and cited the Judiciary Act of 1789, which requires judges to observe their limits on judicial authority. Barrett said Jackson “skips over that part” because the law “involves boring ‘legalese,'” as Jackson put it. “Justice Jackson would do well to heed her own admonition: ‘Everyone, from the President on down, is bound by law,'” Barrett concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump on Iran: President Donald Trump said he would “absolutely” consider bombing Iranian nuclear sites again if he thought it necessary. His comments come as his administration projects confidence in the success of last weekend's strikes in Iran, but has not provided new intelligence supporting Trump's claim that its nuclear program was “obliterated.” • Congress split over intel brief: Lawmakers left a classified briefing on Iran today divided along party lines, with Republicans reinforcing their belief that the US strikes were effective, while some Democrats expressed skepticism. • Effort to revive talks: ﻿Tehran has no plans to resume nuclear negotiations with the US, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Thursday. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN the Trump administration is engaged in secret diplomatic efforts to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table. • Israel's military strategy: The defense minister has instructed Israel's military to prepare an “enforcement plan” aimed at maintaining air superiority over Iran. Following the all-House classified briefing on Iran, GOP Rep. Greg Murphy said the purpose of the US strikes was never to get rid of Iran's nuclear material, but to eliminate certain aspects of Tehran's nuclear program. He argued, “People who are playing second-hand quarterback, they didn't want us to send in troops. Do you want us to send in troops and really make sure? Texas Republican Michael McCaul, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN that “most of” the uranium is still at Iran's nuclear facilities. Asked whether he's concerned about where the uranium may be, McCaul said he thinks most of it remains at the facilities. “My understanding is most of it's still there, so we need a full accounting that's why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the IAEA can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that's there, I don't think it's going out of the country, I think it's at the facilities,” McCaul said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency. CNN's Manu Raju and Nicky Robertson contributed reporting to this post. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Friday's classified briefing for House members about the US strikes against Iran, saying she was “almost sorry” she attended and later adding she would not have authorized the mission. So … let's just say, very clearly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” she said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CNN following the same briefing, “So a lot of unanswered questions about how long this has actually set back the Iranian nuclear capability, and I still have a very strong view that ultimately we need verification and diplomacy to succeed.” “Sure, without question, absolutely – it has to be unbelievable,” Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room when asked specifically if he would consider bombing the country if future intelligence reports offered a concerning conclusion on Iranian enrichment of uranium. Trump said he does not believe that Iran can “go back into nuclear anytime soon,” following last weekend's US strikes on their nuclear sites. The president also said Friday he was “not really” concerned about secret nuclear sites in Iran when asked about that possibility, suggesting that the country is more focused on survival for the time being. The last thing they're thinking about right now is nuclear. They're thinking about tomorrow, trying to live,” he said. In a post on X Friday, Katz said the plan would include “maintaining Israel's air superiority, preventing nuclear and missile development, and responding to Iranian support for terrorist activity.” Katz described the Israeli operations against Iran as “12 days of brilliant action” that eliminated Iranian air defenses and destroyed its missile production. “We eliminated senior security officials and leading scientists advancing the nuclear program, he said. Katz ended his post: “A word of caution to the toothless serpent's head in Tehran: Operation “Rising Lion” was only the preview of a new Israeli policy — after October 7th, immunity is over.” “If you ask me: ‘Commander, what is the decisive element of victory? Therefore, we need to get there, and we need to create the impact that will make them feel exposed — finished. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that Iran must directly negotiate with the US, after leaving a classified all-member briefing on the recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. “And one of the things that was discussed this morning is that we now need Iran to engage with us in direct good faith talks, negotiations, not through third parties, not through other countries. They need to sit down at the table with us and ensure that this peace is truly lasting,” Johnson said. “I would say it's a substantial setback that was a firsthand, authoritative and reliable account that differs greatly from the low confidence preliminary assessment that was leaked, sadly and dangerously, probably from this body, and we're going to get down to the bottom of that. But you can dismiss the low-level initial assessment, and you can rely upon what the CIA has said, because these are firsthand accounts,” Johnson said. And I think their key facilities have been disabled. And I think Iran is now a long time away from doing what they might have done before this very successful operation,” he continued. Johnson noted that there was support from his colleagues on both sides of the aisle during the briefing, leading to some applause. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he is looking at ways to limit the classified information lawmakers can receive after President Donald Trump said he wants to restrict the flow of intelligence going forward. Johnson did not rule out eliminating classified briefings for the entire House going forward. Johnson added: “Clearly there was a leak, and you can't have that. Some context: According to an early US defense intelligence assessment that was described by seven people briefed on it, the US military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities last weekend did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only set it back by months, as CNN and others reported. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said a day later, however, that “a body of credible intelligence” indicated Iran's nuclear program was “severely damaged” by the US strikes and that “several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says that had Iran not responded to Israeli strikes this month, the situation could have escalated into a “full-scale and uncontrollable war in the region.” They hit residential buildings, hospitals, and places of work.” The Iranian health ministry has said that 627 people were killed in Iran by Israeli military action. Like other Iranian officials, Pezeshkian has cast the conflict as a victory for Iran. As agencies struggle to distribute the limited aid that is allowed into Gaza, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday that the enclave's entire population was projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity, with nearly 500,000 facing what it called “catastrophic levels of food insecurity.” OCHA said Thursday that “to meet humanitarian needs and help reduce looting, it is essential to get more humanitarian and essential commercial goods into Gaza, and to facilitate their safe distribution across the Strip.” OCHA added that six out of 17 attempts to coordinate humanitarian movements inside Gaza were outright rejected by the Israeli authorities. “Our hope is this will be a temporary pause and all other aid organizations will soon be able to resume distribution in the region,” its interim Executive Director John Acree said. An Israeli official confirmed to CNN that only GHF had distributed aid on Thursday. The Israeli agency that handles the transfer of aid into Gaza – COGAT – said Wednesday that 150 humanitarian aid trucks carrying food, baby food and formula, as well as medical supplies and medications, had been transferred to northern and southern Gaza. On the same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz claimed that Hamas was “once again seizing control of humanitarian aid entering the northern Gaza Strip” and ordered the Israeli military to present an action plan to prevent Hamas from taking aid within 48 hours. The Palestinian health ministry said that two more children have died of malnutrition in Gaza. Dr. Muneer Alboursh, director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, told CNN that one child died in Gaza City “as a result of malnutrition caused by a lack of milk and starvation.” A 3-month old baby girl also died in Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza. An Israeli blockade on aid began in early March and was only partially relaxed last month, and there has been a growing incidence of looting of aid supplies. Looting sparks clashes: The looting also led to fighting between a clan based in Khan Younis in southern Gaza and a police branch affiliated with Hamas, according to journalists and witnesses. Nahed Shehaibar, head of the Private Transport Association, told CNN that 60 trucks carrying supplies on behalf of the World Food Programme crossed into Gaza on Thursday morning – but more than 50 had been stolen in Khan Younis. The trucks were carrying flour and aid packages, according to Sheihaibar. This followed a similar pattern to that on Wednesday, when more than 70 aid trucks were stolen in the same area, according to Shehaibar. The looting led to gunbattles between a group accused of being involved in the theft and Hamas' Arrow unit, according to journalists in Khan Younis, fighting that damaged the nearby Nasser Medical complex. ET today, giving House members their turn following Thursday's closed-door session in the Senate. Following the highly anticipated classified Senate briefing, Democrats and Republicans disagreed on exactly how much the US strikes on Iran set back that country's nuclear program. Many Republicans said that they believe it will now take Iran years longer to build a nuclear weapon, though some acknowledged the threat is not completely neutralized. But Democrats said the picture is far less clear — with one senator saying the US strikes set Iran back only months. Video from the area showed a series of large explosions, while Lebanon's National News Agency reported an “intense aerial attack.” The Israeli military has continued to carry out attacks in south Lebanon since a ceasefire was agreed last November after more than a year of cross-border attacks by Hezbollah and strikes by Israeli forces against the group. Israel's military says it struck more than 900 targets inside Iran during its unprecedented “Operation Rising Lion.” CNN has previously reported on the death of Iran's highest-ranking military officer, the head of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its air force. The operation struck more than 900 targets overall, destroying 200 missile launchers – which the IDF claimed accounted for half of all of Iran's launchers. Earlier on Thursday, Israel's defense minister said in an interview with Channel 13 that there had not been an opportunity to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during Operation Rising Lion – but said Israel would have “taken him out” if one had arisen. Qom is considered Iran's holy city – home to its largest and most famous Shia seminary, where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei once studied. That's why these terrors and wars will only strengthen our faith instead of weakening us,” one cleric told CNN. Another said: “If Trump ever has goodwill, do not mess with countries and let people live their lives.” Iran has acknowledged that the US strikes caused “serious” damage. Democratic and Republican senators at the classified briefing gave differing accounts of exactly how much the strikes set back Iran's nuclear program. The Iran-Israel ceasefire that ended 12 days of conflict appears to still be holding. The Pentagon held a widely anticipated briefing giving new details on the US strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, but did not provide new intelligence supporting President Donald Trump's assertion that the strikes “obliterated” Iran's nuclear program. And after the classified Senate briefing on Operation Midnight Hammer on Thursday, Democrats and Republicans came away with different narratives. The White House declined to say Thursday how it will limit the classified information it shares with Congress, or how it will respond to lawmakers who insist their oversight duties necessitate access to the information. “This administration wants to ensure that classified intelligence is not ending up in irresponsible hands, and that people who have the privilege of viewing this top-secret classified information are being responsible with it,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a briefing. “And unfortunately, clearly, someone who had their hands on this — and it was a very few people, very few number of people in our government who saw this report… That person was irresponsible with it,” Leavitt added, referring to the early Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that found US strikes on Iran did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only set it back by months. The Trump administration is planning to limit what it shares with Congress, a senior White House official told CNN on Wednesday, believing that the report came out after it was posted on Monday to CAPNET, a system used for sharing classified intelligence with Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VENICE, Italy (AP) — The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fiancée Lauren Sánchez, who have traveled into space — and expectations are just about as high for their wedding in Venice. One of the world's most enchanting cities as backdrop? Still, whispers point to events spread across the Italian lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land. Dozens of private jets touched down at Venice's airport, and yachts pulled into the city's famed waterways. The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall. Kim Kardashian, center, and sister Khloé Kardashian, arrive in Venice, Italy, Thursday, June 26, 2025, ahead of Jeff Bezos' wedding. Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of Embark Beyond, a luxury travel advisory and destination event service. “It's a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,” said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. Boats cruise along the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, on Wednesday, June 25, 2025, ahead of festivities in the lagoon city reportedly linked to a wedding celebration for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/Sánchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million). It's an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola's annual report. Bezos' team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia's richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag. “How do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?” Ezon said. ”You could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that's only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,” or expand the celebration to local landmarks. There's no sign Sánchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice's tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false. On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, Sánchez and guests to the Madonna dell'Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera — Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom — as police on jet skis patrolled. It carried her through the canals to San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark's Square, where the couple is expected to hold a ceremony this evening. Bezos followed two hours later in a tuxedo. Associated Press journalists circling the island earlier saw private security personnel stationed at every landing point, including its newly installed dock. Lauren Sanchez, right, leaves a hotel ahead of the anticipated wedding celebrations with Jeff Bezos, in Venice, Italy, Friday, June 27, 2025. There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city. They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents' needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change. “Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,” Stella Faye, a researcher at a university from Venice, said on Friday. About a dozen Venetian organizations — including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups — are protesting under the banner “No Space for Bezos,” a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride's recent space flight. Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark's Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down Venice's Grand Canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash. “All of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice — our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. As Amazon's CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $234 billion, according to Forbes. In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with Sánchez, a former TV news anchor. He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives. Sitting beside Sánchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime. Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos' Earth Fund was supporting its work with an “important donation.” CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Friday, the Supreme Court released its long-awaited decision in Trump v. CASA, a case challenging President Donald Trump's attempt to strip many Americans of citizenship. The 14th Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States” are citizens, with one narrow exception that does not arise in CASA, so Trump's executive order trying to strip many babies born in the US of their citizenship is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion concludes that a nationwide injunction is not allowed…sort of. Much of the opinion is about why nationwide injunctions should be impermissible, but a key section suggests that, in this case, one might actually be okay. And they argued that it would be unworkable if birthright citizenship was the rule in some states, but not others. As Barrett summarizes their arguments, “children often move across state lines or are born outside their parents' State of residence.” Thus, a “‘patchwork injunction' would prove unworkable, because it would require [the states] to track and verify the immigration status of the parents of every child, along with the birth State of every child for whom they provide certain federally funded benefits.” In any event, Barrett does not ultimately say whether she finds this argument persuasive, instead concluding that “the lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate” in future proceedings. So the holding of CASA seems to be that universal injunctions should be rare, but they are permissible in some cases, including, possibly, this case. During the Biden administration, MAGA-aligned federal judges in Texas routinely handed down nationwide injunctions on highly dubious grounds. Indeed, this practice so frustrated Biden's Justice Department that, even after Trump won the 2024 election, Biden's solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, filed a brief asking the justices to limit their use. The best argument against these broad orders is that they place too much power in individual judges, and in plaintiffs who can often shape which judge hears their case. As Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a 2020 opinion, “there are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges.”In a world with nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs can shop around for the one judge in America who is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause, and potentially secure a court order that no other judge would hand down. The most immediate beneficiary of Friday's decision is Trump, who will now get some relief from nationwide injunctions. Nevertheless, the decision in CASA should also benefit future Democratic administrations, assuming that the GOP-controlled Court applies it fairly to presidents of both parties. As mentioned above, Barrett leaves the door open to a nationwide injunction in this very case. She also suggests that opponents of Trump's anti-citizenship order can bring a class action and obtain relief very similar to a nationwide injunction, although plaintiffs seeking to bring class actions must clear additional procedural bars. It appears that nationwide injunctions are still allowed, at least some of the time. And they might even be allowed in this very case. The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿ The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court sided on Friday with a group of Maryland parents who argued that a school board's policy preventing them from opting their children out of LGBT curriculum infringed on their religious freedom rights. The parents have therefore shown that they are likely to succeed in their free exercise claims,” Alito wrote. Thomas also authored a concurring opinion in which he discussed why he believed the board's policy was unconstitutional as well as the ruling's ramifications. “Insofar as schools or boards attempt to employ their curricula to interfere with religious exercise, courts should carefully police such ‘ingenious defiance of the Constitution' no less than they do in other contexts,” Thomas wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a blistering dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, in which she said the majority decision would create “chaos” and be harmful for schools across the country. “Public schools, this Court has said, are ‘at once the symbol of our democracy and the most pervasive means for promoting our common destiny,'” Sotomayor wrote. “They offer to children of all faiths and backgrounds an education and an opportunity to practice living in our multicultural society. That experience is critical to our Nation's civic vitality.” “Yet it will become a mere memory if children must be insulated from exposure to ideas and concepts that may conflict with their parents' religious beliefs,” she added. The Friday majority opinion is a key victory for religious and parental rights in public schools, holding with recent Supreme Court decisions affirming religious liberty. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2023 decision by Montgomery County Public Schools to bar religious opt-outs for LGBT books, such as Uncle Bobby's Wedding, which portrays a same-sex marriage, and Intersection Allies, which looks at nonbinary gender identities. The decision will have sweeping implications for parents' ability to pull their children out of controversial lessons at public schools for religious reasons.</p>

Nearly 200 House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles earlier this month. Protecting public safety shouldn't be controversial, which is why I am leading the California Republican delegation in a resolution to support law and order as we continue to see unrest," Kim stated when introducing the resolution. "I hope Governor Newsom can come together with President Trump to stop the riots, lower the temperature, and keep our communities safe," she added. "Let's be clear: the riots escalated before the National Guard was sent in and were enabled by California's soft-on-crime policies – peddled for years by Governor Newsom, Sacramento, and local prosecutors – that have allowed for lawlessness and endangered public safety of hardworking Californians," Kim continued. It was introduced on June 17, and it acknowledges that peaceful protests should be welcomed in the United States, but calls out the criminal elements that unfolded in the area earlier this month. "These protests quickly escalated into violent riots across Los Angeles, where acts of arson, widespread looting, property destruction, and vandalism were committed, blocking streets and highways, lighting streets on fire, throwing rocks at law enforcement vehicles, and assaulting Federal and local peace officers," the resolution states. U.S. National Guard are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Earlier this month, Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that the protest was an excuse for bad actors to commit crimes, such as stealing from businesses, committing property damage and assaulting law enforcement. "This group wanted to commit crimes," Hochman said at the time. "They looked at the protest as a cover, an opportunity to go ahead and ply their illegal trade and commit a whole variety of crimes that, in many ways, has done a huge disservice to the legitimate protesters out there." Some Democrats criticized the resolution, as a legal battle ensured whether President Donald Trump was able to send in the National Guard as the civil unrest went on. Gavin Newsom said troop deployment was an instigator. "This resolution ignores those facts to score political points," Rep. Nanette Díaz Barragán, D-Calif., said on the House floor in opposition to the resolution, saying troop deployment "only escalated tensions and further unrest" while adding that Democrats have called for prosecutions of those who have acted violently. "Your daily reminder that Trump still has 4,946 troops sitting around LA doing nothing. Meanwhile, he has weakened our border safety operations -- slashing the National Guard's fentanyl and drug interdiction force by 32 PERCENT. He is actively endangering our communities by keeping these troops in LA," Newsom posted to X on June 25. Meanwhile, debate ensues about the ICE operations and deportation efforts nationwide, as ICE agents face a 500% increase in assaults, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The Supreme Court on Friday delivered a major victory in President Donald Trump's quest to block lower courts from issuing universal injunctions that had upended many of his administration's executive orders and actions. The Supreme Court agreed this year to take up a trio of consolidated cases involving so-called universal injunctions handed down by federal district judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Judges in those districts had blocked Trump's ban on birthright citizenship from taking force nationwide – which the Trump administration argued in their appeal to the Supreme Court was overly broad. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, after signing a series of executive orders and proclamations. Instead, it instructed the lower courts to "move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity." They also stayed any enforcement of the orders from taking effect for 30 days. "The issue before us is one of remedy: whether, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, federal courts have equitable authority to issue universal injunctions." "A universal injunction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable authority, yet Congress has granted federal courts no such power," she added. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elana Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the case. "The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals' constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully. Until the day that every affected person manages to become party to a lawsuit and secures for himself injunctive relief, the Government may act lawlessly indefinitely. Not even a decision from this Court would necessarily," she said. The Supreme Court agreed in April to hear the consolidated cases, which focused on three lower court judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state who issued "universal" injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. Rather, the justices weighed whether lower courts should have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions at all, or whether doing so exceeds their authority, as argued by Trump officials. The ruling is expected to have sweeping implications for U.S. district courts, and comes at a time when presidents, including both Democrat and Republican administrations, have sought to use executive orders as a means of sidestepping a clunky, slow-moving Congress. Trump praised the statement on social media Friday, which he described as a "GIANT WIN" in the Supreme Court. "Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves (same year! ), not the SCAMMING of our Immigration process," he said on Truth Social. Federal judges across the country have blocked Trump's ban on transgender persons serving in the U.S. military, ordered the reinstatement of core functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and halted Elon Musk's government efficiency organization, DOGE, from oversight and access to government agencies, among other things. Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared to agree during oral arguments this month that the use of universal injunctions has surged in recent years – but after more than two hours, remained split on how to proceed. No easy solution emerged to the thorny legal problem, as the justices wrestled with a tangle of procedural questions over whether to scale back the use of universal injunctions and what legal standard should govern them. Sauer argued that lower court judges have used universal injunctions to act beyond their authority and block the lawful powers of a sitting president. But Sotomayor noted that blocking or limiting lower court injunctions could invite hundreds or thousands of new individual lawsuits. "Your theory here is arguing that Article III and principles of equity [clause] both prohibit federal courts from issuing universal injunctions to have your argument," she said later, adding: "If that's true, that means even the Supreme Court doesn't have that power." Kagan, meanwhile, pointed out the practical challenge of expecting the Supreme Court to weigh in on every issue now handled by lower courts, which have already faced hundreds of federal lawsuits during Trump's second term. Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson (Getty Images) She also noted to Sauer that the Trump administration has lost every federal lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship executive order, including under judges Trump appointed during his first term. As expected, several conservative justices on the court, including Justice Clarence Thomas, expressed criticism of universal injunctions. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing the states, acknowledged that there could be alternative remedies for federal courts other than nationwide injunctions – though he suggested that in certain cases, the class action alternative presented by the Trump administration may not move fast enough to grant relief in certain cases. Roberts and Sotomayor questioned Feigenbaum more in depth on how to determine in what cases universal injunctions should not be the preferred remedy and how to ensure district courts are following that. Solicitor General Sauer stressed this point during oral arguments earlier this month, telling justices that universal injunctions "require judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions." The Supreme Court decision will have sweeping implications, both in the near and longer term, with knock-down effects on the more than 300 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to a California vice mayor who is under investigation after posting a video calling on local gangs to push back against ICE raids. FIRST ON FOX: A Republican lawmaker is filing impeachment articles against a judge who temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's control of the National Guard in California during this month's riots in Los Angeles. Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., is filing a resolution to remove U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer from the bench on Friday. President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, N.J., on Friday, June 20, 2025. It comes as Republicans continue to push back on Democratic officials trying to block Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration throughout the country. The days-long riots in Los Angeles were spurred by ICE raids in Hispanic and Latino neighborhoods, leading to activists clashing with law enforcement and burning cars as a sign of resistance. Trump, accusing California's progressive officials of not doing enough to stop the situation, bypassed Democrat Gov. Critics of the move said it needlessly escalated an already tense situation, and accused Trump and his allies of exaggerating the violence. Breyer issued a temporary order blocking Trump's deployment of federal troops earlier this month, however, in response to a lawsuit brought by California. He did not," the court opinion said. Breyer's ruling was quashed last week when a three-judge panel on the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it was within Trump's authority to federalize the California National Guard. Breyer is just the latest judge to be brought under House GOP scrutiny after several Trump executive actions got held up in court. Protesters face off with police outside a federal building in downtown Los Angeles for an anti-Trump "No Kings Day" demonstration in a city that has been the focus of protests against Trump's immigration raids on June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Trump allies have called for the impeachment of multiple judges, though House GOP leadership has made clear there's little appetite to follow through on such moves – particularly when removal by the Senate is unlikely. I don't know that we can pass it, I don't know that the Senate would remove him from office, but I think failing to avail ourselves of the remedies that the framers intended was a mistake," Fine said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The world's war on child death was going well. The deadliest country in the world for young children is South Sudan — the United Nations estimates that about 1 in 10 children born there won't make it to their fifth birthday. But just a hundred years ago, that was true right here in the United States: Every community buried about a tenth of their children before they entered kindergarten. That was itself a huge improvement over 1900, when fully 25 percent of children in America didn't make it to age 5. Primarily through vaccines, which account for about 40 percent of the global drop in infant mortality over the last 50 years, representing 150 million lives saved. Once babies get extremely sick, it's incredibly hard to get adequate care for them anywhere in the world, but we've largely prevented them from getting sick in the first place. And vaccines not only make babies likelier to survive infancy but also make them healthier for the rest of their lives. President Donald Trump's secretary of health and human services (HHS), a noted vaccine skeptic who reportedly does not really believe the scientific consensus that disease is caused by germs, recently announced the US will pull out of Gavi, an international alliance of governments and private funders (mainly the Gates Foundation) that works to ensure lifesaving vaccinations reach every child worldwide. He thinks Gavi doesn't worry enough about vaccine safety (he does not seem to acknowledge any safety concerns associated with the alternative — dying horribly from measles or tuberculosis).The Trump administration had already slashed its contribution to Gavi as part of its gutting of lifesaving international aid programs earlier this year, leaving any US contributions in significant doubt. But if Kennedy's latest decision holds, it now appears that the US will contribute nothing to this crucial program. In 2022, we pledged $2.53 billion for work through 2030, a contribution that Gavi estimates was expected to save about 1.2 million lives by enabling wider reach with vaccine campaigns. That's an incredibly cost-effective way to save lives and ensure more children grow into healthy adults, and it's a cost-effective way to reduce the spread of diseases that will also affect us here in the US. Measles is highly contagious, and worldwide vaccination helps keep American children safe, too. Tuberculosis is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder and more expensive to treat, and widespread vaccination (so that people don't catch it in the first place) is the best tool to ensure dangerous new strains don't develop. It is genuinely hard to describe how angry I am about the casual endangerment of more than a million people because Kennedy apparently thinks measles vaccines are more dangerous than measles is. The American people should be furious about it, too. If other funders aren't able to cover the difference, an enormous number of children will pointlessly die because the US secretary of health and human services happens to be wildly wrong about how diseases work. But the blame won't end with him. It will also fall on everyone else in the Trump administration, and on the senators who approved his appointment in the first place even when his wildly wrong views were widely known, for not caring enough about children dying to have objected. Kennedy, it's worth noting, is not even a long-standing Trump loyalist. He doesn't have a huge constituency; it wouldn't have taken all that much political courage for senators to ask for someone else to lead HHS. A lot of his decisions are likely to kill people — from his decision to ban safe, tested food dyes and instead encourage the use of food dyes some people are severely allergic to because they're “natural” to his courtship of American anti-vaxxers and his steps to undermine accurate guidance on American child vaccination. But if it holds, pulling out of Gavi is likely to be Kennedy's deadliest decision — at least so far. He reportedly may not believe that AIDS is caused by HIV, either, and he can surpass the death toll of this week's decision if he decides to act on that conviction by gutting our AIDS programs in the US and globally. But whether or not the Gavi withdrawal is the deadliest, it certainly stands out for its sheer idiocy. None of this should have been allowed to happen. Since Kennedy's confirmation vote in the Senate passed by a narrow margin with Mitch McConnell as the sole Republican opposing the nomination, every single other Republican senator had the opportunity to prevent it from happening — if they were willing to get yelled at momentarily for demanding that our health secretary understand how diseases work. I'm glad that even South Sudan does not have the child mortality rates of our world in 1900. I'm glad the United States participated in the worldwide eradication of smallpox, and I was glad that we paid our share toward Gavi until the Trump administration slashed funding earlier this year. I'm even glad that mass death is so far in our past that it's possible for someone to be as deluded about disease as Kennedy is. But I am very, very sick of seeing the greatest achievements of our civilization, and the futures of a million children, be ripped to shreds by some of the worst people in politics — not because they have any alternative vision but because they do not understand what they are doing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Jong Un personally cut the ribbon on a new resort hailed by state media as a “national treasure-level tourism city” — a lavish seaside development set against what human rights observers describe as stark realities of hunger and hardship across North Korea. According to the country's official KCNA news service, Kim opened the sprawling Kalma beachside resort with waterparks, high-rise hotels, and accommodation for nearly 20,000 guests — a sweeping display of extravagance in one of the world's most reclusive nations. KCNA reported “service for domestic guests will begin July 1,” but gave no details on eligibility or transportation. In 2024 UN human rights chief Volker Turk described North Korea under Kim's rule as “a stifling, claustrophobic environment, where life is a daily struggle devoid of hope.” Last year, small groups of Russian tourists visited North Korea for three-day ski holidays at Maskiryong resort, which has been a long-standing tourist attraction since its opening in December 2013. These, like all tourist experiences in North Korea, were heavily monitored and controlled by the government. Returning tourists told CNN that they were subject to strict rules about what they could and could not photograph and were required to watch a choreographed dance performance by North Korean children in addition to the outdoor activities. “More broadly, the opening of a major beach resort like Wonsan-Kalma helps to reinforce the state media narrative of Kim's people-first policy and helps to balance out his greater focus on building up national defense,” Lee added. In a country where international tourism has been open mostly to Russian nationals since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and where domestic travel is heavily restricted, the new development raises familiar questions about access, audience, and economic feasibility. “The initial target for this resort is going to be the privileged domestic elite of Pyongyang, such as party officials and other high-ranking figures,” said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean Studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University. North Korea's most notable experiment with international tourism came in the late 1990s, when it opened the scenic Mount Kumgang area on its southeastern coast to visitors from South Korea. But the initiative came to an abrupt halt in 2008, after a North Korean soldier fatally shot a South Korean tourist who had reportedly wandered into a restricted military zone – an incident that underscored the fragility of cross-border cooperation and led Seoul to suspend the tours indefinitely. Kim had previously called the area “shabby” and “backward” during a visit. Related article US tourists can't visit North Korea. This American spent six figures on a second passport so he could travel there Indeed, a central question surrounding the new resort is if one of the world's most secretive and repressive countries is prepared to make a greater foray into international tourism, potentially adding to its foreign cash reserves and prestige. Kim said an expansion of North Korea's tourism zones would be formalized during the ruling party's next congress, likely in the next few months. The lessons learned at Kalma would also be used to develop “promising large-scale tourist and cultural zones” in other parts of the country, Kim noted. The personal investment of North Korea's leader was underscored by at least seven visits to the Kalma construction site, where Kim offered what state media called “on-the-spot guidance” and pushed for “world-class” standards. For Kim's regime, the resort's completion is perceived at home as a significant win and opportunity to showcase development amid stiff international sanctions. In another dimension of symbolism, the nation's leader was joined by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, who is widely seen as his likely successor. Plans for the resort were first announced in 2013 as part of Kim's broader vision to transform Wonsan, a historically significant port city, into a hub of economic and leisure activity. The project was delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic and international sanctions targeting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. “Whether this resort will provide Kim Jong Un with his much-needed economic gain in the long-term, however, remains to be seen: Wonsan-Kalma is hardly a tourist hotspot in the first place,” said Dr. Edward Howell, a North Korea expert at the University of Oxford. “If any Western tourists do come to the resort, the ruling regime will no doubt want to ensure that their actions and movements remain regulated and controlled.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the White House “banned” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard from a congressional briefing on Iran. Gabbard had been at odds with the administration over her claim in March that the intelligence community believed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. President Donald Trump said her March claim was “wrong” last week. “I've never, ever been part of a major Cabinet-level classified briefing where the director of national intelligence was banned from the room,” Murphy told CNN. Gabbard wrote in a post on X on Wednesday that “new intelligence” showed “Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.” She said rebuilding them would take years, rejecting past intelligence leaks that showed the strikes on the nuclear facilities delayed Iran's nuclear program by just months. A senior White House official told the Daily Beast that “CIA Director Ratcliffe will represent the intelligence community tomorrow while Tulsi Gabbard continues her critical work at DNI. The media is turning this into something it's not.” Gabbard was initially scheduled to attend a briefing with senators on Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed to Thursday and Gabbard was removed from those attending, which included Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It's unclear whether she will attend a similar briefing for the House on Friday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the decision should be undone. “Senators deserve information, and the administration has a legal obligation to inform Congress precisely about what is happening right now abroad. “Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images. The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame. The biggest damage took place far below ground level.</p>

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the United States to potentially offer refuge to people from other countries who otherwise would seek asylum in the United States, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday at the conclusion of her Central America trip. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, right, talks to ERO Regional Attaché Guadalupe “Lupita” Serna and U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Tobin Bradley as they watch people deported from the United States disembark a repatriation flight, at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, Thursday, June 26, 2025. People deported from the United States walk into a processing center after arriving on a repatriation flight, during a Department of Homeland Security operations tour for visiting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, Thursday, June 26, 2025. with the U.S. government applying pressure on Honduras and Guatemala to get them done. “Honduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,” Noem said. “We've never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn't necessarily have to be the United States.” Both governments denied having signed safe third-country agreements when asked following Noem's comments. Guatemala's presidential communications office said the government did not sign a safe third-country agreement nor any immigration related agreement during Noem's visit. They reaffirmed that Guatemala would receive Central Americans sent by the United States as a temporary stop on the return to their countries. Noem had said Thursday that “politically, this is a difficult agreement for their governments to do.” There are also the optics of two left-of-center governments appearing to help the Trump administration limit access to U.S. asylum. Noem said that during her Guatemala meeting, she was given the already signed agreement. While later there was a public signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding that establishes a Joint Security Program that will put U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the Guatemalan capital's international airport to help train local agents to screen for terrorist suspects. Honduras' immigration director Wilson Paz denied such an agreement was signed and its Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, the U.S. signed such accords called safe third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The U.S. has had such an agreement with Canada since 2002. The practical challenge was that all three Central American countries at the time were seeing large numbers of their own citizens head to the U.S. to escape violence and a lack of economic opportunity. In February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed deals with El Salvador and Guatemala that allowed the U.S. to send migrants from other nations there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, left, and Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez sign a security program agreement at the National Palace in Guatemala City, Thursday, June 26, 2025. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would not sign a safe third-country agreement, but at the same time Mexico has accepted more than 5,000 migrants from other countries deported from the U.S. since Trump took office. The U.S. also has agreements with Panama and Costa Rica to take migrants from other countries though so far the numbers sent have been relatively small. The agreements give U.S. authorities options, especially for migrants from countries where it is not easy for the U.S. to return them directly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian consular officials are pressing for more information from the United States government after a Canadian citizen died while in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Florida detention center this week. Johnny Noviello, a 49-year-old lawful permanent resident of the US, was being detained at the Federal Detention Center in Miami while facing deportation over a 2023 conviction for racketeering and drug trafficking, according to ICE. He was found unresponsive and pronounced dead by the Miami Fire Rescue Department Monday afternoon, according to ICE. CNN has reached out to the Miami Fire Rescue Department for additional information. The Canadian government was notified of Noviello's death on Thursday, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs Anita Anand said in a statement. “Canadian consular officials are urgently seeking more information from US officials,” the statement said, adding further details will not be provided to respect the family's privacy. Less than 10% of immigrants taken into ICE custody since October had serious criminal convictions, internal data shows Global Affairs Canada said consular officials are in contact with US authorities to gather more information about Noviello's death. Noviello became a lawful permanent US resident in October 24, 1991, after entering the US in January 1988 with a legal visa, ICE said. Noviello only served around 125 days of his sentence with credits for good behavior and time served, said Daniel Leising, an attorney who represented Noviello in the criminal case. The attorney added the last he'd heard from Noviello was in February when a judge granted him community service. The agency has reported seven in-custody deaths in 2025 as of May 5, according to ICE's website. CNN's Max Saltman contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students, is escorted into court for a hearing in Latah County District Court, Sept. 13, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — An Idaho judge says he won't postpone the quadruple murder trial of a man accused in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. Fourth District Judge Steven Hippler made the ruling Thursday, telling Bryan Kohberger's attorneys that jury selection will begin in August and opening arguments will likely be held around Aug. 18. “Nothing links these individuals to the homicides or otherwise gives rise to a reasonable inference that they committed the crime; indeed, it would take nothing short of rank speculation by the jury to make such a finding,” Hippler wrote in the order. Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at Washington State University, is charged with four counts of murder. Prosecutors say he sneaked into a rental home in nearby Moscow, Idaho, not far from the University of Idaho campus, and fatally stabbed Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves on Nov. 13, 2022. She also said extensive publicity could taint the proceedings and that a cooling off period would help ensure an impartial jury. But Hippler noted that interest in the case has only grown and that previous delays have only given the media more time to “provide coverage to a public audience which is clamoring for answers.” “The longer the public is made to sit and wait for the facts to come out at trial, the more time there is for inflammatory, speculative stories, movies and books to circulate and more time for prior ones to be rebroadcast, purchased, viewed and consumed by the public,” he wrote. Hippler also denied the defense's request to present evidence of four “alternate perpetrators” to jurors, after finding that evidence was flimsy at best and would lead to “wild speculation,” needlessly dragging out a trial that is already expected to last three months. The fourth person had only a “passing connection” to one victim after noticing her at a store several weeks before the deaths, Hippler said. All four cooperated with investigators, and their DNA didn't match samples taken at the crime scene, Hippler said, and there is no admissible or significant evidence that any one of them had a motive, was present at the crime scene or was otherwise connected to the crime. “There is not a scintilla of competent evidence connecting them to the crime,” Hippler said. Jury selection will begin Aug. 4, Hippler said, with the trial starting about two weeks later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Cuomo will not drop out of the New York City mayoral race by the Friday deadline to remove himself from the general election ballot, sources tell CNN. That leaves in place contingency plans he had established before the Democratic primary to challenge Zohran Mamdani and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in November. The former New York governor, who quickly conceded the Democratic primary race on Tuesday night to Mamdani, has not fully committed to running an active campaign through the summer and fall. Cuomo is calculating that the full city's electorate would be significantly different from Democratic primary voters who were energized by Mamdani's focus on affordability and his campaign's online videos. His camp also believes Mamdani and his policy ideas, from a rent freeze to city-operated grocery stores, will receive increased scrutiny now that Mamdani is positioned to secure a Democratic primary win once ranked-choice votes are allocated next week. Asked about possibly running against Cuomo in November, he said on “OutFront”: “We did it once and it turned out pretty well.” Kathy Hochul as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have praised Mamdani since Tuesday but declined to endorse him. And two House Democrats from swing districts in the New York suburbs criticized him after Tuesday's results put him in position to win the primary, while Republicans have sharply criticized Mamdani and tried to tie national Democrats to him. Mamdani is poised to face Adams, who opted out of this year's Democratic primary and is running as an independent himself, as well as Republican Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo staying on the November ballot leaves the door open for the former governor to resume his bid for a political comeback, four years after he resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment that he has denied. Cuomo's bet would be that he could become a safe harbor for moderates and progressives concerned about Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, or Adams, who was indicted on federal bribery charges before President Donald Trump's administration moved to drop them. He could also keep his ballot line without campaigning, as he did in 2002 when he dropped a Democratic primary bid for governor but remained on the ballot as the Liberal Party candidate. “There's no clock ticking,” one source said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Rep. Pat Williams, (D-Mont), left, fields questions while seated next to Col. Murray Sanders during a news conference on Japanese World War II germ warfare experiments on American POW's on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 6, 1985. (AP) — Pat Williams, a New Deal-style Democrat who won Montana's great liberal-conservative showdown of 1992 to become the state's lone voice in the U.S. House of Representatives, died Wednesday. Williams died in Missoula of natural causes, family spokesperson Matt McKenna said Thursday. John Patrick Williams represented the western half Montana from 1979 to 1997. The matchup was billed as a classic liberal-conservative confrontation and a microcosm of political battles being waged throughout the West over control of the land and its resources. It was a bitter, hard-fought contest — each man spent more than $1 million — and Williams said quickly after his victory that he would work to bring the state together. Williams first tried for the congressional seat in 1974, but he lost to fellow Democrat Max Baucus. He was an unabashed liberal, a staunch advocate for organized labor and a believer in the potential of government to help people. That won him the enmity of conservative groups such as Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition. Williams defended the National Endowment for the Arts against pornography charges and opposed proposed constitutional amendments to outlaw abortion and flag desecration and to require a balanced budget. He opposed U.S. military intervention in the 1991 Gulf War and wanted post-Cold War defense savings to be used for public works projects. Williams tried to take a middle road in one of Montana's most divisive issues, wilderness, and environmental groups generally gave him strong support. “A clean environment ... has been and will be an absolute cash register for this state,” he said in 1992. His family said in a statement that Williams spent his life protecting wild lands and defending the working poor, arts, Native people and children with disabilities. “He believed government could be a force for good, and that culture, wilderness, and education were not luxuries — but rights,” the statement said. After he left the House in 1997, Williams started teaching at the University of Montana, including courses in environmental studies, history and political science. Greg Gianforte recalled Williams as a “dedicated public servant.” “As Montana's longest-serving congressman, Pat championed Montana's interests, working to find common ground for nearly 20 years in Washington,” Gianforte said. Williams' wife, Carol, was the first woman to become minority leader in the state Senate. Williams received a bachelor's degree from the University of Denver and a teaching degree from Western Montana College. Born Oct. 30, 1937, in Helena, Williams grew up in the mining city of Butte, and its traditionally Democratic unionized workforce was a major element of his power base. In 1968 he headed the Montana presidential campaign for Hubert Humphrey. He did the same in 1976 for Jimmy Carter. Williams got a firsthand look at Washington, D.C., from 1969 to 1971 when he worked as executive assistant to Montana Democratic U.S. Rep. John Melcher. Williams returned to Montana in 1971 and spent seven years as state head of the federally funded Montana Family Education Program, a career program for disadvantaged people. Williams will lie in state at the Montana State Capitol in Helena on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
