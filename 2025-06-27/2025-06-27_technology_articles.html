                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The clause states that if OpenAI's board ever declares it has developed artificial general intelligence (AGI), it would limit Microsoft's contracted access to the startup's future technologies. Late last year, tensions around AGI's suddenly pivotal role in the Microsoft deal spilled into a debate within OpenAI over an internal research paper, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. By making specific assertions about future AI capabilities, sources claim, the paper could have complicated OpenAI's ability to declare that it had achieved AGI, a potential point of leverage in negotiations. “The ‘Five Levels' was an early attempt at classifying stages and terminology to describe general AI capabilities. In a blog post describing its corporate structure, OpenAI notes that AGI “is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft.” OpenAI defines AGI as "a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” The two companies have been renegotiating their agreement as OpenAI prepares a corporate restructuring. Both sources have been granted anonymity to speak freely about private discussions. That same source suggests there are two relevant definitions: First, OpenAI's board can unilaterally decide the company has reached AGI as defined in its charter, which would immediately cut Microsoft off from accessing the technology or revenue derived from AGI; Microsoft would still have rights to everything before that milestone. If OpenAI asserts it has reached that benchmark, Microsoft must approve the determination. The contract also bars Microsoft from pursuing AGI on its own or through third parties using OpenAI's IP. A version of the paper dated September 2024 viewed by WIRED details a five-step scale for measuring how advanced AI systems are, citing other research that claims many of OpenAI's models at that point were at Level 1, defined as “An AI that can understand and use language fluently and can do a wide range of tasks for users, at least as well as a beginner could and sometimes better.” It notes that some models at the time were approaching Level 2, which the authors define as “An AI that can do more advanced tasks at the request of a user, including tasks that might take an hour for a trained expert to do.” The paper deliberately avoids giving a single definition of AGI, arguing the term is too vague and binary, and instead opts for using a spectrum of capabilities to describe increasingly general and capable AI systems. The paper doesn't predict when OpenAI's systems will reach each of the five levels, but it does predict how each step up in capabilities could change different facets of society, including education, jobs, science, and politics, warning about new risks as AI tools become more powerful and independent. In a podcast with YCombinator president and CEO Garry Tan in November, Altman said that the company's o1 model could be defined as Level 2, and he expects they'll reach Level 3 “faster than people expect.” Last July, a coauthor of the paper gave a presentation of the research at an internal event where teams highlighted their most important projects for research-wide awareness, according to multiple sources. The research was well received by other staffers, one source added. Another source says that discussions with Microsoft were often “mentioned as a blocker for putting the paper out.” McCallum said in a comment to WIRED that “it's not accurate to suggest we held off from sharing these ideas to protect the Microsoft partnership.” Another source familiar with the matter said that the paper wasn't released because it didn't meet technical standards. “I think mostly the question of what AGI is doesn't matter,” Altman said at a conference in early June “It is a term that people define differently; the same person often will define it differently.” Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin</p>

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Less than a week ago, Tesla robotaxis began rolling out and giving rides to invited customers in Austin. As Sean O'Kane and I wrote this week, the rollout is the first big test of CEO Elon Musk's belief that it's possible to safely deploy fully autonomous vehicles using just cameras and end-to-end AI — an approach that differs from other players in the space, like Waymo. By all accounts (including Tesla's), this is a limited first run. That doesn't mean there was a subdued reaction. As O'Kane quipped to me the other day, “It's like a Rorschach test.” Here's what gets closer to the truth: One week in, and we have a lot of noise and very little signal. CEO Elon Musk spent the last year working on politics, which culminated in a dramatic exit from his duties as head of DOGE. One source noted it's created a pressure-cooker environment that has caused some employees to leave the company. The news cycle this week is giving me 2016 vibes. Take this deal involving Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick. Kalanick is reportedly working with investors to buy the U.S. arm of Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI, and Uber might even help make it happen. In 2017, Kalanick was pressured to resign due to reports that he fostered a toxic workplace culture rife with sexual harassment, among other complaints. His resignation came a year after Uber purchased Otto, the self-driving trucks startup co-founded by Anthony Levandowski (CEO Pronto AI), Lior Ron (CEO Uber Freight), Don Burnette (founder of Kodiak Robotics), and Claire Delaunay (former Nvidia, former farm-ng CTO, and current seed investor). That deal, which was absorbed into what became Uber ATG, was controversial from the start and ultimately led to Waymo suing Uber over trade secrets theft. Fast-forward eight years: Waymo and Uber are on friendly business terms, and Kalanick is still wondering, “What if?” The founder has been pretty vocal about saying Uber would have its own self-driving fleet had he still been in charge. Then there's Pony, which has operations in the U.S. that are at risk due to national security rules. The company has been poised to sell off its U.S. arm since at least 2022. Nascent Materials, a new startup developing cathode materials to drive down the cost of LFP batteries, raised $2.3 million in a seed round led by SOSV. The New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund and UM6P Ventures also participated. Raphe mPhibr, the Indian drone startup, raised $100 million in an all-equity Series B round led by General Catalyst. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent Ford a lengthy list of questions about its hands-free driver-assistance system BlueCruise as part of an investigation that started more than one year ago following two fatal crashes involving the software. There was a time when AV startups tried to avoid talking about remote driving as a means of supporting its driverless tech. Take self-driving trucks company Kodiak Robotics and Vay, a remote driving startup out of Berlin. The two companies, which announced a partnership this week, have been working together since last year. The companies, which launched the “Waymo on Uber” service in Austin earlier this year, are now operating in a 65-square-mile area of Atlanta. On top of that, Uber Eats launched sidewalk delivery robots in Atlanta with Serve Robotics, an Uber spinout that went public last year. The upshot: Momentum seems to be building for all three companies. Uber is turning into the network connector to autonomous tech (it has 18 AV partnerships globally). It provides 250,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across five major cities. Redwood Materials is launching an energy storage business that will leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected from its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Tesla's top sales executive has reportedly gotten the boot from Elon Musk. Omead Afshar was one of Musk's closest confidants who just this week was posting on X about the “historic day for Tesla” when the company rolled out its robotaxis in Austin. Now Intel is saying goodbye to its automotive architecture business — including its AI-enhanced system-on-chip design for vehicles that had been set for production by the end of 2025 — and laying off most of its staff as part of a broader restructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, a screen pops up and asks if the user will opt into “cloud processing” to allow creative suggestions. As the pop-up message explains, by clicking “Allow,” you'll let Facebook generate new ideas from your camera roll, like collages, recaps, AI restylings, or photo themes. To work, Facebook says it will upload media from your camera roll to its cloud (meaning its servers) on an “ongoing basis,” based on information like time, location, or themes. However, by tapping “Allow,” you are agreeing to Meta's AI Terms. This allows your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI, it says. The same AI terms also give Meta's AIs the right to “retain and use” any personal information you've shared in order to personalize its AI outputs. The company notes that it can review your interactions with its AIs, including conversations, and those reviews may be conducted by humans. We have to wonder whether the photos you've shared for “cloud processing” also count here. Meta has not responded to our requests for comment or clarification. So far, there hasn't been much backlash about this feature. For instance, one user on Reddit found that Facebook had pulled up an old photo (in this case, one that had previously been shared to the social network) and automatically turned it into an anime using Meta AI. When another user in an anti-AI Facebook group asked for help shutting this feature off, the search led to a section called camera roll sharing suggestions in the app's Settings. We also found this feature under Facebook's Settings, where it's listed in the Preferences section. On the “Camera roll sharing suggestions” page, there are two toggles. We found posts from earlier this year where confused Facebook users were sharing screenshots of the pop-up message that appeared in their Stories section. Meta has also published complete Help Documentation about the feature for both iOS and Android users. Meta's AI terms have been enforceable as of June 23, 2024; we can't compare the current AI terms with older versions because Meta doesn't keep a record, and previously published terms haven't been properly saved by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Since this feature dips into your camera roll, however, it extends beyond what Meta had previously announced, in terms of training its AIs on your publicly shared data, including posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram.

However, just because you're going back to nature doesn't mean you have to do away with all of the lovely modern conveniences, and that's where a great portable power station comes in. Thanks to a great deal on Amazon right now, you can get your hands on the excellent Anker 521 Portable Power Station for just $160. It's a limited-time offer though, so don't expect to be around for very long. The Anker 521 Portable Power Station is actually just flat out better than previous models for a lot of reasons, and one of those is the LiFePO4 Battery, which makes for a more reliable option with a better battery life and faster charging. In fact, it has an incredible output of up to 600W, which is more than enough to power a huge number of devices at once. It charges incredibly quickly as well, thanks to a 256Wh capacity, meaning it not only charges a lot, but also does so with haste. It just makes beach days or camping trips better, and can even be useful at home in the event there's an issue with the power. The LiFeP04 battery means that it can last up to 10 years of use, and does a great job of regulating temperatures, and it's all in a very durable shell as well. This thing isn't going to break without a fairly large effort on your part. Not that you should be trying to break it. There's no doubt that this is a great pickup at the normal price of $220, so being able to get it for just $160 is a chance that shouldn't be missed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the new booster started off strong, its nozzle appeared to get blown off around two minutes after it began firing its motor. On Thursday in Utah, Northrop Grumman conducted the first full-scale static fire test of the newly built solid rocket booster. NASA's Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) is the “world's largest and most powerful segmented solid rocket motor,” according to Northrop Grumman. The test lasted for a little over two minutes, burning more than 1.4 million pounds of propellant. Toward the end, however, an unusually bright plume appeared to suddenly burn through parts of the booster, resulting in a large fireball and flying debris. “Today's test pushed the boundaries of large solid rocket motor design to meet rigorous performance requirements,” Jim Kalberer, vice president of propulsion systems at Northrop Grumman, said in a statement. Northrop Grumman developed the new booster under a $3.2 billion contract with NASA. The booster features carbon-fiber composite cases, which are meant to be lighter and stronger than the shuttle-era steel cases currently on SLS. It also uses a different propellant formula that's meant to increase performance by around 10% and adds another five metric tons of payload. NASA's massive, fully expendable Moon rocket is under heavy scrutiny. SLS is outfitted with four RS-25 engines originally built by Aerojet Rocketdyne for the shuttle project. SLS is a capable heavy-lift rocket, but it's ultimately unaffordable. The launch vehicle has already gone $6 billion over budget, with the projected cost of each SLS rocket being $144 million more than anticipated. That would increase the overall cost of a single Artemis launch to at least $4.2 billion, according to a report released in 2024 by the office of NASA's inspector general. In its budget proposal for 2026, the U.S. administration laid out a plan to phase out SLS and its Orion capsule, replacing them with commercial substitutes. To be clear, SLS is not officially dead, but it doesn't look good. On June 20, the agency tested an RS-25 engine at the Fred Haise Test Stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. This was the first hot fire test of the new RS-25 engines, and it lasted around eight and a half minutes or “the same amount of time RS-25 engines fire during a launch of an SLS rocket on Artemis missions to the Moon,” according to NASA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cooler Master updated its Mini-ITX case to comfortably fit and run the most powerful GPUs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It first appeared at CES 2025, where the company showed off its latest line of cases. A PCIe 5.0 riser cable is also included in the package, ensuring you can get the most out of your graphics card. Of course, you're still getting the features of the previous generation of the NR200P, including support for up to two 120mm or 140mm fans on top, up to two 120mm slim fans (max 15mm thickness) on the bottom, and up to a 280mm radiator on top. There are also two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C port, and a 3.5 combo jack at the top front for ease of connection. Unfortunately, the case is only available in black, so you'll have to repaint it if you want it in another color. This might void its two-year warranty, though, so buyer beware. When we saw the NR200P in action in Las Vegas earlier this year, Cooler Master had it outfitted with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with an AIO cooler plus an Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 BTF GPU (since the RTX 5090 was yet to launch back then). This shows how capable this case was in delivering the performance you need without causing thermal issues and taking up a ton of space on your desk or under it. If you want an even smaller case, the Ncore 100 Air is also an available option, giving you a tall and slim PC that still offers good airflow. All of these were showcased at CES 2025, showing us the many creative and innovative solutions Cooler Master has in store for the PC building community.

In the U.S., several states have passed deepfake laws, which are mainly tied to misuse during elections and nonconsensual sexually explicit content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Old EV batteries get a second life powering data centers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A data center housing 2,000 GPUs is now successfully run with off-the-grid power using solar panels and repurposed batteries. According to Bloomberg, the site is powered by solar panels that generate at least 12 megawatts of power and backed up by reused EV batteries with up to 63 megawatt-hours of capacity. 2,000 GPUs have an estimated power draw of about four megawatts, so the on-site battery capacity should be enough for around 15 hours. Redwood's main business is battery recycling, and it has been focusing on getting battery materials from old EV modules that are no longer useful for transportation and have since been disposed of. “Think of this almost like a retirement home for these batteries,” said Redwood Materials Chief Commercial Officer Cal Lankton. These reused batteries are much cheaper than buying new ones while simultaneously delivering the same performance. So, aside from reducing the burden of disposing of old batteries, it also allows businesses to save on capital expenditure when setting up a backup power supply. Crusoe Energy operates the data center that Redwood is powering with its reused EV batteries. Lankton says that they expect to deploy more similar systems for the remainder of 2025, with 5 GWh capacity slated to go live next year. The exponential growth of data centers is putting a strain on our current electricity supply. Many tech companies are investing in small modular reactors to control their own power, but it will still take years before this technology starts to go online. While already available renewable energy like wind and solar is ideal, they're oftentimes unreliable due to changing conditions, forcing data centers to rely on fossil fuel sources. So, solutions like this help ensure that these tech companies will get the kind of clean power they need without putting a strain on the local electric grid.

Meike Kamp, Berlin's Commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told the companies that DeepSeek did not provide “convincing evidence” that users' data was protected as required by EU laws. Kamp said that her office had asked DeepSeek to comply with EU laws for transferring data outside the bloc or pull its app from the country, but the Chinese company did not do so. Italy earlier this year banned DeepSeek from app stores in the country, citing similar data protection concerns. Notably, two key details about DeepSeek that consumer privacy advocate groups in the EU highlighted are that the service is made in and operates out of China. Per its privacy policy, this includes the information and data that DeepSeek collects and stores, which is also housed in its home country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This includes the varying mattress types, how to select a mattress, and our thoroughly tested guide to the best mattresses you can buy online. Today, it's time to break down some of the terminology you'll inevitably come across during your research. You don't have to be a Spencer Institute sleep science coach to understand these terms—but, lucky for you, I am a Spencer Institute sleep science coach. Pressure relief is a crucial aspect for certain sleeping positions, like side sleepers, and those who need to show their joints some love. For side sleepers, a bed that is too firm means your hips and shoulders will be crying out for help because of the tension. Materials like latex and memory foam are known for their pressure-relieving capabilities. Memory foam, in particular, is very adaptive and “hugs” the body, which many side sleepers like. Memory foam's density is usually right on par with absorbing this feeling, and coils have evolved to include fabric pockets (this is what the term “pocketed coils” means). The idea is that when each coil is contained in its own zone, motion has a harder time moving across the bed as opposed to traditional coils, where everything was woven together. Pro tip: Make sure you have a stable frame, as that's half the battle here, too, and is often overlooked. This is aptly called the “S” curve, because healthy alignment of the upper and lower spinal cord does somewhat resemble this letter. But your posture isn't just a concern while upright, as a lack of spine alignment support while sleeping isn't healthy in the long term. Each sleeping position brings about its own set of concerns, as even the smallest degree of sinking in this area can cause misalignment. Stomach sleepers need a firmer surface to keep this area uplifted, as something too soft causes the lower back to sink in. The alignment of your neck is key, as anybody with back pain will tell you. This is where many mattress makers have stepped up with their designs, putting firmer support in the center of the bed by way of extra memory foam layers or reinforced coils. Edge support is important for a couple of reasons. If you're someone who gets banished to the edge of the bed while sleeping due to a pet or partner making themselves comfy, you need edge support. Engaged in adult extracurricular activities and don't want to feel like you're falling off the mattress? Mattress models, especially hybrids, will usually strategically put reinforced coils around the outer edges to make sure weight is supported. This also helps with durability as time goes on, preventing the edges from sagging. Materials like memory foam can be hit-or-miss for edge support, especially depending on the firmness level involved. Too soft, and you may be encroaching on feeling some sagging in any one of the aforementioned situations. Some beds involve natural and organic materials that may not feel cool to the touch, but are able to dispel heat relatively quickly. Keep in mind that factors such as the surrounding bedroom temperature, what you wear to bed, what sheets and accessories you use, and ultimately the mattress materials involved will all play a part in the overall mattress's temperature control. Responsiveness is how well a bed “responds” to the sleeper moving around on top of it. If the bed is softer and sleepers sink in more, they may have a harder time getting in and out of bed or switching between sleeping positions. On the other hand, a highly responsive bed is snappy, feeling as if it is moving alongside you so that you're always receiving support. If you notice a chemical smell radiating from your mattress once unboxed or unpackaged, the materials within the bed are airing out as they inflate. Certifications like CertiPUR-US are crucial here, because it's third-party assurance that the air you're breathing in isn't tainted by anything potentially hazardous. Don't be daunted by official terms and names in the mattress world—they're actually pretty straightforward.

I recently reviewed the Asus ROG Strix G16, which comes from the factory with a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6E (MT7922) M.2 card installed. Since I don't plan on returning the review unit to Asus until next week, I figured that I'd use it as a guinea pig to attempt swapping out the M.2 Wi-Fi card. To continue the endeavor, I grabbed a Gigabyte Aorus GC-WIFI7 card that I had lying around from my best Wi-Fi adapter testing. Why would you opt for a desktop-based PCIe card? And second, desktop wireless cards use M.2-based cards (that are typically destined for laptops) that slot into a full-size PCIe adapter. Getting to the bare M.2 card took some time, patience, and a few handy tools. I then removed one small screw that holds the QCNCM865 M.2 card in place along with a plastic clip that sits over the antenna lead connectors (to prevent the connectors from popping off if shocked). The whole process took around three minutes, which included the time it took to run upstairs and grab my screwdriver. To make my life easier, I downloaded the Aorus GC-WIFI7 drivers from Gigabyte's support and installed them prior to installation.

As I'm in my mid-40s, my up-close vision has recently taken a nosedive, requiring me to use reading glasses for up-close text. But even my reading glasses couldn't help me, so I reached for my YOCTOSUN LED Head Magnifier with the 3.5x lens attached. After booting the ROG Strix G16 with its new Wi-Fi 7 transplant, I noticed that the card was already recognized in Device Manager (thanks to the drivers being installed beforehand) and was able to connect to my test network using a TP-Link Archer BE9700 tri-band Wi-Fi 7 router. The most noticeable performance difference was undoubtedly observed during 6 GHz testing, where the QCNCM865 delivered a 50 percent improvement in maximum throughput at a distance of six feet. At 25 feet, the advantage shrank to 42 percent. Moving to the 5 GHz band, the QCNCM865 Wi-Fi 7 card had a 26 percent improvement at six feet and a 31 percent uplift at 25 feet. The MT7922 and QCNCM865 were evenly matched when tested on the 2.4 GHz band at distances of six feet and 25 feet. Upgrading the Wi-Fi card in your laptop isn't all that difficult, and is only slightly more involved than replacing RAM or an M.2 SSD. If you have good vision, you can even skip the head-mounted magnifier that I needed during the process. Whether those gains are worth chasing comes down to personal preference. You can grab a bare Intel BE200 Wi-Fi 7 M.2 card for around $27. Bare QCNCM865 cards are harder to find, although you can grab a Gigabyte Aorus GC-WIFI7 for $54 and dissect it. One additional note: if you're running an AMD-based laptop (such as the ROG Strix G16), you cannot use an Intel-based BE2xx Wi-Fi 7 card, as they're incompatible.

ASML has introduced an online competition in China to promote knowledge of lithography and identify skilled engineers. The event invites participants among professionals working in the semiconductor industry as well as enthusiasts with a scientific background. According to ASML's statement, the 16 highest-scoring participants will have the chance to interview for positions at ASML, and an additional 75 individuals will be added to a list of candidates who may be considered for future employment. In 2024, mainland China surpassed Taiwan as ASML's largest regional market, accounting for 36.1% of total revenue, according to the company's annual disclosures. To that end, ASML expanded its presence in the country and established a new and bigger repair center in Beijing, which will replace the old one, in a bid to properly serve its expanded installed base in the country. The center needs employees, so the competition could be a part of ASML's effort to staff its new repair shop. However, ASML management expects sales in China to decline in 2025 as a result of fulfilling a backlog of orders accumulated in previous periods, as well as stricter export limitations imposed on tools that can be shipped to China. In response to restrictions imposed by the U.S. and its allies, Chinese companies (including the high-tech giant Huawei) and universities have increased efforts to build domestic lithography systems. The Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, which operates under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, posted recruitment notices offering unlimited compensation for PhD researchers willing to join projects developing domestic lithography systems, reports SCMP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center. Redwood Materials, one of the US's largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26. Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity. “We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood's founder and chief executive, said at the event. This first microgrid, housed at the company's facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation's largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries. (That's tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to Forbes.) Redwood's project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn't be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers. Since Redwood's batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries. Redwood Energy's microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as MIT Technology Review recently reported. Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it “would be logical targets” for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia, and the Midwest as well. “We're talking to a broad cross section of those companies,” he says. Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. Redwood's microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe's local facilities need. Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.) Redwood's new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need. The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight. If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found. “Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood's new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions. Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. In addition, the company's new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week. Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company's core recycling operation someday. “We're confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.
