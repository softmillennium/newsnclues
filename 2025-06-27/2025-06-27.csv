• Supreme Court ruling: The Supreme Court backed President Donald Trump's effort to curtail lower court orders that have hampered his agenda for months in a case related to his birthright citizenship order.
    


• Trump touts “giant win”: The president applauded the court's ruling, saying that a “whole list” of his administration's policies can now move forward. The president has claimed courts overstepped their power by handing down nationwide orders that temporarily blocked some of his agenda, including his controversial plan to effectively end birthright citizenship.
    


            • Birthright citizenship: The ruling leaves the future of birthright citizenship unclear, but signaled the president's controversial plan to effectively end it may never be enforced.
    


• Other cases: The Supreme Court also handed down opinions for other major cases, including backing a group of religious parents who want to opt out their children from reading LGBTQ books in classrooms, rejecting the latest legal challenge related to Obamacare and punting Louisiana's long-contested congressional map to the fall.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision to back President Donald Trump's effort to curtail lower court orders has “fundamentally shifted the balance of powers away from the courts to the president,” CNN senior legal analyst said.
    


            Elie Honig, a former state and federal prosecutor, said it is now “more burdensome” for plaintiffs looking to challenge the Trump administrations policies.
    


            “The bottom line takeaway from today is, right now, the presidency — forget about Donald Trump — the presidency is far more powerful it was at 9:55 a.m. this morning,” before the ruling came down, Honig said.
    


            In the ruling, the court focused on eliminating a tool that both conservative and liberal groups have used to pause policies from presidents of both parties: the nationwide, or universal, injunction. In short, Honig said, this largely means district court judges “cannot individually block a president's orders across the country.”
    


            But the court left intact the ability of plaintiffs to get broad relief through class-action lawsuits.
    


            “This was a practice that bothered and upset and got in the way of presidential initiatives of Joe Biden, of Barack Obama, of George W. Bush, to an extent,” Honig said.
    


            President Donald Trump celebrated what he described as a “tremendous ruling for parents” after the Supreme Court on Friday backed a group of religious parents who want to opt their elementary school children out of engaging with LGBTQ books in the classroom.
    


            The ruling marked another major legal win for religious interests at the conservative high court and underscored Trump's campaign-era promise to, in his words, return “common sense” and dismantle protections for LGBTQ+ individuals.
    


            “I think it's a great ruling for parents. It's really a ruling for parents. They lost control of the schools, they lost control of their child, and this is a tremendous victory for parents. And I'm not surprised by it, but I am surprised that it went this far,” Trump said in remarks in the White House briefing room Friday.

            Trump cast his administration's efforts – and the court's ruling – as “(bringing) life back to normal.”
    


            “I kept saying, ‘We will give you back your parental rights.' They were taken away, and this is a tremendous victory for parents,” the president said.
    


            Shortly after the Supreme Court limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, some of the immigrant rights groups and individuals challenging President Donald Trump's bid to end birthright citizenship quickly pressed a federal judge who previously blocked the policy to do so again through a different legal avenue the high court left available for litigants to use.
    


            The preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Deborah Boardman in February was one of several nationwide injunctions issued earlier this year by judges around the country that indefinitely blocked Trump's executive order.
    


            The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority on Friday limited the ability of plaintiffs to obtain such nationwide relief in cases like the one Boardman is handling. But the court left intact the ability of plaintiffs to get broad relief through class action lawsuits.
    


            Lawyers for two immigrant rights groups and pregnant women who could be impacted by Trump's order asked Boardman to certify a nationwide class that would include any children who have been born or would be born after February 19, 2025 and would be affected by Trump's order.
    


            They filed an updated lawsuit that would challenge Trump's order on behalf of all of those potential class members.
    


            “Plaintiffs seek to litigate this case for themselves, for their children and future children, and on behalf of a class of all others similarly situated,” the new lawsuit reads.
    


            Boardman, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, has not yet responded to the new request.
    


            The challengers also asked Boardman for an emergency court order that would temporarily block Trump's order from applying to members of a putative class that would be impacted by the president's policy.
    


            “The Court should grant relief to this putative class and may do so before certifying the class,” they wrote in court papers. “Consistent with the Supreme Court's most recent instructions, the Court can protect all members of the putative class from irreparable harm that the unlawful Executive Order threatens to inflict.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday that a “whole list” of his administration's policies can now move forward following the Supreme Court's decision on injunctions.
    


            “Thanks to this decision, we can now probably file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people. We have so many of them. I have a whole list,” the president said in the briefing room on Friday.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration was “very confident” the Supreme Court would eventually rule in its favor on the merits of President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship.
    


            “Birthright citizenship will be decided in October, in the next session by the Supreme Court,” Bondi said at the White House.
    


            Today's Supreme Court decision avoided addressing the constitutional merits of the order. But Bondi nonetheless said the ruling was a “huge win.”
    


            “We're very confident in the Supreme Court. But again, it's pending litigation, and that will directly be determined in October,” she said.
    


            However, there's no active case on birthright citizenship before the Supreme Court, and cases are rarely decided in October, which is the start of the court's term.
    


            President Donald Trump praised Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett following today's Supreme Court decisions — a notable and public show of support after he privately griped about Barrett and other justices he appointed during his first term.
    


                    “I just have great respect for her. I always have. And her decision was brilliantly written today — from all accounts,” the president told reporters when asked about criticism of her from some of his supporters.
                





            Barrett today wrote the majority opinion for a major ruling in Trump's favor in a case challenging his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.
    


            “Justice Barrett correctly holds that the district court lacks authority to enter nationwide or universal injunctions,” Trump said during his remarks in the White House briefing room.
    


            He continued, “I want to thank Justice Barrett, who wrote the opinion brilliantly, as well as Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Thomas — great people.”
    


Some context: The show of thanks comes as CNN reported earlier this month that Trump has privately complained Barrett has not sufficiently stood behind his agenda, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversations. Some of Trump's allies have told him that Barrett is “weak” and that her rulings have not been in line with how she presented herself in an interview before he nominated her to the bench in 2020, according to sources.
    


CNN's Kristen Holmes and John Fritze contributed to this post.



            The Supreme Court's ruling today curtailing nationwide injunctions will have far-reaching consequences for President Donald Trump's second term, even if his birthright order is never enforced.
    


            All along, the issue of birthright citizenship was intertwined with Trump's executive order in the court's appeal. But the case also raised fundamental questions about the power of courts to pause the president's agenda while they consider challenges to his policies.
    


            The Supreme Court's majority largely glossed over the issue of birthright citizenship, handing that off to lower courts to assess. What it focused on instead was eliminating a tool that both conservative and liberal groups have used to pause policies from presidents of both parties: the nationwide, or universal injunction. For Trump, this means his opponents will have to jump through additional hoops to try to shut down policies on a nationwide basis.
    


            It won't be impossible to do so, but it will prove more difficult.
    


            The court was careful to say that parties could still seek nationwide relief to pause a policy if that was is required to address their harm. That is precisely the argument nearly two dozen Democratic states made challenging the birthright policy — and while the court didn't directly address it, it left wide room for states to make that claim again. The states had argued they needed a nationwide block on Trump's birthright citizenship policy because it was too easy for people to cross state borders to have a baby in, for example, New Jersey — where that child would be a citizen — rather than staying in Pennsylvania, where it might not.
    


            And so, under the court's opinion, states are likely to have easy time shutting down the birthright policy again.
    


            But on other policies — from trade to other immigration enforcement issues — the Supreme Court's decision may be beneficial to the president (and other future presidents) by making it harder for individuals to seek a temporary pause of a policy when they feel their rights have been violated.
    


            President Donald Trump has begun his briefing room victory lap after a major Supreme Court win.
    


            “Big one, wasn't it? This was a big decision,” Trump said from the White House, calling the birthright citizenship ruling an “amazing decision, one that we're very happy about.”
    


            The president, who is joined by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, said the ruling was a “victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law.”
    


            He said it struck down “the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.”
    


            President Donald Trump is speaking now from the White House, after the Supreme Court backed his effort to curtail lower court orders that have hampered his agenda for months.
    


            Trump earlier called it a “GIANT WIN.”
    


            Divisions between the justices were on full display as they read aloud some of the most controversial cases of the terms, particularly in the case involving birthright citizenship.
    


            As Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench, she pointedly called the opinion striking down the use of universal injunctions “shameful.” As she read the line aloud, several members of the court who signed on to the majority opinion looked at her directly and then quickly looked away.
    


                    As Sotomayor read her dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative member of the court, repeatedly raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips. In a few instances, most notably as Sotomayor warned that “no right is safe in the new legal regime the court creates,” Alito appeared to roll his eyes, lean back in his chair and stare at the ceiling.
                





            As Alito read aloud another opinion that backed a group of religious parents who want to opt their elementary school children out of engaging with LGBTQ books in the classroom, Justice Elena Kagan, a senior liberal judge on the high court, shook her head.
    


            And when Sotomayor again read her dissent, Alito in turn appeared to chuckle as she questioned whether the ruling would undermine the country's public school system.
    


            Justice Neil Gorsuch was not on the bench when the final opinions of the term were read aloud. The court did not immediately respond to an inquiry about his absence.
    


            The Supreme Court punted on Friday in a major legal challenge to Louisiana's long-litigated congressional map, taking the unusual step of holding the case over for a second term.
    


            The decision means the sprawling district that added a second Black and Democratic lawmaker to the state's overwhelmingly Republican delegation will remain in place, at least for the time being. The court said it will hear another set of arguments about the questions raised in the case in the term that begins this fall.
    


            Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, dissented from the decision to hold the appeal over until next term.
    


            Louisiana filed the appeal, arguing that it was caught in an impossible position: At first, a federal court ruled that the state had likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority Black district out of six.
    


            When the state sought to comply with that decision by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of self-described “non-Black voters” sued, alleging the state violated the Constitution by relying too much on race to meet the first court's demands.
    


                    “Congress requires this court to exercise jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to congressional redistricting, and we accordingly have an obligation to resolve such challenges promptly,” Thomas wrote in his dissent.
                





            Thomas wrote that he would have held that the provision of the Voting Rights Act at issue in the case is unconstitutional.

Watch here:


The Supreme Court backed President Donald Trump's effort to curtail lower court orders that have hampered his agenda for months. However, it signaled that the president's controversial plan to effectively end birthright citizenship may never be enforced. #cnn #news #supremecourt #scotus #trump


            One of the states challenging President Donald Trump's bid to end birthright citizenship lamented the Supreme Court's decision Friday that makes it harder to block government policies nationwide but nonetheless appeared confident that it could still prevail in stymying Trump's effort.
    


            New Jersey Democratic Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who was among several state attorneys general challenging Trump's executive order, said in a statement that “we are glad the Court recognized that nationwide orders can be appropriate to protect the plaintiffs themselves from harm—which is true, and has always been true, in our case.”
    


            “We are confident that his flagrantly unconstitutional order will remain enjoined by the courts. And in the meantime, our fight continues: we will keep challenging President Trump's flagrantly unlawful order, which strips American babies of citizenship for the first time since the Civil War, and we look forward to a decision in the coming months that holds this disgraceful order unlawful for good,” he said.
    


            While the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority limited the power of plaintiffs to seek nationwide orders that temporarily halt the government from enforcing a policy, it left unresolved what will happen with Trump's birthright citizenship order, sending a set of cases over it back to lower courts for further review. Those lower courts could halt the policy on a broad basis again through other legal mechanisms, like class action lawsuits.
    


            Vice President JD Vance is hailing the Supreme Court decision limiting the ability of judges to stop President Donald Trump's policies from taking effect as a “huge ruling.”
    


            “A huge ruling by the Supreme Court, smacking down the ridiculous process of nationwide injunctions. Under our system, everyone has to follow the law–including judges,” Vance wrote in a post on X.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday backed President Donald Trump's effort to curtail lower court orders that have hampered his agenda for months. However, it also signaled that the president's controversial plan to effectively end birthright citizenship may never be enforced.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law that requires age verification for pornographic websites in one of the most closely watched First Amendment cases to arrive at the high court in years.
    


            The adult entertainment industry had challenged the Texas law as violating the Constitution because it restricted the ability of adults to access protected online speech.
    


            Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for a 6-3 court divided along ideological grounds with the court's three liberals dissenting.
    


            “The statute advances the state's important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit content,” Thomas wrote. “And, it is appropriately tailored because it permits users to verify their ages through the established methods of providing government-issued identification and sharing transactional data.”
    


            In a scathing solo dissent penned by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the appointee of former President Joe Biden accused her conservative colleagues of creating “an existential threat to the rule of law” by allowing Trump to “violate the Constitution.”
    


            She warned that the “executive lawlessness will flourish” if lower-court judges are now required to let a president “act unlawfully.”
    


                    “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more,” Jackson wrote.
                





            She continued: “Perhaps the degradation of our rule-of-law regime would happen anyway. But this Court's complicity in the creation of a culture of disdain for lower courts, their rulings, and the law (as they interpret it) will surely hasten the downfall of our governing institutions, enabling our collective demise.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Friday called the Supreme Court decision curtailing nationwide injunctions a “giant win.”
    


            “GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court! Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Solicitor General John Sauer, and the entire DOJ.”
    


            He also announced a press availability at the White House at 11:30 a.m.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday backed a group of religious parents who want to opt their elementary school children out of engaging with LGBTQ books in the classroom, another major legal win for religious interests at the conservative high court.
    


            In the latest decision blurring the line that once clearly separated secular education from religious belief, the court said that a suburban school district in Washington, DC, burdened parents' First Amendment rights by refusing to allow them to pull their children from the classroom when the books are used.
    


            Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the 6-3 conservative majority.
    


            “The board's introduction of the ‘LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks, along with its decision to withhold opt outs, places an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote for the majority. “The parents have therefore shown that they are likely to succeed in their free exercise claims.”
    


            For months, President Donald Trump has griped in private about some of the Supreme Court justices he appointed during his first term, believing they were not sufficiently standing behind his agenda.
    


            But on Friday, all of his appointees — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the one who's earned his particular ire — ruled in his favor in a case challenging his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, with Barrett writing the majority opinion.
    


            The ruling was a decisive win for a president who has long railed against unelected judges blocking some of his executive actions. The decision limits lower courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have stymied some of the president's executive actions.
    


            It could help improve the president's view of Barrett in particular.
    


            In private, some of Trump's allies have told him that Barrett is “weak” and that her rulings have not been in line with how she presented herself in an interview before he nominated her to the bench in 2020, according to sources.
    


            Many conservatives were apoplectic in March when Barrett voted to reject Trump's plan to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.
    


            “It's not just one ruling. It's been a few different events he's complained about privately,” a senior administration official told CNN in June.
    


            Now, however, Barrett — along with the court's other five conservatives — handed Trump a win in the most prominent case of the term.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday let stand a series of decades-old government programs that reduce the price of broadband internet and telephone services for poor and rural communities, rejecting an argument from a conservative group that claimed the way Congress set up the program violated separation-of-powers principles.
    


            The ruling was a rare win for a federal agency at the conservative high court, which in recent years has tended to side with groups challenging executive branch power. In this case, both the Biden and Trump administrations had supported the Federal Communications Commission's effort to expand access to high-speed internet through fees on phone bills paid by millions of Americans.
    


            Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court's liberal wing, wrote the opinion for a 6-3 court. Three of the court's conservatives – Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – dissented.

            Over the last few years, Starbucks pulled out 30,000 comfortable seats, installed hard wooden stools, blocked electrical outlets and turned stores into takeout counters for customers picking up orders off its mobile app.
    


            The changes backfired and customers left for local coffee shops and other chains and brewed more coffee at home.
    


            Now Starbucks is trying to win back customers looking to sit down for a cup of coffee by renovating 1,000 stores — 10% of its company-owned US locations—with comfy chairs, couches, tables and power outlets in the next year. The company aims to make changes to all of its US stores within the next three years for an undisclosed price tag.
    


            “It's creating comfortable seating where people want to come in. It's not just the quick grab and go concept,” Mike Grams, Starbucks' chief operating officer, said in an interview with CNN last week at one of the first remodeled stores in Bridgehampton, New York. “Maybe over past years, we lost our way a little bit on that.”
    


            The company is beginning its remodel push in the Hamptons, the posh vacation retreat where Bon Jovi, Jennifer Lopez, Alec Baldwin and other celebrities own homes. Starbucks redesigned four stores in the Hamptons and plans to remodel New York City locations next quarter.
    


            Starbucks' “coffeehouse of the future” is not revolutionary, but the Bridgehampton renovation made the store feel modern. The design was minimalist, with a mix of light and dark-brown wood tones, dark-green walls and soft lighting. Plants and bowls of coffee beans were placed around the store. The espresso bar was opened up, and the menu board went digital.
    


            At the Bridgehampton store, people were having conversations in low, cushioned armchairs, orange booth seats and high-top tables for two. Other customers were sitting in wood chairs on their laptops at small tables.
    


            The big question is whether these changes go far enough to reverse Starbucks' slide.
    


            Sales at stores open at least a year have declined for five consecutive quarters. The company is getting squeezed by independent coffee shops, growing chains like Blank Street Coffee and Blue Bottle Coffee and drive-thru companies such as Dutch Bros. Customers have also balked at Starbucks' prices.
    


            “Is it an overwhelming change? No. But I think it makes a psychological difference,” said Joseph Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons, who criticized Starbucks for “commoditizing itself” through mobile orders in a Harvard Business Review article last year. “It sends a signal to sit down and spend some time here,” he said.
    


            But the redesigned store still didn't solve the balance between mobile and in-person customers.
    


            Despite a riser and a dedicated pickup shelf for mobile orders, customers piled up near the counter, waiting for their pickups and hovering near customers sitting down with their coffee.
    


            Starbucks said it's soon implementing technology that more efficiently sequences orders and a new staffing model that will help alleviate congestion at the counters.
    


            The appeal to customers to sit down in stores again is part of CEO Brian Niccol's “Back to Starbucks” strategy.
    


            Since arriving from Chipotle last year, Niccol, the Mr. Fix-It of the fast food industry known for leading turnarounds at Taco Bell and Chipotle, has brought back a Starbucks tradition of baristas doodling on cups in Sharpie pens; reinstated self-serve milk and sugar stations; cut 30% of the menu; and ended its open-bathroom policy.
    


            Starbucks is also offering free refills for customers who sit down in stores, served in ceramic mugs.
    


            “‘Back to Starbucks' is bringing Starbucks back to the brand that we all grew up with,” said Grams, who was the president of Taco Bell and took over as Starbucks' COO in February. “It's just making sure that you keep everything balanced and you create that sense of real comfort in our cafes.”
    


            The new leadership team is trying to position Starbucks' coffee shops as a “third place” again.
    


            Starbucks' longtime leader Howard Schultz envisioned the company's stores as a location where people could relax that wasn't their workplace or their home, designing stores for people to spend hours in plush purple armchairs, socializing and connecting.
    


            The third place idea became part of Starbucks' corporate mythology. But Starbucks struggled to maintain this identity as it built drive-thru stores and catered to the rise of mobile orders, which now make up more than a third of Starbucks' sales.
    


            Starbucks tried to serve customers looking for both a local coffee shop vibe and those who prioritized speed at the same time. The company ended up alienating both, said RJ Hottovy, an analyst who covers the restaurant industry at data analytics firm Placer.ai.
    


            “People want more third place options out there,” Hottovy said. “To go after that and bring that feeling back for Starbucks is important.”
    


            Starbucks is trying to return to its past, but stores won't look like they did 20 years ago.
    


            For example, Starbucks is not bringing back the iconic stuffed purple armchairs from the 1990s and 2000s. Starbucks said the fabric was easily worn and hard to keep clean. It retired the purple armchairs in 2008.
    


            “You will see something similar to it returning to our stores,” said Meredith Sandland, a former Taco Bell executive who became Starbucks' chief coffeehouse development officer in February. “Will it be purple? I don't know. I'll tease that one out.”
    


            Each redesign will look slightly different, she said, but they will all include new lighting, colors, better acoustics and other improvements across more than 10,000 company-owned US locations. Starbucks also has around 7,000 licensed stores in the United States.
    


            Starbucks also plans a variety of different seats in stores to encourage people to come in for different purposes – working solo on a laptop, having a meeting or reading a book, she said.
    


            The goal is to make Starbucks feel more like a boutique setting, not a McDonald's.
    


            “I think of a ‘third place' as a place that should be warm and welcoming (and) feel a little bit more like a hotel lobby than maybe a fast food restaurant,” she said.

Follow:


            A peace agreement brokered by the White House to stem the bloodshed in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where a militia allegedly backed by Rwanda occupies vast swaths of land, will be signed in Washington D.C. on Friday by officials of the two African nations.
    


            But many remain unconvinced that the accord – portrayed as a “wonderful treaty” by United States President Donald Trump – can end the complex and long-running conflict, while the militia itself has yet to commit to laying down its weapons.
    


            Trump was upbeat about the prospects for peace when teams from Rwanda and the DRC initialed a draft agreement on June 18, while at the same time suggesting that he would not get credit for his role in ending this or other conflicts.
    


            On June 20, he wrote on Truth Social: “This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World! I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for this.”
    


            He added: “I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that's all that matters to me!”
    


            Trump touts himself as a “peacemaker” and has expanded his interest in global conflicts to the brutal war in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. His peace deal could also pave the way for America's economic interests in the region, as it eyes access to the DRC's critical minerals.



            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will preside over the signing of the peace agreement by DRC Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner and her Rwandan counterpart Olivier Nduhungirehe on Friday.
    


            More than 7,000 people have been killed, and some one million others displaced since January, when the M23 militia waged a fresh offensive against the Congolese army, seizing control of the two largest cities in the country's east.
    


            There has been increasing reports of summary executions – even of children – in occupied areas, where aid groups say they are also witnessing an epidemic of rape and sexual violence.
    


            The crisis in the eastern DRC, which shares a border with Rwanda and harbors large deposits of minerals critical to the production of electronics, is a fusion of complex issues.
    


            Daniel Kubelwa, a Congolese activist and researcher told CNN that the DRC's feud with Rwanda is “deeply rooted in colonial-era border disputes, unresolved regional tensions, and the consequences of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.”
    


            In that genocide, hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias.
    


            Rwanda criticizes the DRC, which faces problems with militia violence, for integrating a proscribed Hutu militia group into its army to fight against the mainly Tutsi M23.
    


            M23, which first emerged in 2012, is one of the most prominent militias battling for control of the DRC's mineral wealth. The rebel group also claims to defend the interests of the Tutsis and other Congolese minorities of Rwandan origin.
    


            UN experts and much of the international community believe that Rwanda backs M23 and supports the rebels with troops, leaving the nation on the cusp of war with the DRC over this alleged territorial violation.
    


            The Rwandan government has not acknowledged this claim but insists it protects itself against the Hutu militia operating in the DRC, which it describes as an “existential security threat to Rwanda.”
    


            M23 occupies strategic mining towns in the DRC's eastern provinces of North and South Kivu.
    


            In a report in December, the UN Group of Experts on the DRC said they found evidence that minerals “were fraudulently exported to Rwanda” from the DRC “and mixed with Rwandan production.”
    


            Rwandan President Paul Kagame drew outrage last year when he admitted in a public address  that Rwanda was a transit point for minerals smuggled from the DRC but insisted his country was not stealing from its neighbor.
    


            Washington's peace accord contains provisions on “respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities,” including “disengagement, disarmament, and conditional integration of non-state armed groups,” according to a joint statement issued by the US, Rwanda and the DRC on June 18.
    


            Other points include “facilitation of the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, as well as humanitarian access” and the establishment of a “regional economic integration framework” that could attract significant US investments into Rwanda and the DRC.
    


            However, the rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), of which M23 is a key member, told CNN it did not participate in the US-brokered peace process between the Rwandan and Congolese governments, but was instead committed to a separate negotiation process mediated by Qatar in its capital Doha.
    


            Asked whether AFC would surrender its arms, Victor Tesongo, a spokesperson for the coalition, said it was “not there yet” and that it was waiting on developments in Doha.  He did not confirm whether airports in the eastern DRC that had been shut by the rebels would reopen for aid supply.
    


            Previous truce agreements have failed to bring lasting peace between M23 and the Congolese armed forces.
    


            In April, the rebels jointly declared a truce after meeting with representatives of the DRC during negotiations led by Qatar. Fighting flared up days after.
    


            Qatar has been facilitating talks after Angolan President João Lourenço quit his mediation role following months of inability to broker peace.
    


            Activist Kubelwa told CNN that while the US and Qatar-led peace efforts were commendable, “any deal that doesn't address the root causes (of the conflict) will only serve as a temporary truce.”
    


            One of those root causes, he said, was the “unfair distribution” of the DRC's mineral wealth, which he claimed, “benefits a small elite and foreign powers, while ordinary Congolese, especially in the east, suffer displacement and misery.”
    


            The DRC is roughly the size of western Europe and is home to more than 100 million people. The Central African nation is also endowed with the world's largest reserves of cobalt – used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles – and coltan, which is refined into tantalum and has a variety of applications in phones and other devices.
    


            However, according to the World Bank, “most people in DRC have not benefited from this wealth,” and the country ranks among the five poorest nations in the world.
    


            Kubelwa said another trigger for the conflict in the DRC was the country's “weak institutions” and “suppression of dissent.”
    


            Ahead of signing the US-brokered peace deal, Nduhungirehe, the Rwandan foreign minister, told CNN that his nation was “committed to supporting the ongoing negotiations,” but warned that ending the conflict “will depend on the political will and good faith in Kinshasa,” referring to the DRC's government.
    


            The DRC foreign minister's office said it would comment on the deal after the document is signed.
    


            Congolese human rights activist and Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege has described the deal as “vague” and tilted in Rwanda's favor.
    


            After details of the draft agreement were announced last week, he posted a statement on X criticizing it for failing to recognize “Rwanda's aggression against the DRC,” which he wrote, “suggests it (the peace accord) benefits the unsanctioned aggressor, who will thus see its past and present crimes whitewashed as ‘economic cooperation.'”
    


            He added: “In its current state, the emerging agreement would amount to granting a reward for aggression, legitimizing the plundering of Congolese natural resources, and forcing the victim to alienate their national heritage by sacrificing justice in order to ensure a precarious and fragile peace.”
    


            Congolese political and economic analyst Dady Saleh told CNN he “remains skeptical” about the ability of the US peace treaty to ensure a path to peace.
    


            For Kubelwa, “a true and lasting solution must go beyond ceasefires and formal agreements. It must include genuine accountability, regional truth-telling, redistribution of national wealth, reform of governance, and a broad national dialogue that includes all Congolese voices not just elites or foreign allies.”
    


            “Without this, peace remains a fragile illusion,” he said.

Hungary has vetoed a joint EU statement on Ukraine at the bloc's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels, effectively blocking Kiev's accession talks, according to a communique published on Thursday on the European Council's website.

The statement, which urged the council to open membership negotiations with Ukraine, was “firmly supported by 26 heads of state” out of 27 EU members, the document read. As unanimous approval is required, talks cannot begin until Hungary reverses its stance. The communique noted that the council will revisit the issue at its next meeting in October.

While the document did not name Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban confirmed the veto in comments to reporters.

“We stopped Ukraine's EU accession with the votes of Voks2025, and I needed it, because I was almost swept away by the public anger when I announced that Hungary would not agree to start negotiations with Ukraine,” Orban said, referencing the national referendum which concluded on June 20. More than 2 million Hungarians, or 95% of voters, rejected Ukraine's EU bid, according to the prime minister.

“I had to remind [the council] that the most important criterion [for accession] is that there is in fact a country,” he said. “There must be a defined identity, borders, a population, a territory, and in the case of Ukraine, none of these apply.”

Ukraine made EU accession a national priority in 2019, formally applying in 2022 shortly after the escalation of its conflict with Russia. The EU granted Kiev candidate status later that year and set a 2030 target for membership.

While Brussels supports the move, critics argue that Ukraine's institutions and economy are unprepared, and the cost would strain the bloc. Budapest opposes EU membership for Ukraine, warning it could escalate tensions with Russia and burden EU taxpayers with decades of military aid. Alongside Hungary, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Polish officials have raised concerns. A recent IBRiS poll shows only 35% of Poles support Ukraine's EU bid, down from 85% in 2022.

Moscow strongly opposes Ukraine joining NATO, but had previously taken a neutral stance on its EU ambitions, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying in March that Ukraine has the “sovereign right” to join if the bloc remains focused on economics. However, with Brussels ramping up defense spending, Russian officials have recently grown critical. Peskov earlier this week called EU militarization “rabid,” while former President Dmitry Medvedev said the bloc has become “no less of a threat” to Russia than NATO.

“This is a politicized, globalist, and fiercely Russophobic organization,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. “Thus, the so-called ‘Ukraine in the EU' is a danger to our country.”

Israel would have targeted Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei if it had had the opportunity, Defense Minister Israel Katz has said. His remarks came just days after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, ending nearly two weeks of open hostilities.

“I estimate that if Khamenei had been in our sights, we would have taken him out,” Katz told Israel's Channel 13 on Thursday, as cited by Reuters.

“But Khamenei understood this, went underground to great depths, and cut off communication with the commanders who replaced those that were eliminated, so in the end, it wasn't realistic,” he added.

“We wanted to eliminate Khamenei, but there was no operational opportunity,” Katz said.

Asked whether Israel had sought US approval, he replied: “We don't need permission for these things.”

On June 13, Israel launched a series of airstrikes and targeted assassinations against senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists, as part of what it described as an operation to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

The strikes killed Chief of the General Staff Mohammad Bagheri and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami, among others. Initial media reports claiming that Quds Force chief Esmail Qaani was also killed were later disproven.

Iran, which denies that it is pursuing a military nuclear program, condemned the Israeli attacks as unprovoked and retaliated by launching ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones at Israeli cities.

A US-brokered ceasefire has since come into effect and has so far held, with both sides claiming victory. “The Iranian nation demonstrated its greatness and exceptional character,” Khamenei wrote on X on Thursday.

The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering a $30 billion plan to help Iran develop a civilian nuclear program as an incentive to return to full-fledged talks over a nuclear deal, CNN reported on Thursday, citing sources.

Washington and its Middle East partners have been holding secret negotiations with Tehran, even as Iran and Israel exchanged strikes earlier this month, four sources familiar with the matter told the network.

The US reportedly has not dropped its key demand that Iran agree to zero enrichment of uranium, which has been a red line for Tehran. To sweeten the deal, however, Washington is said to have floated several incentives.

These include an estimated $20-30 billion investment project in Iran's nuclear program for civilian energy purposes – though the money would not come directly from the US, but rather from its Arab partners, the report claims.

Other incentives reportedly under consideration include easing some sanctions and allowing Iran access to approximately $6 billion in frozen funds currently held in foreign bank accounts, CNN reported. One idea also being floated is to have Gulf-backed funding replace Iran's Fordow nuclear site – which was struck by US forces last weekend – with a new civilian-only facility, according to the report.

It is unclear how Iran responded to the reported proposal. “I think it is entirely uncertain what will happen here,” one source familiar with the matter told CNN, with another adding that negotiators taking part in the process “are trying to be creative.”

According to CNN, some US officials hope that the recent stand-off with Israel and US strikes on Iranian facilities will make Iran more likely to agree to Washington's terms. Others, however, fear that the flare-up will only spur Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon. Tehran maintains it does not seek nuclear weapons and insists the country's nuclear efforts are solely for peaceful energy purposes.

Earlier this month, Israel launched a wave of attacks on Iranian nuclear and military facilities seeking to derail Iran's nuclear program. The US later joined the attack, using heavy bombers to target Iran's nuclear sites, including the well-protected Fordow nuclear facility.

Trump has claimed that Iran's nuclear sites have been “completely obliterated,” although US media reports disputed this assessment, claiming that the strikes only inflicted limited damage.

MOSCOW, June 27. /TASS/. Serbia's political establishment will not be able to maintain good relations with the Russian authorities if they supply ammunition and weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces, as they can't be on both sides at once, Natalia Nikonorova, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs and former head of the DPR Foreign Ministry, told TASS.

On June 24, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced that his country had ceased all exports of ammunition and that all domestically-made arms would now be reserved for the country's own military use. According to him, weapons will only be exported in exceptional cases and only with special government approval. He also claimed that, following the decision to suspend arms and ammunition exports, Belgrade came under serious pressure, including threats to organize protests at defense industry enterprises.

""Despite the fact that, according to media reports, the Serbian top leadership is under pressure over this decision, the head of state assures that he will stick to the suspension. There's no sitting on the fence in this situation. The Serbian politician will have to make a concrete choice. Only actions, not words, will show what that choice is,"" Nikonorova said.

She pointed out that this is not the first time Russia has recorded Serbian weapons and ammunition ending up in the hands of the Ukrainian military. ""With regard to the Russian-Serbian alliance, we are referring to genuine bonds that have united our peoples for decades. I think the publication of the Russian SVR investigation results could be a revelation for the wider Serbian audience,"" the senator added.

On June 23, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) reported that ammunition produced at Serbian defense enterprises, mainly for heavy long-range systems, ""is sent to NATO countries in the interests of Ukraine in the form of complete sets of parts for assembly."" This allows Kiev to ""formally receive not Serbian military products,"" but rather those assembled at Western arms factories, according to the report. The SVR noted that ammunition is assembled and fitted mainly in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Press review: NATO tiptoes around Trump and Serbia digs into ammunition scandal","https://tass.com/pressreview/1981861","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 10:13:59 GMT","

MOSCOW, June 27. /TASS/. NATO's summit declaration makes no mention of its open-door policy for the first time in three decades; the Serbian Parliament seeks to probe into alleged arms exports to Ukraine; and the EU summit in Brussels indicates that Moldova, not Ukraine, is currently poised to move forward with accession negotiations. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

For the first time since the 1990s, NATO did not include a reference to its commitment to the open-door policy in its final summit declaration, Izvestia writes. For over 30 years, this provision had consistently appeared in all of the alliance's concluding documents. Experts believe the omission was a tactical decision aimed at avoiding provoking US President Donald Trump, who opposes Ukraine's accession to the bloc. Nonetheless, NATO has not abandoned the open-door policy. The alliance continues to expand cooperation with post-Soviet states, including Armenia, Russia's ally in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russia is firmly opposed to NATO enlargement, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia.

""Everything at the NATO summit was done so as not to antagonize Trump. NATO has a long history. The alliance has outlasted many politicians and will outlast Trump. This is not a rejection of the open-door policy,"" Associate Professor in the Department of Politics and Governance at the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Mironyuk told Izvestia.

Thomas Graham, Distinguished Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush for Russia and Eurasia, told the newspaper that the situation simply arises from the fact that the United States was opposed to including such a provision in the declaration, and this should not be interpreted as signalling a change in the other allies' position.

However, some experts do not rule out that NATO's enlargement policy may shift in the future. After all, opposition to Ukraine's accession is not limited to Washington - several European nations, primarily Hungary and Slovakia, are also against it.

""For now, it's mainly about not contradicting Trump. But many in Europe also don't want to admit Ukraine. So, a tactical move could evolve into a strategic one,"" Andrey Kortunov, an expert with the Valdai Discussion Club, told Izvestia.

""Russia's position was clearly articulated by the president on June 14 of last year during his address at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: one of the key elements of a future settlement of the Ukrainian crisis must be the consolidation of Ukraine's non-bloc, neutral, and non-nuclear status,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia.

 

The Serbian Parliament has initiated hearings on the issue of Belgrade's military supplies to Ukraine, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on the Diaspora and Serbs in the Region and a member of the ""We - Voice from the People"" parliamentary group Dragan Stanojevic told Izvestia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has already halted arms exports and pledged to establish oversight of future shipments. Experts believe Vucic will make good on these commitments. Belgrade has previously been repeatedly linked to supplying weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including mortar shells.

""We have initiated a hearing within the Defense Committee in Parliament on this matter. There has been no response yet. Our parliamentary group ‘We - Voice from the People' made a statement in Parliament in which we included two matters: arms deliveries and Vucic's trip to Odessa to meet with Zelensky (on June 11, for the Ukraine-Southeast Europe Summit),"" Stanojevic told Izvestia.

The issue of the Moscow-Belgrade-Kiev triangle gained prominence in late May, when the press office of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service reported that, contrary to Belgrade's declared ""neutrality,"" Serbian defense enterprises continued supplying munitions to Kiev, Izvestia writes. These actions, according to the report, were being disguised through schemes involving falsified end-user certificates and intermediary countries, primarily the Czech Republic, Poland, and Bulgaria.

On June 23, Vucic announced the suspension of all munitions exports. The Serbian leader stated that henceforth, all deliveries would require authorization from the National Security Council.

The additional control measures presented by President Vucic could yield the desired outcomes, Program Manager at the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) Milan Lazovic told Izvestia.

""There has been a certain degree of tension in bilateral relations, but both sides have promptly engaged in addressing the sensitive issues. Belgrade's reaction was immediate, and there was a dialogue with Moscow. The Serbian side pledged to strengthen its oversight of military-industrial exports to ensure they do not reach the Kiev regime. In turn, Moscow affirmed that it trusts Belgrade on this matter but will continue to monitor the situation independently,"" the expert noted.

 

The two-day European Union summit that opened on Thursday, June 26, in Brussels confirmed that Ukraine should not expect swift progress toward European integration. European leaders are unlikely to make any such promises while the Russian-Ukrainian conflict continues, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Among all post-Soviet states, Moldova currently holds the strongest prospects for entering substantive negotiations on EU accession. In the meantime, the European Union is bracing for a prolonged standoff with Russia - a confrontation that, according to one summit participant, may extend at least through 2028.

The Brussels summit was preceded by a NATO leaders' meeting in The Hague, which concluded on Wednesday. The timing of these events suggests a seamless transition from one to the other - particularly since, following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU has effectively transformed into a military bloc, according to the newspaper. It is within the EU, more so than at NATO meetings, that critical decisions are now made on supplying military aid to Ukraine, and it is there that the West's strategic posture toward Russia is increasingly defined.

As a result, the first day of the EU summit was heavily focused on security matters - albeit in a distinct context. Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly stated, from various platforms, that the only reliable guarantee for his country's security lies in membership in NATO or the EU, ideally both. However, there is still no clarity as to whether this goal is even attainable, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

When it comes to Ukraine's EU prospects, there appears to be somewhat more specificity - Hungary remains categorically opposed to Ukraine's accession. The Hungarian veto is currently blocking the opening of a negotiation cluster with Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reassured other summit participants that Budapest's stance is unwavering.

By contrast, talks on Moldova's potential accession to the EU seem likely to begin. Speaking to journalists ahead of the summit, Romanian President Nicusor Dan stated that negotiations are underway across 33 chapters, and at the summit scheduled to take place in Chisinau on July 4, talks will also take place along these lines. According to the newspaper, it is now clear there will be no further delays, and Moldova, which had previously advanced toward the EU at the same pace as Ukraine, is now poised to outpace its neighbor.

 

The global price of platinum has climbed to its highest level since September 2011, surpassing $1,400 per troy ounce, according to data from Comex, a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). On June 26, the metal rose another 4.5% compared to the previous session's close, reaching $1,415 per ounce. At its peak during trading, platinum touched $1,418 per ounce, representing a 5% gain. Since the beginning of the year, platinum prices have surged by 54%. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti attribute platinum's sharp price rally to a persistent global supply deficit exacerbated by declining production and geopolitical tensions.

According to the June report from the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), the primary driver behind this price rally is geopolitical instability, particularly ongoing trade wars that continue to disrupt global commerce, including supply chains. Global platinum production this year is projected to reach 5.4 mln ounces, which is a 6% decline from 2024. An additional 1.6 mln ounces are expected to enter the market through recycling, which is 3% higher than last year, WPIC data show.

Platinum is one of the rarest naturally occurring metals. It is highly resistant to corrosion, has a very high melting point, and is widely used as a catalyst in chemical processes. The largest platinum producer in Russia is Nornickel, which, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources, accounts for over 90% of the country's platinum output.

Alexander Potavin, an analyst at Finam Investment Group, noted that a ""strong price rally"" has begun due to the persistent supply deficit amid shrinking output. He pointed out that in recent years, platinum prices have significantly lagged behind gold and silver. For instance, in 2024, according to Comex, gold rose 27% to $2,641 per ounce, silver increased 21% to $29.20 per ounce, while platinum prices fell by 8.5% to $910.50 per ounce.

 

India, one of the key buyers of Russian thermal coal, increased its imports from Russia in May to the highest level in two years. Analysts interviewed by Kommersant attribute this trend to the flexible pricing strategies adopted by Russian coal exporters, as well as the quality of the fuel itself. While a significant increase in Russia's market share in India is unlikely due to rising domestic production and high port inventories, experts believe that maintaining current shipment levels is entirely feasible.

According to a report from the Center for Price Indices (CCI), Russian thermal coal deliveries to India rose by 52% in May 2025 compared to April, reaching a two-year high of 1.3 mln metric tons. Since June 2023, monthly exports from Russia had not exceeded 1 mln tons.

India's total thermal coal imports in May increased seasonally by 10% month-over-month to 17.4 mln tons, the highest level since June 2024, CCI noted, citing data from Bigmint. Russia accounted for approximately 7.5% of India's total coal purchases. Indonesia remained the country's top supplier, expanding shipments by 16% over the previous month to 9.8 mln tons.

Russian coal exporters likely increased volumes within the bounds of existing contracts, Director of the CCI Evgeny Grachev. ""In India, the monsoon season began earlier this year, which means hydropower generation will put pressure on thermal generation and coal consumption,"" he noted.

According to Nariman Taiketayev, Director of the Corporate Ratings Group at National Credit Ratings (NCR), favorable market conditions prompted India to reduce its imports of lower-calorific-value Indonesian coal in favor of higher-grade Russian coal, which is offered at competitive prices. Russian suppliers, he added, are generally more amenable to flexible pricing. He also emphasized that India's future demand for coal will depend on a combination of price dynamics and weather-related factors.

Sonia Sotomayor says decision is an ‘open invitation … to bypass the constitution'; joined by Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson

US supreme court limits judges' power on nationwide injunctions

US supreme court rules key provision of Obamacare constitutional

The supreme court, in a 6-3 ruling, appears to have delivered Trump a major victory by ruling that individual district court judges lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions, which Trump has complained have blocked federal government policies nationwide including his executive order purporting to end the right to automatic birthright citizenship.

Speaking from the bench, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the supreme court's majority decision “a travesty for the rule of law”, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered a scathing dissent.

Trump called the supreme court's decision “a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions interfering with the normal functions of the executive branch”.

Trump said his administration “can now promptly file to proceed” with policies that had been enjoined nationwide. One of these cases would be ending birthright citizenship, he says, “which now comes to the fore”.

In a press briefing US attorney general Pam Bondi was asked whether the administration is going to try to implement Trump's order banning birthright citizenship in states where there isn't a legal challenge. Bondi said the birthright citizenship question will “most likely” be decided by the supreme court in October but that Friday's ruling still “indirectly impacts every case in this country”, adding that the administration is “thrilled” about this.

Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo reportedly plans to run as an independent candidate in New York City's mayoral race, days after finding himself bested in the Democratic primary by progressive insurgent candidate Zohran Mamdani.

The Trump administration is planning to deport Kilmar Ábrego García for a second time, but reportedly does not plan to send him back to El Salvador, where he was wrongly deported in March.

Trump reiterated that Tehran wants to meet following US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities last weekend, but gave no further details.

Trump says his 9 July trade deadline was not a fixed date, adding that it could be sooner or later than that date, when wider US tariffs are set to be re-imposed if deals are not reached.

We can do whatever we want. We could extend it. We could make it shorter. I'd like to make it shorter. I'd like to just send letters out to everybody: Congratulations, you're paying 25%.

Earlier, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said trade deals could be done by Labor Day.

Trump says he thinks something will happen in Russia's war in Ukraine that would get it “settled”, citing his recent call with Russian president Vladimir Putin but offers no other details.

We're working on that one. President Putin called up and he said, I'd love to help you with Iran. I said, do me a favor: I'll handle Iran. Help me with Russia. We got to get that one settled. And I think something's going to happen there.

Trump says the US will get a lot of mineral rights from Congo under an agreement between that country and Rwanda that he will promote during an Oval Office meeting and signing later in the day.

I'm at the Faith & Freedom Coalition conference in Washington DC – a large conservative gathering featuring high-profile Republican speakers.

On the back of the supreme court rulings this morning, governor Glenn Youngkin, of the swing state Virginia, is currently extolling the ruling in Mahmoud v Taylor that says parents should be able to opt out of school activities centered around LGBTQ+ issues.

“It is right to side with the parents,” said the governor, whose state is about to see a tense election later this year. Youngkin also applauded Trump's immigration policies, saying his state detained at least 2,000 “criminals”. He also weighed in on the Iran strikes, and supported the intervention, saying “peace through strength”.

“I am here today with a strong warning,” he said. “If we don't stay focused it can all change … elections have consequences.”

“Just look at what happened in New York,” he added later, referencing Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic mayoral primary. “They nominated a mayoral candidate who would make Bernie Sanders blush. You know what his big idea is: government-run grocery stores. Imagine this: the charm of the Department of Motor Vehicles combined with the efficiency of Venezuela's [Nicolás] Maduro.”

“The other side has nominated a self-described democratic socialist,” he continued. “That is where they will go.”

Trump says he believes Spain will come through on a Nato commitment for member nations to spending 5% on their common defense.

Spain has been reluctant to commit to that level of funding, which was agreed upon at the Nato summit in The Hague earlier this week.

Trump says his administration would examine ending temporary protected status (TPS) for individuals from El Salvador, but gives no other details.

Asked why he has not canceled TPS for El Salvador, which his administration is paying to detain migrants deported from the US, Trump says: “We'll take a look. We've had a great relationship with El Salvador. They have a fantastic leader … We'll talk about El Salvador.”

Trump says it “would be great” if Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell lowered interest rates.

The only problem we have is we have a Fed guy that doesn't understand what's happening. And it would be great if it lower the rate, because we'd be able to borrow a lot cheaper.

Trump reiterates that Tehran wants to meet following US strikes on three Iranian nuclear last weekend, but gives no further details.

He repeats his claim that Iran's nuclear sites were “obliterated”, saying “we finished them off”, and repeats his attacks on “fake news” coverage of an early DIA intelligence assessment that found the damage was much less extensive than that and and has likely only set back Tehran's nuclear program by months.

He also says that he would want the International Atomic Energy Agency or another trusted entity to have full rights to conduct inspections in Iran.

Trump says he plans to send out a letter over the next week and a half telling countries what US tariff rate they will have to pay.

He also says that he's working on trade deals with several countries, including India.

Trump says he has “great respect” for conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett – who has taken a lot of heat recently from Maga types – and says her decision was “brilliantly written”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Nato chief Mark Rutte derided for calling US president ‘daddy' and showering him with praise over Iran

History may record this week as the one in which Donald Trump came to Europe to discuss defence spending.

Diplomats may remember it as the week in which the art of obsequiousness reached new highs and the sycophants plunged new lows.

All in the name of taming the president. It seems to have worked.

After Trump landed to Washington from this week's Nato summit in The Hague, the White House posted a video that made clear how his team felt the trip had gone.

The summit had concluded on Wednesday with a joint press conference in which Nato's secretary general, Mark Rutte, after showering the US president with compliments over his actions on Iran, bizarrely referred to him as “daddy”.

Rutte was now being widely derided for the summit's “orchestrated grovel” and attempting to row back on his choice of language. In Washington, however, Team Trump were enjoying themselves.

“Daddy's home!” trilled the video, which mixed clips of Trump's handshakes with world leaders with footage of crowds awaiting his motorcade, soundtracked by a 2010 song by Usher: “And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day …”

The tone of Rutte's public bootlicking had been muted compared with the text messages he had sent to “dear Donald” before the summit – “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, it was truly extraordinary … you will achieve something NO president in decades could get done” – and which the president had immediately leaked. “I think he likes me,” smirked Trump later, while his cabinet giggled behind him.

Ass-kissing, arse-licking, brown-nosing, sucking up – there is a reason metaphors for obsequiousness so often involve body fluids and the backside, because the act of sycophancy demeans both the arselicker and the arselickee.

What is more cringeworthy, after all – the clips of Trump's cabinet members taking turns to parrot praise of his leadership and vision, or the fact that his fragile ego demands lavish compliments before he can get down to work?

No doubt all the president's yes-men believe that lavishing him with praise can lead to lavish rewards.

Take the former South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who in 2020 presented him with a “bookshelf-sized” bronze model of Mount Rushmore, portraying Trump's face next to those of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Noem is now the secretary of homeland security. Stephen Miller, who called Trump “the most stylish president in our lifetime”, is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy.

To some observers, this is just how Trump works, at home and abroad, and world leaders like Rutte who engage in flattery and “strategic self-emasculation” are just being smart. “A useful way to think about President Trump and his team is not in terms of a conventional American administration, but rather as a court,” says Sam Edwards, a reader in modern political history at Loughborough University. Understood in those terms, he argues, performative upsucking is all.

He points to Keir Starmer's first visit to Trump's Oval Office, when the UK prime minister theatrically brandished a letter from King Charles inviting Trump to a second state visit, saying, “This is really special, this is unprecedented.”

In this sense, Edwards argues, Rutte's conduct “looks like debasement, like he's conducted himself with weakness,” says Edwards. “But in the longer term, he gets the Nato partners to sign up to 5% expenditure on defence, which is something he wants as much as Trump wants. I guess that's the strategic calculation that Rutte has made. I might come in for criticism, but further down the line, do I get what I want? Yes.”

That view is not universal, however. “Mr Rutte, he's trying to embarrass you, sir,” Trump's former director of communications Anthony Scaramucci said earlier this week. “He's literally sitting on Air Force One laughing at you.”

David H Dunn, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, agrees that licking Trump's boots doesn't earn his favour but his disdain. His flattering cabinet were selected not because the president admires them, says Dunn, but because their obsequiousness shows their weakness.

He thinks Rutte, too, has miscalculated. “There is a lot of evidence from the first term that Trump doesn't necessarily respond to flattery,” Dunn says. “It sends a signal that this is not an alliance of equals. This is not the America of old, whereby there was a coming together of countries of shared values and shared interests. What it looks like is fealty to the king.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Environmental groups, immigration advocates and Native Americans decry idea to set up the outdoor detention camp

Environmental groups, immigration rights activists and a Native American tribe have decried the construction of a harsh outdoor migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades billed by state officials as “Alligator Alcatraz”.

Crews began preparing the facility at a remote, largely disused training airfield this week in support of the Trump administration's aggressive goal of arresting and incarcerating 3,000 undocumented migrants every day.

It is among a number of controversial new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jails appearing around the country as the number of detentions by the agency surges dramatically.

Florida officials say the Everglades camp, which has been criticized by the Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost as “a cruel spectacle”, will open in the first week of July – a month in which south Florida's daily heat index regularly exceeds 100F (37.8C).

Initially, about 100 Florida national guard troops will provide “security” at the base, a spokesperson said on Thursday, a number likely to increase as its detainee population grows.

Paid for by Florida taxpayers and homeland security department funds, the project came about after the state seized the 39-square-mile site from its owners, Miami-Dade county, under emergency powers enacted by the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. It now faces staunch opposition from an alliance of groups.

These groups say housing up to 5,000 detainees in tents in the heat and humidity of the Florida summer, at a site surrounded by marshes and wetlands containing alligators, Burmese pythons and swarms of mosquitoes, amounts to inhumane treatment.

James Uthmeier, the state's hard-right attorney general, laughed off the criticism.

“We believe in the swamp down here in Florida. We are swamp creatures,” he told the conservative podcast host Benny Johnson in a reveal of the scheme on Monday that bordered on mockery.

“There's no way in and no way out. The perimeter's already set by Mother Nature. People get out, there's not much waiting for them other than pythons and alligators.”

The airfield's 11,000ft runway, he said, was perfect for large planes bringing in scores of undocumented persons detained by Ice from all over the US.

“There's a lot of low-hanging fruit,” said Uthmeier, who was held in civil contempt by a federal judge this month for continuing to enforce a state immigration law she blocked.

The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians condemned the use of its ancestral lands in the Big Cypress national preserve for detention purposes, citing parallels with the government's mass roundup and forced removal of Native Americans in the 19th century.

“The state would save substantial taxpayer dollars by pursuing its goals at a different location with more existing infrastructure and less environmental and cultural impacts to the Big Cypress and Tribal lands,” Talbert Cypress, chair of the Miccosukee Tribe, said in a statement posted to social media.

Environmental fears have been raised by, among others, the Friends of the Everglades group, and the mayor of Miami-Dade, Daniella Levine Cava, who sent the Guardian a statement detailing her “significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state's effort”.

She said the project would have a “potentially devastating impact to the Everglades”, and noted that the state and federal government had invested billions of dollars in Everglades restoration efforts, some of which she fears could now be undone.

“We continue to have concerns about how a facility at this scale can operate without impacts to the surrounding ecosystem,” she said.

Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said the site was found unsuitable for development in the 1960s, when ambitious plans to make it a six-runway Everglades jetport with monorail service ferrying tourists to Florida's east and west coasts, was thwarted by environmental activism.

“All the reasons this was terrible back then still exist today,” she said.

“These are really valuable and protected Everglades wetlands, and if we move forward with a thousand-bed prison detention facility, whether it's temporary or not, there will be impacts from ancillary development, water and sewer impacts, water supply needs, traffic impacts. Those impacts were analyzed a half-century ago, and we know that they would be negative.

“Combined with the assault on Florida state parks last summer, and the rock mine proposal that we're currently fighting in the Everglades, it suggests the DeSantis administration is out of touch with what Floridians want, which is to protect the Everglades and our last remaining green spaces.”

Neither the Florida department of emergency management, which is managing construction of the camp, nor Uthmeier's office responded to requests for comment.

Immigration advocates, meanwhile, say the Everglades camp represents a sinister ramping up of the DeSantis's already vigorous endorsement of Donald Trump's agenda. The Tampa Bay Times reported on Wednesday that a second new detention facility, at the Florida national guard's Camp Blanding training center west of Jacksonville, was in the works.

“He just always has to throw red meat to his base, always has to generate controversy and polarization,” said Thomas Kennedy, spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.

“So obviously, they pick the most controversial site possible, right in the Everglades, using language like the alligators and the snakes, making it seem like it's going to be like a medieval castle with a moat.

“There's no adequate running water or plumbing facilities. Uthmeier is out there saying we don't need to build brick and mortar because we'll just throw some tents up in the middle of the swamp, in July, in hurricane season, with the heat, no proper infrastructure and the mosquitoes.

“It's designed to enact suffering.”

Frost, in a statement, called Uthmeier “a Trump sycophant”, and said the Everglades project was “disgusting”.

“Donald Trump, his administration, and his enablers have made one thing brutally clear: they intend to use the power of government to kidnap, brutalize, starve, and harm every single immigrant they can,” he said.

“They target migrants, rip families apart, and subject people to conditions that amount to physical and psychological torture. Now, they want to erect tents in the blazing Everglades sun and call it immigration enforcement. They don't care if people live or die; they only care about cruelty and spectacle.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An Israeli strike hit a street in central Gaza on Thursday, where witnesses said a crowd of people was getting bags of flour from a Palestinian police unit that had confiscated the goods from gangs looting aid convoys. 

Hospital officials said 18 people were killed.

The strike was the latest violence surrounding the distribution of food to Gaza's population, which has been thrown into turmoil over the past month. After blocking all food for two-and-a-half months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since the middle of last month.

Efforts by the UN to distribute the food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.

The strike in Deir al-Balah appeared to target members of Sahm, a security unit tasked with stopping looters and cracking down on merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices. The unit is part of Gaza's Hamas-led Interior Ministry, but includes members of other factions.

A HORRIFIC SCENE

Witnesses said the Sahm unit was distributing bags of flour and other goods confiscated from looters and corrupt merchants, drawing a crowd when the strike hit. Video of the aftermath showed bodies, several torn, of multiple young men in the street with blood splattering on the pavement and walls of buildings. 

The dead included a child and at least seven Sahm members, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said, where casualties were taken.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. 

Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid and using it to prop up its rule in the enclave. Israeli forces have repeatedly struck Gaza's police, considering them a branch of Hamas.

An association of Gaza's influential clans and tribes on Wednesday said they have started an independent effort to guard aid convoys to prevent looting. 

The National Gathering of Palestinian Clans and Tribes said it helped escort a rare shipment of flour that entered northern Gaza that evening. It was unclear if the association had coordinated with the UN or Israeli authorities. 

“We will no longer allow thieves to steal from the convoys for the merchants and force us to buy them for high prices,” said Abu Ahmad al-Gharbawi, a figure involved in the tribal effort.

ACCUSATIONS

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz in a joint statement on Wednesday accused Hamas of stealing aid that is entering northern Gaza and called on the Israeli military to plan to prevent it.

The National Gathering slammed the statement, saying the accusation of theft was aimed at justifying the Israeli military's “aggressive practices.” 

Aid was “fully secured” by the tribes, it said, adding that they were committed to delivering the supplies to the population.

Throughout the war, the UN led the massive aid operation by humanitarian groups providing food, shelter, medicine and other goods to Palestinians despite the fighting. However, Israel seeks to replace the UN-led system and has backed an American private contractor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has started distributing food boxes at four locations, mainly in the far south of Gaza for the past month.

Thousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the hubs, moving through Israeli military zones, where witnesses said Israeli troops regularly open fire with heavy barrages to control the crowds.

Health officials said hundreds of people have been killed and wounded, while the Israeli military said it has only fired warning shots.

Pep Guardiola's Manchester City demonstrated their FIFA Club World Cup credentials with a 5-2 victory over Juventus on Thursday, while Vinicius Junior starred as Real Madrid beat Salzburg 3-0 to secure a spot in the last 16.

Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia beat Pachuca of Mexico 2-0 to pip Salzburg to the last berth in the knockout phase, as Al-Ain battled to a 2-1 win over Wydad Casablanca in the day's other game.

City became the only side at the tournament to win all three of their group matches as they put Juventus to the sword in front of 54,320 at the Camping World Stadium in Orland, Florida.

City now face Al-Hilal, the only Asian representative in the next round after goals from Salem Al-Dawsari and Brazilian Marcos Leonardo against Pachuca.

“We played well and I'm happy with the victory,” said City winger Jeremy Doku, who opened the scoring.

Doku pounced for the early opener after new arrival Rayan Ait-Nouri set him up with a clever ball.

However, City stopper Ederson passed the ball straight to Teun Koopmeiners who leveled for Juventus, in one of the few moments in which Guardiola's team let their focus slip.

Pierre Kalulu bundled into his own net from Matheus Nunes' cross to restore City's lead.

The English Premier League side, hoping to make up for a poor season by their standards in which they finished without a major trophy, stepped up a level after the break with Erling Haaland's introduction.

The Norwegian striker tapped home the third and then helped create the fourth for Phil Foden, before Savinho smashed home from distance for the fifth.

Dusan Vlahovic netted late on for Juve, but it did not take the shine off an impressive triumph for City, who were able to give holding midfielder Rodri a first start after his long injury layoff.

“Manchester City have a lot better [quality of] players than us, that's the truth, that needs to be acknowledged,” said Juventus coach Igor Tudor, as his side finished second in Group G. 

“The stars didn't align for us to play better tonight,” he added. 

Al-Ain got the better of Wydad in Washington in a meeting of two teams who were already eliminated, but were hoping to sign off with a victory.

South African striker Cassius Mailula blasted the Moroccans into an early lead, but Togo international Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba levelled from the spot just before the break for Al-Ain.

That was their first goal of the tournament after 5-0 and 6-0 thrashings by Juve and City respectively, and Paraguayan international Alejandro Romero curled home from the edge of the box to earn the team from the United Arab Emirates victory.

Vinicius scored one goal and made another with a touch of class as Madrid saw off Salzburg in Philadelphia to clinch top spot in Group H.

Real play Juventus in the last 16 in Miami on Tuesday.

Brazilian star Vinicius opened the scoring after a superb defense-splitting pass by Jude Bellingham on 40 minutes, to the delight of the vast majority of the 64,811 crowd on a rainy night at Lincoln Financial Field. Vinicius then set up Federico Valverde with a clever backheel to make it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time.

Young striker Gonzalo Garcia ran through to wrap up the win late on with his second goal of the tournament, as Xabi Alonso's team ended the first round of FIFA's new tournament unbeaten.

“I am pleased with the boys, and now the interesting phase begins,” Alonso told broadcaster DAZN.

Real were once again without top scorer Kylian Mbappe, who has yet to play at the tournament as he recovers from illness.

“We thought Kylian would make it and it wasn't to be. Now we have four days and I want to be optimistic but cautious at the same time,” Alonso said.



                                                                                While British star Jack Draper spent the past week trying to find rhythm and comfort in his first grass tournament of the season at the Queen's Club Championships in London, Jiri Lehecka on Saturday bulldozed everything in his path.
After more than two furious hours of battle, their form was reflected in the final scoreline as Lehecka toppled a frustrated Draper, the second seed, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 to reach the biggest final of his career, against Carlos Alcaraz. Lehecka is also the first Czech to reach the men's title match at Queen's since Ivan Lendl lifted the trophy in 1990.

Sabalenka was 6-2 down in the final-set tie-breaker, but won six straight points to reach her eighth semi-final of the season.
“Elena is a great player and we've had a lot of tough battles,” Sabalenka said. “I have no idea how I was able to win those last points. I think I just got lucky.”

President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday conferred a presidential award on  Mitsuo Ohashi, former chair of the Japan-Taiwan Exchange  Association (JTEA), in recognition of his contributions to  Taiwan-Japan relations.

During a ceremony in Taipei, Lai presented the Order of  the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon to Ohashi, who led the  JTEA for 14 years, praising him as “a model of Taiwan- Japan friendship,” according to a Presidential Office news  release.

The president thanked Ohashi for his unwavering  dedication to promoting bilateral ties, noting that during his  tenure, Taipei and Tokyo had signed over 50 agreements on  trade and economics, fisheries and taxation.

He also credited Ohashi's efforts with helping  institutionalize Taiwan-Japan ties, notably through the 2017  renaming of the JTEA and its Taiwanese counterpart, the  Taiwan-Japan Relations Association, to include the word  “Taiwan.”

Looking ahead, Lai expressed hope that Taiwan and  Japan would further strengthen their relations by  accelerating talks on an economic partnership agreement  and collaborating in key sectors such as semiconductors,  energy and artificial intelligence.

In his remarks, Ohashi said he is proud of the close ties  between Taiwan and Japan, particularly in the midst of  growing international geopolitical tensions, according to the  news release.

Ohashi, who was on a short visit to Taiwan on Thursday  and Friday, said he would continue to promote peace in his  role as head of the Japan branch of the World Federalist  Movement, an organization dedicated to advancing global  cooperation and democratic governance.

Ohashi was succeeded by Shuzo Sumi, the former head  of Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc., as the JTEA chair -- a  primarily ceremonial role -- on June 20.

The JTEA is headquartered in Tokyo and has offices in  Taipei and Kaohsiung. Its Taipei office functions as the de  facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan, and its current  representative is Kazuyuki Katayama.

The US' ongoing conflict with Iran is not merely an act of retaliation or a “delaying tactic,” but a strategic military campaign aimed at dismantling Tehran's nuclear capabilities and reshaping the regional order in the Middle East, said National Defense University distinguished adjunct lecturer Holmes Liao (廖宏祥), former McDonnell Douglas Aerospace representative in Taiwan.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 21 people and injuring more than 300 others, local officials reported.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said the morning strike ignited a large fire and also damaged a dormitory, a gymnasium, and an administrative building in the city.

The Russian military also struck the nearby town of Samarske, Lysak said. Casualties were reported in both locations. 

""Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere,"" he said.  

In Samarske, two people were killed, and 14 injured. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition.

""As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: ""The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase.""

Lysak reported on June 27 that the death toll in Dnipro rose to 21. Earlier, the governor said that more than 300 people were injured in the attack.

Almost a hundred of the victims remain in the hospital, according to Lysak.

Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. 

""Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia,"" the company said in a statement.

In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care.

The attack came as NATO leaders convened for a high-level summit in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.



Active fighting is still taking place around the village of Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, home to one of Ukraine's largest lithium deposits, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces told the Kyiv Independent on June 27, denying reports Russia had occupied the village.

The activists reportedly thought the equipment would be supplied to Israel.

The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell explains a new modification of the standard first-person view (FPV) drone that already once transformed the way war is fought. Fiber optic cable now used to connect drone operators to FPVs ensures a perfect image and control experience all the way to the target — and cannot be spotted by enemy drone detectors.



A day earlier, EU member states' leaders gave their political consent to extend the sanctions previously imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine.

""Russia decided to plunge Kherson Oblast into darkness,"" Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on Telegram. He said the attack has disrupted electricity supply to multiple settlements.

""After completing discussions on humanitarian issues, Ukraine plans to move forward to the topic of a leaders' summit for substantive dialogue,"" Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said during a press briefing on June 26.

""We saw them on the battlefield — and it's truly motivating,"" Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.

""It's a crime,"" Ukraine's ambassador to India, Oleksandr Polishchuk, told Reuters. ""We will share our investigation with our European Union colleagues, and we will kindly ask them to take the appropriate measures.""

Governor Serhii Lysak said most of the injured were hospitalized. Three of the victims are in serious condition, while the others sustained moderate injuries.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Ukrainian air defense intercepted 365 of 371 incoming Russian air weapons, including 363 Shahed-type drones, two Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, and six Kalibr cruise missiles.

""These are soldiers specially selected based on physical, psychological, and other criteria,"" Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. ""These units have already suffered significant losses.""

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov was officially named a suspect on June 23 in what Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau called a ""large-scale"" illegal land grab case. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, local officials reported.

The Netherlands and Belgium have delivered two minehunter vessels to Ukraine to support maritime security in the Black Sea, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced on June 26.

""The Netherlands and Belgium are transferring two minehunters to Ukraine. A vital contribution to Black Sea security, and key to safeguarding trade routes and global food supply,"" Brekelmans said on X. He added that Ukrainian crews and technicians were trained ""in record time."" 

According to the Dutch Defense Ministry, the vessels involved are the Belgian ship BNS Narcis and the Dutch Zr.Ms. Vlaardingen. The official handover ceremony took place earlier in Zeebrugge, Belgium, but was disclosed only later due to security concerns.

""The major ports of Odesa and the Black Sea shipping lanes are the lifeblood of the Ukrainian economy,"" Brekelmans said. ""And (they are) under constant threat. Ukraine may not win the war at sea, but it can certainly lose the war there. We simply cannot let that happen. That is why it is so important for maritime security and free passage that Ukraine can use minehunters.""

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the Netherlands has provided Kyiv with a combined 8.4 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy while Belgium has allocated over two billion euros (about $2.2 billion) in support, including military, financial, and humanitarian assistance.

A Chinese journalist was reportedly injured in a drone strike near Russia's border with Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, acting governor Alexander Khinshtein said on June 27.

According to Khinshtein, 63-year-old reporter Lu Yuguang from the Chinese television network Phoenix TV was wounded in a Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Korenevo in Russia's Kursk Oblast. He sustained an open head injury and a contusion on the parietal region of his skull, but later declined hospitalization after being examined at a regional hospital, Khinshtein wrote on Telegram.

""Fortunately, the journalist received skin wounds on the head. No other damage was found,"" the governor said, adding, ""Please refrain from traveling to the border area, it can be dangerous.""

If confirmed, this would be the first publicly reported case of a Chinese journalist being injured in Russia's Kursk Oblast as a result of cross-border drone strikes amid Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign troops since World War II. The move was intended to disrupt a planned Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's Sumy Oblast and to relieve pressure on the Donetsk front.

Since then, Ukraine claims it has inflicted 63,402 Russian troop casualties in the oblast, including 25,625 killed and 971 captured. Ukrainian forces also say they have destroyed or damaged over 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment in the area.

Russia retook most of the lost territory during a renewed offensive in March 2025, supported by North Korean troops. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

For months, the “buy Canadian” movement has inspired Canadians to shift their shopping habits away from American goods. While this has mostly been a patriotic move, some experts say recent cuts at the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for inspecting 80 per cent of American food, might give Canadians another reason to think twice about buying American products at the grocery store.

Kate Helmore is The Globe's agriculture and food policy reporter. She's on the show to talk about why the cuts at the FDA have some experts concerned, how intertwined the U.S. and Canadian food systems are, and why it's so challenging to disentangle them.

Greece is experiencing its first heat wave of the summer. A large wildfire broke out south of Athens, prompting evacuations as temperatures approached 40 degrees Celsius.

Greek firefighters on Thursday battled a fast-moving wildfire that burned holiday homes and forest land near the coastal town of Palaia Fokaia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Athens.

""Right now, strong land and air forces are fighting a huge battle against the flames, mainly among homes,"" fire department spokesman Col. Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.

He added that 12 water-dropping planes and 12 helicopters were providing air support to 80 fire engines  and 130 firefighters, who were backed up by volunteer firefighters.

The cause of the blaze is still unknown, but authorities say that high temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and strong winds are fueling its rapid spread.  A fire department spokesman said an arson investigation unit had been sent to the area.

According to a report by Greek broadcaster ERTnews, several vacation homes have been destroyed, and a large area of scrubland and forest is currently ablaze.

The civil protection agency sent out emergency text alerts, telling residents to leave the affected coastal area near Palaia Fokaia.

Vathrakogiannis said that Greek police had moved 40 people to safety. Meanwhile, the coast guard reported that two patrol boats and nine private vessels were on standby in the area in case an evacuation by sea was necessary.

Authorities also reported that ambulances were on standby, though none had been needed by Thursday afternoon.

According to Greek radio, police rescued 11 tourists from a holiday home in the danger zone. The fire department stated that the hotel complexes were not in immediate danger.

Wildfires are common in Greece during its hot, dry summers. Authorities said the risk of wildfires would remain high Friday before the weather cooled down.

The civil protection agency warned that small fires can transform into major blazes in a matter of minutes due to extreme heat, dry conditions, and high winds.

Due to the weather conditions, the entire wider Athens area, as well as several Aegean islands, were on Level 4 of a 5-level scale for wildfire danger.

Earlier this week, it took hundreds of firefighters four days to bring a major wildfire under control on the eastern Aegean island of Chios.

Microsoft has announced that it is getting rid of its Blue Screen error display to make way for a ""Black Screen of Death.""

Microsoft is killing its infamous ""Blue Screen of Death"" after more than four decades. The notorious error message will soon be set against a black background.

The technology giant made the announcement in a blog post on Thursday as it outlined wider measures to improve the resilience of the Windows operating system.

""Now it's easier than ever to navigate unexpected restarts and recover faster,"" the company wrote.

The efforts by Microsoft come in light of the 2024 Crowdstike incident which led to a mammoth IT outage, crashing millions of Windows systems across the globe.

The ""Blue Screen of Death"" or Blue Screen error was displayed if a serious problem caused Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly to prevent data loss.

The company said it is ""streamlining"" what users experience when confronted with ""unexpected restarts"" that lead to disruptions.

The steps entail revamping the error screen that greeted users — often frustratingly so — for more than 40 years.

The new error message has a much more condensed text displayed across a black backdrop.

""Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart,"" it will read, according to an image shared by Microsoft in its blog.

The error message is no longer accompanied by a sad face icon and instead shows a percentage completed for the restart process.

The software company said that this ""simplified"" user interface for unexpected restarts will be available from later this summer on all of its Windows 11 (version 24H2) devices.

Germany's foreign minister has defended a decision to cut sea rescue funding in the Mediterranean. The move ends support for NGOs there and has sparked warnings of a worsening humanitarian crisis.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday defended a decision by the conservative-led government to stop financial support for civilian sea rescue organizations operating in the Mediterranean Sea.

The decision has drawn criticism from the opposition Green party, who warned it could worsen an already severe humanitarian crisis.

Speaking at a news conference in Canada, Wadephul said the pulling of funding had been ""the right decision to make.""

""Germany remains committed to humanity and always will be,"" Wadephul said. ""But I don't believe it is the foreign office's job to use funds for this type of sea rescue,"" he added.

Wadephul's ministry on Wednesday said no money had been earmarked for migrant rescue groups in Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil's new budget plans.

The German Foreign Ministry under the previous coalition, led by Green Party minister Annalena Baerbock, had provided significant financial support to NGOs involved in rescuing migrants attempting to reach Europe from Africa.

That funding drew criticism from the center-right Christian Democrats of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who took office in May promising to toughen up immigration policy. The policy also led to tensions with Italy, as many of the rescued migrants were brought ashore there.

According to a ministry source, the German government gave €2 million ($2.3 million) last year to organizations including SOS Humanity, Sea Eye and SOS Mediterranee to support rescue operations for migrants in distress.

Gorden Isler, chairman of the sea rescue NGO Sea-Eye, called the shift in policy a ""catastrophic signal.""

""Now we might have to remain in port despite emergencies at sea,"" he said.

The Greens sharply criticized the decision.

""This move will predictably worsen the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean and cause human suffering,"" said Green parliamentary group leader Britta Hasselmann on Wednesday.

Who will own our energy future? There's a battle playing out in northern Minnesota with major ramifications for this question.

It centers on the region's main investor-owned electric utility, Minnesota Power, whose parent company, Allete, struck a deal in May 2024 to be acquired and taken private for $6.2 billion by two entities: Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which is fully owned by the global asset management behemoth BlackRock, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP).

Minnesota Power, Allete's core holding, says the deal will provide the capital needed to build new clean energy infrastructure to comply with Minnesota's requirement for 100 percent carbon-free electricity sources by 2040.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

But a broad coalition of customers, ratepayer advocates, watchdog organizations, climate groups, local heavy industry, and the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and Department of Commerce is opposing the deal. They say its overall public benefit has not been demonstrated, and they worry it would impose private equity control over their utility, threatening affordability and transparency, and leave ratepayers and regulators at the mercy of far-off financial profiteers. Some also question the deal's climate rationale.

The deal has been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Wisconsin regulators, but it awaits a decision from Minnesota's Public Utility Commission (PUC), likely coming in the fall. A Minnesota administrative law judge will make a nonbinding recommendation on the deal to the Minnesota PUC in July following public hearings earlier this year.

The stakes are high. Locally, the deal would place a vital utility in the private grip of a global financial juggernaut whose raison d'etre is securing big investor returns. More broadly, it signals an acceleration of the asset manager takeover of basic infrastructure everyone depends on — in this case, a monopoly utility meant to be managed for the public good. Truthout spoke with several organizations that have intervened to try to stop the acquisition.

“This deal represents the antithesis of local control,” said Maggie Schuppert, a Minnesota Power customer and organizer with CURE, a rural community advocacy group. “They're buying the things that are the basis of our lives.”

Under the deal, BlackRock, through its subsidiary GIP, would become a 60 percent owner of Allete. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $11.6 trillion in assets. That's around the combined GDP of Germany, Japan, and France.

BlackRock's billionaire CEO Larry Fink has insider access to U.S. presidents across the political spectrum and massive influence within the world of global finance. His annual letters to CEOs are seen as pacesetters for corporate governance.

BlackRock's ascendency over the past two decades rested upon its sprawling empire of low-fee “passive” index funds that track market indexes. These have made BlackRock a top shareholder of virtually every publicly traded U.S. company and a “universal owner” of capital.

But recently, BlackRock has turned sharply toward private markets and “active” management of real assets like infrastructure. The center of this shift was BlackRock's 2024 acquisition of GIP, the world's second-largest infrastructure fund manager, for $12.5 billion.

The firm's growing domination of the utility market is even setting alarm bells off for Trump-appointed regulators.

GIP is a global colossus with dozens of portfolio companies across almost every continent. GIP founder and CEO Adebayo Ogunlesi is also a director of OpenAI and, until recently, was the lead director of Goldman Sachs. He served on business advisory councils for both Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

BlackRock recently made waves when, through GIP, it struck a deal to acquire over 40 global shipping ports, including two in the Panama Canal.

Firms like BlackRock have turned to private ownership over real assets to diversify their holdings and secure steady profits from the infrastructure that undergirds our lives — hospitals, housing, telecommunications, and so on. Utilities, with their regulated returns, are a desirable target.

Scholar Brett Christophers has noted the perils of asset manager dominance over the real assets we all depend on. “While all private owners are trying to make a profit,” he told Truthout in a 2023 interview, “asset managers tend to be particularly ruthless and single-minded in extracting profit from the assets they oversee.”

In northern Minnesota, many worry what will happen if their local utility is swallowed up by BlackRock's business kingdom. As energy expert Scott Hempling told the Minnesota PUC, the deal would make Minnesota Power a “minor asset within the multinational portfolios” of GIP and the CPP.

Opponents of the deal question the utility's claim that the deal is needed to attract sufficient capital to meet Minnesota's clean energy requirements. Brian Edstrom, a senior regulatory advocate with the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (CUB), told Truthout that Allete hasn't demonstrated that it must abandon public markets to raise funds.

“Even accepting they need to raise more capital doesn't mean that this avenue is a better way to do that,” Edstrom told Truthout. “It injects new risks, and they become solely reliant on those two partners for capital.”

Critics point out that Allete's own Securities and Exchange Commission reports contradict its assertion that it must go private for financing. For example, Allete's 2024 annual report stated that the utility was “well positioned to meet our financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows, available additional working capital and access to capital markets.”

Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group focused on private equity, testified on behalf of CURE to the Minnesota PUC that “private equity ownership of Minnesota Power may be a more expensive way to raise capital than through public markets investments because of the high target annual return and cash yield expected to be paid out to GIP Fund V investors.”

Baker noted that GIP Fund V, one of the two funds through which GIP will acquire its 60 percent stake in Allete, has advertised a gross investment return target of 15 to 20 percent, which Baker says is around double the average 8.36 percent return of publicly traded utilities over the past decade.

Opponents of the deal say investor demands for big returns like these will come at the expense of ratepayers. “Private equity investors demand higher profits than normal market investors,” Jenna Yeakle, an organizer with the Sierra Club and a Minnesota Power customer, told Truthout. “That means higher rates for residential and small business customers.”

Intervenors also say private equity ownership will add pressure on regulators who may fear the new owners unloading their investment if it isn't deemed profitable enough.

Experts brought up examples of troublesome private equity takeovers of utilities to the PUC, such as with the Michigan Upper Peninsula Power Company (UPPCO), which Baker testified had significantly higher rates than the Michigan state average following two private acquisitions with multiple rate increases.

“The prospect of a utility that so many folks rely on for access to energy being taken over by a shadowy private equity firm is incredibly concerning,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate director at Private Equity Stakeholder Project, told Truthout.

Some believe customers will have to pay for the deal's acquisition premium, which CUB estimates at around $600 million and one utility expert testifying on behalf of CURE estimates at around $1.5 billion — money that will go to Allete's shareholders, including the current executives running the company.

“The captive customers who've been paying rates to grow the company don't receive any of that literal financial benefit associated with the sale,” said Edstrom. “But they do inherit the potential risk of private equity now owning the utility that they have no choice to get their electricity from.”

Opponents say the deal will concentrate control over a community asset, with just two private owners focused on extracting profits and operating with less transparency. Between their control over the board — GIP and CPP can appoint 10 of Allete's 13 directors — and becoming Allete's sole source of capital, these two private owners will dominate the utility.

“That's control from two different sides,” says Edstrom.

If taken private, Allete will face less regulatory scrutiny, and opponents of the deal worry about a greater lack of transparency.

“We don't have any ability to know what this deal actually looks like and what its ramifications will be,” said Schuppert. “All we really have to go on is what we know private equity always does, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.”

“They're invested in what makes them money and don't care if it's fossil fuels or renewables.”

BlackRock has big stakes in other U.S. utilities through its passive funds. The firm's growing domination of the utility market is even setting alarm bells off for Trump-appointed regulators.

In May, FERC Chairman Mark Christie warned of “the specter of a huge asset manager, such as BlackRock, using its substantial holdings to exert control over the operational decisions of a public utility,” adding that “a public utility has public service obligations; it is not just another company seeking to maximize returns to its shareholders.”

Opponents also question Minnesota Power's claim that the deal is necessary to meet its climate commitments under state law and say the utility's own filings contradict this claim.

They point to the utility's new integrated resource plan that proposes adding around 1,000 megawatts of natural gas capacity. Natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits large amounts of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases.

“At the same time they're saying they need this deal to fund the clean energy transition, they're presenting a plan that isn't geared toward clean energy, but largely natural gas,” said Schuppert.

Truthout reached out to Allete for comment. “As we move forward to remove coal generation from our system, we need to replace it with a reliable 24/7 available resource and natural gas is a flexible important resource,” an Allete representative said, also referring Truthout to a press release on the company's integrated resource plan.

Some critics of the deal worry that private equity ownership could slow down Minnesota Power's retirement of its Boswell coal plant.

BlackRock has backtracked on previous climate commitments. It recently withdrew from a major net-zero initiative, while the CPP was lambasted for dropping its net-zero commitment in May. GIP is also a big investor in fossil fuel projects, including the Rio Grande LNG facility under construction in Brownsville, Texas, which has faced major community opposition.

“All this should raise a lot of concern,” said Schafer. “There's no reason that customers in Minnesota should have faith that BlackRock and GIP are going to do the right thing.”

Critics say there's nothing legally binding the new owners to provide clean energy funding to Minnesota Power. “The commitment to provide that capital is a big pinky swear they're making in the context of this proceeding, but it's not legally enforceable,” Edstrom says.

Because utilities garner profits from investing in new infrastructure, there are also worries that the new owners could saddle ratepayers with the costs of unnecessary projects while skimping on the operational side.

Some wonder whether BlackRock's interest in Allete relates to its growing focus on data centers, which are major utility customers. There's speculation that a new data center is being proposed outside of Duluth.

Truthout reached out for comment to BlackRock, GlP, CPP, and Allete on the multiple criticisms of the acquisition discussed in this article, but only received a response from Allete. An Allette representative shared a press release and other materials on, they said, “why this transaction is necessary and is the best path forward for our employees, customers and communities as we build a clean-energy future.”

Even if the new ownership follows through with clean energy investments, there's a larger question at stake: Will the energy transition be controlled by far-off private investors, or can it be something more democratic and accountable?

“They're invested in what makes them money and don't care if it's fossil fuels or renewables,” Schuppert says. “I don't want these entities controlling my green energy either.”

Even if the Minnesota PUC rejects the acquisition of Minnesota Power, Allete would remain a for-profit investor-owned utility, albeit with more transparency than a private utility owned by giant asset managers.

From New York to Washington, D.C. to San Diego, movements for democratic and decommodified public power are growing.

“Rather than handing power and profits to private equity,” Schuppert and Yeakle wrote in a recent op-ed, “we could begin to develop a system that keeps every dollar of revenue from the electric power system in our communities and reinvested for our long-term, beneficial interests.”

In the final sprint leading up to Zohran Mamdani's historic win on Tuesday, the New York City mayoral primary took on an unusually refreshing tone: one of cooperation.

Shortly before early voting started, Mamdani, a state assemblymember and unabashed democratic socialist, cross-endorsed with City Comptroller Brad Lander. It was a good match. In spots where 33-year-old Mamdani's political resume was thin, Lander, a longtime local progressive leader, could add gravitas. What Lander lacked in innovation and charisma, polling in a distant third place, Mamdani had in spades. And by appearing side-by-side at rallies, in social media videos, and on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” the two could work to dispel the lie that Muslim and Jewish New Yorkers need be divided. Their overarching message was clear: Vote for both of us, but keep disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo off your ballot.

This collaborative approach to campaigning was enabled by New York City's ranked choice voting system, which voters overwhelmingly adopted for primaries and special elections in a 2019 ballot referendum. New York's system allows voters to rank their top five candidates rather than choose just one. If no candidate receives the majority of votes, ballot tabulation continues in rounds, with the last-place candidate eliminated each round. When a voter's top candidate is eliminated, their second-choice candidate gets their vote, and so on.

Advocates began pushing for ranked choice voting after the 2013 Democratic primaries for city council, when multiple candidates were elected with less than 40 percent of the vote. Those results hardly felt democratic. And proponents argued that, by eliminating the winner-takes-all approach, ranked choice voting could help lesser-known progressives band together to box out corporate-backed establishment candidates.

That vision was dealt a blow during the city's first test of ranked choice voting, when Eric Adams notched the 2021 Democratic nomination for mayor during the eighth round of counting. During that election, it was two moderates, former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and businessman Andrew Yang, who formed a failed last-minute alliance in the hopes of keeping Adams out of city hall. But Garcia ultimately finished second, and Maya Wiley, a progressive candidate endorsed by the Working Families Party, trailed in third.

Ranked choice voting might not seem relevant to this year's primary. After all, while ballot tabulation is still continuing in rounds, Mamdani's incredible grassroots campaign earned him a clear plurality of the vote right off the bat. Before election night was over, Cuomo had already conceded.

It's a remarkable feat for Mamdani — a young socialist loudly opposed to Israel's genocide in Gaza — to beat out Cuomo's multimillion-dollar, super PAC-funded campaign, which fought tooth and nail to paint Mamdani as a radical antisemite. The vast majority of polls had it wrong; it wasn't even a close race. And Mamdani's victory isn't attributable to just one thing: He mobilized 50,000 volunteers to knock on more than 1 million doors; he had a clear, compelling pitch to New Yorkers for how he plans to make life in the city more affordable; and his media team ran an infectious social video campaign that will likely be studied for years to come.

Cuomo is also, well, a scumbag centrist. He largely ran on his track record as New York governor, but his tenure was marked by scandals. His administration hid the true toll of nursing home deaths at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and he eventually resigned in disgrace after more than a dozen women credibly accused him of sexual harassment. Lander shared his explicit feelings about Cuomo during a triumphant speech following Mamdani's victory, “Andrew Cuomo is in the past. He is not the present or future of New York City. Good fucking riddance.”

So, no, ranked choice voting didn't hand Mamdani his victory. Still, it's exciting to see how the system can galvanize parts of the left into coalition rather than infighting. It wasn't just Lander: Michael Blake, a former New York state assemblymember, also cross-endorsed with Mamdani and ramped up television ads in the days before the primary, urging his supporters not to rank Cuomo. The Working Families Party, a progressive group, encouraged its supporters to rank its slate of endorsed candidates and leave Cuomo off their ballot. Perhaps even more than “Vote For Me,” the message to New Yorkers before Election Day became “Don't Rank Cuomo.”

“People were really excited about a politics that doesn't feel so selfish,” Lander told New York Magazine in an election postmortem on June 25. “I thought it was interesting yesterday that both Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo went out of their way to say, ‘I'm only voting for myself.' And in contrast, the cross endorsement reflects a shared belief in the future of the city.”

This collaborative approach made possible by ranked choice voting is not only ideologically aligned with the progressive left, but it also presents a materially different opportunity for candidates. Those who fall behind in — increasingly unreliable — polls aren't pressured to drop out to avoid splitting the vote, leaving their supporters to decide between whoever remains. Since the candidates never stopped running their campaigns, they could, in a way, pool their resources — and each reach their respective voting blocs with messaging they knew would ultimately help propel Mamdani, the clear progressive frontrunner, to victory. As Susan Lerner, one of the architects of ranked choice voting in New York City and the executive director of Common Cause New York, told the New York Times, the system also requires candidates to work harder to reach a broader swath of potential voters, knocking on more doors in the hopes of receiving second- and third-place rankings. Plus, if ranked choice voting wasn't a threat to the status quo, then the Republican National Committee probably wouldn't have adopted a formal resolution calling to ban it.

Ranked choice voting presents an exciting and underexplored opportunity for a more deeply democratic process. It is only, however, the tip of the iceberg for building a movement on the left. While Lander has a serious track record of policy wins for New York City's working class, he is also a self-described liberal Zionist who opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. And, contrary to right-wing fearmongering, Mamdani is not going to single-handedly bring about the fall of capitalism in New York City (bummer!), because that is not something that the mayor of New York City has the power to do. His role, should he be elected in the November general election, will be to better the quality of life for working-class New Yorkers through social democratic policy-making.

So, much of the work of building power on the left will still have to be done at the grassroots level, in communities and outside of electoralism. But within the political machine, let's think of this election as a first step — an example of how our democratic processes can more adequately represent the will of the people — and take what lessons we can to strategize for more solidarity in action.

The new attack on the CFPB comes after an earlier proposal to eliminate its entire budget violated reconciliation rules.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Senate Republicans on Thursday moved to revive a plan to dramatically reduce the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's budget after the chamber's parliamentarian determined that an earlier proposal ran afoul of reconciliation rules.

The previous proposal, crafted by Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, would have zeroed out the CFPB's budget, but the Senate parliamentarian deemed it in violation of the Byrd Rule.

The new attack on the CFPB, unveiled by Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) — a major recipient of financial industry donations — would cut the agency's budget nearly in half. The proposal still must face scrutiny from the parliamentarian.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee and an architect of the consumer bureau, said in a statement that Democrats would introduce an amendment to strip the proposal from the reconciliation package, noting that the CFPB has “returned $21 billion to scammed American families” since its inception in the wake of the Great Recession.

“Donald Trump and Republicans tried to shut down the CFPB by gutting its entire operating budget to 0%,” said Warren. “We fought back and won. Now, Senate Republicans will bring to the floor a proposal that slashes the agency's available budget so they can hand out more tax breaks for billionaires and billionaire corporations.”

The CFPB has been a major target of the Trump administration, which has installed an opponent of the agency — Russell Vought — as its acting director, moved to gut the bureau's staff, and effectively halted its enforcement efforts. Since the start of Trump's second term, the CFPB has dropped at least 18 enforcement actions against predatory financial firms.

“Trump is making his corporate backers even richer by letting them swindle you,” former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote Thursday.

Research released earlier this week estimates that the Trump administration's assault on the CFPB has already cost Americans $18 billion worth of fees and lost compensation for harms inflicted by law-breaking corporations.

“The increased consumer costs from the CFPB's rollback of regulations on bank fees, wholesale dismissal of cases against banks and other lenders, and the apparent failure to disburse funds intended for harmed borrowers run counter to Trump's campaign pledges to ease the cost of living,” Reuters reported Tuesday, citing an analysis by the Student Borrower Protection Center and the Consumer Federation of America.

JOSEP BORRELL FONTELLES is former Vice President and High Representative of the European Union Commission and the former Foreign Minister of Spain.

Formerly at Harvard, Oxford, and the École National d'Administration, she has advised EU bodies and is a coauthor of A Citizen's Guide to the Rule of Law.

 Josep Borrell Fontelles and Kalypso Nicolaidis

The European Union has rarely played more than an auxiliary role in helping resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in spite of its multifaceted presence in the region. Over the past two decades, European governments came to believe that achieving a two-state solution was more or less impossible and not worth the investment of time and energy. And to many Europeans, supporting the status quo in Israel while rhetorically condemning some of the country's actions seemed manageable.

It was not. As Europe and the rest of the world looked away, the costs of failing to secure a durable peace in which both Israelis and Palestinians enjoy the right to self-determination became exorbitant.

Some European governments can be hesitant to intervene in other countries' affairs—justifiably, given their colonial history. But Europe can no longer afford to linger at the margins of a conflict whose most recent iteration began with Hamas's horrific October 7 attack on Israel and continued with the Israeli government's devastating war on Gaza and escalations between Israel and Iran. Not only is Europe's own security at stake, but more important, European history imposes a duty on Europeans to intervene in response to Israel's violations of international law. Moreover, when it comes to the aftermath of the war in Gaza, the EU has experience to offer that no other actor does: practical lessons, hard-won during the twentieth century, about how to reject cycles of endless war and collaborate with former adversaries to achieve peace and prosperity.

To be fair, many European leaders have called on the EU and its member states to take a more active role in peacemaking and are stepping up their individual efforts. But the EU needs a concerted plan. A set of precepts born out of five years spent trying to lead a disunited EU Middle East policy can guide these efforts: the EU must live up to Europe's responsibility to the Middle East and use its as yet untapped financial leverage. It must offer concrete support on the ground to those who want peace. It must confront spoilers on all sides. It must protect those seeking to illuminate facts on the ground. It must back the work of the UN and consistently uphold international law. Before anything else, however, the EU must overcome the internal obstacles to action posed by its member states' divergent approaches to Israel.

Europeans bear significant responsibility for the conflicts currently roiling the Middle East. We are both the original perpetrators and historical accomplices, guilty by implication in the tragedy that has been unfolding for decades. Since at least the Middle Ages, we have created trauma that contributes to Jewish people's feeling of vulnerability. In the nineteenth century, anti-Semitic European nationalisms and colonial tropes gave rise to Zionism as a secular national movement. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, European powers carved up the region, carelessly imposing boundaries, aggravating local cleavages, and exploiting its natural resources. The 1917 Balfour Declaration promised to protect “the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” but European leaders did not follow suit. Much had prepared the ground for what many consider the worst crime in human history, the Holocaust.

These dark chapters oblige Europeans to prevent the annihilation of Israel, the safe haven that Jews sought after the Holocaust. But if Europe bears responsibility for its victims, it also bears responsibility for the victims of its victims. After the end of the British mandate in Palestine, Israel's 1948 war of independence, and the flight or expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs from their homes, Europeans did not push back against the UN's failure to implement its partition plan, which would have established a homeland in Palestine for two peoples. Although the 1967 Six-Day War was triggered by all of Israel's neighbors, after the war, Europeans failed to stop the Israeli government's creeping occupation of Palestinian territory and bankrolled serious human rights violations by Israeli troops in the West Bank.

As the twentieth century drew to a close, the EU became content to play a purportedly neutral role, letting the United States take the lead in the Oslo process, offering ultimately inadequate support to the Palestinian Authority, and providing a destination for Israeli tourists and exports. It has perpetuated the problem by turning a blind eye to the utter violation of Palestinians' rights by settlers and soldiers and ignoring Palestinians' legitimate aspirations. Europeans cannot stay the hapless fools in this tragic story, dishing out cash with their eyes closed.

But Europeans cannot simply revert to a moralistic tendency to tell others what to do. They must assert that it is in their own interest, too, not only to help create a stable future for Israelis and Palestinians but also to strongly pressure both the Israeli government to do its part and the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence and adopt durable democratic reforms. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict stirs emotions and fuels polarization in European countries, given the shared historical baggage. And increasingly, it is undermining the foundations of the international order that Europeans cherish and rely on. If we do not accept our portion of responsibility for it, the conflict will impose itself on us. No other conflict overseas is so closely linked to European history. The EU as a whole—not just individual member states—needs to be become much bolder in addressing it.

For too long, Europeans have counted on U.S. leadership to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This expectation is especially irresponsible now. Many in Europe feel that U.S. President Donald Trump is neither able nor inclined to act as an effective mediator. But no matter what role the United States seeks in the Middle East, Europeans have their own unique role to play, because they have learned firsthand that despite the distorted image of the “other” that politicians may seek to project, most people desire to live in peace with their neighbors. Specific circumstances, however, can allow extremists to gain the upper hand.

Since October 7, the EU has deployed its traditional tools in the region—from economic instruments to normative discourse—but cautiously and inconsistently. It has significantly increased its aid to Gaza—pledging around $125 million in 2024, including through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and the Red Crescent—but without adequately ensuring that this aid reaches its targets. It has called repeatedly for a cease-fire and for respect for international law. One of us, Borrell, has issued numerous statements condemning both Hamas's murderous attacks and Israel's entirely disproportionate responses.



But internal divisions among member states undermined the EU's efficacy. Some EU leaders cautiously backed the International Criminal Court's investigations, while others, such as Austria and Germany, have declined to implement its arrest warrants against Israeli officials. And because EU member states, beginning with Germany and Hungary, could not agree on whether to revisit the union's trade policy with Israel, the EU continues to be Israel's largest trading partner. As a result, the EU, as a bloc, has been largely relegated to the sidelines, divided internally and overshadowed in cease-fire diplomacy by the United States and regional actors such as Egypt and Qatar. Shouldn't the EU also have acted as a mediator?

The EU's decades-long experience in fostering peaceful compromise between former enemies—grounded in a philosophy of mutual recognition and nondomination—gives the union special relevance. And it has the practical instruments to play a far more central role in Middle East peacemaking.

To get a full grasp of that leverage, the European External Action Service—the EU's diplomatic agency—will need to give teeth to the many resolutions that the EU Council and European Parliament have put forth over the years, as well as the guidelines set out for a comprehensive Middle East strategy by the 2024–2029 EU Commission. To make good on these appeals, the EU will need to use the full panoply of legal, financial, trade, political, and regulatory tools at its disposal to affect existing levers and pressure points.

Europe has immense leverage, but so far, it hasn't allowed itself to use it effectively. To some extent, this is historically justified, given the continent's long record of power abuse. But when it comes to protecting their core values and vital interests against external threats, Europeans should not hesitate to put their leverage to good use.

On the diplomatic front, EU states must start by extending the application of the principle that undergirds the EU itself: reciprocal recognition, which sits at the core of the state-based order created in Europe in the eighteenth century and has transformed the continent into a peace project over the past 80 years. The European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU, first called for Palestinians' right to self-determination in 1980. Although 14 out of 27 EU member states now recognize the state of Palestine, the EU would be much more effective if all of its member states—including the largest, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland—recognized Palestine within the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed-on land swaps. Far from rewarding Hamas, such a step would empower moderates on all sides who champion diplomatic solutions instead of extremists who preach violence. Rather than waiting for negotiations to make a path to statehood, the EU must affirm that statehood is the pathway to negotiation.

Alongside recognition, and to make the call for a cease-fire credible, the EU must step up its support for Palestinian statebuilding, including by pressuring the Palestinian Authority to become more effective, more accountable, and more democratic, given that the EU remains its top donor. Europe owes this to the Palestinian youth who have long been angered by the corruption of their own leadership. Europeans must then translate a shared commitment to a two-state solution into shared leadership with Arab states. The Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, created at the September 2024 UN General Assembly, can be better used to develop incentives that support the peace camp and encourage other countries in the Middle East to finally recognize Israel alongside a Palestinian state.

Only if Palestinians are able to determine their own fate can postwar governance in Gaza succeed. The EU should help design and fund an International Transitional Authority for Gaza pending the devolution of authority to Gazans, on the model of prior UN initiatives in Cambodia and East Timor. Europe must take a stronger stance against actors who flout its taxpayers' norms and interests by destroying or confiscating EU-funded infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. But the European agenda must also aim to reverse Gazans' utter dependence on outside aid while enhancing reconstruction standards. The EU can and should be central to Gaza's reconstruction, given Europeans' experience with sustainable and environmentally friendly construction techniques. It must help unite the rest of the world against any attempt to uproot Palestinians from their land, whether by resettlement, annexation, transfer, or mass expulsion.

Europe must also invest much more, and more effectively, in supporting civil society groups that are fighting for peace in the spirit of mutual respect, empathy, and recognition. The EU, and not only individual member states, must spotlight and broadcast in Israel as well as in the Arab world the remarkable peace efforts made by Israeli and Palestinian civil society activists—including, for instance, the Alliance for Middle East Peace, Women Wage Peace, Women of the Sun, Parents Circle-Families Forum, Breaking the Silence, B'Tselem, and the 2024 process that led to the Barcelona declaration on “our shared humanity.” And Europe must strongly oppose the Israeli proposal to tax foreign aid to peace organizations by 80 percent while countering pressure on civil society organizations that opposed the Palestinian leadership.

More concretely, and when the time is ripe, the EU could support the convening of a citizens' “peace assembly” made up of randomly selected Israelis and Palestinians who would gather on neutral ground over several months to help design a path to peace. Europeans have started to convene such assemblies in the last decade, to good effect. It is time to give citizens in the Middle East a far bigger say in their own future.

One of the most important lessons that centuries of wars taught Europe is that international relations is not a zero-sum game. But for too long, Europe has failed to apply this lesson in confronting spoilers in the Middle East determined to sidetrack a peace process. The EU rightly listed Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups as terrorist entities more than 20 years ago. But it has done little to sanction Israeli settlers who perpetuate violent acts against Palestinians.

Moreover, the EU has yet to act in the face of Israel's war crimes in Gaza. Such unbalanced pressure ends up strengthening spoilers on both sides of a conflict. The hard-liners who escape penalties feel vindicated and emboldened, and those who are targeted use the pressure to garner sympathy with their constituencies.

Consistency is paramount in a policy world replete with accusations of double standards. The EU cannot impose an import ban on products from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and shy away from imposing them on products from illegal settlements in the West Bank. Nor can the EU call on other states to honor the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and announce that it will not enforce the same body's warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.



The EU can rectify this: it could, for instance, revoke visa waivers for residents of settlements and implement Schengen-wide individual entry bans. In fact, by imposing visa requirements only on West Bank Palestinians and not on settlers who live there, the EU becomes complicit in an apartheid-style regime. Crucially, the EU-Israel Association Agreement—the central legal framework that has governed relations between the EU and Israel since 2000—could be reexamined. Its Article 2 provides a legal basis to reconsider the agreement's terms in response to human rights violations. A recent investigation by the EU's own human rights envoy clearly established these violations. Seventeen member states have now joined Ireland and Spain in calling for a reassessment of the agreement.

First, and at a minimum, the EU could take preliminary steps such as initiating a formal review of the agreement, suspending summits and high-level political contacts between European and Israeli leaders, or suspending Israel's participation in some EU programs such as Erasmus+, which supports education. Even more important, the EU can send a strong message to Israel's government and citizens by suspending the agreement's trade provisions, which in practice would mean pausing Israel's preferential tariffs. In line with an International Court of Justice 2024 advisory opinion warning states “to abstain from entering into economic or trade dealings with Israel” that “entrench its unlawful presence” in occupied Palestinian territories, the EU should also ban imports from illegal settlements altogether—imports that already fall outside the Association Agreement.

Although unanimous support from EU member states is required to suspend the entire agreement, most experts in the European Commission's Legal Service assert that only a qualified majority vote—in which policies can be adopted by 55 percent of states representing at least 65 percent of the EU's total population—is needed to suspend its trade provisions. Given that the EU has only ever suspended preferential trade provisions with Myanmar and Cambodia, such a move would be of high symbolic significance. Nothing should stop the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, from supporting such a move at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council in July.

The EU must also uphold its values by supporting the free flow of factual information. Hamas has denied the media its independence by harassing, detaining, and censoring journalists who report critically on its actions or governance. In Gaza, Netanyahu's government has imposed the longest media blackout in the history of modern journalism. More journalists have been killed in the strip than in any previous armed conflict. Israel refuses to cooperate with UN-mandated investigators, defying legally binding orders made by the International Court of Justice.

Hate speech, incitement, supremacist discourse, disinformation, and narrative manipulation online are fueling anti-Semitism as well as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hatred. The EU already has strong regulatory powers over social media companies, and it can do more to dissolve digital echo chambers by obliging social media companies to disclose and adapt their algorithms.

One sometimes hears the argument that there can be “no moral equivalence between a democratic state and a terrorist group.” In principle, this makes perfect sense. When dealing with the rule of law, however, the nonequivalence argument falls apart. There is a reason why justice is blindfolded, why both sides of her scale are level, and why courts must be independent from politics. Judges must examine the act, not the actor.

The EU must make it much clearer that it will not tolerate efforts to intimidate international courts. Recent threats and sanctions against ICC officials by Israel and the United States constitute a direct challenge to the multilateral legal order the EU claims to champion.

Although the EU's 1996 Blocking Statute is still in force, the way it is applied has become outdated. Originally designed to shield EU companies from the extraterritorial reach of U.S. sanctions—such as those targeting Cuba or Iran—it has not yet been adapted to protect institutions such as the ICC or its EU-based personnel from similar coercive measures. A revised Blocking Statute should explicitly include such provisions and ensure that the union's legal and diplomatic infrastructure resists extraterritorial pressure. And the EU should consider targeted sanctions—such as travel bans and asset freezes—against individuals and entities, whether governmental or nongovernmental, that seek to obstruct or delegitimize international justice mechanisms. This move would demonstrate that the EU is willing to match, with concrete deterrent measures, its rhetorical support for the rules-based order.

Before anything else, however, Europeans need to have a frank discussion about the elephant in the room: their disunity when it comes to condemning Israel or recognizing a Palestinian state. This disunity has prevented the EU from using its immense leverage to good effect. The Gaza war has underscored the EU's alarming inability to make timely decisions, even when a large majority of member states agree. For instance, despite the fact that a majority of EU states supported a call for a cease-fire in October–November 2023, the EU could not act decisively.

Europe cannot stand for the values it believes in without improving its decision-making processes. Some reforms do not require a change to the EU's treaty. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy currently requires unanimous votes for decisions on military or defense matters, sanctions, and most foreign policy positions. But member states could enact a switch to qualified majority voting in some areas of foreign policy, although such a switch would need to be decided by unanimity.

Alternatively, to bypass the reluctance of some member states, a smaller group could establish a so-called CFSP+, or an addition to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The existing provisions on enhanced cooperation in Article 20 of the EU's Treaty allow for at least nine member states to come together to utilize certain foreign policy tools not related to defense. Because such an action has never been taken before, those states would have to explore what a CFSP+ would concretely allow them to do. But they may well be able to use the EU's trade, aid, and political leverage more decisively.

The Israeli-Palestinian crisis has shown how easily the EU can become paralyzed on divisive subjects. This is the moment to overcome the crippling effect of 27 veto powers—for the sake of European policy as well as for the Middle East. Such a change might, in turn, make it easier for the EU to help codesign a peace plan incorporating the views of all the relevant actors in the region. If a majority of member states can coalesce more effectively around a vision, the rest might follow. Europeans once trod the path from war to stable coexistence to mutual flourishing. We must allow ourselves to hope that our recent history can inspire our neighbors to trace their path to peace.

Live Updates


• Trump on Iran: President Donald Trump said he would “absolutely” consider bombing Iranian nuclear sites again if he thought it necessary. His comments come as his administration projects confidence in the success of last weekend's strikes in Iran, but has not provided new intelligence supporting Trump's claim that its nuclear program was “obliterated.”
    


• Congress split over intel brief: Lawmakers left a classified briefing on Iran today divided along party lines, with Republicans reinforcing their belief that the US strikes were effective, while some Democrats expressed skepticism.
    


• Effort to revive talks: ﻿Tehran has no plans to resume nuclear negotiations with the US, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Thursday. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN the Trump administration is engaged in secret diplomatic efforts to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table.
    


• Israel's military strategy: The defense minister has instructed Israel's military to prepare an “enforcement plan” aimed at maintaining air superiority over Iran.
    


            Following the all-House classified briefing on Iran, GOP Rep. Greg Murphy said the purpose of the US strikes was never to get rid of Iran's nuclear material, but to eliminate certain aspects of Tehran's nuclear program.
    


                    “The purpose of the mission was to eliminate certain particular aspects of their nuclear program. Those were eliminated. To get rid of the nuclear material was not part of the mission,” the North Carolina lawmaker said.
                





            He argued, “People who are playing second-hand quarterback, they didn't want us to send in troops. Do you want us to send in troops and really make sure? No, that's not the answer. So, I think as far as what the purpose of the mission, the goals, I think those are well satisfied.”
    


            Other GOP lawmakers weighed also weighed in. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, told CNN: “I think there was a lot of relief in the room.”
    


            “I'm very confident and the president made the right decision,” Burchett added.
    


            Texas Republican Michael McCaul, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN that “most of” the uranium is still at Iran's nuclear facilities.
    


            “There is enriched uranium in the facilities that moves around, but that was not the intent or the mission,” McCaul said.
    


            Asked whether he's concerned about where the uranium may be, McCaul said he thinks most of it remains at the facilities.
    


            “My understanding is most of it's still there, so we need a full accounting that's why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the IAEA can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that's there, I don't think it's going out of the country, I think it's at the facilities,” McCaul said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
    


CNN's Manu Raju and Nicky Robertson contributed reporting to this post. 



            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Friday's classified briefing for House members about the US strikes against Iran, saying she was “almost sorry” she attended and later adding she would not have authorized the mission.
    


                    “Let me just say, I'm almost sorry I went to this briefing, because almost everything that was there is in the public domain,” the California Democrat said, downplaying the substance of the briefing. “A little bit additional information.”
                





            Pelosi also expressed skepticism about the extent of the damage done to Iran's nuclear program, after President Donald Trump's claims that the Iran's nuclear sites had been “obliterated” by the strikes.
    


            “We do know, in the public domain, that the enriched uranium is still there. And that was never part of the goal. So … let's just say, very clearly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CNN following the same briefing, “So a lot of unanswered questions about how long this has actually set back the Iranian nuclear capability, and I still have a very strong view that ultimately we need verification and diplomacy to succeed.”
    


CNN's Annie Grayer contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump said Friday he would “absolutely” consider bombing Iranian nuclear sites again if he thought it necessary.
    


            “Sure, without question, absolutely – it has to be unbelievable,” Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room when asked specifically if he would consider bombing the country if future intelligence reports offered a concerning conclusion on Iranian enrichment of uranium.
    


            Trump said he does not believe that Iran can “go back into nuclear anytime soon,” following last weekend's US strikes on their nuclear sites.
    


            The administration has continued to project confidence in the success of the strikes but has not offered intelligence to support Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear program was, in his words, “obliterated.”
    


            The president also said Friday he was “not really” concerned about secret nuclear sites in Iran when asked about that possibility, suggesting that the country is more focused on survival for the time being.
    


                    “Can I tell you – they're exhausted. And Israel's exhausted too. And I dealt with both of them, and they both wanted it settled – both of them – and we did a great job. But they're exhausted. The last thing they're thinking about right now is nuclear. You know what they're thinking of? They're thinking about tomorrow, trying to live,” he said.
                





            Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz says he's instructed the military to prepare an “enforcement plan” against Iran following the 12-day conflict which saw Israel kill military targets and pound the country's nuclear sites.
    


            In a post on X Friday, Katz said the plan would include “maintaining Israel's air superiority, preventing nuclear and missile development, and responding to Iranian support for terrorist activity.”
    


            Katz described the Israeli operations against Iran as “12 days of brilliant action” that eliminated Iranian air defenses and destroyed its missile production.
    


            “We eliminated senior security officials and leading scientists advancing the nuclear program, he said.
    


            Katz ended his post: “A word of caution to the toothless serpent's head in Tehran: Operation “Rising Lion” was only the preview of a new Israeli policy — after October 7th, immunity is over.”
    


            The Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar has also stressed the importance of air superiority. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces released details of his briefing to air force commanders on the first day of the Israeli campaign.
    


            “If you ask me: ‘Commander, what is the decisive element of victory? Is it Natanz? Is it 80 surface-to-surface missile launchers?” It is aircraft over Tehran whenever we choose — that's a significant decisive component. Therefore, we need to get there, and we need to create the impact that will make them feel exposed — finished.
    


            “And if you ask me what will bring us to that point, it's only one thing: superiority, superiority, and once again — superiority,” Bar added.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that Iran must directly negotiate with the US, after leaving a classified all-member briefing on the recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
    


            “And one of the things that was discussed this morning is that we now need Iran to engage with us in direct good faith talks, negotiations, not through third parties, not through other countries. They need to sit down at the table with us and ensure that this peace is truly lasting,” Johnson said.
    


            The speaker also said that the information given in the briefing was a “first hand, authoritative and reliable account” and to ignore the information that was included in an early Pentagon intelligence assessment, which CNN first reported on earlier this week.
    


                    “I would say it's a substantial setback that was a firsthand, authoritative and reliable account that differs greatly from the low confidence preliminary assessment that was leaked, sadly and dangerously, probably from this body, and we're going to get down to the bottom of that. But you can dismiss the low-level initial assessment, and you can rely upon what the CIA has said, because these are firsthand accounts,” Johnson said.
                





            “It is clear, everyone can see by the videos that these, these massive ordinance penetrating bombs, do the job. And I think their key facilities have been disabled. And I think Iran is now a long time away from doing what they might have done before this very successful operation,” he continued.
    


            Johnson noted that there was support from his colleagues on both sides of the aisle during the briefing, leading to some applause.
    


            “I was heartened by the briefing that we just got here, and the reaction by all of our colleagues was bipartisan, and Republicans and Democrats there, there was a couple of moments of rousing applause and support for our outstanding, extraordinary military servicemen and women, the pride that we all have as Americans as the only nation on the face of the planet that is capable of this kind of decisive action,” the Louisiana Republican said.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he is looking at ways to limit the classified information lawmakers can receive after President Donald Trump said he wants to restrict the flow of intelligence going forward.
    


            “We're looking into that. It's a real problem,” Johnson told CNN.
    


            Johnson did not rule out eliminating classified briefings for the entire House going forward.
    


                    “It probably effects what we are able to be told because there are real risks to that. So, it's unfortunate. It effects how the institution works and that's a problem so we got to address it,” he said.
                





            Johnson added: “Clearly there was a leak, and you can't have that. When you're dealing with national security matters it's a serious problem that you got to address.”
    


Some context: According to an early US defense intelligence assessment that was described by seven people briefed on it, the US military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities last weekend did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only set it back by months, as CNN and others reported.
    


            CIA Director John Ratcliffe said a day later, however, that “a body of credible intelligence” indicated Iran's nuclear program was “severely damaged” by the US strikes and that “several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.”
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says that had Iran not responded to Israeli strikes this month, the situation could have escalated into a “full-scale and uncontrollable war in the region.”
    


            Pezeshkian was speaking in a video message to a conference in Belarus.
    


                    “The attacks carried out by the United States and the Zionist regime constitute a grave violation of all international norms and an irreparable blow to the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,” he said.
                





            Iranian officials have questioned the country's membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and parliament has voted to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
    


            “The Israeli assault occurred in the midst of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington over Iran's nuclear program — a deliberate attempt to sabotage the diplomatic process,” Pezeshkian said.
    


            He said that Israel had “killed outside of the norms of war. They targeted university students and civilians. Many civilians were killed during this war. They hit residential buildings, hospitals, and places of work.”
    


            The Iranian health ministry has said that 627 people were killed in Iran by Israeli military action.
    


            Like other Iranian officials, Pezeshkian has cast the conflict as a victory for Iran.
    


            The World Health Organization said it was able to deliver nine truckloads of essential medical supplies into Gaza on Wednesday, the first such shipment since the beginning of March. The aid included 2,000 units of blood and 1,500 units of plasma.
    


            As agencies struggle to distribute the limited aid that is allowed into Gaza, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday that the enclave's entire population was projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity, with nearly 500,000 facing what it called “catastrophic levels of food insecurity.”
    


            OCHA said Thursday that “to meet humanitarian needs and help reduce looting, it is essential to get more humanitarian and essential commercial goods into Gaza, and to facilitate their safe distribution across the Strip.”
    


            OCHA added that six out of 17 attempts to coordinate humanitarian movements inside Gaza were outright rejected by the Israeli authorities.
    


More on Gaza aid: The privately-run and controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said that it had been the only humanitarian organization permitted to distribute food aid in the territory on Thursday. “Our hope is this will be a temporary pause and all other aid organizations will soon be able to resume distribution in the region,” its interim Executive Director John Acree said.
    


            An Israeli official confirmed to CNN that only GHF had distributed aid on Thursday.
    


            The Israeli agency that handles the transfer of aid into Gaza – COGAT – said Wednesday that 150 humanitarian aid trucks carrying food, baby food and formula, as well as medical supplies and medications, had been transferred to northern and southern Gaza.
    


            On the same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz claimed that Hamas was “once again seizing control of humanitarian aid entering the northern Gaza Strip” and ordered the Israeli military to present an action plan to prevent Hamas from taking aid within 48 hours.
    


            The Palestinian health ministry said that two more children have died of malnutrition in Gaza.
    


            The ministry said it bring the number of children who have died of malnutrition to 66 since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            Dr. Muneer Alboursh, director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, told CNN that one child died in Gaza City “as a result of malnutrition caused by a lack of milk and starvation.” A 3-month old baby girl also died in Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.
    


Looting after blockade: The deaths were reported amid a sharp decline in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching many parts of the territory. An Israeli blockade on aid began in early March and was only partially relaxed last month, and there has been a growing incidence of looting of aid supplies.
    


            Dozens of trucks entering Gaza with humanitarian aid have been looted in the last two days, according to the Private Transport Association in the enclave.
    


Looting sparks clashes: The looting also led to fighting between a clan based in Khan Younis in southern Gaza and a police branch affiliated with Hamas, according to journalists and witnesses.
    


            Nahed Shehaibar, head of the Private Transport Association, told CNN that 60 trucks carrying supplies on behalf of the World Food Programme crossed into Gaza on Thursday morning – but more than 50 had been stolen in Khan Younis. The trucks were carrying flour and aid packages, according to Sheihaibar.
    


            This followed a similar pattern to that on Wednesday, when more than 70 aid trucks were stolen in the same area, according to Shehaibar.
    


            The looting led to gunbattles between a group accused of being involved in the theft and Hamas' Arrow unit, according to journalists in Khan Younis, fighting that damaged the nearby Nasser Medical complex.
    


            The all-House classified briefing on the situation in Iran is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET today, giving House members their turn following Thursday's closed-door session in the Senate.
    


            Following the highly anticipated classified Senate briefing, Democrats and Republicans disagreed on exactly how much the US strikes on Iran set back that country's nuclear program.
    


            Many Republicans said that they believe it will now take Iran years longer to build a nuclear weapon, though some acknowledged the threat is not completely neutralized. But Democrats said the picture is far less clear — with one senator saying the US strikes set Iran back only months.
    


            The Israeli military said it has bombarded a site in southern Lebanon used by Hezbollah to manage attacks on Israel, the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Iran-backed militant group.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that warplanes attacked a site “used by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to manage its fire and defense array in the area of the Beaufort Ridge in southern Lebanon.”
    


            Video from the area showed a series of large explosions, while Lebanon's National News Agency reported an “intense aerial attack.”
    


            The IDF said the site was “part of an underground project that had been put out of service as a result of IDF strikes in the area, but the IDF detected attempts to rebuild it,” calling them a violation of the truce that brought last year's conflict to an end.
    


            The Israeli military has continued to carry out attacks in south Lebanon since a ceasefire was agreed last November after more than a year of cross-border attacks by Hezbollah and strikes by Israeli forces against the group.
    


            Part of the agreement stipulated that only Lebanon's official security forces could be deployed in the area south of the Litani river, a Hezbollah stronghold that borders Israel.
    


See below the map showing the ceasefire lines from last year.



            Israel's military says it struck more than 900 targets inside Iran during its unprecedented “Operation Rising Lion.”
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claim the operation killed 11 Iranian nuclear scientists and 30 senior security officials, including three top commanders.
    


            CNN has previously reported on the death of Iran's highest-ranking military officer, the head of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its air force.
    


            The operation struck more than 900 targets overall, destroying 200 missile launchers – which the IDF claimed accounted for half of all of Iran's launchers. The strikes also destroyed aircraft and missile production sites, “thereby preventing the manufacture of thousands of additional missiles,” said the IDF statement.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify these figures.
    


            Earlier on Thursday, Israel's defense minister said in an interview with Channel 13 that there had not been an opportunity to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during Operation Rising Lion – but said Israel would have “taken him out” if one had arisen.
    


            Qom is considered Iran's holy city – home to its largest and most famous Shia seminary, where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei once studied.
    


            The surrounding Qom province is also where the Fordow nuclear site is located, deep in the mountains – one of the three nuclear facilities targeted by US strikes last weekend.
    


            When CNN's Senior International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen visited the city this week, several clerics condemned the strikes, and expressed defiance.
    


                    “They think they're able to stop us from our chosen path through bombing, killing and terror. That's why these terrors and wars will only strengthen our faith instead of weakening us,” one cleric told CNN.
                





            Another said: “If Trump ever has goodwill, do not mess with countries and let people live their lives.”
    


Some context: The status of the Fordow plant, like that of the other two sites, is still not clear. Iran has acknowledged that the US strikes caused “serious” damage. Democratic and Republican senators at the classified briefing gave differing accounts of exactly how much the strikes set back Iran's nuclear program. And the Trump administration has repeatedly insisted the program was “obliterated,” but has not shared new intelligence supporting this claim.
    


            The Iran-Israel ceasefire that ended 12 days of conflict appears to still be holding. The Pentagon held a widely anticipated briefing giving new details on the US strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, but did not provide new intelligence supporting President Donald Trump's assertion that the strikes “obliterated” Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Meanwhile, sources tell CNN the Trump administration is engaged in secret diplomatic efforts to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table – even as Iran's foreign minister said the country has no plans to resume nuclear talks with the US.
    


            And after the classified Senate briefing on Operation Midnight Hammer on Thursday, Democrats and Republicans came away with different narratives.
    


Here are the latest developments:



            The White House declined to say Thursday how it will limit the classified information it shares with Congress, or how it will respond to lawmakers who insist their oversight duties necessitate access to the information.
    


            The comments came shortly before the classified briefing on Iran by Trump administration officials for the Senate.
    


                    “This administration wants to ensure that classified intelligence is not ending up in irresponsible hands, and that people who have the privilege of viewing this top-secret classified information are being responsible with it,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a briefing.
                





            “And unfortunately, clearly, someone who had their hands on this — and it was a very few people, very few number of people in our government who saw this report… That person was irresponsible with it,” Leavitt added, referring to the early Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that found US strikes on Iran did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only set it back by months.
    


            “We need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public,” Leavitt said.
    


            The Trump administration is planning to limit what it shares with Congress, a senior White House official told CNN on Wednesday, believing that the report came out after it was posted on Monday to CAPNET, a system used for sharing classified intelligence with Congress.

Follow:


            Andrew Cuomo will not drop out of the New York City mayoral race by the Friday deadline to remove himself from the general election ballot, sources tell CNN. That leaves in place contingency plans he had established before the Democratic primary to challenge Zohran Mamdani and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in November.
    


            The former New York governor, who quickly conceded the Democratic primary race on Tuesday night to Mamdani, has not fully committed to running an active campaign through the summer and fall. But Cuomo will keep the place he already secured on the “Fight & Deliver” ballot line for the November election, three sources say.
    


            Cuomo is calculating that the full city's electorate would be significantly different from Democratic primary voters who were energized by Mamdani's focus on affordability and his campaign's online videos. His camp also believes Mamdani and his policy ideas, from a rent freeze to city-operated grocery stores, will receive increased scrutiny now that Mamdani is positioned to secure a Democratic primary win once ranked-choice votes are allocated next week.
    


            “Ultimately Andrew's decision and my decision matters less than the decision that voters already took on Tuesday night,” Mamdani told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday.
    


            Asked about possibly running against Cuomo in November, he said on “OutFront”: “We did it once and it turned out pretty well.”
    


            Notably, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have praised Mamdani since Tuesday but declined to endorse him. And two House Democrats from swing districts in the New York suburbs criticized him after Tuesday's results put him in position to win the primary, while Republicans have sharply criticized Mamdani and tried to tie national Democrats to him.
    


            Mamdani is poised to face Adams, who opted out of this year's Democratic primary and is running as an independent himself, as well as Republican Curtis Sliwa.
    


            Cuomo staying on the November ballot leaves the door open for the former governor to resume his bid for a political comeback, four years after he resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment that he has denied. Cuomo was long considered the front-runner in the mayoral race but faced progressive anger over the sexual harassment cases as well as his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic while governor, driving much of the liberal enthusiasm for Mamdani.
    


            Cuomo's bet would be that he could become a safe harbor for moderates and progressives concerned about Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, or Adams, who was indicted on federal bribery charges before President Donald Trump's administration moved to drop them.
    


            He could also keep his ballot line without campaigning, as he did in 2002 when he dropped a Democratic primary bid for governor but remained on the ballot as the Liberal Party candidate.
    


            For now, however, Cuomo has not set a timetable for making a final decision on whether to actively campaign or when to re-launch a prospective campaign.
    


            “There's no clock ticking,” one source said.

Follow:


            Kim Jong Un personally cut the ribbon on a new resort hailed by state media as a “national treasure-level tourism city” — a lavish seaside development set against what human rights observers describe as stark realities of hunger and hardship across North Korea.
    


            According to the country's official KCNA news service, Kim opened the sprawling Kalma beachside resort with waterparks, high-rise hotels, and accommodation for nearly 20,000 guests — a sweeping display of extravagance in one of the world's most reclusive nations.
    


            The Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, unveiled in a ceremony on June 24, is on North Korea's eastern coast. KCNA reported “service for domestic guests will begin July 1,” but gave no details on eligibility or transportation.
    


            Earlier this month, North Korea announced the opening of Kalma train station, reporting it was built to “ensure a high level of convenience for travelers to the coastal tourist area.” The Kalma beach resort is next to an international airport, another indication the project is aimed at attracting foreign currency.
    


            International attendance at the ribbon-cutting was limited to the Russian ambassador and staff, a nod to Pyongyang's growing alignment with Moscow amid deepening isolation from the West under Kim's authoritarian regime.
    


            In 2024 UN human rights chief Volker Turk described North Korea under Kim's rule as “a stifling, claustrophobic environment, where life is a daily struggle devoid of hope.”
    


            Last year, small groups of Russian tourists visited North Korea for three-day ski holidays at Maskiryong resort, which has been a long-standing tourist attraction since its opening in December 2013. These, like all tourist experiences in North Korea, were heavily monitored and controlled by the government.
    


            Returning tourists told CNN that they were subject to strict rules about what they could and could not photograph and were required to watch a choreographed dance performance by North Korean children in addition to the outdoor activities.
    


            “Wonsan-Kalma is open to just North Koreans for now, but we should not be surprised to see Russians at the resort in the not-too-distant future,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a non-resident fellow with the 38 North program at the Stimson Center.
    


            “More broadly, the opening of a major beach resort like Wonsan-Kalma helps to reinforce the state media narrative of Kim's people-first policy and helps to balance out his greater focus on building up national defense,” Lee added.
    


            In a country where international tourism has been open mostly to Russian nationals since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and where domestic travel is heavily restricted, the new development raises familiar questions about access, audience, and economic feasibility.
    


            “The initial target for this resort is going to be the privileged domestic elite of Pyongyang, such as party officials and other high-ranking figures,” said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean Studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.
    


            “The ceremony of the Wonsan-Kalma resort reflects Kim Jong Un's vision of ‘socialist civilization' and is part of his strategic effort to seek economic breakthroughs through the tourism industry.”
    


            North Korea's most notable experiment with international tourism came in the late 1990s, when it opened the scenic Mount Kumgang area on its southeastern coast to visitors from South Korea.
    


            The project was hailed as a rare symbol of inter-Korean engagement during a period of cautious rapprochement.
    


            Nearly two million South Koreans traveled to the site over the next decade, providing Pyongyang with a critical stream of hard currency.
    


            But the initiative came to an abrupt halt in 2008, after a North Korean soldier fatally shot a South Korean tourist who had reportedly wandered into a restricted military zone – an incident that underscored the fragility of cross-border cooperation and led Seoul to suspend the tours indefinitely.
    


            Many of the sites were demolished in 2022, including the Onjonggak Rest House hotel which had hosted cross-border family reunions. Kim had previously called the area “shabby” and “backward” during a visit.

            Indeed, a central question surrounding the new resort is if one of the world's most secretive and repressive countries is prepared to make a greater foray into international tourism, potentially adding to its foreign cash reserves and prestige.
    


            So far, Russians appear to be the only foreign tour groups granted access to the beach resort. Vostok Intur, a Vladivostok-based travel agency, is promoting three tour packages - one in July and two in August - priced at around $1,840.
    


            According to its website, the first tour is scheduled to begin on July 7 and will last eight days. Travelers will fly from Pyongyang to Wonsan, spend four nights at the resort, and visit the nearby Masikryong Ski Resort.
    


            Kim said an expansion of North Korea's tourism zones would be formalized during the ruling party's next congress, likely in the next few months. The lessons learned at Kalma would also be used to develop “promising large-scale tourist and cultural zones” in other parts of the country, Kim noted.
    


            The personal investment of North Korea's leader was underscored by at least seven visits to the Kalma construction site, where Kim offered what state media called “on-the-spot guidance” and pushed for “world-class” standards.
    


            For Kim's regime, the resort's completion is perceived at home as a significant win and opportunity to showcase development amid stiff international sanctions. In another dimension of symbolism, the nation's leader was joined by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, who is widely seen as his likely successor.
    


            “The apparent full attendance of Kim Jong Un's family at the event implies that the project is intended to carry forward the legacy of his predecessors and be sustained for future generations,” explained Lim of Kyungnam University.
    


            Plans for the resort were first announced in 2013 as part of Kim's broader vision to transform Wonsan, a historically significant port city, into a hub of economic and leisure activity.
    


            The project was delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic and international sanctions targeting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
    


            Despite the projections of glamour across the new resort and images of an enigmatic leader touring wave pools and waterslides, experts expressed skepticism about the destination's prospects.
    


            “Whether this resort will provide Kim Jong Un with his much-needed economic gain in the long-term, however, remains to be seen: Wonsan-Kalma is hardly a tourist hotspot in the first place,” said Dr. Edward Howell, a North Korea expert at the University of Oxford.
    


            “Of note, since 2020, Kim Jong Un has adopted an increasingly severe approach towards social control; quashing any signs of the virus of outside information and ideologies entering the DPRK,” Howell emphasized.
    


            “If any Western tourists do come to the resort, the ruling regime will no doubt want to ensure that their actions and movements remain regulated and controlled.”

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez shared a kiss in a water taxi en route to a Venice reception on Thursday evening, ahead of their weekend wedding.

VENICE, Italy (AP) — The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fiancée Lauren Sánchez, who have traveled into space — and expectations are just about as high for their wedding in Venice.

One of the world's most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.

Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.

Local flavor? You bet.

Beyond that, the team of the world's fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the Italian lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.




Dozens of private jets touched down at Venice's airport, and yachts pulled into the city's famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple's love as to their extraordinary wealth. 

The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.

Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for small, colorful protests. But any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.

Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of Embark Beyond, a luxury travel advisory and destination event service.

“It's a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,” said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. “There's very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.”

It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.

Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/Sánchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).

It's an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola's annual report.

Bezos' team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia's richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag. 

“How do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?” Ezon said. ”You could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that's only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,” or expand the celebration to local landmarks.

There's no sign Sánchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice's tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false. 

On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, Sánchez and guests to the Madonna dell'Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera — Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom — as police on jet skis patrolled.

On Friday afternoon, Sánchez emerged from her hotel wearing a silk scarf on her head and blew a kiss to journalists before stepping into her water taxi. It carried her through the canals to San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark's Square, where the couple is expected to hold a ceremony this evening. Bezos followed two hours later in a tuxedo. Associated Press journalists circling the island earlier saw private security personnel stationed at every landing point, including its newly installed dock.

Local media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.

There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city. 

They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents' needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.

“Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,” Stella Faye, a researcher at a university from Venice, said on Friday. 

About a dozen Venetian organizations — including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups — are protesting under the banner “No Space for Bezos,” a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride's recent space flight.

Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark's Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down Venice's Grand Canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.

Authorities — from Venice's mayor to the nation's tourism minister — have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.

“There will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride's dress, over the ceremony,” Italy's tourism minister, Daniela Santanchè, told the AP. 

“All of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice — our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it's a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.”



As Amazon's CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $234 billion, according to Forbes.

In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with Sánchez, a former TV news anchor. Sánchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos' divorce was finalized.

He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.

Sitting beside Sánchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.

Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos' Earth Fund was supporting its work with an “important donation.” CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the United States to potentially offer refuge to people from other countries who otherwise would seek asylum in the United States, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday at the conclusion of her Central America trip.

The agreements expand the Trump administration's efforts to provide the U.S. government flexibility in returning migrants not only to their own countries, but also to third countries as it attempts to ramp up deportations.

Noem described it as a way to offer asylum-seekers options other than coming to the United States. She said the agreements had been in the works for months. with the U.S. government applying pressure on Honduras and Guatemala to get them done.

“Honduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,” Noem said. “We've never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn't necessarily have to be the United States.”

Both governments denied having signed safe third-country agreements when asked following Noem's comments. 

Guatemala's presidential communications office said the government did not sign a safe third-country agreement nor any immigration related agreement during Noem's visit.




They reaffirmed that Guatemala would receive Central Americans sent by the United States as a temporary stop on the return to their countries.

Noem had said Thursday that “politically, this is a difficult agreement for their governments to do.”

Both countries have limited resources and many needs making support for asylum-seekers from other countries a tougher sell domestically. There are also the optics of two left-of-center governments appearing to help the Trump administration limit access to U.S. asylum.

Noem said that during her Guatemala meeting, she was given the already signed agreement. While later there was a public signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding that establishes a Joint Security Program that will put U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the Guatemalan capital's international airport to help train local agents to screen for terrorist suspects.

Honduras' immigration director Wilson Paz denied such an agreement was signed and its Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

During U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, the U.S. signed such accords called safe third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They effectively allowed the U.S. to declare some asylum seekers ineligible to apply for U.S. protection and permitted the U.S. government to send them to those countries deemed “safe.”

The U.S. has had such an agreement with Canada since 2002.

The practical challenge was that all three Central American countries at the time were seeing large numbers of their own citizens head to the U.S. to escape violence and a lack of economic opportunity. They also had extremely under-resourced asylum systems.

In February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed deals with El Salvador and Guatemala that allowed the U.S. to send migrants from other nations there. But in Guatemala's case it was to only be a point of transit for migrants who would then return to their homelands, not to apply for asylum there. And in El Salvador, it was broader, allowing the U.S. to send migrants to be imprisoned there.

Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would not sign a safe third-country agreement, but at the same time Mexico has accepted more than 5,000 migrants from other countries deported from the U.S. since Trump took office. She said Mexico accepted them for humanitarian reasons and helped them return to their home countries.

The U.S. also has agreements with Panama and Costa Rica to take migrants from other countries though so far the numbers sent have been relatively small. The Trump administration sent 299 to Panama in February and fewer than 200 to Costa Rica.

The agreements give U.S. authorities options, especially for migrants from countries where it is not easy for the U.S. to return them directly.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — An Idaho judge says he won't postpone the quadruple murder trial of a man accused in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. 

Fourth District Judge Steven Hippler made the ruling Thursday, telling Bryan Kohberger's attorneys that jury selection will begin in August and opening arguments will likely be held around Aug. 18. 

Hippler also rejected the defense team's request to present theories of four “alternate perpetrators” to the jury, writing that evidence presented by the defense is “entirely irrelevant.” 

“Nothing links these individuals to the homicides or otherwise gives rise to a reasonable inference that they committed the crime; indeed, it would take nothing short of rank speculation by the jury to make such a finding,” Hippler wrote in the order. 

Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at Washington State University, is charged with four counts of murder. Prosecutors say he sneaked into a rental home in nearby Moscow, Idaho, not far from the University of Idaho campus, and fatally stabbed Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves on Nov. 13, 2022.

Kohberger stood silent at his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Defense attorney Anne Taylor had asked the judge to delay the proceedings. She said beginning the trial this summer would violate Kohberger's right to a fair trial in part because his defense team was still reviewing evidence and struggling to get potential witnesses to agree to be interviewed. She also said extensive publicity could taint the proceedings and that a cooling off period would help ensure an impartial jury. 




But Hippler noted that interest in the case has only grown and that previous delays have only given the media more time to “provide coverage to a public audience which is clamoring for answers.”

“The longer the public is made to sit and wait for the facts to come out at trial, the more time there is for inflammatory, speculative stories, movies and books to circulate and more time for prior ones to be rebroadcast, purchased, viewed and consumed by the public,” he wrote. 

Hippler also denied the defense's request to present evidence of four “alternate perpetrators” to jurors, after finding that evidence was flimsy at best and would lead to “wild speculation,” needlessly dragging out a trial that is already expected to last three months. 

The names of the four were redacted from the ruling, but Hippler briefly described them: Three of the people were socially connected to at least one of the victims, and interacted with them socially in the hours before the killings, lived within walking distance of the home and had been to the home before. The fourth person had only a “passing connection” to one victim after noticing her at a store several weeks before the deaths, Hippler said. 

All four cooperated with investigators, and their DNA didn't match samples taken at the crime scene, Hippler said, and there is no admissible or significant evidence that any one of them had a motive, was present at the crime scene or was otherwise connected to the crime. 

“There is not a scintilla of competent evidence connecting them to the crime,” Hippler said.

Jury selection will begin Aug. 4, Hippler said, with the trial starting about two weeks later.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Pat Williams, a New Deal-style Democrat who won Montana's great liberal-conservative showdown of 1992 to become the state's lone voice in the U.S. House of Representatives, died Wednesday. He was 87.

Williams died in Missoula of natural causes, family spokesperson Matt McKenna said Thursday.

John Patrick Williams represented the western half Montana from 1979 to 1997. When the 1990 census eliminated one of two House seats the state held since 1912, Williams captured the new statewide district in a bruising race against the longtime eastern-district representative, Republican Ron Marlenee.

The 51% majority was the slimmest of Williams' congressional career — and the first election defeat in Marlenee's 16-year career.

The matchup was billed as a classic liberal-conservative confrontation and a microcosm of political battles being waged throughout the West over control of the land and its resources.

It was a bitter, hard-fought contest — each man spent more than $1 million — and Williams said quickly after his victory that he would work to bring the state together.

Williams first tried for the congressional seat in 1974, but he lost to fellow Democrat Max Baucus. Williams was elected to the post in 1978 when Baucus moved to the U.S. Senate. By the time of the face-off with Marlenee, Williams was a deputy whip in the House.

He was an unabashed liberal, a staunch advocate for organized labor and a believer in the potential of government to help people.




That won him the enmity of conservative groups such as Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition.

Williams defended the National Endowment for the Arts against pornography charges and opposed proposed constitutional amendments to outlaw abortion and flag desecration and to require a balanced budget. He opposed U.S. military intervention in the 1991 Gulf War and wanted post-Cold War defense savings to be used for public works projects.

Williams tried to take a middle road in one of Montana's most divisive issues, wilderness, and environmental groups generally gave him strong support. He said the argument of jobs versus the environment presented a false choice because the state could not have one without the other.

“A clean environment ... has been and will be an absolute cash register for this state,” he said in 1992.

His family said in a statement that Williams spent his life protecting wild lands and defending the working poor, arts, Native people and children with disabilities.

“He believed government could be a force for good, and that culture, wilderness, and education were not luxuries — but rights,” the statement said. 

After he left the House in 1997, Williams started teaching at the University of Montana, including courses in environmental studies, history and political science.

Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte recalled Williams as a “dedicated public servant.”

“As Montana's longest-serving congressman, Pat championed Montana's interests, working to find common ground for nearly 20 years in Washington,” Gianforte said.

Williams' wife, Carol, was the first woman to become minority leader in the state Senate. They have a son Griff, and two daughters, Erin and Whitney.

Williams' cousin was daredevil Evel Knievel.

Williams received a bachelor's degree from the University of Denver and a teaching degree from Western Montana College.

Born Oct. 30, 1937, in Helena, Williams grew up in the mining city of Butte, and its traditionally Democratic unionized workforce was a major element of his power base. He taught in the Butte public schools for seven years, and the combination earned him a spot on the House Education and Labor Committee.

Williams served in the Montana House in the 1967 and 1969 sessions. In 1968 he headed the Montana presidential campaign for Hubert Humphrey. He did the same in 1976 for Jimmy Carter.

Williams got a firsthand look at Washington, D.C., from 1969 to 1971 when he worked as executive assistant to Montana Democratic U.S. Rep. John Melcher.

Fox News' Shannon Bream breaks down the latest details on the ruling. Fox News contributors Jonathan Turley and Andy McCarthy also weigh in on the highly-anticipated decision during 'America's Newsroom.'

The Supreme Court on Friday delivered a major victory in President Donald Trump's quest to block lower courts from issuing universal injunctions that had upended many of his administration's executive orders and actions.

Justices ruled 6-3 to allow the lower courts to issue injunctions only in limited instances, though the ruling leaves open the question of how the ruling will apply to the birthright citizenship order at the heart of the case.

The Supreme Court agreed this year to take up a trio of consolidated cases involving so-called universal injunctions handed down by federal district judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Judges in those districts had blocked Trump's ban on birthright citizenship from taking force nationwide – which the Trump administration argued in their appeal to the Supreme Court was overly broad.

The Supreme Court's arguments in May focused little on the merits of those universal injunctions – and on Friday, the court made clear that it is not ruling on whether the birthright citizenship orders are constitutional.

100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT

Instead, it instructed the lower courts to ""move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity."" 

They also stayed any enforcement of the orders from taking effect for 30 days. 

""The applications do not raise – and thus we do not address – the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,"" Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, writing for the majority. ""The issue before us is one of remedy: whether, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, federal courts have equitable authority to issue universal injunctions.""

""A universal injunction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable authority, yet Congress has granted federal courts no such power,"" she added.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elana Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the case.

Sotomayor, in a scathing dissent, characterized the decision as ""nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution.""

""The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals' constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully. Until the day that every affected person manages to become party to a lawsuit and secures for himself injunctive relief, the Government may act lawlessly indefinitely. Not even a decision from this Court would necessarily,"" she said.

In a separate dissent, Jackson wrote that the decision from the majority ""will disproportionately impact the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular – i.e., those who may not have the wherewithal to lawyer up, and will all too often find themselves beholden to the Executive's whims.""

The Supreme Court agreed in April to hear the consolidated cases, which focused on three lower court judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state who issued ""universal"" injunctions against Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. 

But that wasn't the main focus of the appeal, or the May 15 oral arguments before the high court.

Rather, the justices weighed whether lower courts should have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions at all, or whether doing so exceeds their authority, as argued by Trump officials.

The ruling is expected to have sweeping implications for U.S. district courts, and comes at a time when presidents, including both Democrat and Republican administrations, have sought to use executive orders as a means of sidestepping a clunky, slow-moving Congress.

Trump praised the statement on social media Friday, which he described as a ""GIANT WIN"" in the Supreme Court. He also said he plans to hold a press conference on the decision at 11:30 a.m.  

""Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves (same year!), not the SCAMMING of our Immigration process,"" he said on Truth Social. ""Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Solicitor General John Sauer, and the entire DOJ."" 

Federal judges across the country have blocked Trump's ban on transgender persons serving in the U.S. military, ordered the reinstatement of core functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and halted Elon Musk's government efficiency organization, DOGE, from oversight and access to government agencies, among other things. 

Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared to agree during oral arguments this month that the use of universal injunctions has surged in recent years – but after more than two hours, remained split on how to proceed. 

No easy solution emerged to the thorny legal problem, as the justices wrestled with a tangle of procedural questions over whether to scale back the use of universal injunctions and what legal standard should govern them.

Sauer argued that lower court judges have used universal injunctions to act beyond their authority and block the lawful powers of a sitting president.

But Sotomayor noted that blocking or limiting lower court injunctions could invite hundreds or thousands of new individual lawsuits. 

""Your theory here is arguing that Article III and principles of equity [clause] both prohibit federal courts from issuing universal injunctions to have your argument,"" she said later, adding: ""If that's true, that means even the Supreme Court doesn't have that power.""

Kagan, meanwhile, pointed out the practical challenge of expecting the Supreme Court to weigh in on every issue now handled by lower courts, which have already faced hundreds of federal lawsuits during Trump's second term.

She also noted to Sauer that the Trump administration has lost every federal lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship executive order, including under judges Trump appointed during his first term. 

As expected, several conservative justices on the court, including Justice Clarence Thomas, expressed criticism of universal injunctions.

New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing the states, acknowledged that there could be alternative remedies for federal courts other than nationwide injunctions – though he suggested that in certain cases, the class action alternative presented by the Trump administration may not move fast enough to grant relief in certain cases.

""We are sympathetic to some of the concerns the United States has about percolation, about running the table in particular cases,"" he said. ""We just don't think that that supports a bright line rule that says they're never available.""

Roberts and Sotomayor questioned Feigenbaum more in depth on how to determine in what cases universal injunctions should not be the preferred remedy and how to ensure district courts are following that.

Lawyers for the Trump administration asked the high court to review the case earlier this year, arguing that the three lower courts, each of which blocked Trump's birthright citizenship order from taking force nationwide, acted beyond the scope of their authority. 

Solicitor General Sauer stressed this point during oral arguments earlier this month, telling justices that universal injunctions ""require judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions.""

""They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere,"" he said, and ""invert,"" in the Trump administration's view, the ordinary hierarchy of appellate review. 

The Supreme Court decision will have sweeping implications, both in the near and longer term, with knock-down effects on the more than 300 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025.

Bondi praised the high court's ruling on social media Friday. 

""Today, the Supreme Court instructed district courts to STOP the endless barrage of nationwide injunctions against President Trump,"" she said, adding that the ruling ""would not have been possible without tireless work from our excellent lawyers"" at the Justice Department and Sauer.

""This Department of Justice will continue to zealously defend @POTUS's policies and his authority to implement them,"" she added.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to a California vice mayor who is under investigation after posting a video calling on local gangs to push back against ICE raids.

FIRST ON FOX: A Republican lawmaker is filing impeachment articles against a judge who temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's control of the National Guard in California during this month's riots in Los Angeles.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., is filing a resolution to remove U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer from the bench on Friday.

He told Fox News Digital that he felt the judge's decision was ""political.""

""The goal is to get judges to do their jobs. If we're not going to try to hold accountable the ones that aren't, then they have no incentive to stop,"" Fine said.

It comes as Republicans continue to push back on Democratic officials trying to block Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration throughout the country. 

The days-long riots in Los Angeles were spurred by ICE raids in Hispanic and Latino neighborhoods, leading to activists clashing with law enforcement and burning cars as a sign of resistance.

Trump, accusing California's progressive officials of not doing enough to stop the situation, bypassed Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom to order the National Guard into Los Angeles to restore order.

Critics of the move said it needlessly escalated an already tense situation, and accused Trump and his allies of exaggerating the violence.

Breyer issued a temporary order blocking Trump's deployment of federal troops earlier this month, however, in response to a lawsuit brought by California.

""At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions. He did not,"" the court opinion said.

""His actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.""

Breyer's ruling was quashed last week when a three-judge panel on the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it was within Trump's authority to federalize the California National Guard.

Breyer is just the latest judge to be brought under House GOP scrutiny after several Trump executive actions got held up in court.

Trump allies have called for the impeachment of multiple judges, though House GOP leadership has made clear there's little appetite to follow through on such moves – particularly when removal by the Senate is unlikely.

Fine acknowledged the long odds but insisted the resolution was a potent messaging tool.

""I think it's worth doing. I don't know that we can pass it, I don't know that the Senate would remove him from office, but I think failing to avail ourselves of the remedies that the framers intended was a mistake,"" Fine said.

Sen. Charles Schumer sounds off against Trump's use of military force.

Nearly 200 House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles earlier this month. 

The resolution was led by Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., and the rest of the Golden State's Republican congressional delegation. 215 members of the House of Representatives, which included seven House Democrats, voted in favor of the resolution.

""Peaceful protests are a constitutional right, but vandalism, looting, violence, and other crimes are not. Protecting public safety shouldn't be controversial, which is why I am leading the California Republican delegation in a resolution to support law and order as we continue to see unrest,"" Kim stated when introducing the resolution. 

""I hope Governor Newsom can come together with President Trump to stop the riots, lower the temperature, and keep our communities safe,"" she added.

""Let's be clear: the riots escalated before the National Guard was sent in and were enabled by California's soft-on-crime policies – peddled for years by Governor Newsom, Sacramento, and local prosecutors – that have allowed for lawlessness and endangered public safety of hardworking Californians,"" Kim continued.

It was introduced on June 17, and it acknowledges that peaceful protests should be welcomed in the United States, but calls out the criminal elements that unfolded in the area earlier this month.

""These protests quickly escalated into violent riots across Los Angeles, where acts of arson, widespread looting, property destruction, and vandalism were committed, blocking streets and highways, lighting streets on fire, throwing rocks at law enforcement vehicles, and assaulting Federal and local peace officers,"" the resolution states.

Earlier this month, Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that the protest was an excuse for bad actors to commit crimes, such as stealing from businesses, committing property damage and assaulting law enforcement.

""This group wanted to commit crimes,"" Hochman said at the time. ""They looked at the protest as a cover, an opportunity to go ahead and ply their illegal trade and commit a whole variety of crimes that, in many ways, has done a huge disservice to the legitimate protesters out there.""

Some Democrats criticized the resolution, as a legal battle ensured whether President Donald Trump was able to send in the National Guard as the civil unrest went on. Many Republicans have argued it was necessary, while many California Democratic leaders like Gov. Gavin Newsom said troop deployment was an instigator.

The Phoenix Suns' roster will look vastly different this fall.

Just a few days before the 2025 NBA Draft, reports of a trade involving Kevin Durant surfaced. The deal is expected to send the two-time NBA champion to the Houston Rockets, ESPN reported Sunday.

The Rockets held the tenth overall pick in the draft and selected 7-foot-2 Khaman Maluach Wednesday. The former Duke standout was subsequently sent to Phoenix as part of the package of players and picks included in the Durant deal, according to ESPN.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Hegseth is right","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3456013/pete-hegseth-is-right-trump-media-criticism/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 02:57:17 GMT","

HEGSETH IS RIGHT. This newsletter has often noted a peculiar feature of some media coverage of President Donald Trump: When Trump or Republicans say something, many reporters and commentators reflexively seek to knock it down. When Trump or Republicans say A, they immediately say not-A. Do Trump and his GOP allies say former President Joe Biden seems out of it? Then Biden must be just fine.

On Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered his own description of the phenomenon when he was addressing media coverage of the effectiveness of the U.S. bombing attack on Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump has said the raid was a huge success and that U.S. bombers “completely demolished” and “obliterated” Iran's nuclear sites. Almost immediately, some media reports, citing anonymously leaked early assessments, said that was not true. Addressing the Pentagon press corps, Hegseth accused journalists of rooting for the president to fail. “You cheer against Trump so hard,” he said. “It's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump because you want him not to be successful so bad.”

There's something to that. Hegseth appeared particularly angry because rooting against Trump in this particular case — that is, hoping he is wrong in his positive assessment of the bombing's effects — also means rooting against the U.S. military.

Of course, reporters, even the most reflexively anti-Trump, would deny doing any such thing. But there is no denying that some news organizations, acting on scant evidence, jumped to suggest that the U.S. bombing — Trump's most consequential foreign policy decision so far — was, if not an outright failure, not nearly as effective as the president claimed.

Exhibit A is a story published Wednesday by CNN headlined, “Exclusive: Early US intel assessment suggests strikes on Iran did not destroy nuclear sites, sources say.” Citing a preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the story reported that the bombing not only did not destroy the “core components” of Iran's nuclear program, but it likely “only set it back by months.” It appears CNN had not actually seen the assessment, which was surely highly classified, but instead based its reporting on descriptions “by seven people briefed on it.”

Seven sources sound pretty impressive — until you read a bit further down the story. “Two of the people familiar with the assessment said Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed,” the story said. “One of the people said the centrifuges are largely ‘intact.' Another source said that the intelligence assessed enriched uranium was moved out of the sites prior to the U.S. strikes.”

In the blink of an eye, seven sources went down to two sources and then down to one source “briefed” on the assessment. In addition, the assessment was a very early look at the situation, just hours after the bombing, and analysts had “low confidence” in its ultimate accuracy. 

Hegseth pounded home those points. “It was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike, when it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment,” Hegseth said. “It's preliminary. It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. There's low confidence in this particular report. It says in the report there are gaps in the information.” Hegseth continued, “It says in the report multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment — a linchpin assumption, you know what that is? That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. If you're wrong, everything else is wrong. And still this [DIA] report acknowledges it's likely severe damage.”

After the leaks came out, CIA Director John Ratcliffe offered support for Trump's and Hegseth's position. “CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes,” Ratcliffe said in a statement. “This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.” Hegseth also offered quotes from other sources — the United Nations, the Israeli government, and others — to support his position.

A number of administration supporters pointed out that the lead reporter on the CNN piece, Natasha Bertrand, has a history of writing poorly supported hit pieces directed at Trump. In his first term, Bertrand was a vocal proponent of the so-called Steele Dossier, the collection of salacious, damaging, and unfounded rumors targeting Trump that was compiled by a former British spy paid by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign. In the 2020 contest, Bertrand pushed a letter from former intelligence officers who wrongly claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop was a Russian disinformation operation: “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.” The Biden campaign organized the letter; the laptop was genuine.

You get the idea. The main point is that at this moment in the story, so soon after the U.S. bombing, there is simply no way to know its full effect with great certainty. But think about it. After more than a week of damaging Israeli attacks, the United States, with great precision, then drops 14 bombs, each weighing 30,000 pounds, on Iranian facilities. The U.S. also threw in some cruise missiles on top. Given the quality of the intelligence about Iran's equipment and the accuracy of the targeting, it is reasonable to suspect that the attacks did some very serious damage. There is also reason to be skeptical about sources — maybe seven, or maybe two, or perhaps just one — who have been briefed on the matter and want to declare it a failure quickly. Who knows? Maybe they have an agenda. In any event, we will learn more in the coming days about the full effects of the U.S. and Israeli attacks.

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected an attempt to undo a portion of Obamacare preventive coverage mandates, once again thwarting another try from conservatives to get rid of a major piece of the law via legal challenge.

The 6-3 majority decision upholding the current structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force protects insurance coverage mandates for 10 different preventive treatments, including for certain cancers, perinatal depression, preeclampsia, and HIV.

The case, Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, turned on the fact that the members of the USPSTF are “inferior officers” under the appointments clause of the Constitution, meaning that they do not need to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The task force members have been chosen by the health and human services secretary since the panel was created by Congress in 1984 in a purely advisory capacity. The power of the body changed with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, which mandated the recommendations of the board upon the HHS secretary's approval.

Braidwood Management, a Texas-based, Christian-owned business, challenged the USPSTF's authority by arguing that task force members ought to be considered “primary officers” under the appointments clause of the Constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in the case, to which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonja Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined.

Kavanaugh argued that the members of the task force are not independent of the HHS secretary and, as such, cannot be construed as primary officers.

“The Task Force members are removable at will by the Secretary of HHS, and their recommendations are reviewable by the Secretary before they take effect,” Kavanaugh wrote. “So Task Force members are supervised and directed by the Secretary, who in turn answers to the President, preserving the chain of command in Article II.”

Because task force members “cannot make any legally binding, final decisions” without the assent of the HHS secretary, Kavanaugh argued, the HHS secretary ultimately controls whether or not the task force recommendations become mandates for insurance companies.

That means that they would need to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. In the current system, they are appointed by the HHS secretary.

Preventive care mandates have been one of the most controversial elements of the Affordable Care Act, requiring private health insurance plans to cover a range of preventive services without cost-sharing.

Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, the USPSTF has implemented 10 different preventive service mandates, ranging from cancers, perinatal depression, preeclampsia, and HIV prevention.

A study published in April in the Journal of the American Medical Association Health Forum found that about 30% of privately insured people, including half of all privately insured women, use at least one of the 10 preventive services mandated by the task force since 2010.

During oral arguments, liberal and conservative Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of the challenger's argument that the USPSTF functioned as an independent agency, citing that the 16 members of the panel serve “at-will” of the HHS secretary.

Kagan, during oral arguments, sparked laughter from the audience when she forcefully pushed back against the assertion that the USPSTF is an independent agency.

“More often we destroy independent agencies,” Kagan said. “The idea that we would take a statute which doesn't set up an independent agency and declare it one strikes me as pretty inconsistent with everything that we've done in this area.”

In the dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that both the statutes creating the USPSTF and Obamacare are ambiguous with respect to the oversight authority of the HHS secretary. 

Thomas wrote in his dissent that the issue should be remanded to the lower court to address the challenge to the statute before addressing the constitutionality of the body's appointment.

SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH PARENTS WHO WANT TO OPT KIDS OUT OF LGBT SCHOOL BOOKS

“Due respect for Congress as a coordinate branch of Government usually demands that we refrain from calling the constitutionality of its enactments into question ‘unless absolutely necessary to the decision of a case,'' Thomas wrote, citing precedent from the 1930s.

Thomas was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court sided on Friday with a group of Maryland parents who argued that a school board's policy preventing them from opting their children out of LGBT curriculum infringed on their religious freedom rights.

The 6-3 ruling from the high court marked the latest win for religious liberty advocates handed down by the justices this term. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion.

“The Board's introduction of the ‘LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks, along with its decision to withhold opt-outs, places an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights to the free exercise of their religion. The parents have therefore shown that they are likely to succeed in their free exercise claims,” Alito wrote.

The majority ruling granted the Maryland parents a preliminary injunction and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for further proceedings. While the case continues in the lower court, the justices ordered the school board to notify parents and allow opt-outs when the types of books at the center of the case are part of classroom instruction.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett joined Alito's majority opinion. Thomas also authored a concurring opinion in which he discussed why he believed the board's policy was unconstitutional as well as the ruling's ramifications.

“Insofar as schools or boards attempt to employ their curricula to interfere with religious exercise, courts should carefully police such ‘ingenious defiance of the Constitution' no less than they do in other contexts,” Thomas wrote.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a blistering dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, in which she said the majority decision would create “chaos” and be harmful for schools across the country.

“Public schools, this Court has said, are ‘at once the symbol of our democracy and the most pervasive means for promoting our common destiny,'” Sotomayor wrote. “They offer to children of all faiths and backgrounds an education and an opportunity to practice living in our multicultural society. That experience is critical to our Nation's civic vitality.”

“Yet it will become a mere memory if children must be insulated from exposure to ideas and concepts that may conflict with their parents' religious beliefs,” she added. “Today's ruling ushers in that new reality.”

The Friday majority opinion is a key victory for religious and parental rights in public schools, holding with recent Supreme Court decisions affirming religious liberty.

The lawsuit stemmed from a 2023 decision by Montgomery County Public Schools to bar religious opt-outs for LGBT books, such as Uncle Bobby's Wedding, which portrays a same-sex marriage, and Intersection Allies, which looks at nonbinary gender identities. The group of parents alleged that the school board's decision not to notify parents that their children would be studying the controversial books and not to allow students to sit out of the LGBT-themed story time violated their Constitutional rights.

During oral arguments for the case held on April 22, a majority of the justices appeared ready to side with parents over the school district in the dispute.

TOP CASES THE SUPREME COURT WILL DECIDE AT THE END OF THIS TERM

Lawyers for the parents argued the school board violated their First Amendment rights when it removed their ability to opt their children out of studying LGBT books. The school board's lawyers argued that opening the door to sweeping opt-outs for curriculum that parents disagree with would “conscript courts into the role of playing school board.”

The decision will have sweeping implications for parents' ability to pull their children out of controversial lessons at public schools for religious reasons.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump may have averted a wider war with Iran, but he is now taking the fight to a more familiar foe: the media.

The White House and Pentagon have pushed back strongly against reporting calling into question the efficacy of U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, with Trump himself accusing reporters of denigrating the pilots who flew the dangerous mission to tarnish him politically.

“Those pilots hit their targets,” Trump said. “Those targets were obliterated, and the pilots should be given credit. They‘re not after the pilots; they're after me. They want to try and demean me.”

Trump took the unusual step of announcing a Thursday morning press briefing by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth himself as part of the administration's effort to combat the reporting.

“Before I pass it to the chairman, because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes,” Hegseth said during the sometimes tense press conference. “You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. Maybe the way the Trump administration's represented them isn't true.”

The Pentagon chief came to the job from television, giving him a more extensive media background than the typical defense secretary.

“There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because your people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful,” Hegseth continued. “It's irresponsible. And folks in this room are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. It's an important responsibility.”

Trump took a similar line in a press availability at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, thanking the pilots and lambasting the press.

“You know, [the pilots] were maligned and treated very badly. Demeaned by fake news, CNN, which is back there, believe it or not, wasting time and wasting– and nobody's watching them, so they're just wasting a lot of time. Wasting my time,” he said. “And the New York Times, they put out a story that, well, maybe they were hit, but it wasn't bad.”

Trump added, “What bothered me about these reports with fake reports put out by the New York Times failing– I call it the failing New York Times because it's doing terribly. Without me, it would be doing no business at all, but– and by fake news, CNN and MSDNC [his nickname for MSNBC], all of these terrible people, you know, they have no credibility.”

Trump spoke at length about the pilots' skill and courage, circling back to that topic when asked about a leaked early report, issued with low confidence, that suggested the Iranian nuclear program had not been disrupted as much as the administration originally hoped.

“You know, you should be proud, you– especially you should be proud of those pilots and you shouldn't be trying to demean them,” Trump told a reporter. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt specifically called out CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who had previously covered the Trump-Russia story and attempted to debunk the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop. “This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove,” Leavitt said of Bertrand during a press briefing. Trump had previously called for Bertrand's firing and alleged she was “attempting to destroy our Patriot Pilots by making them look bad.”

At a White House event on Thursday highlighting workers the administration says would benefit from Congress passing Trump's “big, beautiful” reconciliation bill, Trump took a moment to rip “fake news CNN” for its characterization of the Iran strikes.

Hegseth clashed with his former Fox News colleague Jennifer Griffin in similarly personal terms. “Jennifer, you've been about the worst — the one who misrepresents the most intentionally,” he said on Thursday. 

Trump's relationship with the legacy media has never been good. Hegseth has been nearly as combative with the Pentagon press corps since taking office after a grueling confirmation process. 

The president has started to have some success with his lawsuits against media outlets, worrying press freedom advocates. But being a target of Trump's criticism, however unpleasant, is still a career booster for many political reporters.

Republican complaints about liberal media bias date back at least to the 1960s. Spiro Agnew, vice president under President Richard Nixon, called the Washington press corps “nattering nabobs of negativism,” a phrase later attributed to speechwriter and eventual longtime conservative columnist William Safire. 

This has only intensified in the decade since Trump has been at the helm of the Republican Party. The press is only now coming to terms with its largely kid-gloves treatment of former President Joe Biden's age-related decline, which grew severe enough that Democrats pushed him off the top of the 2024 ticket following a disastrous debate performance. 

The press has regularly been criticized for its coverage of wars since Vietnam. In the past quarter-century, however, many have argued the media has been too trusting of the intelligence community on issues ranging from weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq War and the Trump-Russia stories from the president's first term. Foreign war zones and uncertain international events are notoriously difficult to cover.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE THREE IRAN NUCLEAR SITES TARGETED IN US STRIKES

A Gallup poll last year found a continuing trend of low trust in the mass media, with only 12% of Republicans saying they had a great deal or fair amount of confidence in the press.

While a war between Trump and the media may last as long as any in the Middle East, this one comes with much greater political upside for the White House.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the White House “banned” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard from a congressional briefing on Iran.

Gabbard had been at odds with the administration over her claim in March that the intelligence community believed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. President Donald Trump said her March claim was “wrong” last week.

“I've never, ever been part of a major Cabinet-level classified briefing where the director of national intelligence was banned from the room,” Murphy told CNN. “It stands to reason that they knew that she was not going to toe the line. She was likely to refuse to say what the administration wants, which is that [Iran's nuclear] program was obliterated.”

Gabbard wrote in a post on X on Wednesday that “new intelligence” showed “Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.” She said rebuilding them would take years, rejecting past intelligence leaks that showed the strikes on the nuclear facilities delayed Iran's nuclear program by just months.

A senior White House official told the Daily Beast that “CIA Director Ratcliffe will represent the intelligence community tomorrow while Tulsi Gabbard continues her critical work at DNI. The media is turning this into something it's not.”

The DNI also blamed the media for allegedly distorting the intelligence report. “The propaganda media has deployed their usual tactic: selectively release portions of illegally leaked classified intelligence assessments (intentionally leaving out the fact that the assessment was written with ‘low confidence') to try to undermine President Trump's decisive leadership and the brave servicemen and women who flawlessly executed a truly historic mission to keep the American people safe and secure,” she added.

Gabbard was initially scheduled to attend a briefing with senators on Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed to Thursday and Gabbard was removed from those attending, which included Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

It's unclear whether she will attend a similar briefing for the House on Friday.

Gabbard's exclusion comes as the White House plans to limit classified intelligence sharing with Congress because of the past leaked intelligence. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the decision should be undone.

“The administration has no right to stonewall Congress on matters of national security,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Senators deserve information, and the administration has a legal obligation to inform Congress precisely about what is happening right now abroad.

“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images. Obliteration is an accurate term!

For me, a native New Yorker, watching the Democratic Party nominate a socialist jihadi apologist for mayor less than 25 years after 9/11 is infuriating. Not because Zohran Mamdani is a Muslim, but because he embraces “globalizing the intifada,” a violent, terroristic slogan aimed at his Jewish neighbors — in a city where they have increasingly been targeted. 

There's no need to soft-pedal what's happening. Even as national media worked to moderate the candidate's image, Mamdani was campaigning with popular leftist Twitcher and Jew-baiter Hasan Piker, who once said, “America deserved 9/11.” In 1984, it was a scandal that Jesse Jackson called New York “Hymietown.” By today's standards, it seems frivolous. 

Then, of course, Mamdani supports rent controls, price controls, government-run stores, new regulatory burdens, and redistribution. In the past, he backed dismantling the police, even though public safety is allegedly the top issue on the minds of New Yorkers. But Mamdani isn't a product of the old-fashioned class-based socialistic tradition that's been, to some extent, embedded in our politics for over a century. He is an adherent of a reinvigorated red-green alliance, in which Marxists, Islamists, Third World revolutionaries, and, now, champions of quack and identitarian causes align. 

I get a kick out of people who struggle to wrap their minds around “Trans for Palestine” or other seemingly illogical alliances. It makes complete sense. They share the same enemy. It's why Mamdani promises to spend $65 million on “gender-affirming” mutilation surgeries for children while siding with Hamas. 

Why would New Yorkers vote for him?

Political pundits love to psychoanalyze voters and imbue them with all kinds of imaginary motivations. One of the trendy theories I see floating around is that Mamdani's win was due to a restive populist revolt, much like “working class” upheaval against the Republican Party establishment. Mamdani, like President Donald Trump, we are told, is merely a reaction to years of failed promises by the forgotten people of the Bronx and Queens. 

First off, Mamdani's most loyal supporters are educated white voters who are immigrants from around the country. Mamdani's strongest support came from younger renters from gentrified areas in Western Queens and North Brooklyn. These people are about as “working class” as Mamdani. Then again, one of the biggest myths of Marxism has always been that it is led by the proletariat. From Marx onward, most notable socialist leaders hail from the middle and upper classes, propped up by the wealthy benefactors. 

Many conservatives, on the other hand, blamed Islamic immigration for Mamdani's rise. It's true that stressing “diversity” over integration has degraded our shared social mores and values. It's a problem. But Mamdani is an all-too-familiar product of American institutions. His father is a professor of anti-Western pseudohistorical “postcolonial studies” at Columbia University. His mother is a film director. Mamdani attended the elite Bronx High School of Science and went to Bowdoin, where he earned a degree in Africana studies. The 33-year-old assemblyman took the predictable and coddled journey of the modern-day American revolutionary. 

Others tell me Mamdani won because he was charismatic and spoke passionately about the lack of affordability in the city. I'll have to take their word. If charisma is leading young people toward socialism, someone is going to have to explain to me why the octogenarian red-diaper baby Bernie Sanders is perhaps the most popular Democrat in the country. 

What if Mamdani, like socialists everywhere, simply appealed to the envy of economic illiterates who want others to pay for their lives? What if 70% of young people are fine with socialism because they've spent their lives being bombarded with anticapitalistic messaging in culture, politics, and schools? People tell me the young are susceptible to collectivism because capitalism has failed them. I disagree. But it's certainly not the market's fault you chose to borrow over $100,000 for unusable degrees and then moved to the most expensive real estate market in the world.

Even if it was, Mamdani is just reanimating a host of failed ideas. Of course, I'm sure you can show Mamdani supporters charts and numbers and give them a bevy of historical examples of socialism's extensive history of catastrophe, and they wouldn't care. When Mamdani fails, progressive Democrats will blame corporations and the wealthy, and maybe AIPAC. Progressivism is an emotion and vibe-driven movement. Everyone is looking for a religion. Many New Yorkers just happened to pick the most destructive one ever created. 

In years past, Democrats would feign offense at being labeled socialists. Today, not a single notable elected Democrat, outside of Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), decried the direction of their party. Indeed, many big-name Democrats have endorsed Mamdani, including, despicably, numerous Jewish Democrats. 

That might point to a bigger problem than Mamdani. The Democratic Party establishment is terrified of the contemporary progressive Democrats, who have adopted the most authoritarian ideology mainstreamed in modern American political history. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) made her name proposing we nationalize the entire economy in the name of the environment. Simply because socialist ideas are not yet feasible does not negate the insanity of their champions. 

TRUMP LEARNED THE LESSONS OF IRAQ

That said, we shouldn't overstate Mamdani's victory, either. In total, about 9% of New Yorkers voted for him in an off-year election in a left-wing city. A corrupt former governor, Andrew Cuomo, was his leading opponent in the primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams (also corrupt!) still has a shot to win in the general. Michael Bloomberg won reelection as an independent in 2009, so it can happen. 

But that doesn't mean Mamdani's win doesn't signify an ugly reality about American politics. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

What does America owe its Latino soldiers?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The four men in jeans and tactical vests labeled Police: U.S. Border Patrol had Narciso Barranco surrounded. Their masks and hats concealed their faces, so that only their eyes were visible. When they'd approached him, he was doing landscape work outside of an IHOP in Santa Ana, California. Frightened, Barranco attempted to run away. By the time a bystander started filming, the agents had caught him and pinned him, face down, on the road. One crouches and begins to pummel him, repeatedly, in the head. You can hear Barranco moaning in pain. Eventually, the masked men drag him to his feet and try to shove him into an SUV. When Barranco resists, one agent takes a rod and wedges it under his neck, attempting to steer him into the vehicle as if prodding livestock.

Barranco is the father of three sons, all of them United States Marines. The eldest brother is a veteran, and the younger men are on active duty. At any moment, the same president who sent an emboldened ICE after their father could also command them into battle. That president has described Latinos as “criminals” and “anchor babies,” but the Barrancos and so many like them, immigrants or the children of immigrants, are not “invading” America; they're defending it.

Read: Trump's deportations aren't what they seem

In 2015, 12 percent of active-duty service members identified as Hispanic. By 2023, that number had increased to 19.5 percent. In the Marine Corps, the proportion was closer to 28 percent. Latinas are more represented in the military than in the civilian workforce—21 percent of enlisted women compared with 18 percent of working women. (One explanation might be the military's guaranteed equal pay: In the civilian workforce, Latinas earn just 65 cents on the dollar compared with white men.)

Communities of color have long been targets for military recruitment. When I went to public high school in Brooklyn in the '90s, recruitment officers used to visit classrooms. The military offers financial stability, a route to college. But for many Latinos, as for other immigrant groups, it offers more: a path to belonging, whether for citizens who have been treated as outsiders in their own nation, or for the undocumented. Immigrants who serve at least a year in any branch of the armed forces can become eligible for naturalized citizenship.

In 1917, just before entering World War I, the United States passed the Jones-Shafroth Act, bestowing citizenship (but not a right to representation) on Puerto Ricans. This would have the effect of making them eligible for the draft when it was instituted a few months later. An estimated 18,000 to 20,000 Puerto Rican recruits were soon shipped off to fight in Europe. 

During World War II, approximately 15,000 Mexican nationals fought in American uniforms, many earning citizenship. This was in addition to the 500,000 American Latinos of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent who enlisted and fought for their country, including my own grandfather. He was a decorated member of the 9th Infantry Division who fought in Tunisia, landed in Normandy, and was one of the first American soldiers to make it into Germany. He was proud of his role in history, but also of the lifelong friendships that he, a Puerto Rican man from Brooklyn, had with veterans from across the country.

In one oral history, Armando Flores, a veteran of World War II, recounts a lieutenant scolding him in his early days of service: “American soldiers stand at attention.” Rather than feeling chastened, Flores was stunned. “Nobody had ever called me an American until that time.”

Hispanic veterans came home to a country where signs were posted in Texas restaurant windows announcing: No Dogs Negroes Mexicans. Like their African American counterparts, many were the victims of redlining that prevented them from buying homes. Latino veterans created the American GI Forum to demand that benefits such as medical care and burial rights be available to Latino as well as white veterans. During the Vietnam War, Latinos were about 5 percent of the U.S. population, but they accounted for an estimated 20 percent of the 60,000 American casualties.

This country has a long history of treating the veterans who have served it shoddily. And yet what's happening now—as Donald Trump's agents violently detain some Latinos in the streets as other Latinos serve their country in strikes against Iran—feels extreme.

Johnathan Hernandez, a city councilman in Santa Ana, where Barranco was beaten, describes what's happening in his community as a kind of war itself. Santa Ana is 77 percent Hispanic. It has become a popular target for ICE. Hernandez told me that he is seeing “a culture of fear, a culture of people not feeling safe, and people feeling under attack.” He said he worked to get the video posted on social media because no one knew who the man in it was, and he hoped that someone in the tight-knit community could identify him. “Because of the fact that these agents are unidentified and they're taking people without due process, it means that you're leaving very little for a family to be able to put the pieces together and find their loved ones,” he said. A woman saw the video on Instagram and commented that it was her friends' father.

Nearly 24 hours after the violent encounter, Barranco's eldest son, Alejandro, was able to finally make contact with his father, who said he still had not received medical care, and that he was hungry and thirsty. (The Department of Homeland Security claimed that Barranco had “assaulted” agents with his string trimmer—sharing a video in which he can be seen turning toward the agents and briefly lifting it—and that he had declined medical care.) In interviews with news agencies, Alejandro said that he and his brothers “feel hurt; we feel betrayed.” Their father taught them to “respect this country, thank this country, and then that led us to join the Marine Corps and kind of give back to the country and be thankful,” he said.

Alejandro was deployed to Kabul in 2021, when the U.S. was evacuating from Afghanistan.

Had a Marine treated a detainee the way that the Border Patrol agents treated his father, he told MSNBC, it would have been considered a war crime.

He also spoke with Task & Purpose, which covers the military. “I don't believe that they followed their training,” he said about the agents. “Repeatedly punching a man in the face while he's on the ground while he's been maced or pepper-sprayed, I don't believe that that was in their training.” (He also noted that the agents could be seen running with their weapons, which is “a very unprofessional way of holding a firearm.”)

Many Latinos are sharing in the Barranco family's trauma. We are a highly diverse identity group, whose common bonds can feel tenuous at best. Forty-eight percent of the Latinos who voted in the 2024 election chose Trump—and many Latino members of the military, which tends to lean more conservative than the general population, were probably among them. And yet even some of those Trump voters, seeing on a daily basis the violence and haphazard cruelty with which the Trump administration is executing its mass-deportation agenda, must share my terror and anger. (ICE's recent actions have already led some of Trump's supporters to regret their vote.)

How can any Latinos feel secure if “looking” Hispanic or speaking Spanish or even going to Home Depot puts you at risk? How would you feel if you were deployed half a world away and wondering each day if your mother or father or sister or brother or wife might have been snatched up by ICE?

This is a personal question for Latino soldiers, but it is a personnel question for the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, who have to worry about military morale as an essential dimension of combat power. The psychological toll of ICE raids isn't borne only by the new immigrants whom Trump calls “invaders,” but also by many of the Americans tasked with protecting us from real foreign threats. In the barracks at Camp Pendleton where the younger Barranco brothers sleep, they must be struggling to focus on their mission while fearing for the safety of their father in the hands of the very government they are sworn to defend.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A fantastical new novel from Karen Russell turns the whispered secrets of a Dust Bowl town into a bold metaphor for repressed history.

If literature and pop culture are to be trusted, many of us are drawn to the idea of eliminating memories—cordoning them off, storing them outside ourselves, or getting rid of them completely. In the 2004 movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a former couple pays to have their memories of each other erased after a bad breakup. Jennifer Egan's 2022 novel, The Candy House, features a technology called Own Your Unconscious, which extracts and packages characters' memories to be revisited, or not, at will. And most recently, on the television show Severance, a corporation offers its employees a procedure that splits their consciousness in two, creating workers untroubled by their outside self's emotions. All of these narratives rely on the sense that memories—good and bad—are a burden. Implicitly, they ask their audience whether they'd like to be free of their recollections too.

Often, such stories suggest a real personal cost to getting rid of one's memories, and The Candy House and Severance both have broader dystopian elements as well. But the acclaimed short-story writer Karen Russell's second novel, The Antidote, takes a much more sweeping and historically minded approach to the idea of memory erasure and its pitfalls. Set during the Dust Bowl in a small Nebraska town called Uz, the book is named after a so-called prairie witch, one of a number of women in the area who perform a mysterious service: For a fee, they store memories for their drought-stricken neighbors, who whisper their secrets to the witches while they're in a trance. One of the Antidote's clients confesses to resenting their chronically ill child; others store beautiful memories “like bouquets preserved under glass,” not wanting them to lose their bloom; still others, prodded by the town's corrupt sheriff, use her service to lock away details about crimes they've witnessed. Awake, the Antidote has no idea what she's heard. She operates, essentially, as temporary remote storage for the townspeople's recollections, making them inaccessible to anyone until the sharer chooses to retrieve the memory.

But the Antidote and her colleagues aren't the only memory-erasers in the novel. When a huge dust storm (the one known as Black Sunday, which, Woody Guthrie famously wrote, “blocked out the traffic an' blocked out the sun”) hits Uz, it somehow eliminates the Antidote's cache of memories. On realizing what has happened, she panics. Of course, this is an existential issue for her—prairie witching is how she supports herself—but her response also has a moral dimension: Although she doesn't know what secrets she's lost, she suspects that justice won't be done until many of them are aired publicly. But not even Black Sunday can erase Uz's founding shame: the theft of land from American Indians, and the devastation that ensued. One of Russell's narrators, a kindhearted farmer named Harp Oletsky, puts this bluntly to his peers, telling them that the “land is blowing because we stole it from the people who knew how to take care of it. Before we uprooted the prairie, we uprooted human beings.”

Of course, to Harp, this uprooting, of which he is deeply ashamed, isn't history. His parents, Polish immigrants who fled German conquest and discrimination, took Indian land—and felt shame over doing so, having been uprooted themselves. But rather than changing course, they used prairie witches to get rid of their guilt toward the people whose homes they'd stolen.

The Antidote has her own complex relationship to this history. The daughter of poor, urban Italian immigrants, she tells herself that she and her family had nothing to do with the land theft—that, in fact, its wealthy perpetrators are her enemies too. But over the course of the novel, she comes to understand that her magic—her ability to bank ugly memories so that families such as the Oletskys can prosper without pain—is a form of complicity.

The Antidote comes to this realization as she befriends one of the novel's other narrators, a photographer named Cleo who comes to Nebraska through the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal program designed to address rural poverty. On the road, Cleo buys a camera that seems to be able to see through time. Its images, once developed, show the future or past of the site Cleo meant to photograph. Often, she can tell she's looking at a time other than her own, but can't begin to guess when it is.

By collapsing time, Russell yanks her audience into the book. Cleo may not recognize the 21st century when she develops a picture of it, but we do. Some of the novel's agenda—it very much has an agenda—is to create a history of the prairie that, in the Antidote's words, is one not “of Manifest Destiny, but Invisible Loss.” Russell clearly wants to complicate John Steinbeck–type tales of the Dust Bowl, ones that tend to concentrate on white farmers' suffering without considering the pain their arrival in the West caused. For Americans to forget the latter, Russell seems to argue, would be a loss of identity on a national scale—something worth grieving and, indeed, something dystopian. But The Antidote doesn't stop there. Its true project is to defeat the very fantasy it starts with: that of getting rid of the past. In the novel, memories, like money, need to be kept in circulation for the health of society. They don't do anybody much good in a vault.

The Antidote's characters tend to struggle with describing their memories to anyone but the Antidote—and to the reader. Russell writes in what can feel like a series of monologues. As in her first novel, the highly inventive and fun Swamplandia!, her prose is just dense and unusual enough to insist on being read slowly. At the same time, it's direct and intimate. Especially in the first half of the novel, her narrators seem to be pouring their guts out to us in order to avoid talking to one another. Harp, who is raising his orphaned niece, Dell, after her mother is murdered, never reminisces with Dell about his sister; the Antidote and Cleo both do their best not to have meaningful conversations with anyone at all. Only when Russell puts these four characters into proximity do they start getting some of their memories out into the air.

For Dell, Harp, and the Antidote, talking is straightforwardly healing. Dell and Harp get to grieve Dell's mom; Harp gets to work through his unsettled feelings about his family's acquisition of its land; the Antidote gets to reckon with the nature of her work. For Cleo, the book's outsider, however, things are more complex. Her explicit duty as a government photographer is to contribute to “public recollection, ‘a rich fund of memories' for every present and future American,” but even before her camera begins showing her scenes that aren't there, she has little faith in the veracity of photography. As an artist, she knows that she can manipulate the images she makes: “People are wary of my camera,” she admits, “with good reason. Each flash ran a stake through your heart. Now you were nailed to one spot, wearing this forlorn or broken expression. The wrinkling ocean of human thinking and feeling that ripples across a face, over a lifetime—the camera cannot capture any of that.”

Read: Whitewashing the Great Depression

In fact, it's Cleo's assignment to catch her subjects looking pitiable, though without letting them know she's doing so. Her images are meant not only to become memory but also to get Congress to give struggling farmers money. For Cleo, who is Black, this is a fraught mission; she knows—and her boss often reminds her—that it is likeliest to succeed if she makes portraits of the “faces that carried the most weight with Congress. The need that triggered avalanches of compassion was White need.” Russell includes real images from the Resettlement Administration in her book—the sorts of images that were by and large taken to represent white suffering, even when, as in the case of Dorothea Lange's famous “Migrant Mother,” their subject was not white. Their presence is a reminder that public memory can hide as much as it preserves.

The Antidote, in part, is a reaction to the hidden history of the Dust Bowl, an effort to return to circulation the fact that the land “blew away,” as Harp puts it, because white settlers stole it from its stewards. By the end of the novel, Russell's characters are all on a mission to get people talking not only about this painful collective memory but also about all the bits of their past that they've tried to stifle or pack away. The more we share our memories, they realize, the less they burden us—and, crucially, the more we can know ourselves through them. This is especially true for Dell: As she begins to allow herself to talk about her mother, whom she misses acutely, she grows more able to feel happiness in her new life with Harp.

Russell makes this point about memory in other ways too—through an exhibition of Cleo's photographs and a subplot concerning Uz's sheriff, who is both the Antidote's enemy and one of her biggest clients. Sometimes he deposits his own memories with her; more often, though, he uses her to hide evidence, hence her moral distress after Black Sunday. If the happy memories some people deposit in the Antidote's vaults are treasures, then so, in a sense, are the ones that could have brought justice. Taken together, these lost stories demonstrate that in The Antidote, hiding memories—whatever the reason—is never a good thing. The poor farmer who deposited his first kiss in the prairie witch loses it forever on Black Sunday. Dell, meanwhile, loses her chance at knowing who killed her mother, due to the sheriff's machinations. These are very different losses, but both suggest a cost in refusing to engage with the past. If a person or a group of people can't look back on the ills they've perpetrated, they can't undo their damage or aspire to do better in the future. And if they can't summon the joys of their life—well, then what's there to hope for?

﻿This decision isn't really about birthright citizenship.

On Friday, the Supreme Court released its long-awaited decision in Trump v. CASA, a case challenging President Donald Trump's attempt to strip many Americans of citizenship. The Court handed Trump a narrow victory along party lines, with all six Republicans in the majority and all three Democrats dissenting.

The 14th Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States” are citizens, with one narrow exception that does not arise in CASA, so Trump's executive order trying to strip many babies born in the US of their citizenship is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional. Multiple lower courts have all reached this same conclusion.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

There are three important takeaways from the CASA opinion:

The specific issue was whether all the lower courts that struck down the Trump anti-citizenship order may issue a “nationwide injunction,” which would block that order everywhere in the country, or whether they must issue a more narrow injunction that only blocked it in certain states, or for certain families.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion concludes that a nationwide injunction is not allowed…sort of. Much of the opinion is about why nationwide injunctions should be impermissible, but a key section suggests that, in this case, one might actually be okay.

Specifically, Barrett says that courts may issue injunctions that are broad enough to ensure that a victorious plaintiff receives “complete relief.” This matters because several of the plaintiffs in this case are blue states that object to Trump's attempt to cancel many Americans' citizenship. And they argued that it would be unworkable if birthright citizenship was the rule in some states, but not others.

As Barrett summarizes their arguments, “children often move across state lines or are born outside their parents' State of residence.” Thus, a “‘patchwork injunction' would prove unworkable, because it would require [the states] to track and verify the immigration status of the parents of every child, along with the birth State of every child for whom they provide certain federally funded benefits.”

In any event, Barrett does not ultimately say whether she finds this argument persuasive, instead concluding that “the lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate” in future proceedings. So the holding of CASA seems to be that universal injunctions should be rare, but they are permissible in some cases, including, possibly, this case.

During the Biden administration, MAGA-aligned federal judges in Texas routinely handed down nationwide injunctions on highly dubious grounds. Indeed, this practice so frustrated Biden's Justice Department that, even after Trump won the 2024 election, Biden's solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, filed a brief asking the justices to limit their use. 

The best argument against these broad orders is that they place too much power in individual judges, and in plaintiffs who can often shape which judge hears their case. As Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a 2020 opinion, “there are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges.”In a world with nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs can shop around for the one judge in America who is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause, and potentially secure a court order that no other judge would hand down.

The most immediate beneficiary of Friday's decision is Trump, who will now get some relief from nationwide injunctions. And it's notable that the Republican-controlled Supreme Court waited until a Republican was in the White House before cracking down. Nevertheless, the decision in CASA should also benefit future Democratic administrations, assuming that the GOP-controlled Court applies it fairly to presidents of both parties.

As mentioned above, Barrett leaves the door open to a nationwide injunction in this very case. She also suggests that opponents of Trump's anti-citizenship order can bring a class action and obtain relief very similar to a nationwide injunction, although plaintiffs seeking to bring class actions must clear additional procedural bars.

The Court, in other words, resolved very little. It appears that nationwide injunctions are still allowed, at least some of the time. And they might even be allowed in this very case.

The world's war on child death was going well. Then RFK Jr. came along.

The deadliest country in the world for young children is South Sudan — the United Nations estimates that about 1 in 10 children born there won't make it to their fifth birthday. 

But just a hundred years ago, that was true right here in the United States: Every community buried about a tenth of their children before they entered kindergarten. That was itself a huge improvement over 1900, when fully 25 percent of children in America didn't make it to age 5. Today, even in the poorest parts of the world, every child has a better chance than a child born in the richest parts of the world had a century ago.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

How did we do it? Primarily through vaccines, which account for about 40 percent of the global drop in infant mortality over the last 50 years, representing 150 million lives saved. Once babies get extremely sick, it's incredibly hard to get adequate care for them anywhere in the world, but we've largely prevented them from getting sick in the first place. Vaccines eradicated smallpox and dramatically reduced infant deaths from measles, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and tetanus. And vaccines not only make babies likelier to survive infancy but also make them healthier for the rest of their lives. 

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., unfortunately, disagrees. President Donald Trump's secretary of health and human services (HHS), a noted vaccine skeptic who reportedly does not really believe the scientific consensus that disease is caused by germs, recently announced the US will pull out of Gavi, an international alliance of governments and private funders (mainly the Gates Foundation) that works to ensure lifesaving vaccinations reach every child worldwide. His grounds? He thinks Gavi doesn't worry enough about vaccine safety (he does not seem to acknowledge any safety concerns associated with the alternative — dying horribly from measles or tuberculosis).The Trump administration had already slashed its contribution to Gavi as part of its gutting of lifesaving international aid programs earlier this year, leaving any US contributions in significant doubt. But if Kennedy's latest decision holds, it now appears that the US will contribute nothing to this crucial program.

The US is one of many funders of Gavi, historically contributing about 13 percent of its overall budget. In 2022, we pledged $2.53 billion for work through 2030, a contribution that Gavi estimates was expected to save about 1.2 million lives by enabling wider reach with vaccine campaigns.

That's an incredibly cost-effective way to save lives and ensure more children grow into healthy adults, and it's a cost-effective way to reduce the spread of diseases that will also affect us here in the US. Diseases don't stay safely overseas when we allow them to spread overseas. Measles is highly contagious, and worldwide vaccination helps keep American children safe, too. Tuberculosis is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder and more expensive to treat, and widespread vaccination (so that people don't catch it in the first place) is the best tool to ensure dangerous new strains don't develop. 

It is genuinely hard to describe how angry I am about the casual endangerment of more than a million people because Kennedy apparently thinks measles vaccines are more dangerous than measles is. The American people should be furious about it, too. If other funders aren't able to cover the difference, an enormous number of children will pointlessly die because the US secretary of health and human services happens to be wildly wrong about how diseases work. 

But the blame won't end with him. It will also fall on everyone else in the Trump administration, and on the senators who approved his appointment in the first place even when his wildly wrong views were widely known, for not caring enough about children dying to have objected. 

Kennedy, it's worth noting, is not even a long-standing Trump loyalist. He's a kook who hitched his wagon to the Trump train a few months before the election. He doesn't have a huge constituency; it wouldn't have taken all that much political courage for senators to ask for someone else to lead HHS. A lot of his decisions are likely to kill people — from his decision to ban safe, tested food dyes and instead encourage the use of food dyes some people are severely allergic to because they're “natural” to his courtship of American anti-vaxxers and his steps to undermine accurate guidance on American child vaccination.

Trump could still easily override Kennedy on Gavi, if Trump cared about mass death. But if it holds, pulling out of Gavi is likely to be Kennedy's deadliest decision — at least so far. He reportedly may not believe that AIDS is caused by HIV, either, and he can surpass the death toll of this week's decision if he decides to act on that conviction by gutting our AIDS programs in the US and globally. 

But whether or not the Gavi withdrawal is the deadliest, it certainly stands out for its sheer idiocy. (The Gates Foundation is going to heroic lengths to close the funding gap, and individual donors matter, too: You can donate to Gavi here.)

None of this should have been allowed to happen. Since Kennedy's confirmation vote in the Senate passed by a narrow margin with Mitch McConnell as the sole Republican opposing the nomination, every single other Republican senator had the opportunity to prevent it from happening — if they were willing to get yelled at momentarily for demanding that our health secretary understand how diseases work. 

I am glad the United States does not have the child mortality rates of South Sudan. I'm glad that even South Sudan does not have the child mortality rates of our world in 1900. I'm glad the United States participated in the worldwide eradication of smallpox, and I was glad that we paid our share toward Gavi until the Trump administration slashed funding earlier this year. I'm even glad that mass death is so far in our past that it's possible for someone to be as deluded about disease as Kennedy is. 

But I am very, very sick of seeing the greatest achievements of our civilization, and the futures of a million children, be ripped to shreds by some of the worst people in politics — not because they have any alternative vision but because they do not understand what they are doing.

The Endangered Species Act has a major problem. This unlikely move could help save it.

In the early 1900s, long before smartphones and selfie sticks, tourists flocked to Yellowstone National Park — not for the geysers or scenery, but for a grotesque show: A nightly spectacle of grizzly bears raiding cafeteria scraps from open-pit landfills like desperate, starving pirates. 

The bears were in dangerous proximity to humans: Hungry bears tore at open car windows. Tourists posed a little too close with their film cameras. Yellowstone park rangers logged dozens of injuries each year — nearly 50 on average.

Eventually, the Park Service ended the nightly landfill shows: feeding wild animals human food wasn't just dangerous, it was unnatural. Bears, ecologists argued, should eat berries, nuts, elk — not leftover Twinkies. In 1970, the park finally shut down the landfills for good. 

By then, though, grizzlies were in deep trouble. As few as 700 remained in the lower 48 states, down from the estimated 50,000 that once roamed the 18 Western states. Decades of trapping, shooting, and poisoning had brought them to the brink. The ones that clung to survival in Yellowstone National Park learned to take what scraps they could get and when they were forced to forage elsewhere, it didn't go so well. 

More bears died. Their already fragile population in the Yellowstone region dipped to fewer than 250, though one publication says the number could have been as low as 136, according to Frank van Manen, who spent 14 years leading the US Geological Survey's grizzly bear study team and now serves as an emeritus ecologist.

The Yellowstone bears had been trained to rely on us. And when we cut them off, their population tanked.

And so in 1975, the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed grizzly bears on the endangered species list, the country's most powerful legal mechanism to stave off extinction. 

The grizzly's place on the list afforded them some important protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Hunting was off limits, as was trapping or poisoning, and the listing included rigorous habitat protections. Grizzlies slowly came back.

Today, more than 1,000 grizzly bears live in and around Yellowstone alone, and tourists who visit the park by the millions every year can observe the bears — no longer desperately feeding on trash but lumbering in and out of meadows with their trailing cubs, or sitting on their haunches feasting on elk carcasses. 

The recovery effort was a major success, but it's brought a whole new slate of issues. 

In recent years, grizzlies have spilled out of their stronghold in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem — a broad swath of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming — and into human territory, where coexistence gets messy. In 2024 alone, more than 60 grizzlies were killed in Wyoming, most of them lethally removed by wildlife officials after killing cattle, breaking into cabins and trash cans, or lingering in residential neighborhoods.

It's the classic species recovery paradox: the more bears succeed and their populations expand, the more trouble they get into with humans. 

And now, a controversial debate rages over whether or not to delist the grizzly bear. No species is meant to be a permanent resident on the Endangered Species List. The whole point of the ESA is to help species recover to the point where they're no longer endangered. A delisting would underscore that the grizzlies didn't just scrape by in the Yellowstone area — they exceeded every population requirement in becoming a thriving, self-sustaining population of at least 500 bears.

But to remove federal protection would mean grizzly bears would face increasing threats to their survival at a time when some biologists argue the species' recovery is shaky at best. 

The stakes here are bigger than just the grizzly bear alone — what happens next is about proving that the ESA works, and that sustained recovery is possible, and that ESA protection leads to progress. Because if a species like the grizzly, which has met every biological benchmark, still can't graduate from the list, then what is the list for?

“The [ESA] is literally one of the strictest wildlife protection laws in the world…but in order for people to buy into it, they have to have respect for it,” says Kelly Heber Dunning, a University of Wyoming professor who studies wildlife conflict. “If it starts to be seen as…part of the culture war, that buy-in will go away.”

Since President Donald Trump has taken office, the Republican Party's assault on the Endangered Species Act hasn't been subtle. 

The Fix Our Forests Act — which sounds like it attempts a wildfire and forest health solution — actually fast-tracks large-scale logging at the expense of fragile ecosystems and imperiled species. Trump allies in Congress, like Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert with the Pet and Livestock Protection Act, flagrantly prioritize political agendas over science, according to the nonprofit National Resources Defense Council. The House Natural Resources Committee has also suggested weakening the Marine Mammal Protection Act with an apparent intent to unravel protections for species like the North Atlantic right whale and the Gulf of Mexico Rice's whale. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has called to remove “burdensome regulations” standing in the way of Trump's desire to unleash America's energy potential. Project 2025, the conservative playbook, even explicitly calls to delist the grizzly bear. 

But ironically, to prevent a full unraveling of one of the world's most powerful protections for wildlife and wild places, conservationists need to grapple with the mission creep of the ESA.

When Republican President Richard Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the country's wildlife had been in a century-long nosedive. After decades of habitat destruction, unregulated hunting and industrial expansion, federal officials had already flagged more than 70 species at risk of extinction — with many more lining up behind them.

In the decades that followed, the ESA proved to be one of the most powerful conservation tools in the world. More than 50 species, including the Canada goose and bald eagle, thrived with their newfound federal protections and were later delisted; another 56 species were downgraded from endangered to threatened. But others, like the black-footed ferret, Houston toad and the red wolf, for example, remain endangered — even after almost 60 years of federal attention.

Today the act protects more than 2,300 plant and animal species in the US and abroad. And still more wait in line, as overworked federal biologists triage petitions amid dwindling resources, aggressive layoffs and budget cuts. 

But when it comes to the grizzly bear, the debate has become bigger than just biology — it's become a referendum on what the Endangered Species Act is for, says David Willms, a National Wildlife Federation associate vice president and adjunct faculty at the University of Wyoming. 

“The ESA is a science-based act,” he says. “You have a species that is struggling, and you need to recover it and make it not struggle anymore. And based on the best available science at the end of the day, you're supposed to delist a species if it met those objectives.”

The Endangered Species Act is at odds with President Donald Trump's plan to “unleash American energy.” His administration has even proposed to rescind the definition of “harm” under the ESA. But as broader attacks on the law play out, consequential battles are being waged on individual species. Read the following stories to learn more:

Black-footed ferrets: This animal is on the edge of extinction. Trump just fired the people trying to save it. 

The delta smelt: Why does Trump hate this tiny fish so much?

The dunes sagebrush lizard: The tiny lizard that will test Trump's “drill, baby, drill” agenda

Lesser prairie chicken: Trump officials are trying to yank this animal's last shot at survival

Monarch butterflies: The fate of this beloved creature is in Trump's hands

Red wolves: Less than 20 red wolves remain in the wild. We had a plan to save them.

The trouble begins when species linger on the list indefinitely, not because they haven't recovered but because of what might happen next, out of fears of possible future threats. 

But the ESA was only meant to safeguard against “reasonably foreseeable future threats,” Willms argues. Congress has the ability to protect species indefinitely — like it did for wild horses under the 1971 Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act or for numerous species of birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. But those were specific, deliberate laws. 

“If there are other reasons why somebody or groups of people think grizzly bears should be protected forever, then that is a different conversation than the Endangered Species Act,” he says. 

But this power works in the opposite direction, too. If grizzly bears stay on the list for too long, Congress may well decide to delist the species, as lawmakers did in 2011 when they removed gray wolves from the endangered species list in Montana and Idaho.

Those kinds of decisions happen when people living alongside recovered species, especially the toothy, livestock-loving kind, spend enough time lobbying their state's lawmakers, says Dunning, the wildlife conflict researcher. 

When Congress steps in, science tends to step out. A political delisting doesn't just sideline biologists, it sets a precedent, one that opens the potential for lawmakers to start cherry-picking species they see as obstacles to grazing, logging, drilling, or building. The flamboyant lesser prairie chicken has already made the list of legislative targets. 

“Right now, the idea of scientific research has lost its magic quality,” she says. “We get there by excluding people and not listening to their voices and them feeling like they're not part of the process.”

And when people feel excluded for too long, she says, the danger isn't just that support for grizzly bears will erode. It's that the public will to protect any endangered species might start to collapse.

For Dan Thompson, Wyoming's large carnivore supervisor, the question of delisting grizzlies is pretty simple: “Is the population recovered with all the regulatory mechanisms in place and data to support that it will remain recovered?” he says. “If the answer is yes, then the answer to delisting is yes.”

That's why Thompson believes it's time to delist the grizzly. And he's not alone. The Greater Yellowstone ecosystem population is “doing very well,” says van Manen. In fact, grizzlies met their recovery goals about 20 years ago. 

Getting there wasn't easy. After the landfills closed and the bear population plummeted, it took a massive, decades-long effort from states, tribes, federal biologists, and nonprofits to bring the grizzlies back. The various entities funded bear-proof trash systems for people living in towns near the national parks and strung electric fences around tempting fruit orchards. They developed safety workshops for people living in or visiting bear country, and tracked down poachers. 

And little by little, it worked. Bear numbers swelled, and by the mid-2000s, more than 600 bears roamed the Yellowstone area.

Given this success, the US Fish & Wildlife Service proposed delisting the grizzlies for the first time in late 2005. Environmental groups sued, arguing bears needed continued federal protection as whitebark pine, an important food source, diminished. Bears could starve, groups maintained, and their populations could plummet again. But a subsequent federal study of what, exactly, grizzly bears eat, found that while grizzlies do munch whitebark pine seeds during bumper years, they don't depend on the trees to survive. In fact, grizzlies consume no fewer than 266 species of everything from bison and mice to fungi and even one type of soil.

“Grizzly bears are incredibly opportunistic and use their omnivorous traits to shift to other food sources,” says van Manen. So losing one food — even a high-calorie one — did little to change the population.

The move to delist them paused as the federal government addressed the federal court's concerns, including researching the grizzly bear's diet. 

And bear numbers kept climbing. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service — under President Barack Obama — updated delisting requirements including more expansive habitat protections, stricter conflict prevention, and enhanced monitoring. The agency then proposed a delisting. The following year — under Trump — it delisted the grizzly bear. 

This time the Crow Indian Tribe sued and — determining in part that delisting grizzlies in the Yellowstone region threatened the recovery of other populations of grizzlies — a federal judge overturned the government's decision to delist the bears and placed them back on the list. In 2022, Wyoming petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to delist bears in the Yellowstone region. The service took a few years to analyze the issue, and then this January, days before the Biden administration ended, it issued a response to that petition: Grizzly bears would stay on the Endangered Species List. 

All of these years of back and forth reflected the change in how the federal government viewed the grizzly population, largely a result of the bear's own success. The Yellowstone region's bears, they argued, are no longer distinct from bear populations in northern Montana, Idaho, and Washington. And because northern populations haven't met the recovery benchmarks yet (with the exception of a population in and around Glacier National Park), the species as a whole is not yet recovered.

But the goalposts for delisting grizzlies keep moving, Thompson told Vox.

Grizzly bears would still be managed even after a delisting. States would be responsible for them, and — miracle of miracles — state and federal agencies actually agreed on how to manage grizzlies after ESA protections end. 

Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana are committed to maintaining between 800 and 950 grizzly bears if the creature ever leaves the endangered species list. And states like Wyoming know how to manage grizzly bears because for years, under the supervision of the feds, they've been doing the gritty, ground-level work. Wyoming's wildlife agency, for example, traps and relocates conflict bears (or kills problem bears if allowed by the Fish and Wildlife Service), knocks on doors to calm nervous landowners, hands out bear spray, and reminds campers not to cook chili in their tents. 

Despite all that, “nobody trusts us,” Thompson, with Wyoming's state wildlife agency, said. “There's always going to be a way to find a reason for [grizzlies] not to be delisted.”

Even though grizzly bears may be thriving in numbers, they're not ready to go it alone, says Matt Cuzzocreo, interim wildlife program manager for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition Grizzlies. 

The Greater Yellowstone Coalition has spent millions of dollars over the past few decades helping bears and humans more successfully coexist. But whatever comes next needs to build on the past 50 years of working with locals. As bears expand into new territory, they're crossing into areas where residents aren't used to securing garbage and wouldn't know how to respond to 600-pound predators ambling down back roads or into neighborhoods. 

Simply removing bears from the list and handing management to the states, which is the default after a species delisting, isn't enough, says Chris Servheen — not when so much is still in flux. Servheen, who led the Fish and Wildlife Service's recovery program for 35 years, helped write the previous two recovery plans. He says a delisting could leave them dangerously exposed. 

“Politicians are making decisions on the fate of animals like grizzly bears and taking decisions out of the hands of biologists,” Servheen says. 

Montana and Idaho, Servheen points out, already allow neck-snaring and wolf trapping just outside Yellowstone's borders — traps that also pose a lethal threat to grizzlies. And now, the Trump administration has slashed funding for the very biologists and forest managers tasked with protecting wildlife.

Once states take over, many are expected to push for grizzly hunting seasons, and some, like Wyoming, have already set grizzly bear hunting regulations for when the creatures are no longer protected. Layer that on top of existing threats — roadkill, livestock conflicts, illegal kills — and it's easy to imagine a swift population slide.

“It's a perfect storm for grizzlies,” Servheen says. “We're seeing attacks on public land agencies, the sidelining of science, predator-hostile politicians muscling into wildlife decisions, and relentless pressure from private land development. Walking away from the grizzly now — after all we've invested — just feels like the worst possible timing.”

Nike shoppers may need to save a little more for that next pair of running shoes.

The company is hiking prices for US customers to offset an expected $1 billion cost increase from tariffs, Nike told investors on Thursday.

""These tariffs represent a new and meaningful cost headwind,"" CFO Matthew Friend said as the company reported earnings for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. 

The company is making a ""surgical price increase"" in the US with a ""phased implementation"" that would begin in the fall, Friend said. He didn't expand on what products would be affected or by how much.

Price checks suggest the cost of some Nike products has already increased this year. In May, BMO Capital analysts said they observed price increases of $5 to $10 on the Nike website.

During Thursday's earnings call, Friend outlined a four-part strategy — including the price increases — to mitigate the $1 billion tariff costs, beginning with diversifying its sourcing and allocating production across countries.

Nike said 16% of the footwear it imports to the US comes from China. It expects that share to drop to the high single digits by the end of fiscal year 2026.

It also plans to work with suppliers and retail partners to minimize the impact of tariffs on consumers. Friend told investors that these arrangements will go into effect throughout fiscal 2026.

He also said the company would ""evaluate corporate cost reduction.""

Nike's revenue for its 2025 fiscal year fell 10% year over year to about $46 million, the company reported Thursday. However, it beat Wall Street's modest expectations for quarterly sales and profit and said it expects the declines to moderate looking ahead. It expects the tariff impact to be greatest in the first half of its 2026 fiscal year.

CEO Elliott Hill took the helm of Nike about eight months ago. He's been trying to get the company back on track by slashing promotional sales, improving its wholesale relationships with major retailers, and putting sports at the forefront of its strategy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm the CEO of the largest superyacht firm in the world. I start my days commuting from France to Monaco and end with a family jam session.","https://www.businessinsider.com/day-in-the-life-superyacht-ceo-anders-kurten-monaco-2025-6","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 09:05:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anders Kurtén, the 54-year-old CEO of Fraser Yachts, based in Monaco. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I became the CEO of Fraser Yachts in 2023. We're the world's largest yacht brokerage with dual headquarters in Monaco and Fort Lauderdale.

I've been told I was carried aboard my grandfather's mahogany sailing boat when I was just a few months old. Growing up in Finland, our summers were spent on the Baltic Sea.

I didn't consider turning that passion into a profession at first. My career began in the mid-'90s, building websites in Finland. I then worked in New York during the dot-com boom and returned to Finland for a brief stint at Accenture.

I realized I couldn't see myself doing that for the next three or four decades. I enrolled in a wooden-boat-building school and became a boat carpenter for a few years.

BI's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine.

In the mid-2000s, I was headhunted to run a small yard manufacturing performance cruising sailboats. I then spent nearly a decade at a Nordic boat manufacturer. In 2019, I entered the superyacht industry as CEO of Baltic Yachts.

My primary role at Fraser now is serving the needs of our clients with the help of my 230 colleagues. Here's what a typical day in my life looks like.

I roll out of bed around 6 a.m., get ready, and head to the office. I live in Nice, France, but I moved here from Pietarsaari, Finland, for my role. The 22-minute trip can stretch to two hours during rush hour.

I primarily listen to business and language learning podcasts and some French news. I speak English, Finnish, French, and Swedish fluently, but I'm trying to master a few more.

I get to the office, park the car, and then go for a run. Depending on my energy level, it's either a 5K or a 10K. I generally run west, starting from Monaco harbour.

After my run, I shower at the office and grab some oatmeal and fruit for breakfast.

Once a week, I treat myself to a café au lait and a pain au chocolat at a nearby café called Bella Vita.

By 8 a.m., I'm at my desk, ready to get to work. Our office is opposite the Formula 1 circuit's La Rascasse turn. During the Monaco Grand Prix, if I had a fishing rod, I could tap the drivers on their helmets as they drive by.

My office decor is minimalist, with pictures of my wife and kids, ages 9 and 11. Our reception area showcases impressive scale models of 6-foot-long superyachts.

My mornings are for strategic work and clearing my inbox unless I'm traveling for events like the Palm Beach International Boat Show. When traveling, I rely on my team to triage incoming emails and calls.

I spend the mornings taking internal meetings and catching up with my team.

Sometimes, I might be in the middle of a meeting and then get a client call that can last 10 minutes or require me to go spend a few days touring a shipyard with the client.

Our clients are high-net-worth individuals and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Many charter our yachts for vacations, while the wealthiest among them buy vessels outright. We manage 338 superyachts, sell about 50 yachts annually, and book thousands of charter days.

There are only about 6,000 to 7,000 superyachts in the world. The most expensive residential real estate sold in the past decade went for around $200 million. Several new superyachts easily exceed that price tag.

I have a small 30-foot outboard powerboat and a 28-foot sailboat at my summer cottage in the southwest archipelago of Finland. However, I'd need more than one boat for my dream yacht.

For sailing, I'd want something like the Baltic 47 Elsa. For motor yachts, I lean toward a classic gentleman's yacht like the Feadship Santa Maria. Both would pair well with a vintage chase tender like the Monte Carlo Offshorer 32.

I eat lunch around 12:30 p.m. Most days, I grab a sandwich from one of the sandwich shops nearby and eat at my desk.

When I want to treat myself, I head next door to Quai des Artistes, a traditional French bistro where I sometimes host colleagues or clients. The food is excellent.

The afternoons get busy around 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. Monaco time, when our Florida team starts their day.

We catch up on recent developments and sync projects to ensure seamless handoffs across time zones. This global coordination is especially critical for our yacht owners' new-build projects and crewing needs.

I leave the office between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. to get home for dinner with my wife and kids. After dinner, I help the kids with homework and play music until bedtime.

I play the piano, my son plays the drums, and my daughter sings and plays the guitar. It's almost like a rock band at home.

After the kids are asleep, my wife and I unwind with Netflix. We're hooked on Nordic noir detective shows.

Depending on my workload, I might hop on a call or respond to emails from our US or Australia teams.

I usually go to bed around midnight and get about five to six hours of sleep on weeknights.

I reserve weekends for family time, unless there's a yacht show or an urgent client matter that needs my attention.

In winter, we head to the southern Alps, where our children ski competitively while my wife and I ski at a more leisurely pace. We also occasionally travel together for business trips and take short getaways to places like Florence or Northern Italy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Xiaomi says it received over 200,000 orders for a new car it priced just below Tesla's Model Y in 3 minutes","https://www.businessinsider.com/xiaomi-sold-over-200000-units-of-new-car-tesla-rival-2025-6","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 06:31:00 GMT","

Xiaomi launched a car just slightly cheaper than Tesla's Model Y, and it has already attracted hundreds of thousands of buyers.

In a Weibo post on Thursday, the Chinese smartphone and electric vehicle maker said it received over 200,000 orders for the YU7 within three minutes of its launch in Beijing.

Within an hour of the sale starting, it had more than 289,000 orders for the car, Xiaomi wrote in a second post.

The car, which starts at $35,000, is a competitor for the Model Y, China's most popular SUV, which starts at $36,760.

Xiaomi's founder and CEO, Lei Jun, repeatedly took jabs at Tesla during the launch event.

""Tesla previously said, 'Go ahead and compare,' and we at Xiaomi just won't accept defeat. Today we officially take up Tesla's invite to compare,"" Lei said on Thursday.

Tesla and CEO Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Xiaomi's stock rose 8% to a record high on Friday in Hong Kong following strong order demand. It ended the day up about 3.6% at almost 59 Hong Kong dollars.

""YU7 seems to be selling like hot cakes despite slightly higher pricing"" than estimated, Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee wrote in a note on Thursday.

""YU7's pricing is slightly below that of Tesla Model Y, but it offers much better specs/performance,"" the analysts wrote. ""Model Y is the main target of YU7, and thus we expect YU7 would be able to take market share from Model Y.""

Chinese players, including Xiaomi, BYD, the world's largest EV company by sales volume, Nio, and Xpeng, have been undercutting Tesla's prices and gaining market share in China and Europe.

The YU7 unveiling adds to the growing EV price war — and Tesla's headaches in the Chinese market.

The YU7 is Xiaomi's second car since the company entered the EV sector last year with its SU7 sedan. It is priced below Tesla's Model 3 and has sold more cars than Tesla's Model 3 in China every month since December.

It's also attracting some big-name fans in the US.

In October, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said he didn't want to give up the Xiaomi SU7 he had been driving for the past half year.

Xiaomi's stock is up 72% this year on the back of strong SU7 sales, continued success in the smartphone market, and the addition of home appliances to its product offering.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding is in full swing. See photos of their multiday celebration in Venice.","https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-photos-2025-6","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:33:00 GMT","

What starts with a foam party and ends with ""I do""? Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding week, of course.

Bezos, 61, and Sánchez, 55, floated into Venice via water taxi on Wednesday for their multiday nuptials, and in the days since, celebrities have descended on the city to celebrate the couple.

Their wedding has been a long time coming, as the billionaire and former journalist first went public with their relationship in 2019 and got engaged in 2023.

From local protests to celebrity sightings, it's already been an eventful week.

Take a look at photos of Bezos and Sánchez's wedding so far.

The public got their first glimpse of the bride and groom when photographers snapped shots of the couple making their way to the Aman Venice hotel via a transport boat.

Although they officially arrived in Venice on Wednesday, the couple appeared to be celebrating early. On Sunday, Bezos and Sánchez were photographed hosting a foam party on his superyacht Koru off the coast of Croatia, though it wasn't clear if the event was related to their wedding.

Bezos and Sánchez were all smiles as they waved to photographers, seemingly unbothered by the demonstrators who took to the streets of Venice to protest their wedding in the days ahead of their nuptials.

The five-star hotel is in the Palazzo Papadopoli in Venice, and it offers both views of the water and private gardens.

Rather than wearing bridal white, Sánchez exited the boat in a form-fitting black dress and black sunglasses.

The couple has kept details of their festivities under wraps.

However, luxury wedding planners told Business Insider that the nuptials would likely cost eight figures and that no detail would be overlooked.

Bezos and Sanchez invited around 200 people to their wedding, and the list is full of celebrities, politicians, and business owners.

Their A-list attendees arrived in waves throughout the week, with many being photographed leaving the Venice airport via water taxi.

For instance, Ivanka Trump and her family arrived in Venice on Tuesday, while Kris Jenner's longtime partner Corey Gamble and billionaire Barry Diller arrived on Wednesday.

When they left the Aman on Wednesday evening, the couple paused to wave to the public before jetting off in a water taxi.

Bezos wore a dark suit with a cream T-shirt and sunglasses, while Sánchez donned another black look. Her form-fitting gown had one shoulder, and silver embellishments covered the dress in a pattern of diagonal stripes.

Before she entered the seating area of the boat, Sánchez blew a kiss to those around her, showing off a massive diamond ring on her right hand.

She wore her 30-carat engagement ring on her left hand and carried a black clutch.

Kim Kardashian was photographed greeting Orlando Bloom. She arrived with Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner in tow.

The Kardashian family has become close to Sánchez in recent years, and Jenner and Kim Kardashian both attended Sánchez's bachelorette party in May.

Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King were spotted waiting for a water taxi after taking Winfrey's private jet to Venice, as many of the wedding's attendees did. King notably went to space with Sánchez in April.

Tom Brady and Queen Rania of Jordan were also photographed arriving on Thursday, as was Domenico Dolce, the cofounder of Dolce & Gabbana, a brand Sánchez has frequently worn to public events.

Bezos wore a charcoal suit with no tie and sunglasses, creating a dressy and relaxed look.

Sánchez donned a Schiaparelli dress for the occasion. The midi-length gown featured intricate floral embroidery on the strapless neckline and skirt, while the form-fitting bodice was sparkly and cinched at her waist. Sánchez wore her hair in a high ponytail with beachy waves.

The couple waved to the public again as they left the Aman on Thursday evening, both smiling for photos.

They also kissed each other as photographers captured them leaving the Aman.

The longtime friends walked together to a taxi boat, wearing sunglasses and printed dresses.

Winfrey's maroon dress had daring cutouts on the waist.

Like Bezos, Bloom wore a suit with no tie for Thursday's gathering.

His suit was khaki-colored, and his shirt was white.

Bezos, Sánchez, and their guests arrived at the medieval church on Thursday evening.

The couple walked through the area hand in hand, surrounded by security and a team of photographers.

Jenner, Gamble, and the Kardashian sisters shared a water taxi to Thursday night's gathering.

Jenner took a photo of her daughters on the boat, who both raised their hands in peace signs as they floated along the canal. Gamble sipped on a drink and adjusted his lapel.

For instance, Usher and his wife, Jennifer Goicoechea, were photographed enjoying a boat ride.

Goicoechea snapped a photo as the singer posed with the city behind him.

Sydney Sweeney, who attended Bezos and Sánchez's event on Thursday, was photographed walking through the city in an all-black ensemble.

Bill Gates and Paula Hurd were also spotted sightseeing in Venice on Friday.

Tommy Hilfiger escorted his wife, Dee Ocleppo, through the city, and she carried a large bag from Hermès as they strolled.

Sánchez was spotted sans Bezos on Friday afternoon, leaving the Aman in a retro white set, headscarf, and sunglasses.

She took a water taxi to San Giorgio Maggiore, an island where Friday's event is expected to take place.

Bezos boarded a water taxi in a black tuxedo, which he paired with a black bow tie and sunglasses.

He grinned and waved at the crowd as he entered the vessel.

Chip Wars:

China's main chip investment fund is planning to focus on the country's key shortcomings in sectors like lithography and semiconductor design software, adjusting its approach to better overcome US efforts to stop its technological advances.

The third phase of the state-backed National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, better known as Big Fund III, will focus on backing local companies and projects in areas considered bottlenecks to technological advances, people familiar with the matter said. That includes lithography systems, where Dutch firm ASML Holding NV dominates, and chip design tools, an arena controlled by US companies Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

A chunk of its trillion-dollar valuation is tied to building truly autonomous vehicles and monetizing the technology. The Austin rollout must deliver.

Tesla's robotaxi squares off with Waymo's autonomous ride.

Photographer: Eli Hartman

Unlike us mere mortals, time is usually on Tesla Inc.'s side. The launch of its robotaxi service this week has inverted that, and at a moment of particular weakness for the company.

When it comes to Tesla's push for dominance in autonomous vehicles, the handful of Model Y robotaxis now offering paid rides in Austin represents a milestone. But it is also a millstone because of how Tesla is doing autonomy and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's long history of overpromising on its capabilities. Tesla's pitch is that the vehicles it sells already have the hardware needed to be robotaxis and that its self-driving software, trained on a vast fleet of existing cars driven by unpaid beta testers, can handle virtually any situation. Yet the Austin launch has been defined less by its boundless potential and more by its boundaries, operating in a limited area, with invite-only customers and a “safety monitor” in each vehicle.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued Fox News on Friday, seeking damages of at least $787 million from the conservative network for allegedly defaming him by making misleading comments about a phone call with President Donald Trump.

""No more lies,"" Newsom wrote in a tweet that announced his lawsuit, which the Democrat filed in Superior Court in Delaware, where Fox News is incorporated.

The monetary damages Newsom is seeking almost exactly match what Fox Corp., Fox News, and other Fox cable networks agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems in April 2023 to settle a Delaware lawsuit alleging they defamed Dominion by falsely claiming its machines swayed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election against Trump.

Newsom's suit is focused on comments by Fox News anchor Jesse Waters, who had said Newsom lied about not having a call with Trump on a certain day in early June.

The suit alleges that Fox News was motivated to ""lie and distort on behalf of the President,"" who has been engaged in a feud with the governor over the deployment of California National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.

It also accuses Fox of harboring ""significant ill will toward Governor Newsom because he is a strong champion of progressive values and an articulate voice fighting the radical Fox News agenda.""

Newsom's lawyers, in a letter Friday to Fox News, said that the governor is prepared to voluntarily dismiss his lawsuit ""if Fox News retracts the claim that he lied when speaking about President Trump not calling him on June 9.""

The letter also demands a ""formal on-air apology"" from Watters and Fox News in exchange for dismissal of the suit.

 ""If Fox News wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump's behalf, it should face consequences -- just like it did in the Dominion case,"" Newsom said in a statement.

""I believe the American people should be able to trust the information they receive from a major news outlet. Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.""

Fox News, in a statement, said, ""Gov. Newsom's transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him.""

""We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed,"" the network said.

Newsom's suit says the governor and Trump spoke for about 16 minutes during a call late June 6, or early June 7, depending on the time zone.

""The contents of that conversation are not germane to this matter, but at no point did President Trump raise the demonstrations in Los Angeles which had begun that day, nor discuss the National Guard,"" the suit says. 

""And when Governor Newsom attempted to discuss the situation in Los Angeles, President Trump steered the topic away.""

The suit notes that days later, on June 10, Trump at a press briefing in the Oval Office told reporters that he last spoke to Newsom ""a day ago."" 

The president said he had called the governor ""to tell him, got to do a better job, he's doing a bad job. Causing a lot of death and a lot of potential death.""

Newsom, after learning of Trump's claim, denied there had been a call on that day, much less that they discussed the situation in Los Angeles.

""There was no call. Not even a voicemail,"" Newsom wrote in a post on the social media site X.

Hours after Trump made his claim on June 10, the suit notes, Watters, during an episode of ""Jesse Watters Primetime,"" played an edited clip of Trump that removed the president's claim that he spoke to Newsom ""a day ago."" 

Watters then reported that Newsom had said there was no phone call.

Watters then noted that Fox News host John Roberts had received Trump's call logs, which showed the president and the governor last spoke on June 6 or 7.

""Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him?"" Watters asked. ""Why would he do that?""

A chyron that played on Watters' show said ""Gavin Lied About Trump's Call,"" the suit notes.

The suit says, ""Rather than leave the matter alone, or simply provide the facts, Fox News chose to defame Governor Newsom, branding him a liar.""

""Recognizing that President Trump was not correct, yet wanting to curry favor with the President, Fox News willfully distorted the facts,"" the suit says.

Americans are tightening their belts, as concerns about tariffs, inflation, job security and market volatility have prompted many consumers to pare back their spending and increase their savings, financial experts say.

The U.S. personal saving rate — the percentage of disposable income that U.S. households save, after they pay taxes and spend money — has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data released Friday. That is slightly down from 4.9% in April, but up significantly from 3.5% in December.

Some consumers may be changing their financial habits from so-called ""revenge spending"" — the trend of splurging after the pandemic — to ""revenge saving,"" as they focus more on building savings and spending less. ""No buy"" challenges are going viral on social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit, as consumers vow to limit their discretionary spending, cut back on subscriptions and travel, and rebuild their savings. 

Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.

A recent Vanguard survey found 71% of Americans polled plan to shift their savings approach this summer to prioritize emergency savings and flexibility.

Financial advisors typically recommend consumers aim to set aside three to six months' worth of living expenses as a cash cushion. But you might benefit from having more in some circumstances; for example, if you're a one-income household or your pay is variable, experts say.

Having ample cash reserves improves overall financial wellbeing, according to Vanguard researchers.

""American workers are spending, on average, nearly seven hours each and every week thinking about their finances,"" said Dina Caggiula, head of participant experience at Vanguard. ""But if you have sufficient emergency savings, we can cut that number nearly in half.""

Several factors are prompting consumers to be cautious and cut back, including fluid tariff negotiations, the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates lingering at higher levels longer than some expected, financial advisors and researchers say. Many Americans are also concerned about geopolitics and social unrest.

Some of the ""revenge savings"" trend is consumers wanting to amass cash to help shield themselves from unexpected cost increases in the future. 

""This may be a lot of just defensive behavior or anticipatory behavior. I may not need the money today, but I'm going to get access to that money in case I need it a few months down the road,"" said Charlie Wise, senior vice president and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.

Workers are also increasing the share of pay they contribute to retirement savings plans, which has boosted the 401(k) savings rate to a record high.

A recent report from Fidelity, the nation's largest 401(k) provider, found 401(k) savings rates hit a record high in the first quarter of 2025, with a contribution rate of 9.5%. When you add matching contributions from employers, the savings rate for those plans rises to 14.3%, edging closer to Fidelity's recommended retirement savings rate of 15% a year. 

Meanwhile, another report from Vanguard shows the average savings rate for employee deferrals was 7.7% in 2024, matching record-high levels from the previous year. More retirement plans are making it easier for workers to enroll and contribute through automatic enrollment and automatic escalation features.

""If you get money automatically out of people's paychecks, kind of the same way taxes come out of people's paychecks, if we can do that, most people end up saving a very high percentage of their income,"" said Jeff Schneble, CEO of Human Interest, a San Francisco-based firm that helps small companies set up 401(k) services. 

Correction: Human Interest is based in San Francisco. An earlier version misstated where the firm is located.

In this article

Tesla's June launch of its long-awaited ""robotaxi"" requires a lot of qualifiers: it was supervised, open only to a few invitees and included somewhere between 10-20 vehicles.

The stock jumped 8% the day after the launch, and some participants and observers called it a success. The shares have largely given back that gain since then.

""I thought it was extremely smooth. Everything we saw,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. ""Not just from a safety perspective. Maneuverability was way impressive. I thought actually even better than Waymo out of the gates. I thought going into it was going to be an eight out of 10. I think it's a 10 out of 10 relative to our experience.""

Other experiences were less smooth: One vehicle drove on the wrong side of the road, one vehicle stopped in the middle of traffic, one braked suddenly on a 40 mph street and another vehicle dropped off a passenger in the middle of an intersection.

""What Tesla put out this past Sunday is not a robotaxi,"" said analyst Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research in note published Thursday. ""It is a robotaxi infant that requires constant supervision to stop it from injuring itself or others.""

Since 2016, CEO Elon Musk has been promising that Tesla vehicles were on the cusp of full autonomy.

Tesla's Master Plan, Part Deux, envisioned a future where every Tesla owner would be able to ""add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost.""

He said in October of that year that all Tesla vehicles would have the hardware necessary for full self-driving.

In 2019, he said Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020.

So far, none of these predictions have come true. And many researchers and rivals have disputed Musk's claim that Teslas already have all the hardware needed for full autonomy.

The electric car maker is taking a very different path from every other major company working toward fully self-driving vehicles. It does not use radar or lidar — laser-based devices that map the environment around the vehicle.

Companies like Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox each use both radar and lidar. Tesla, in contrast, primarily uses cameras. Musk has said he thinks software can make up the difference.""Inside the autonomous vehicle industry, I think the thing that's both frustrating and just puzzling is that, you know, everyone seems to be on the same page,"" said Ed Niedermeyer, a journalist who has covered Tesla for years and who wrote a book on the company. ""You talk to almost any major expert and they'll say, you know, what Tesla is doing is interesting. It's pushing the technology forward in certain ways. Right? It's like teaching a dog to drive. If you can teach a dog to drive a little ways, that's super impressive. Does that mean you're going to build a business around dogs driving taxis? No.""

The other key difference is Tesla has long been promoting what Niedermeyer calls a ""general solution"" to full self-driving. That means every Tesla will be able to drive itself under all circumstances anywhere in the world.

This is pretty much what Musk said in Tesla's second Master Plan, ""When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere.""

This presents tremendous technical challenges.

""If your operating domain is the whole world, how do you ever get enough miles to know that you've covered everything that you're ever going to see in all the conditions that exist out there in the world?"" Niedermeyer said.

Everyone else is taking the Waymo route — deploying fleets of vehicles to a small contained area like parts of Austin, Texas, Phoenix and San Francisco.

The fact that Tesla chose to only deploy robotaxis in a section of Austin, rather than let them roam everywhere, is one reason why Niedermeyer said the company is kind of proving that Waymo is taking the more feasible approach.

""It's funny because Tesla wants Austin to be the show, the performance that shows, 'hey, like, we're doing this, we can do driverless, right?'"" he said. ""But really what it's showing is, well, Waymo kind of had it right all along.""

Musk still has fans and believers.

""Tesla is the future,"" said Darko Protich, an Austin resident who CNBC spoke with at a local coffee shop.

Protich said he has owned a few Tesla vehicles and has ridden in similar autonomous vehicles from Waymo, which he said he grew to like after a bit of apprehension. He has also ridden in robotaxi-like cars in China, and has less confidence in those.

""They're not as safe,"" Protich said. ""They're smaller. But I believe in Teslas, honestly.""

Another fan is Michael Simon, from Buda, Texas.

""I just think it's amazing what, what Elon is doing,"" he said. ""When I saw robotaxis were active, I was like, I want to ride.""

Neither Protich nor Simon had ridden in the initial launch models, but both said they were looking forward to the chance.

""Elon has made a huge investment in the Austin area, and if I were younger and still working, I would absolutely put in a resume for Tesla to try to go to work for them and be part of that exciting technology and the future,"" Simon said.

NATO's agreement to more than double allies' defense spending targets will rebalance Europe's trade relations with the U.S. and see the region buy more American weaponry, European Union Council President Antonio Costa told CNBC on Friday.

Earlier this week, NATO allies agreed to more than double their defense spending target from 2% of gross domestic product to 5% by 2035.

The move has solved the main trade-related issue between Europe and the United States, Costa told CNBC's Silvia Amaro.

""What we have decided to do is strengthen our position and to assume greater responsibilities in our own defense. Then I think we solved already the main issue, and then I think the path is paved to solve the other issues,"" he said.

At least some part of this higher defense expenditure will be used to ""buy American,"" according to Costa.

""And of course, if we buy more American, that means then the trade relations rebalance. Then that's the reason — because I have said always that we cannot separate these two negotiations about defense — [that this] was the most important issue for the United States, and [it] is already solved.""

Costa, who served as prime minister of Portugal up until last year, reiterated Trump's previous statements that the military agreement is a ""big win,"" adding that it effectively rebalances the burden sharing on defense.

The EU is among the trade partners rushing to strike an agreement with Washington ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's early July deadline for hiking so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from nearly all countries.

Steps toward a deal were made this week after the U.S. presented the European Commission with a new proposal. Markets were also buoyed by the Thursday announcement from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the July 8 and 9 deadlines for restarting tariffs on nations are ""not critical.""

""Perhaps it could be extended, but that's a decision for the president to make,"" Leavitt said.

When asked whether the EU could reach a deal ahead of the July deadlines, Costa said the European Commission is currently assessing the White House's trade proposal.

""Both parties are very engaged to find a solution, and I hope that we will and that we achieve this before the ninth of July,"" he said.

One of Germany's data protection watchdogs on Friday said DeepSeek's app illegally sends user data to China and asked Google and Apple to consider blocking the artificial intelligence service.

Berlin's data protection commissioner Meike Kamp said in a statement that DeepSeek's transfer of German user data to China is ""unlawful."" 

There is not a readily available way to get in touch with DeepSeek. CNBC has reached out to DeepSeek's privacy team.

Chinese firm DeepSeek made waves this year when it launched an AI model that it claimed was created at a fraction of the cost of competitors, using less advanced Nvidia chips.

The company also has its own global chatbot AI app, which has been downloaded millions of times, garnering scrutiny.

If the German case against DeepSeek progresses, it could lead to a European Union-wide ban for the app, some experts say.

""It is certainly possible that this incident could lead to an EU-wide ban because the rules that apply in Germany are the same elsewhere in the EU and also in the UK,"" Matt Holman, specialist AI and data lawyer at Cripps, told CNBC by email. There are a few steps before this would become reality, however.

""DeepSeek has not been able to convincingly demonstrate to my authority that the data of German users is protected in China at a level equivalent to that of the European Union,"" Germany's Kamp said, according to a CNBC translation. ""Chinese authorities have extensive access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies.""

Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation — the bloc's huge data protection law — companies are prohibited from sending data outside the region unless specific safeguards are in place at the countries of arrival. Those safeguards must meet GDPR requirements in Europe.

In short, the Berlin data protection commissioner is concerned that Chinese authorities could access German user data sent by DeepSeek to China.

The Berlin data watchdog on Friday said it had informed Apple and Google of DeepSeek's alleged violations and expects the U.S. tech giants to carry out a ""timely review"" about whether to ban the app or not from their respective app stores.

It's unclear if Google and Apple will comply. CNBC has reached out to both companies for comment.

Cripps' Holman said that while and EU-wide ban is possible, there needs to be consensus among the bloc's regulators first that this would be an appropriate step.

If Apple and Google remove DeepSeek from their app stores, this would effectively amount to an EU-wide ban, Holman said.

""The implications for Deepseek could be, unsurprisingly, quite stark. Access to German citizens' data will be curtailed. In short order this could expand to the remainder of the EU if other national regulators follow suits meaning EU — and potentially UK — markets will be curtailed if Apple and Google disables the app,"" Holman said.

This is not DeepSeek's first run-in with regulators in Europe. Italian data protection authorities in February ordered DeepSeek to block its app in the country. Meanwhile, Irish authorities in January asked DeepSeek for information on its data processing.

The Trump administration is readying a package of executive actions aimed at boosting energy supply to power the U.S. expansion of artificial intelligence, according to four sources familiar with the planning.

Top economic rivals U.S. and China are locked in a technological arms race, and with it secure an economic and military edge. The huge amount of data processing behind AI requires a rapid increase in power supplies that are straining utilities and grids in many states.

The moves under consideration include making it easier for power-generating projects to connect to the grid, and providing federal land on which to build the data centers needed to expand AI technology, according to the sources.

The administration will also release an AI action plan and schedule public events to draw public attention to the efforts, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Training large-scale AI models requires a huge amount of electricity, and the industry's growth is driving the first big increase in U.S. power demand in decades.

Between 2024 and 2029, U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow at five times the rate predicted in 2022, according to power-sector consultancy Grid Strategies.

Meanwhile, power demand from AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, according to a new report by consultancy Deloitte.

Building and connecting new power generation to the grid, however, has been a major hurdle because such projects require extensive impact studies that can take years to complete, and existing transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed.

Among the ideas under consideration by the administration is to identify more fully developed power projects and move them higher on the waiting list for connection, two of the sources said.

Siting data centers has also been challenging because larger facilities require a lot of space and resources, and can face zoning obstacles or public opposition.

The executive orders could provide a solution to that by offering land managed by the Defense Department or the Interior Department to project developers, the sources said.

The administration is also considering streamlining permitting for data centers by creating a nationwide Clean Water Act permit, rather than requiring companies to seek permits on a state-by-state basis, according to one of the sources.

In January, Trump hosted top tech CEOs at the White House to highlight the Stargate Project, a multi-billion-dollar effort led by ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle to build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the U.S.

Trump has prioritized winning the AI race against China and declared on his first day in office a national energy emergency aimed at removing all regulatory obstacles to oil and gas drilling, coal and critical mineral mining, and building new gas and nuclear power plants to bring more energy capacity online.

He also ordered his administration in January to produce an AI Action Plan that would make ""America the world capital in artificial intelligence"" and reduce regulatory barriers to its rapid expansion.

That report, which includes input from the National Security Council, is due by July 23. The White House is considering making July 23 ""AI Action Day"" to draw attention to the report and demonstrate its commitment to expanding the industry, two of the sources said.

Trump is scheduled to speak at an AI and energy event in Pennsylvania on July 15, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick.

Amazon earlier this month announced it would invest $20 billion in data centers in two Pennsylvania counties.

The U.S. and China have confirmed details of a trade framework that seeks to allow rare earth exports and easing of tech restrictions, according to a statement released by China's Ministry of Commerce on Friday afternoon.

China will review and approve export applications for items subject to export control rules, while the U.S. will correspondingly cancel a range of existing restrictive measures imposed against Beijing, a spokesperson for the ministry said in the statement, without elaborating.

The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday at an event in the White House that ""we just signed with China yesterday."" A White House official later clarified that the administration and China had agreed to ""an additional understanding of a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.""

Earlier this month, trade negotiation teams from both sides, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, reached an agreement on implementing the Geneva consensus after two days of high-level talks in London.

The London agreement stabilized what had become a fraught relationship, with Washington blaming China for slow-walking on relaxing rare earths curbs and Beijing criticizing the U.S. tech restrictions and student visa revocation.

While China's latest statement is ""encouraging,"" it is important to temper expectation, said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, senior advisor for the China center at think tank The Conference Board, pointing to the lack of details on which rare earth export curbs will be relaxed, other than magnets.

As both sides view the rare earths as ""a crucial bargaining chip in future negotiations,"" trade in these goods will likely remain constrained, Montufar-Helu added.

Following the initial trade meeting in Geneva in mid-May, Washington and Beijing had struck a preliminary agreement to suspend a majority of tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days and to roll back certain restrictive measures.

The Supreme Court on Friday limited federal judges from issuing universal injunctions, which had been used to block President Donald Trump from implementing his executive order ending birthright citizenship.

The 6-3 decision, which divided the conservative-majority court along ideological lines, helps clear the way for the Trump administration to push forward with its efforts to unilaterally upend long-standing U.S. citizenship rules and other major policies.

The ruling also bolsters Trump's frequent claims that his expansive use of his executive powers has been unfairly thwarted by judicial overreach.

""GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!,"" Trump wrote on social media after the opinion was released.

The case centered on nationwide injunctions that federal district court judges had granted in three separate lawsuits challenging Trump's citizenship order.

Those injunctions temporarily blocked enforcement of the order while the cases moved through the court system.

But on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that, ""Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.""

The majority granted the Trump administration's request to pause those injunctions, ""but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.""

Crucially, the court declined to rule on whether the executive order, which would end centuries of birthright citizenship in the United States, was constitutional.

""Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch,'"" Justice Amy Coney Barrett, one of three Trump appointees on the bench, wrote for the majority.

""But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,"" wrote Barrett.

""When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,"" she wrote.

In a blistering dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor decried the government's efforts to end birthright citizenship, while criticizing her conservative colleagues for ""shamefully"" permitting judicial ""gamesmanship"" by the Trump administration.

""No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,"" wrote Sotomayor in the dissent, where she was joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

""Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,"" Sotomayor wrote.

The ""patent unlawfulness"" of Trump's executive order ""reveals the gravity of the majority's error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case,"" she wrote.

""As every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land.""

In a separate, equally vehement dissent, Jackson added, ""The Court's decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.""

The bid to quash universal injunctions is essentially ""a request for this Court's permission to engage in unlawful behavior,"" Jackson, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote.

""With its ruling today, the majority largely grants the Government's wish,"" she wrote. ""But, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Nation of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to deny it.""

In this article

Hotels want guests to feel at home — but some take it too far, according to a Hotels.com survey.

The survey results, published by Expedia in March, showed that the most frowned upon behavior was walking around barefoot, with 94% of respondents deeming it inappropriate.

A close second is wearing hotel robes in the lobby (92%), followed by public displays of affection in the pool (86%), according to the survey.

Some hotels deal with these behaviors by providing subtle cues instead of a heavy-handed approach.

""I believe customers will follow the lead if you and your staff are being respectful [and] discreet,"" said Reem Arbid, co-founder of The Blue Door Kitchen & Inn.

Guests who speak loudly on their phones is another common issue, she said. Staff can politely ask guests to take the call elsewhere, she said, but ""the reaction is not always positive."" 

Gently signaling hotel protocols can encourage guests to be more mindful, she said, citing the example of staff speaking in quieter voices.

A subtle approach can also work with other forms of inappropriate behavior, such as wearing unsuitable attire, which can turn off other guests. 

""At a high-end retreat, showing up in pajamas or barefoot around shared spaces can come across as disrespectful,"" said Ariel Barrionuevo, managing director of La Coralina Island House in Panama.

To address those issues, some hotels provide etiquette guidelines in pre-arrival emails or during the check-in process.

However to some, going barefoot is more about safety than decorum, said Aidan O'Sullivan, general manager of Kilkea Castle, a resort and golf club in Ireland.

Shirts and shoes are required in all on-property restaurants, and the hotel encourages guests to be clothed while in public parts of the castle. Though some may not be dressed accordingly after a swim or spa visit, ""it is not the norm,"" he said.

Nevertheless, the hotel's 18-hole golf course still enforces stricter dress codes on the greens, and prohibits non-collared shirts and tracksuits, O'Sullivan said.

Others in the industry, however, say they are taking a more modern approach to luxury standards. 

""Whether it's PJs at breakfast, pups in beds, or kids enjoying the pool — we welcome it all,"" said Sam Jagger, managing director of The Maybourne Beverly Hills.

The hotel instead prioritizes ""respect for the safety and privacy of fellow guests and our team,"" he said. 

Mary D'Argenis-Fernandez, founder of hospitality training company MDA Hospitality Solutions, said strict dress codes are not as common as they used to be. To her, poor behavior — such as public outbursts aimed at staff members or other guests — is a bigger problem, she said.

""It's these situations, that are sometimes uncalled for, that are more concerning to those who work in the industry,"" she said, noting that team members are trained to de-escalate such situations by moving the commotion to a private area.

When disruptive behavior occurs in luxury properties, staff could be labeled the ""fun police"" simply for doing their job, said Cassandra Wheeler, who was a guest service supervisor at a Hilton hotel.

""We would just laugh, smile, and tell them to have a great day,"" she said. ""Stressed conference attendees and local weekenders sometimes treated us like personal servants.""

Another problem highlighted in the survey are guests who hog pool chairs. Some 60% of respondents say they disapprove of travelers who do this, causing some hotels to nip this behavior in the bud.

Marriott's Maui Ocean Club - Lahaina & Napili Towers only allows guests to reserve one additional chair, according to Expedia's press release on the survey. And St. George Beach Hotel & Spa Resort in Cyprus simply allocates sunbeds to guests upon arrival, it added.

Markets this week? Totally unbothered — like they're on a beach somewhere, sipping a cold drink and ignoring the headlines.

Geopolitical tensions flared (again), oil prices plunged, and defense stocks couldn't make up their mind — but the broader market? Barely blinked. The S&P 500 flirted with record highs, the Nasdaq kept cruising thanks to its AI darlings, and even small caps got in on the action. It's almost as if investors looked at the chaos and said, ""Meh, we're good.""

What's driving this chilled-out mood? Part of it is rate-cut optimism creeping back in. Oil's sudden drop took some inflation pressure off the table, and dovish murmurs from the Fed gave traders just enough hope that September could be in play for a cut. Bond yields eased, and risk appetite returned.

Sure, there are risks everywhere — from Middle East tensions to stretched valuations in some corners of the market — but right now, Wall Street seems to be in full summer mode. Cool, calm, and slightly detached.

Will it last? Hard to say. Markets have a habit of waking up just when you least expect it. But for now, they're tuning out the noise and catching rays.

Tariff pause ""could be extended.'' Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs are set to resume early July, but White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday the deadlines are ""not critical"" and will depend on the U.S. President's decision.

U.S. markets advanced Thursday. Buoyed by Leavitt's comments, the S&P 500 closed at 6,141.02, just a few points away from its intra-day high. The Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.09%. Mining and defense stocks were among the biggest gainers.

Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations is out. Omead Afshar was fired by CEO Elon Musk amid declining sales in key markets. Chinese technology company Xiaomi on Thursday priced a new electric SUV lower than Tesla's Model Y.

Nike expects a $1 billion hit from tariffs. During an earnings call on Thursday, Nike's finance chief said the company will tweak its supply chains and increase prices to ""mitigate"" that cost. Nike beat Wall Street expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.

[PRO] Three AI stocks to play. Swiss banking giant UBS highlighted three pillars of artificial intelligence that will drive demand, and picked what it thinks will be winners in the space.

— Yeo Boon Ping

How the stock market made it back to a new record — even with so much still to worry about

The S&P 500 is less than 0.1% away from closing at a new record, rebounding from a near 20% sell-off in April.

The wall of worry has been crumbling little by little over the past four months. Perhaps most importantly, as Trump backed off from the stiffest tariffs on key U.S. partners.

Corporate earnings have also held up well despite policy uncertainty. For the second quarter, the S&P 500 earnings grew by 4.9%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index, according to FactSet.

— Yun Li

U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are experiencing their longest inflow streak since December 2024, bringing in over $2.9 billion over 13 consecutive trading days, while regulatory momentum builds for other digital asset approvals within the next four months.

The ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow for June on Tuesday with $588.6 million, extending an unprecedented streak to $1.2 billion this week alone.

BlackRock's IBIT once again led inflows with $163.7 million on Thursday, while Fidelity's FBTC added $32.9 million and Bitwise's BITB attracted $25.2 million, according to Farside Investors data. 

Other major funds, including Ark's ARKB and Invesco's BTCO, reported more modest inflows, while Grayscale's GBT and several smaller ETFs saw no meaningful activity.

The sustained inflows indicate a growing institutional appetite for crypto investment products, particularly as ETF managers increasingly execute purchases through over-the-counter channels to minimize price impact. 

“ETF flows are largely driven by two types of investors: Long-only fundamental investors and basis arb traders,” Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, told Decrypt. 

But with basis arbitrage less attractive at present, Chung believes, “most of the ETF flows are driven by long-only fundamental investors.”

The 13-day stretch has brought nearly $3 billion into Bitcoin ETFs, even as Bitcoin (BTC) itself trades sideways near $107,374, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

“ETF managers can execute their purchase via OTC transactions, thus without impacting spot price too much,” Chung said. “On-chain data indicates Bitcoin held by short-term holders (less than 155 days) has fallen rapidly in the last two months, suggesting short-term traders have been selling aggressively in the market.”

While Bitcoin continues to attract institutional capital, momentum is quietly building around the next frontier of crypto investment products.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas previously told Decrypt the revised Dogecoin and Aptos ETF filings and rule changes from Bitwise reflect a “completely new attitude” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with far more consistent engagement than what issuers experienced ahead of the Bitcoin ETF approvals.

“Everything we're hearing is even more optimistic than what we heard during the Bitcoin saga,” Balchunas said on Thursday.

He forecasts better than 95% probability for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETF approvals, with 90% odds for Dogecoin authorization.

Since Bitcoin ETFs were launched 18 months ago, they've attracted over $40 billion, according to Arjun Vijay, founder of Indian crypto exchange Giottus. 

""In this cycle, there is a definite trend of Bitcoin moving from retail to institutions,"" Vijay told Decrypt. ""Retail is selling while the institutions are buying.""

Still, Ganesh Mahidhar, an investment professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt that ETF inflows are often overstated, noting that real buying is happening through treasury programs and structured products.

June 2025 – Global — The Eyes Are Always Watching, a 21,000-piece digital art collection inscribed on Bitcoin using Ordinals, is now live with over 1,000 pieces already permanently embedded on-chain. The project is free to mint and aims to create a mirror for humanity, one that lives on Bitcoin forever.

Created by the pseudonymous artist Mr. Black, the collection uses Ordinals — Bitcoin's method of assigning digital content to individual Satoshis — to ensure each artwork is immutable, decentralized, and preserved as part of the Bitcoin blockchain itself.

“Bitcoin is eternal. So is the soul. Art that lives on Bitcoin is the truest form of art, for it stays in its original state for eternity,” said Mr. Black.

The project features 21,000 unique portraits, capturing the vastness of humanity from iconic figures and cultural touchstones to quiet moments and forgotten stories. Some pieces honor those who shaped history; others challenge injustice or give voice to the unseen. With global themes and rich diversity, The Eyes Are Always Watching offers a profound reflection of our world, where every viewer can find a piece of themselves, and perhaps, something they've never seen before.

The goal: a decentralized art archive for all 8 billion people on Earth.

Unlike NFTs on traditional platforms, this collection uses Ordinals — a method that inscribes digital media directly onto Bitcoin without the need for external servers or centralized platforms. Each inscription is stored natively on the Bitcoin blockchain, offering unmatched permanence.

There is no token, no utility, and no paywall — just pure, immutable art.

Status: Live

Chain: Bitcoin

Format: Ordinals

Total Supply: 21,000 Inscriptions

Inscribed to Date: 1,000+

Cost: Free

Creator: Mr. Black (pseudonym)

Since its origin in November 2023, The Eyes Are Always Watching has been a visual protest and a spiritual statement. The project gained visibility across Rome, Jerusalem, and major U.S. cities, where mobile billboards and public installations promoted the message: Fear God, Not Man.

Most recently, the project sponsored and attended Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, engaging with the global Bitcoin community and further cementing its presence as a cultural and technological statement within the Ordinals ecosystem.

 Bit Digital's stock plummeted after announcing a $150 million share sale and a transition from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum staking. 

Former Bitcoin mining firm Bit Digital fell sharply this week, with its share price tumbling almost 19% over the five-day period to close at $1.99 on Friday, with a 15% drop in just 24 hours. 

The plunge follows major company announcements, including a $150 million public offering and a strategic pivot to Ether staking. On Thursday, the company announced a public offering of 75 million ordinary shares that is intended to raise $150 million. 

Bit Digital plans to issue the 75 million ordinary shares at $2 each. The proceeds will be used to purchase Ether (ETH), doubling down on its previous decision to shift to an Ethereum-focused company. 

After the news, the company's stock dipped to as low as $1.86 before recovering slightly during after-hours trading.

The news follows the company's decision earlier this week to ditch Bitcoin (BTC) for ETH. On Wednesday, the company revealed it would transition into a “pure-play Ethereum staking and treasury company,” focused on increasing its ETH holdings.  

The company said it had accumulated ETH for its treasury reserves and had started its staking infrastructure in 2022. It plans to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to purchase more ETH. 

As of March 31, Bit Digital held 24,434 ETH and 417 BTC, valued at around $44.6 million and $34.5 million, respectively.

When it converts all of its BTC into ETH, the company would have about 42,000 ETH, worth about $103 million at current market prices.

Investors have reacted unfavorably to the shift. Bit Digital shares dropped nearly 4% on Wednesday following the ETH pivot announcement.

Throughout the week, the company's stock prices declined by nearly 19%, going from a high of $2.40 to a low of $1.86 on Friday. Despite the reaction, the company showed no signs of stopping its move into ETH. 

Bit Digital was the 12th-largest Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization. However, since its ETH pivot, CompaniesMarketCap shows a drop to the 13th spot. The data also shows that its stock prices have declined by over 40% this year. 

Cointelegraph reached out to Bit Digital for comment but had not received a response by publication.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ethereum's price has surged above $2,500, marking a significant milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This upward movement has been driven by a combination of factors, including strong bullish sentiment and a shift in funding rates on major exchanges. However, analysts are cautioning that this rapid ascent could be followed by a short-term correction.

The recent price action in Ethereum has been characterized by a powerful spike, with the cryptocurrency decisively breaking above and re-testing the crucial $2,500 mark. This movement reflects a notable price action driven by a confluence of factors that signal strong bullish sentiment. However, caution against potential short-term volatility has also appeared as it began consolidating in the $2,400–$2,500 range.

Analysts have noted that while the current price action is bullish, there are signs of potential overheating in the market. A recent study from a CryptoQuant analyst reported a shift in funding rates on Binance, moving from negative to positive territory. This indicates that leveraged long positions are aggressively betting on a continued ETH price rise. However, this also raises concerns about the market turning into “overheating,” where further increases could precede with a short-term correction.

On-chain data presents a cautionary note, despite the recent strong price action. The data reveals that Binance witnessed an inflow of 177,000 ETH over three consecutive days. This movement of ETH onto exchanges has higher odds that some large holders may be preparing to take profits or reallocate their assets, potentially leading to selling pressure.

Even popular analyst Degen Hardy noted with caution that he will stay long on ETH as long as it remains above the $2,400 mark. As he believes in the short term, if $2400 is taken out, it will mean that bulls are struggling to reclaim untapped weekly highs. This increases the likelihood of a dip coming, as the market might aim to normalize the current overheated funding dynamics.

While a retracement might be on the horizon in the short term, the underlying long-term bullish structure of Ethereum's price appears intact. If the lower border of the consolidation zone is breached, then a short-term fall will pull ETH price to June 22nd low at $2,120. However, if the upper border is pierced, then the minimum aim is set at $2,620.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Ethereum chart signals ‘altseason' as analysts predict $10K ETH price top","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-chart-signals-altseason-as-analysts-predict-10k-eth-price-top","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

 Crypto analysts and several metrics suggest that an ""altcoin season"" will begin once Ether's price breaks new all-time highs. 

Key takeaways:

Ether's technical breakouts suggest ETH price may hit $10,000 this cycle. 

Altcoin Season Index says it's prime time to accumulate “lagging” altcoins.

Bitcoin dominance nearing 70% could trigger a full-blown altseason soon.

Ether's (ETH) technical setup suggests that the altcoin is poised for sharp price gains that could mark the start of an “altseason” over the next few weeks or months. 

Technical analysis using the Wyckoff method points to a potential Ethereum price breakout to the $3,200 mark, according to crypto analyst Mikybull.

“Ethereum is done with ‘test' on Wycoff reaccumulation schematic,” the analyst wrote in a June 26 post on X, adding:

Fellow XForceGlobal shared a similar bullish outlook for ETH, pointing out that Ethereum was “looking to shoot” to all-time highs this cycle.

The recent move to $2,800 was “objectively bullish,” backed with real-time data, the analyst said in a Thursday post on X.

An accompanying chart showed an Elliott Wave analysis projecting a possible breakout to $9,400.

Several analysts have made similar projections, targeting $10,000 and above per ETH, citing historical fractals, increased institutional demand via Ethereum ETFs, and other factors.

The Altcoin Season Index, a metric used to measure the performance of non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies (ie, altcoins) in the cryptocurrency market, suggests now is the time to get into altcoins.

“The Altcoin Season Index is flashing signs of opportunity,” founder and CEO of Alphractal, Joao Wedson, said in a June 26 post on X, adding, “Make sure you are prepared.” 

Bitcoin has outperformed altcoins over the last 60 days, with the altcoin season index in the green zone below 20%. 

Wedson explained that this is not “necessarily bad,” arguing that “it could be a great chance to accumulate altcoins while they're still lagging.”

The chart below shows that every time the index rose above 20%, it rose sharply over a short time, topping 80% as “lagging” altcoins started to outperform Bitcoin. 

Wedson said:

Bitcoin dominance—a metric measuring Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall crypto market—is one of the indicators commonly used to indicate whether the altseason has begun. It can provide traders with the overall investor sentiment and risk appetite in the market.

At the time of publication, BTC dominance is at 65.77% maintaining the uptrend, indicating that it is still “Bitcoin season.”

Historically, a “full-blown altseason” comes once Bitcoin dominance hits areas above 70% and then drops significantly, as highlighted by Mikybull Crypto.

Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital says BTC dominance is 5.5% away from revisiting the 71% level for the first time since January 2021, a move that has historically taken one to two months “after a successful retest of 64% as support.”

“Bitcoin dominance about to fall over the coming weeks,” said pseudonymous analyst The Chart Degen in a June 27 post on X, adding:

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) continues to exert significant influence over the broader cryptocurrency market, dampening the prospects of an imminent altcoin season. Despite recent market volatility and declines, a crypto analyst notes that Bitcoin Dominance remains elevated, indicating that capital is still heavily concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend suggests that any meaningful breakout for altcoins is being hindered and could persist until there is a decisive shift in market dynamics. 

According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin's market cap dominance has reached 65.72%. Both the monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings have pushed above the critical 70 level. At the time of the analysis, the RSI on the monthly timeline stood at 73.19, while the weekly registered at 70.58—both firmly in overbought territory. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin's command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. 

Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin's ongoing upward momentum. BTC.D has been climbing since late 2023. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. 

As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70—effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. 

Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. 

In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. With four days left in the weekly session, the analyst notes that the distinct candle pattern is still developing but presently resembles the classic Dragonfly Doji, characterized by a long lower wick and a close near the opening price. 

Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. However, in this case, it has emerged during a broader uptrend in BTC.D, creating a more complicated technical picture. 

Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin's growing market dominance relative to altcoins.

In this article:

A payments company backed by African political leaders has launched a blockchain-based marketplace for trading local currencies, in a bid to make it easier for companies to repatriate their profits and reduce the continent's dependence on the dollar in regional trade.

The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), a company set up by the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and endorsed by the African Union in 2019, publicly launched the exchange this week after testing it in a year-long pilot program. PAPSS partnered with Interstellar, a Cameroon-headquartered blockchain infrastructure company, to create the exchange.

Demand for the marketplace comes from international companies that do business across Africa and struggle to move money, said PAPSS chief executive Mike Ogbalu III, who spoke to Semafor on the sidelines of Afreximbank's annual meeting in Nigeria. The roughly 80 companies that trialled the service include multinational insurance companies who operate in multiple African countries and often can't access foreign exchange to repatriate their earnings, Ogbalu told Semafor.

Interstellar's CEO Ernest Mbenkum said the company plans to enable the buying and selling of regulated African currency stablecoins — like Nigeria's cNGN — on the exchange in the near future.

In this article:

Ogbalu said airlines are a key target of the marketplace, in the push to ease the process of repatriating earnings. An estimate by global airlines trade group IATA suggests more than $1 billion of their members' revenues remains trapped or blocked in Africa.

The exchange is the newest feature PAPSS has produced to fulfill its broader mandate: to create a central instant payments platform that enables transactions that begin in one African currency and end in another. It currently completes these transactions in seven seconds on average, Ogbalu said.

After a formal endorsement by African heads of state in 2019, PAPSS launched local currency instant payments across English-speaking West Africa and Guinea four years ago. Since then it has expanded to 16 countries covering other regions including North Africa. Its products are intended to underpin the African Continental Free Trade Area's (AfCFTA's) agenda of boosting intra-Africa trade. A key goal for the agenda is to end the dollar's role as the intermediary trade currency between the continent's more than 40 currencies. But at the moment, nearly half of commercial payments going out of Africa are dollar transactions, according to the SWIFT payments network.

The AfCFTA, Africa's landmark agreement that created the world's largest free trade area in 2018, is projected to unlock a $3.4 trillion market. The aim is to remove tariffs and other trade barriers to ease the movement of goods in a continent of around 1.5 billion inhabitants.

But intra-Africa trade accounted for “a paltry 14.4%” of Africa's formal trade in 2024 despite a “robust” 12.4% year-on-year rise in transaction value to $220.3 billion, Afreximbank said in a trade report published this week. Reducing transaction costs incurred in major international currencies will help to improve trade within Africa, analysts say.

While PAPSS could lower trade and currency conversion costs in Africa by $5 billion, its utility stretches beyond savings, said the AfCFTA secretary-general Wamkele Mene.

“Trading in the United States dollar or any other currency has no business between African countries,” Mene told an audience at the Afreximbank meeting. “We must use our own currencies and ensure the economic sovereignty of our continent, guarding ourselves against the ever-shifting geopolitical tensions which have an impact on payments,” he said.

Previous attempts to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments for intra-Africa trade have stumbled due to the absence of political will, said Kenneth Ugwuanyi, head of transaction banking at the United Bank for Africa Group which operates in 20 African countries. The backing of African leaders for PAPSS has given commercial banks a strong institutional basis to more easily carry out transactions within the continent, he said.

And the system appears to be benefitting the bottom line of banks adopting it. GCB Bank, Ghana's largest lender by assets, saw both its cross-border trade transactions and small and medium-scale business client base grow last year by “about 25% and a significant portion of that was driven by PAPSS,” said George Fuachie, its head of investor relations.



A marketplace for African currencies presents a chicken and egg problem because “you need more trade within Africa to boost demand for African currencies,” Amaka Anku, head of the Eurasia Group's Africa practice, told Semafor.

It remains to be seen how the exchange operates when there is no demand to match the supply of the currencies of countries that don't export much to other African countries, said Anku. “You can only have a market when there is supply to meet demand,” she said.

Codex, a new blockchain network for stablecoins that secured $16 million earlier this year from Dragonfly Capital, Coinbase, Circle Ventures, and other notable investors, has officially launched its mainnet to help make digital dollars more practical for everyday finance.

The network went live today, June 24, with native support for USDC, which means the stablecoin can move across Codex without needing a cross-chain bridge or wrapper. Per a press release shared with The Defiant, the goal of Codex is to offer a smoother way for businesses and institutions to use stablecoins just as their global capitalization has recently climbed above $250 billion.

Codex co-founder Haonan Li said in an interview with The Defiant that the project is trying to solve what he sees as the real challenge in stablecoin adoption, not blockchain speed or transaction limits, but the gap between crypto and traditional money.

“In our view, neither TPS nor latency are really the bottlenecks for stablecoin adoption today,” he said. “The real bottlenecks are all at the fiat <> crypto boundary. Blockchain teams historically have not focused on these boundary problems, they typically do not have the interest or expertise to solve these problems.”

To address this, Codex is working on licenses, partnerships with payment ramps, and banking relationships, Li says. The developers plan to roll out features like instant currency swaps, atomic off-ramps that don't leave users' money stuck due to compliance issues, and more reliable cash delivery systems in regions where existing off-ramps are slow or untrustworthy.

Codex's swap platform — called Codex Avenue — already offers trades between stablecoins and fiat, including large trades close to 1:1 pricing, the team revealed in the press release. Additional features, such as automated compliance checks and risk-free fiat delivery using validators held accountable by the network itself, are expected by late 2025.

“This is why Codex will be where the stablecoin future will happen, and why we are proud to work with stablecoin issuers such as Circle,” Li said.

When asked about on-chain privacy features, Li said Codex is working with top teams in crypto to allow some parts of transactions to stay private, while still meeting compliance standards. The chain will use new zero-knowledge and encryption tools to offer this kind of confidentiality at scale. “More to share soon,” he hinted, without diving into technical details.

While Codex launches with USDC, Li confirmed the team is planning to support all major stablecoins, including Tether's USDT and Circle's euro-backed EURC. “Codex works with all issuers. We believe the stablecoin chain of the future must provide native access to all stablecoins,” he told The Defiant, though no timeline for those integrations was specified.

Earlier this month, another stablecoin-focused blockchain, Plasma, saw overwhelming demand for participation in its $50 million token sale, while Circle's long-awaited IPO was also oversubscribed and, it turned out, undervalued — both signs of strong demand for exposure to stablecoins. As of yesterday, Circle's market cap surpassed the current circulating market cap of USDC itself.

In 2021, NFTs exploded into the public consciousness—JPEGs sold for millions, celebrities joined the fray, and everyone seemed to be minting, buying, or mocking digital art. Fast forward to now, and the conversation has shifted. Critics point to plummeting trading volumes, failed projects, and the general disappearance of the hype. “NFTs are dead,” they say.
But are they?
This article explores how NFTs are evolving from hype-driven collectibles into infrastructure-level tools for digital ownership, access, and utility—far from dead, and very much maturing.
Why NFTs Got a Bad Reputation
The backlash isn't unfounded. During the peak hype cycle:      
Many projects were launched with no utility beyond “being rare.”
Scams and rug pulls were common.
Marketplaces were flooded with low-quality, overpriced assets.
Media fixated on speculative profits, not technical innovation.
According to Web3 pioneer, entreprenuer, Alessio Vinassa, this phase was inevitable. “What we witnessed was an attention bubble—not a failure of the core technology, but a failure of how it was communicated and applied,” he explains.





Alessio Vinassa, who has helped incubate several real-world NFT utility platforms, believes that the collapse of the hype is what Web3 needed to develop and grow up. “The noise had to die so the signal could be heard.”
The Core Innovation: Verifiable Digital Ownership
At its heart, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset stored on a blockchain. Its real power lies in verifiable ownership, not collectibility.
Here's what that means in practical terms:
A musician can sell a limited edition track and prove authenticity.      
A university can issue diplomas that are tamper-proof and transferable.
A concert ticket can be verified, resold, or revoked with transparency.
A gamer can own in-game assets that persist across platforms.
“These use cases have nothing to do with speculation,” says Alessio Vinassa. “They're about efficiency, trust, and removing middlemen from digital value exchange.”
Real-World Applications Emerging Now





Beyond collectibles, NFTs are finding their footing in:
Digital identity: Self-sovereign ID systems use NFTs as portable credentials.
Event ticketing: Prevents fraud and allows creators to earn resale royalties.
Real estate: Tokenized property deeds that streamline title transfer.
Supply chains: Tracking the lifecycle of physical goods using digital twins.      
One promising area is dynamic NFTs, where metadata can change based on real-world inputs—ideal for credentials, reputation systems, or gaming progress.
Alessio Vinassa's current ventures are exploring NFTs as “access keys”—a form of digital membership for internationally gated communities, decentralized platforms, or exclusive physical experiences. “These are programmable containers of utility. We're just scratching the surface.” Related News  Breet picks Lagos trendsetter Rahman Jago to bring crypto closer to the culture  Crypto duo faces kidnapping charges in alleged bitcoin theft attempt  The 10 commandments of unleashing the Gen Z economy in your organization (Episode 2)   
Why People Still Doubt NFTs
The term “NFT” still carries baggage. Here's why:
The word is overused and often misunderstood.





Media coverage emphasized price tags over purpose.
Many consumers saw no tangible value or real use.
Alessio Vinassa acknowledges the skepticism but frames it as a design challenge: “We don't need to convince people that NFTs matter—we need to show them. When the tech disappears into the background, adoption becomes effortless.”
From Speculation to Infrastructure
Think about email. In the early days, it was clunky and mostly used by tech hobbyists. Now it's invisible—just a layer of communication we rely on every day. NFTs are headed the same way.      
The next wave of NFT innovation will prioritize:
Utility over rarity
Experience over speculation
Interoperability across platforms
Sustainability in economic models





Alessio Vinassa sums it up best: “The best NFTs in five years won't be sold. They'll be used.”
Key Takeaways
NFTs are not dead—they're evolving beyond speculation into real infrastructure.
Core value lies in verifiable digital ownership and programmability.
Use cases span identity, ticketing, gaming, access, and more.      
Alessio Vinassa is a key voice in reframing NFT narratives toward utility and user empowerment.
Conclusion
“NFTs are dead” might make a great headline, but the truth is more nuanced. Like all emerging technologies, NFTs are undergoing a transition—from misunderstood to indispensable. The bubble may have burst, but what remains is a resilient layer of blockchain innovation ready to solve real-world problems.
And leaders like Alessio Vinassa are ensuring that this evolution is grounded, responsible, and driven by purpose.

Why People Still Doubt NFTs
The term “NFT” still carries baggage. Here's why:
The word is overused and often misunderstood.





Media coverage emphasized price tags over purpose.
Many consumers saw no tangible value or real use.
Alessio Vinassa acknowledges the skepticism but frames it as a design challenge: “We don't need to convince people that NFTs matter—we need to show them. When the tech disappears into the background, adoption becomes effortless.”
From Speculation to Infrastructure
Think about email. In the early days, it was clunky and mostly used by tech hobbyists. Now it's invisible—just a layer of communication we rely on every day. NFTs are headed the same way.      
The next wave of NFT innovation will prioritize:
Utility over rarity
Experience over speculation
Interoperability across platforms
Sustainability in economic models





Alessio Vinassa sums it up best: “The best NFTs in five years won't be sold. They'll be used.”
Key Takeaways
NFTs are not dead—they're evolving beyond speculation into real infrastructure.
Core value lies in verifiable digital ownership and programmability.
Use cases span identity, ticketing, gaming, access, and more.      
Alessio Vinassa is a key voice in reframing NFT narratives toward utility and user empowerment.
Conclusion
“NFTs are dead” might make a great headline, but the truth is more nuanced. Like all emerging technologies, NFTs are undergoing a transition—from misunderstood to indispensable. The bubble may have burst, but what remains is a resilient layer of blockchain innovation ready to solve real-world problems.
And leaders like Alessio Vinassa are ensuring that this evolution is grounded, responsible, and driven by purpose.

Marketplaces were flooded with low-quality, overpriced assets.
Media fixated on speculative profits, not technical innovation.
According to Web3 pioneer, entreprenuer, Alessio Vinassa, this phase was inevitable. “What we witnessed was an attention bubble—not a failure of the core technology, but a failure of how it was communicated and applied,” he explains.





Alessio Vinassa, who has helped incubate several real-world NFT utility platforms, believes that the collapse of the hype is what Web3 needed to develop and grow up. “The noise had to die so the signal could be heard.”
The Core Innovation: Verifiable Digital Ownership
At its heart, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset stored on a blockchain. Its real power lies in verifiable ownership, not collectibility.
Here's what that means in practical terms:
A musician can sell a limited edition track and prove authenticity.      
A university can issue diplomas that are tamper-proof and transferable.
A concert ticket can be verified, resold, or revoked with transparency.
A gamer can own in-game assets that persist across platforms.
“These use cases have nothing to do with speculation,” says Alessio Vinassa. “They're about efficiency, trust, and removing middlemen from digital value exchange.”
Real-World Applications Emerging Now





Beyond collectibles, NFTs are finding their footing in:
Digital identity: Self-sovereign ID systems use NFTs as portable credentials.
Event ticketing: Prevents fraud and allows creators to earn resale royalties.
Real estate: Tokenized property deeds that streamline title transfer.
Supply chains: Tracking the lifecycle of physical goods using digital twins.

The term “NFT” still carries baggage. Here's why:
The word is overused and often misunderstood.





Media coverage emphasized price tags over purpose.
Many consumers saw no tangible value or real use.
Alessio Vinassa acknowledges the skepticism but frames it as a design challenge: “We don't need to convince people that NFTs matter—we need to show them. When the tech disappears into the background, adoption becomes effortless.”
From Speculation to Infrastructure
Think about email. In the early days, it was clunky and mostly used by tech hobbyists. Now it's invisible—just a layer of communication we rely on every day. NFTs are headed the same way.      
The next wave of NFT innovation will prioritize:
Utility over rarity
Experience over speculation
Interoperability across platforms
Sustainability in economic models





Alessio Vinassa sums it up best: “The best NFTs in five years won't be sold. They'll be used.”
Key Takeaways
NFTs are not dead—they're evolving beyond speculation into real infrastructure.
Core value lies in verifiable digital ownership and programmability.
Use cases span identity, ticketing, gaming, access, and more.      
Alessio Vinassa is a key voice in reframing NFT narratives toward utility and user empowerment.
Conclusion
“NFTs are dead” might make a great headline, but the truth is more nuanced. Like all emerging technologies, NFTs are undergoing a transition—from misunderstood to indispensable. The bubble may have burst, but what remains is a resilient layer of blockchain innovation ready to solve real-world problems.

        The ICO's £2.31m fine against 23andMe for a major data breach is a stark reminder of the regulatory consequences that can result from cybersecurity incidents, in addition to the financial and reputational damage caused to businesses by the incident itself. The consequences of inadequate cybersecurity measures can be existential for the businesses involved in such incidents. Organisations handling sensitive personal data should prioritise robust protections to avoid similar pitfalls.
    

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has imposed a £2.31m fine on genetic testing company 23andMe for failing to implement adequate security measures following a major cyber-attack in 2023. The penalty follows a joint investigation by the ICO and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. This comes on top of the financial and reputational damage to 23andMe caused by the attack which appears to have been a major contributing factor in driving the business to bankruptcy, with proceedings currently being resolved before the US courts.

Between April and September 2023, hackers carried out a ""credential stuffing"" attack, exploiting reused login credentials stolen from unrelated breaches. This resulted in unauthorised access to personal data of 155,592 UK residents. Exposed data included names, birth years, self-reported city or postcode-level locations, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees, and health reports. The amount and type of data accessed varied by account, but DNA records were not compromised.

The ICO found that 23andMe lacked critical security measures, such as mandatory multi-factor authentication and secure password protocols. It also failed to implement effective monitoring systems to detect and respond to cyber threats. Despite warning signs, the company was slow to investigate and only confirmed the breach in October 2023 after stolen data was advertised for sale online.


                Director, Environmental, Health and Safety
            

The ICO concluded that 23andMe breached UK data protection law by failing to protect special category data, which requires heightened safeguards. John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, described the breach as “profoundly damaging,” noting the lasting impact on individuals whose sensitive data was exposed.

The fine was imposed amidst 23andMe's bankruptcy proceedings. This demonstrates the ICO's commitment to holding organisations accountable whether or not the fine imposed is ever likely to be paid. The company has since been sold to TTAM Research Institute, which has committed to improving data privacy protections. 

1.    Strengthen security protocols: Implement mandatory multi-factor authentication, secure password policies, and unpredictable usernames to protect accounts.

2.    Prioritise special category data: Organisations handling sensitive data, such as health or genetic information, should adopt enhanced security measures to comply with UK data protection law.

3.    Monitor and respond proactively: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities, install security patches promptly, and ensure robust systems are in place to detect and respond to cyber threats.

4.    Educate users on password hygiene: Credential-stuffing attacks exploit weak or reused passwords. Encourage strong, unique passwords and provide tools to support their use.

5.    Learn from regulatory action: The ICO's fine, even amidst bankruptcy proceedings, demonstrates its resolve to enforce data protection laws. Compliance is critical to avoid fines and reputational harm in addition to the immediate impact of the incident itself.

This case should serve as a wake-up call for organisations handling sensitive personal data. Inadequate security measures can lead to severe regulatory penalties in addition to financial and reputational damage and claims from data subjects. Proactively investing in cybersecurity not only ensures compliance but also builds customer trust and resilience.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has welcomed a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims.

The verdict follows a 10 week trial and an extensive investigation by the ICO. During which, the ICO seized the widest body of evidence it has ever seen, demonstrating the misuse of people's personal details to make nuisance calls to try and persuade people to make personal injury claims.

A jury at Bolton Crown Court this week found Craig Cornick, 40, of Prestbury, guilty of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data contrary to the Data Protection Act.

Earlier in the month, the jury returned a not guilty verdict for Cornick and Thomas Daly, 35, of Macclesfield, for a charge of conspiracy to access computer systems without authority contrary to the Computer Misuse Act.

Daly had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data.

Cornick and Daly join six other men who had all previously pleaded guilty to the offences listed below:

All the defendants are due to return to court on 11 July, where it is proposed Proceeds of Crime Act and cost issues will be discussed, with sentencing following at a later date.

ICO Head of Investigations, Andy Curry, said: “Most of us have had nuisance calls asking if we've been in a crash. At best they're annoying but at worst they cause real upset and fear, especially to vulnerable people, and have a real impact on the businesses affected. 

“This case uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages across England, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. This has been an enormous and complex case which has seen ICO staff use both technical expertise and investigative skills to work tirelessly to track down those responsible and hold them accountable on behalf of the public.” 

ICO investigation

The ICO initially started this investigation in 2016 when the owner of a car repair garage in County Durham contacted the regulator, saying he was worried his customers blamed him for the nuisance calls they were receiving about personal injury claims.

From this first initial complaint, the investigation snowballed into one of the largest nuisance call cases the ICO has ever dealt with, resulting in a wealth of evidence that demonstrated misuses of personal data for the purpose of making calls relating to personal injury claims.

After identifying the people involved, the ICO's investigations team conducted nine warrants in the Manchester and Macclesfield areas. The devices seized under search warrant contained 241,000 emails, 4.5 million documents,144,000 spreadsheets,1.5 million images and 83,000 multimedia files.

The defendants were found to have conspired together between 2014 and 2017, where they accessed and obtained personal data of approximately one million people from vehicle repair garages without their consent.

This data was then sold onto claims management firms hoping to generate potential leads for personal injury claims. The ICO has an ongoing second phase of its investigation and anticipates further prosecutions of people embedded into insurance companies and claims management companies with the sole aim of stealing personal data.

Several months ago the Bank of Russia said it was planning to delay the rollout of its digital ruble central bank digital currency (CBDC) following pushback from both banks and retailers. The first phase was originally scheduled to launch on 1 July 2025, with the central bank now proposing 1 September 2026, although it requires a change to the law.

That's a compromise given the largest retailers requested an extension of up to two years. The first rollout date applies to the biggest banks and retailers. But the categorization of the largest retailers has been narrowed to those with revenues of more than 120 million rubles ($1.5m), compared to 30 million ($380,000) under the previous plan.

The next tier of banks and merchants get an extra year to launch, and includes banks with a universal license and traders with more than 30 million rubles in revenues. For the smaller ones, the launch deadline is 1 September 2028. However,  it seems that small merchants with revenues of under 5 million are no longer compelled to accept the CBDC.

While requests for the delay were widespread, Russia's largest bank Sber was one of the loudest. That's in part because it was not included in the first phase of the CBDC trials, so only joined in late December 2024, which would not have given it enough lead time if the launch had rolled out next month as planned.

In the announcement, the central bank also emphasized that at checkout the digital ruble will use its universal QR code, which already supports its faster payment system. Late last year the bank said it had piloted the universal QR with 22 banks.

This content was produced in partnership with Bazoom Group.

Lawmakers in Albany are taking another shot at tackling the fast-moving world of digital currency. A bill introduced this session would establish a state task force to study cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, examining aspects ranging from economic impact to energy consumption. It's a response to growing calls for updated rules that can keep pace with tech without pushing innovation out of the state.

As part of the review, the group will also examine how cryptocurrency is being utilized beyond trading, encompassing decentralized platforms, blockchain-based services, and newer models like Telegram casino sites, which impressively combine technological innovation and gambling regulation. The goal isn't to crack down immediately, but to understand how these tools are spreading and where the gaps in oversight might lie.

The proposed task force would include 17 members from state agencies, finance, law, and tech. It would report back by late 2027 with recommendations on a range of topics, including consumer protections and tax strategies. That timeline gives lawmakers breathing room, but also raises questions about whether they can act fast enough in a space where things change overnight.

New York has a complicated history with crypto. It was once seen as a leader—until the BitLicense rules in 2015 drove many startups out of the market. Critics said the rules were too strict and didn't reflect how the industry worked. Since then, some progress has been made, but there's still a sense that the state is playing catch-up.

One focus of the task force will be energy. Mining operations, especially those powered by fossil fuels, have sparked pushback from environmental groups. New York even passed a two-year pause on some mining operations in 2022, aimed at slowing the industry while cleaner energy rules are figured out. That pause is still in place.

But it's not just about mining. Lawmakers also want to understand how blockchain is being utilized in other areas, such as healthcare records, voting systems, and supply chain tracking. The point of the task force isn't just to regulate, but to get a better grasp on how the tech is being used in the real world.

Supporters of the bill say it's not just about catching up—it's about laying the groundwork for New York to lead again. With fintech investment booming and other states rolling out crypto-friendly regulations, there is pressure to act before talent and business flow elsewhere. For now, the bill is still moving through the committee. But if passed, it would mark a shift in how New York approaches crypto—not as something to fear or overregulate, but as something worth studying closely. Whether that leads to meaningful change or more delays remains to be seen.

Bitcoin BTC$107,032.65 continues to consolidate in the $102,000 to $108,000 range and gold is lower by 2% today and roughly 7% from its record high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has reached new all-time highs.

A couple of U.S. macroeconomic data points Friday morning — though nearly two months old at this point — might have added to the modestly negative tone for BTC and gold. Personal income in May came in at -0.4%, falling short of the expected increase of 0.3%. Personal spending month over month printed at -0.1%, missing the forecast of a 0.1% increase.

Maybe of more import to markets, the core PCE price index in the US, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the Federal Reserve's chosen gauge of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in May compared to expectations of a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE prices rose 2.7% versus 2.6% expected.

This data further supports the view that the economy may be heading toward stagflation. Noted goldbug and no-coiner Peter Schiff: ""Traders continue to sell gold even as this morning's release of weak economic data and stronger-than-expected inflation data pushed the dollar index to new lows. Stagflation and a tanking dollar are bullish for gold, regardless of any superficial trade deals 'negotiated' by Trump.""

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

A measure of XRP's XRP$2.0964 price volatility has crashed to the lowest level since President Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections in November. Still, it's not yet at the level which has historically presaged strong directional trends.

XRP's 30-day annualized realized volatility, a measure of how volatile prices have been over the past four weeks, recently dropped to 44%, the lowest since early November, according to data source TradingView. The decline marks a sharp slide from highs above 150% registered in December and March.

The volatility meltdown follows boring price action in the XRP market. This despite the debut of XRP futures on the CME, several issuers applying for spot XRP ETFs and overall positive regulatory developments for the crypto industry under Trump's presidency.

Since March, XRP has primarily traded back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring the occasional short-lived dips below $2. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. 

The price action is consistent with that of bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, which has mostly traded between $100,000 and $110,000 for almost 50 consecutive days.

Volatility is mean-reverting, which means that, over time, it tends to fluctuate around its long-term average. In other words, a sharp rise in volatility often paves the way for consolidation, and a prolonged drop in volatility usually sets the stage for strong directional trends.

That said, the 30-day realized volatility is still well above the 15% to 30% range, which has marked volatility bottoms and renewed price turbulence since 2014.

 Bitcoin long-term holder supply has increased at a record rate over the past month, data from CryptoQuant reveals. 

Key points:

Bitcoin long-term holder supply has increased by a record 800,000 coins over the past 30 days.

Data shows that even a 750,000 BTC increase has only occurred six times in Bitcoin's history.

BTC price support hinges on supply with a cost basis above $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders are making history as they increase their BTC exposure by 800,000 BTC per month.

New research from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows the Bitcoin “hodl” mentality reaching rarely seen levels.

Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) — entities holding coins for at least six months without selling — have doubled down on their commitment despite BTC price hitting new all-time highs in 2025.

Analyzing the LTH supply change, CryptoQuant said that on a rolling 30-day basis, the supply had increased by a net 800,000 BTC — a new record.

“This week brings a key signal from LTH that shouldn't be overlooked,” contributor Darkfost said in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on Thursday.

Over Bitcoin's history, 30-day LTH supply increases have only passed the 750,000 BTC mark six times. The two most recent occasions, in July 2021 and September 2024, each preceded a BTC price spike.

“This makes it a powerful signal that should absolutely be factored into any strategy,” Darkfost concluded.

The post added that coins now entering the LTH category have a purchase price between $95,000 and $107,000, reinforcing that range as a potential support zone.

As Cointelegraph continues to report, the opposite end of the Bitcoin investor spectrum, short-term holders (STHs), also play an important role in bull markets.

Currently, STHs — corresponding to speculators hodling coins for six months or less — have their aggregate cost basis at just below $100,000.

That level often acts as support during bull market corrections, with this week's retracement to $98,000 being no different.

Analyzing support composition this week, onchain analytics firm Glassnode warned that the area between $98,000 and $93,000 was crucial.

“As long as the price holds above this range, the bull market structure remains intact,” it summarized in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain.”

 US stock futures have hit record highs, fueling analyst predictions that Bitcoin could soon break past resistance to hit a new price peak. 

US stock futures are at record highs as the country's largest markets are nearing their peaks, which could help propel Bitcoin to reach another all-time high, according to analysts. 

S&P 500 futures entered new all-time high territory on Thursday with the index tapping 6,145 points, surpassing February's peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures also hit a peak at 20,180 around the same time. 

The S&P 500 has gained 23% since its April 8 crash as trade tariff shocks ease and a ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to hold.

Stock futures are derivative contracts where traders agree to buy or sell a specific stock index, such as the S&P 500, at a set price at a future expiration date. They trade overnight and before markets open, often providing insight and signals on how stocks might open the following day. 

The rally came as investors digested new reasons to believe the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates as early as July, Yahoo Finance reported.

Analysts have been weighing in on the prospect of Bitcoin (BTC) following stocks to a new all-time high. 

“US stock futures nearing all-time highs, fueled by geopolitical easing and Fed rate-cut expectations, are bolstering investor risk appetite as Bitcoin's recent rebound increased speculation of a new record high in the near future,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph.

He added that sustained equity momentum and institutional inflows “could propel BTC past its $109,000 resistance into a new price discovery phase” if the Fed rate cut happens “in the coming months.”

Jeff Mei, chief operations officer at crypto exchange BTSE, told Cointelegraph that “conditions are ripe for Bitcoin to surpass its previous all-time high of about $112,000, especially given that the Iran-Israel conflict seems to be over for the time being.” 

Meanwhile, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes posted to X on Thursday that Bitcoin all-time highs “are coming,” and pointed to the passage of stablecoin regulations in the US and the easing tensions in the Middle East.

Bitcoin has failed to break resistance above $108,000 at least three times this week and has declined from its last attempt on Thursday to trade at $107,400.

10x Research head of research Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph that a “notable dovish shift is emerging” among Fed leadership, but the market remains constrained.

The Fed on Friday will release its preferred inflation gauge, called the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which could induce more market volatility.

 UK-based The Smarter Web Company has made a multimillion-dollar raise just days after it purchased $20 million worth of Bitcoin to bring its holdings to over 540 BTC. 

UK-based web design and marketing firm The Smarter Web Company has raised 41.2 million British pounds ($56.59 million), days after it purchased 196 Bitcoin to add to its growing holdings.

The firm said on Thursday that the raise came from institutional investors via accelerated bookbuild, a process where a company raises capital quickly, usually within one or two days, without any marketing push.

The Smarter Web Company raised 36.27 million British pounds ($49.8 million) with the bookbuild and a further 4.97 million British pounds ($6.82 million) by subscription. The offer price was 2.9 British pounds ($3.98) per share.

The company expects the stocks issued across both offerings will go into effect from July 1.

The raise came two days after The Smarter Web Company said it spent over $20 million to buy 196.8 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $103,290 each.

The company held 543.52 BTC as of Tuesday, bought at an average price of $104,450, a stash that's currently worth around $58.19 million.

The Smarter Web Company has purchased BTC five times in June so far, and its Bitcoin stack has increased from 83.24 BTC at the end of May to 543.52 BTC, an increase of 460.28 BTC in less than 30 days.

The firm launched its Bitcoin treasury strategy in April, but has accepted Bitcoin as payment since 2023.

In the US, The Smarter Web Company trades on the OTCQB, an over-the-counter market comprising early-stage or developing companies.

Shares in Smarter Web Company PLC (TSWCF) fell by 15% and closed Thursday at $3.56 after hitting an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance.

Its shares fell another 1.8% after the bell and ended the after-hours session at $3.49. Despite the recent drop, the company's stock is still up 274% year-to-date.

Other UK companies have been buying up Bitcoin despite the country's lack of clear laws around digital assets. 

On Tuesday, Vinanz, a London Stock Exchange-listed firm that markets itself as a Bitcoin treasury company, said it acquired 37.72 BTC to bring its total holdings to 58.68 BTC.

In April, London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital purchased Bitcoin worth more than $250 million.

 Crypto private key exploits and front-end protocol attacks account for 80% of the $2.1 billion worth of crypto that has been stolen so far this year, TRM Labs reports. 

Crypto private key exploits and front-end compromises have accounted for most of the $2.1 billion worth of crypto lost to attacks in the first half of 2025, says blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. 

Over 80% of crypto stolen across 75 hacks so far this year was taken in so-called infrastructure exploits, which, on average, made off with 10 times more than other attack types, TRM Labs said in a report on Thursday.

Infrastructure attacks target the technical backbone of a system to gain unauthorized control, mislead users, or reroute assets.

They include attacks such as hijacking a crypto wallet's private seed phrase or exploiting the user-facing part of a crypto protocol.

Another major successful attack vector was protocol exploits, including flash loan and re-entrancy attacks, which accounted for 12% of the losses in the first half of the year. 

“These attacks target vulnerabilities in a blockchain protocol's smart contracts or core logic to extract funds or disrupt system behavior,” TRM Labs explained. 

Overall, losses in the first half of 2025 have surpassed the previous record set in 2022 by roughly 10% and nearly equal the total losses from all of 2024, which TRM Labs said “highlights an increasingly concentrated threat to digital assets.” 

North Korea's $1.5 billion hack of Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit in February made up nearly 70% of the total losses so far in 2025.

That attack also pushed the average hack size to nearly $30 million, double the $15 million average in the first half of 2024.

However, according to TRM Labs, January, April, May and June still saw total thefts over $100 million. 

The pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, or Predatory Sparrow — which has possible links to the Israeli government — contributed to jacking up the averages as well, after it exploited Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, for $100 on June 18.

“H1 2025 marks a pivotal shift in crypto hacking: escalating strategic intent from state actors and other geopolitically motivated groups,” TRM Labs said. 

TRM Labs said that the crypto industry needs to reinforce fundamental security, such as multifactor authentication, cold storage, frequent audits and prioritize insider threat detection and advanced social engineering countermeasures. 

It added that there also needs to be “multifaceted collaboration” between global law enforcement, financial intelligence units and blockchain intelligence firms.

“H1 2025's record thefts are a stark call to action for a collective, sustained, and strategically aligned security posture — one prepared not just for crime, but for covert acts of statecraft,” TRM Labs said.

This is How We Fight Bird Flu If H5N1 Becomes the Next Human Pandemic

This San Antonio, Tex., lab takes biosecurity seriously. Suit up with its scientists and go behind the scenes of the science of vaccine creation.

By Naeem Amarsy, Jeffery DelViscio, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Rachel Feltman 

Naeem Amarsy/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. This is the final episode of our three-part series on bird flu.

(You can listen to episode one here and episode two here.)

On Wednesday we met scientists who are getting their hands dirty with dairy cows and poultry to better understand how H5N1 bird flu is spreading. Today we'll take a look at efforts to create vaccines for H5N1—and learn why eggs are so critical to the vaccine-making process.

Our host today is Naeem Amarsy, a multimedia journalist based in New York City. Here's Naeem now.

Naeem Amarsy: It's barely 10 A.M. in San Antonio, Texas, and it's nearly 90 degrees—in the middle of May. While the rest of the city steps out in sandals and shorts, I'm watching a team of scientists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. They're rummaging through metallic shelves to find the extra layers of protective gear they need to start their day: scrubs, gowns, gloves, shoe covers, hairnets and long white coveralls.

Luis Martinez-Sobrido: So, we need to change all our clothes. That's why we have all these cabinets there.

Amarsy: That's virologist Luis Martinez-Sobrido. He observes with a keen eye as two members of his lab dress up for their next shift.

Martinez-Sobrido: You take everything out—only the scrubs and the bunny suit. They also use this head net to cover the head. I don't have that problem. I don't need that [laughs].

Amarsy: Luis's team is preparing to enter a BSL-3—which is short for biosafety level three—facility. In these highly secure labs scientists handle some of the world's potentially deadliest viruses.

Martinez-Sobrido: So mainly here we are working with tuberculosis, we are working with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1.

Amarsy: H5N1 is the reason I am here. As we learned in the first two episodes of this series the virus is moving between species, from wild birds to their domesticated counterparts to cows and other mammals. And now it's reached humans.

The currently circulating strains have already infected dozens of people, mostly poultry and cattle farmworkers. Luckily, most of these infections have been mild. But historically, H5N1 viruses have killed nearly 50 percent of the people they've infected, according to the World Health Organization. And that's a major concern. The more these H5N1 viruses circulate, the greater the chance they change into forms that cause severe disease—and that easily spread between people.

Martinez-Sobrido: We do not have any preexisting immunity against this H5N1 virus, and if it's able to transmit, it will potentially cause a pandemic.

Amarsy: I wanted to understand what virologists like Luis are discovering about bird flu and how they might try to protect us if it does start jumping between humans.

Inside the anteroom, a sealed space between the outside world and the BSL-3 lab, each of Luis's colleagues puts on their final piece of equipment: a battery-powered respirator connected to a large white hood with a transparent front that they call “the bubble.”

From left: Ramya Smithaveni Barre and Ahmed Elsayed of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute put on personal protective equipment before entering a BSL-3, or biosafety level three, laboratory.

Ahmed Elsayed: So we start with checking our bubble and connecting the battery.

[CLIP: Elsayed's respirator battery makes a noise as it's plugged in.]

Elsayed: And then start the bubble.

[CLIP: Elsayed's bubble beeps.]

Elsayed: Then we connect the shroud that we put to protect our face.

Amarsy: That's Ahmed Elsayed, a staff scientist working in Luis's lab. In his immaculate white coveralls he reminds me of a beekeeper. At the back of his head a thick cable connects his bubble to the air filter around his belt, it's a lifeline from any contagion inside the lab.

Elsayed: We are waiting to have everyone ready before opening the second door because we cannot open it twice. So once everything is fine then we enter the PIN number and enter the lab.

[CLIP: Elsayed types the entry code into the PIN pad. The PIN pad beeps, and the lab's second door opens and shuts.]

Amarsy: As they disappear into the lab I am left wondering what Ahmed and his [colleagues] will do over the next six hours of their shift, working with those potentially deadly viruses. So I ask Luis.

Martinez-Sobrido: So the main specialty of our lab is reverse genetic approaches, and reverse genetics mainly refer to the ability to generate recombinant viruses in the laboratory. It's not a virus that has been isolated from an animal or from a human.

Amarsy: Recombinant viruses are one of the most powerful tools in virology. They let scientists like Luis use genetic sequences to re-create and modify viruses found in the wild—all that without having to rely on samples from the outside world.

This helps researchers test a bunch of things about viruses such as H5N1, from how they respond to antiviral treatments to how they mutate and how sick they can make us.

Martinez-Sobrido: More importantly, like in the case of the influenza vaccines, allow you to generate attenuated forms of the virus that then you can use as vaccines for the treatment of viral infections.

Amarsy: Every year tens of millions of Americans get a flu shot. This prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations. And making the annual seasonal flu vaccines is a coordinated global effort.

The World Health Organization offers recommendations on the vaccines' makeup twice a year—in February for the Northern Hemisphere and September for the Southern Hemisphere. They make these recommendations based on which strains experts think are most likely to spread. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration considers that data and then makes its own recommendations, which pharmaceutical manufacturers use to produce millions of doses that are distributed across the country.

Along the way, labs like Luis's get involved.

Martinez-Sobrido: Well, we generate some of the stocks, or the seeds, of the vaccine. we cannot produce vaccines for a large population; we just do it [on a] smaller scale here.

Amarsy: What Luis calls the “seed” of the vaccine is a specifically designed virus that pharma companies use to develop flu vaccines. It doesn't make us sick but instead helps our body create antibodies. It's also known as a candidate vaccine virus.

Amarsy (tape): So if I get a flu shot at the end of the year ...

Martinez-Sobrido: It could be coming from here, yeah.

Amarsy: In addition to its contribution to your annual flu shot, Luis's lab makes candidates for potential vaccines to protect against H5N1. These so-called pandemic vaccine viruses are an essential line of defense against the threat of an avian flu pandemic. They can be used to create vaccines to help reduce severe illness.

And whether we're talking about flu shots for seasonal or avian strains, making them usually involves a surprising tool.

Martinez-Sobrido: We infect eggs with the virus.

Ahmed Elsayed of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute picks-up fertilized chicken eggs from a crate before inspecting them for infection with an an H5N1 vaccine virus.

Naeem Amarsy/Scientific American

Amarsy: These aren't your everyday supermarket eggs. They are fertilized eggs, produced in secret biosecure farms across the country. It's believed that we go through millions of these eggs every year. They are used because flu viruses grow very well in the allantoic cavity, which is full of a liquid that contains waste from the embryo as well as various proteins.

Luis and his team showed me how they make H5N1 vaccine seeds. They said it all starts in their super-secure BSL-3 lab that only authorized researchers can enter. I can't go in.

Martinez-Sobrido: So, we usually start with a vaccine virus that we generate in the laboratory. It does not infect or replicate [in] humans, but it grows very well in eggs.

Amarsy: Once the scientists create the virus they conduct a bunch of tests to make sure it actually isn't dangerous to humans. Only when they know the virus is safe do they move it to another lab with less stringent safety rules—no need for respirators—and this time I could join.

Martinez-Sobrido: We have egg incubators like these where we keep the eggs inside, and they actually rotate, like, every 15 minutes, 20 minutes.

[CLIP: The incubator rotating.]

Amarsy: Ahmed removes a dozen white eggs from the incubator and turns off the ceiling lights.

Elsayed: So we get the egg at day one, so then we keep it until day 10, [when] the embryo will be ready and the egg will be ready for infection to propagate the viruses. So now we will start to candle the egg.

Amarsy: He holds an egg in one hand. He moves the egg below a small light attached to his workstation, causing it to glow orange—except for a small circular patch at the top, which remains white. That's the air sac, he explains. He wants to avoid injecting the virus there because it won't grow.

Ahmed Elsayed of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute uses a laboratory light to observe the inner contents of a fertilized chicken egg.

Naeem Amarsy/Scientific American

[CLIP: Elsayed marks an egg's air sac.]

Elsayed: Then we find [a] certain point in which we can use to inoculate safely the embryonated egg without affecting the embryo.

Amarsy: After labeling a dozen eggs Ahmed turns the lights back on. He passes the crate to Ramya Smithaveni Barre, a Ph.D. student who also works in Luis's lab.

Ramya Smithaveni Barre: We will actually be making a hole here at the point, and we will be injecting the virus into the allantoic fluid.

Amarsy: Under a loud biosafety hood she pokes small holes into the eggs and injects them with the specially designed vaccine virus.

Barre: These are 18-gauge needles. These are very thick, so it just helps drill a hole quickly. So just make a hole here. So you see this point here, which—where the X mark is made? So from here we will be injecting using a syringe.

[CLIP: Barre opens a syringe packet and injects virus into an egg.]

Barre: So after this is done I will basically be covering them with the glue to seal them.... So after that they go into the incubator, and they stay there for, like, 48 hours.

Amarsy: Now that the eggs have been infected the team needs to wait for the virus to propagate in large enough quantities. In two days they will extract the allantoic fluid, which now contains the virus, conduct a number of tests and put the samples with the highest virus concentration into vials. Each has enough virus to make thousands of flu vaccine doses.

After leaving Luis's lab the vials go through a series of quality control evaluations and testing. And then they'll be sent to manufacturing labs, which, in the case of a pandemic, can use them to replicate the process in millions of eggs.

Martinez-Sobrido: Since this is a virus that is still alive the next thing they do after growing the virus is to kill the virus, inactivate the virus. So once they inactivate the virus they process [it], and then they put it in the tube, and then they send it to the pharmacy, and that's what you get.

Amarsy: For the 2024–2025 flu season the CDC said it expected about 80 percent of flu vaccines in the U.S. to be made using the egg-based method. And without the science that has—even if most people don't know it—gone into every flu shot you've ever had, we might not be able to prepare for what scientists say is the growing threat of a potential bird flu pandemic.

Martinez-Sobrido: We recently are aware of how important the vaccines are because of the COVID-19 pandemic, right? That these vaccines have clearly saved millions of lives. But, clearly [this] is the best mechanism that we have to protect us against any type of infectious disease, including influenza.

Amarsy: And if H5N1 does become easily transmissible between humans, the seeds that Luis's lab makes and the H5N1 vaccines that follow, could become central to our pandemic response.

Amesh Adalja: So there are stockpiled vaccines against H5N1. This is a process that began during George W. Bush's administration. These are not well-matched to what's circulating now, but there have been efforts to update that stockpile.

Luis Martinez-Sobrido of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute holds up a test to detect the presence of an egg-grown H5N1 vaccine virus in diluted samples of allantoic fluid from inside fertilized chicken eggs.

Naeem Amarsy/Scientific American

There's not enough in the stockpile currently to vaccinate the entire U.S. population. There are efforts underway to increase that stockpile if needed, and there are contracts in place to be able to do that. In the event of a threat change you would anticipate manufacturers coming online and some of the seasonal flu capacity being shifted to pandemic flu requirements.

Amarsy: That's Amesh Adalja. He's a pandemic-preparedness specialist at Johns Hopkins University and an infectious disease physician.

Amesh emphasizes the importance of vaccines as one of our first lines of defense against a potential avian influenza pandemic. But he sees some challenges in our current system.

Adalja: The issue will always be: Does the vaccine work very well? Is it well-matched to what—the strain that's circulating or that's causing the issue? And how much of it do we have, and how fast can we have it in the arms of those people who are at most risk?

Amarsy: Part of what complicates addressing these concerns is the use of chicken eggs, he says.

Adalja: If you're in an avian influenza outbreak, it might affect chicken farms and chicken egg production. However, people recognize that, and there have been specific flocks that have been segregated away and kept under high biosafety to not allow them to be infected. They're not kept in [the] open, where a passing goose can't put its droppings in the chicken cage. The individuals that have to interact with them have to wear aggressive personal protective equipment.

Amarsy: So to experts like Amesh, threats to egg availability aren't the main problem. The larger concern is that creating vaccines by using chicken eggs takes so long that scientists have to pick the strains about six months before a vaccine gets into our arms.

Adalja: And that creates a problem because when they're making that strain selection, things might change later in the season, and they're pretty much stuck with what they picked. So that's why we sometimes have vaccine mismatches: because of that long lead time required by the egg-based vaccine manufacturers.

Amarsy: This means that if the H5N1 viruses currently circulating were to mutate into a new strain that doesn't respond to the vaccine seeds made in labs like Luis's, it would be at least half a year before we even had egg-based shots available. By that time many people could already be infected.

Additionally, Amesh says there's another problem with growing bird flu vaccines in eggs.

Adalja: When you propagate the virus in chicken eggs, the virus mutates and you might end up at the end with something different than what you started with that might not work as well, so I think it also decreases the efficacy.

So, long lead time, which allows mismatches to occur more frequently, and you get egg-based mutations that decrease the efficacy of the vaccine.

Amarsy: As mentioned before we still use eggs to make most flu shots, and most of the time it works well. It's the cheapest option, and we have a widespread manufacturing infrastructure built around this process. But there are also quicker alternatives, like cell-based vaccines, which are grown in mammalian cells. And though these approaches cost more right now, experts like Amesh have advocated for them to be adopted more widely.

Some labs are trying to develop even newer solutions based on messenger RNA, like many of the COVID vaccines. This process could allow countries to deploy a vaccine that matches a new strain much quicker. The Trump administration, however, recently canceled $766 million in funding for the pharmaceutical company Moderna to develop an mRNA-based bird flu shot. This has added to concerns about the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' approach to vaccination.

But for H5N1 to trigger the next pandemic it would need to acquire the ability to easily transmit between humans. And that, we think, hasn't happened yet.

Adolfo García-Sastre: We have these little entities, microscopic entities, viruses—flu has only eight genes, eight genes, and they get inside a cell of an organism that—we have [about] 30,000 genes. And how [is] the virus ... able to—these eight genes [able to] code information that take over the whole 30,000 genes and then change completely the cell to make copies of themselves? How can you achieve that with so little information, right? That's fascinating.

Amarsy: That's Adolfo García-Sastre. He's one of the world's leading flu virologists, and he trained Luis back in the 2000s. He now runs a lab at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in New York City.

His lab looks at pretty much everything that has to do with flu—vaccination, treatments, viral evolution, transmission, mutations—but even he was surprised by what H5N1 has done.

García-Sastre: I could never imagine in my life that there will be cows infected with flu.... Before that they say, “You think that flu can replicate and establish a cycle in dairy cows by replicating in the mammary glands of the dairy cows?” I say, “What, are you crazy or what?”

Virologist Adolfo García-Sastre of Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in his office in New York City.

Amarsy: As we heard my colleague Meghan Bartels explain in Episode Two, scientists were astonished when they learned that H5N1 had jumped from birds to cows. And now the big fear is that the virus manages to adapt well enough to our bodies to transmit efficiently between people.

One way that could happen is through reassortment, the genetic mixing of multiple influenza viruses that we learned about in episode one.

García-Sastre: So if we get, for example, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of flu, ... it [had acquired] gene chromosomes coming from four different viruses: one was a virus circulating in humans, the other was a virus circulating in birds, the other virus circulating in pigs and the other virus circulating in pigs but [in] a different geographical area. So somehow these viruses got together into a pig and then created this particular virus.

Amarsy: Another way H5N1 could develop the ability to move from human to human is by simply mutating. Mutations happen when viruses make copies of themselves and mistakes slip in. Most of the time the mutations that don't benefit the virus are less likely to pass down.

García-Sastre: But it can happen that if a new mutation gives you a new characteristic that makes you more likely to replicate faster than your previous brothers and [sisters], then this mutation dominates.

Now, let's say H5N1, if it requires 20 different mutations to replicate and transmit in humans and if each mutation by itself doesn't make it better, that is very rare because these 20 mutations, it's very difficult [for them to] happen at the same time. But if it requires only four mutations, that's a different story. Maybe you can get four mutations being [generated] at one moment and it just [happens] to be that this—there is a human that gets infected with this mutant virus; then it starts to propagate in humans.

Amarsy: There's an ongoing debate among virologists about how many mutations it would take for the H5N1 viruses we are currently dealing with to better adapt to humans. One study found that for the strain that has been circulating in dairy cows since last year, one single mutation could potentially do the job. Here's what Adolfo had to say.

García-Sastre: It's very unlikely because I think the number of encounters of this virus with humans has been so many that if it [would] be only one mutation required for [transmissibility] in humans, it would have happened already.

Amarsy: Flu pandemics are historically very rare. But there's one notable exception: experts believe that in 1918 an H1N1 virus thought to have avian origins mutated in a way that made it better adapted to humans. Eventually, the virus caused one of the deadliest pandemics in recorded history, with estimates suggesting it killed anywhere from 50 to 100 million people worldwide.

In 2005 Adolfo was part of a team that re-created this virus in the lab. And here's what they found.

García-Sastre: So 1918 was always a, a mystery and a speculation [among] flu researchers. We realized that the virus was a very nasty virus to start with, and many of the deaths happened because that was an extreme case of a very virulent virus for humans of influenza. And that means that this can happen again, but will it happen again?

When we started to try to understand what are the determinants of virulence of this virus, we found that it needed to have a perfect storm—a combination of multiple mutations happening in multiple genes of the virus—and only this combination makes the virus as lethal as it was.

Amarsy: Just in the last roughly 140 years there have been five flu pandemics, ranging from the disastrous 1918 pandemic to the relatively mild 2009 outbreak. Virologists tend to agree that another flu pandemic is inevitable. But there's disagreement about how likely H5N1 is to be the trigger, so I asked Adolfo's longtime colleagues what they thought.

Peter Palese: Some people think that it's just a question of time when any of these H5 ... they are bound to, to jump into humans. I turn it around and say, “They have been with us so long already, in all kinds of animals—avian, mammalian—why hasn't it happened?” And so I'm not so sure it will happen, right? And I'm not so sure that this is the next pandemic strain, which will cause us all the grief, which we have seen with other pandemic strains.

Amarsy: That's Peter Palese, Adolfo's mentor at Mount Sinai, and a leading figure behind a lot of innovations in influenza research.

Florian Krammer: I think it's really hard to predict. You know, people were saying this would become a pandemic in 1997, in 2003 and since then very often, right? I think there is a high chance right now, or higher than before, just because there is so much virus out there and because it seems to adapt to mammals better.

Amarsy: And that's Florian Krammer, who also works with Adolfo and Peter at Mount Sinai.

García-Sastre: What is really clear is that there's gonna be another flu pandemic—doesn't need to be H5, but there have been, all the time, pandemics.

Amarsy: It's not a foregone conclusion that H5N1 will trigger the next pandemic. But if it does, are we ready to respond effectively?

I talked to epidemiologists Jennifer Nuzzo and Shira Doron. Here's what they told me.

Jennifer Nuzzo: So historically, H5N1 has been observed to be one of the most deadly viruses we've seen. Meaning that of all the cases we've been able to find, about half of them have died, and that is truly extraordinary when you sort of rank pathogens in terms of their potential to kill the people that we know are infected.

Amarsy: That's Jennifer. She directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University.

Shira Doron: That has not been the case with the current strain. What we've seen with this particular strain is very mild illness, and so often what we're seeing with the individuals who have developed H5N1 influenza from cows and poultry is just conjunctivitis, or just conjunctivitis with some mild upper respiratory symptoms, like a sore throat.

Amarsy: And that's Shira. She's the chief infection control officer at Tufts Medicine.

From the beginning of the current outbreak to early June 2025 there have been 70 known human cases of H5N1 in the United States. And though most cases have been mild we made be undercounting them—by a lot.

Doron: We know that our known cases are a relatively small proportion of total actual cases, especially because the disease has been so mild in most of the farmworkers who have become infected. Most people with very mild infection don't go to the doctor and don't request testing. Add to that the fact that many of these workers are undocumented migrants who are trying to stay under the radar.

Amarsy: If many cases go undetected, it means that H5N1 could be spreading silently. And every time it infects a new person it gets a chance to mutate, possibly into a form that adapts better to our bodies.

Nuzzo: I think it's quite concerning that we continue to see new outbreaks on farms being reported and yet no new human cases have been identified in months. So the number of animals who are getting infected continues to climb, and somehow the number of people who are being infected has just remained unchanged. We are also seeing that the amount of tests that states are doing has decreased. So we have a lot of reason to be concerned that we haven't found new cases because there's been a contraction in the surveillance efforts directed at H5N1.

There may be lower H5N1 activity; I'm not ruling that out. But we also know that H5N1 is not going away.

Amarsy: So in order to stay ahead of the curve Jennifer says we'd need to ramp up our monitoring efforts, from testing for possible infections to conducting wastewater surveillance. We'd also need to do much more to protect those who are most exposed to the virus.

Nuzzo: We know just telling people to wear personal protective equipment to protect themselves against the virus every time they're around animals is not working because people have continued to get sick despite making those recommendations. So, I do think there is a case to be made to offer the vaccines that we do have to the agricultural sector—not mandate but offer—as another tool to protect them.

Amarsy: Otherwise, we could be caught off guard.

Nuzzo: H5N1 could be a lot less severe and still cause a tremendous amount of chaos and damage. You know, COVID-19 has [been] observed to be far less lethal than what we've observed H5N1 to be. And if H5N1 became able to infect people easily and able to transmit easily between people, thus triggering a pandemic, and anything close to the case fatality that we've seen it have, it would be far and away so much worse than anything we've ever observed with COVID-19.

Amarsy: Of course, that's a scenario nobody wants. But if it happened, it's not like we'd be taking shots in the dark.

As we learned from Luis we can make vaccines that are thought to be effective, at least against the current circulating strains of H5N1. Additionally, we have antiviral treatments, some of which researchers such as Adolfo and Peter have tested against the nastiest flu viruses, including viruses with genes from the 1918 strain, and they tend to work well against many different flu viruses.

So what seems to concern epidemiologists such as Jennifer and Shira the most is not whether we have the right treatments and prevention mechanisms available to fight bird flu. Instead, the question is whether we have enough resources right now to handle another pandemic.

Doron: We have tested a number of strategies and figured out how to do some really hard things, and those are triggers we could pull again if need be. So for example, in my hospital, we now know how to set up, very quickly, a mass testing site, a mass vaccination site. We know how to expand intensive care and expand patient care, so in some ways we're more prepared today because of COVID-19.

Amarsy: But in other ways we are less prepared, the experts say.

Nuzzo: The thing that I'm most worried about is the loss of experienced personnel. During the start of COVID-19 one of the things that states tried to do was contact tracing, but it was really hard because states didn't have the kind of personnel. So there was a massive, quick effort to try to build that personnel. Now not only do we not have that workforce anymore, but we've also lost a lot of public health leaders. You know, it's like we had an enormous fire rip through the U.S. and we decided to systematically dismantle all of the fire departments. So I am deeply worried about how the U.S. would fare in another pandemic.

Amarsy: Jennifer says that sooner or later there will be another flu pandemic. Whether it will be caused by H5N1 or another bird flu virus, we just don't know. But the way we prepare today, from the vaccine seeds built in labs like Luis's to the critical research conducted by Adolfo to the care administered in Shira's hospital, will determine how strong our response is—and whether the next outbreak will upend our world.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We hope you've enjoyed this week's special series on bird flu. We'll be back with something new on Monday.

Meditation's Benefits Stretch Beyond the Person Who Meditates

Often framed as a boon for personal wellness, meditation helps us connect with and support others, too

By Mariah G. Schug edited by Daisy Yuhas

Listening to the daily news, with stories of war and conflict, can be disheartening. Unsurprisingly, data suggest that a majority of Americans feel exhausted and hopeless when they think about politics. Some psychologists have argued that Americans suffer from a sort of learned helplessness—the sense that nothing we do will make a difference—from hearing about violence such as mass shootings. We feel the pain of events in the news cycle but see ourselves as powerless to stop them.

In terms of coping with these events, meditation could help in more ways than one. The power of meditation for cultivating personal well-being is hardly a secret. For more than 20 years, neuroscientists have been documenting how mindfulness meditation can help people cultivate calm and improve their mood, among other benefits. Some recent research suggests it can also help people experience deeper psychological transformation, allowing regular practitioners to reach important insights about themselves and their world.

But there's another consequence of meditation that people do not always anticipate. Despite the ways in which wellness movements have emphasized a highly individualistic way of thinking about meditation and self-care, meditation can also help care for and support others.

When one person takes the time to regularly be still and attend to a specific cue, such as their breath or a mantra, their practice can have spillover benefits for the people around them. It's an idea that several studies have explored to date and one that dovetails with recent investigations into what scientists call the social ripple effect, or the idea that one person's behavior, mood or attitudes can spread throughout a community. It is also a potent reminder of how bringing a spirit of calm and compassion towards oneself may translate into something beneficial to those around us.

Some meditators propose that if enough people had a regular practice, the result would be a world enriched with calm and compassionate people. And there's science to support that idea. Research demonstrates that people who meditate show increased positivity toward others. For instance, training in meditation is linked to increased sensitivity to and engagement with human suffering and an increased tendency toward altruism. Similarly, meditation interventions aimed at increasing kindness are associated with reduced bias toward numerous “others,” including ethnic out-groups, people experiencing homelessness and people who face stigma because of their weight.

In one classic study, 20 people received eight weeks of meditation training, and another 19 were put on a wait list for training. Afterward each participant came to an appointment and had to wait in a crowded room with just one available seat. When a researcher came in, pretending to be another person with an appointment who had a seemingly painful broken foot, the people who had received meditation training were significantly more likely to give up their seat than study participants who had not received this training.

So why might one person's meditation practice benefit the people around them? There are many plausible mechanisms. For one, as meditation trains participants to be aware in the present moment, it may promote sensitivity to others' perspectives and emotions. Another possibility is that we sometimes dismiss others' pain because it will cause us discomfort—but meditation can help practitioners better cope with negative emotions, making it less painful to engage with and respond to others' suffering. In line with these ideas, researchers published findings in 2023 that showed that meditation increased people's concern for the suffering of others—and that, by comparison, people without this practice were more oriented to their own distress.

Meditation may also help people develop strong interpersonal relationships. The practice may leave people in a better mood overall and build up their emotional control, both of which could improve their interactions with others. Last spring a study that compared 47 physicians who were trained in meditation with 47 who did not have this training found that doctors in the meditation group were less anxious about communicating with their patients and reported having more trust in others. Critically, the meditating participants were also less likely to practice defensive medicine, in which doctors make health care choices based on fear of litigation instead of best practice. The higher-quality social interactions that emerged with meditation training seemed to improve doctor-patient interactions and ultimately the care that doctors provided to their patients.

It's possible that the meditators' improved relationships and interactions have even broader benefits. Research on a phenomenon called the social ripple effect suggests a person's attributes can spread through and beyond their social network. For example, in a study published in 2024, when researchers wanted to find the best way to deliver an intervention aimed at reducing newborn infant mortality to people living in 176 isolated villages in the Honduran highlands, they provided information on prenatal health, safe delivery and newborn care to a subset of people in these communities who had strong social connections. Teaching those socially influential individuals triggered a knowledge spillover by two degrees of separation, such that friends of friends of these villagers knew at least some of the health information two years after the researchers' initial efforts. The researchers thus found a way to target a subset of the population while reaching far more. Although social ripple studies have yet to explore meditation, it's possible a similar phenomenon occurs. Some experienced meditators have argued that cultivating a state of compassion in oneself helps us bring that attitude toward others. Perhaps, in turn, they pass some calm and compassion along too.

Whatever may be at play, the science of meditation's social consequences are heartening. Often, the challenges of the world can feel overwhelming, and one person's actions may seem to make very little difference. But this research is a reminder that when we improve our own well-being, we can also improve the lives of others. The benefits of just one person cultivating peace and compassion may have a cascading impact.

How a Passing Star Could Oust Planets from the Solar System

Close stellar encounters could change the structure of our planetary system, potentially dooming Earth or other worlds to oblivion

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

This artist's concept depicts one of the solar system's inner planets slamming into Earth after being nudged on a collision course by a passing star. Such a world-shattering cataclysm is extremely unlikely to befall us, but recent studies suggest it's not technically impossible.

There's a bit of a paradox about our galaxy: it's both jam-packed with stars and cavernously empty.

The Milky Way is crowded in the sense that it holds hundreds of billions of stars, as well as sprawling clouds of gas and dust. But even so, there is a lot of elbow room: the nearest star to the sun is more than four light-years distant, separated from us by tens of trillions of kilometers. That's an immense distance and difficult to even analogize. Saying our fastest space probes would take tens of thousands of years to reach the nearest star is still such a ponderous concept that it's hard to grasp.

Of course, there are more crowded spots, too. Some stellar clusters pack thousands of stars into a small volume of space, and the bustling galactic center swarms with stars. But out here in the galactic suburbs, stars are more spread out, providing one another plenty of room as they orbit through the Milky Way.

Still, given enough time, some stars will encroach on our personal space. About 80,000 years ago a small red dwarf called Scholz's star passed the sun at a distance of just 0.85 light-year. Looking ahead, about 1.3 million years hence, the star Gliese 710 will give us a close shave by 0.17 light-year.

That may seem like a long time on a human scale, but that's barely a tick of the galactic clock. The sun and its retinue of planets, asteroids and comets have been around for more than 4.5 billion years. Across that yawning stretch of time, it's a near certainty the sun has had some close encounters of the stellar kind.

What sort of effect does that have on the solar system?

We know that the sun is surrounded by a vast halo of trillions of icy bodies collectively called the Oort Cloud; although each individual object is far too faint to see with modern equipment, every now and again, one will drop down into the inner solar system and grace our skies as a long-period comet. Estimates of the cloud's size vary, but it could stretch more than a light-year from the sun. A star passing through that region could gravitationally poke at those ice balls, nudging hundreds or even thousands of them toward the sun, and some of them could hit an inner planet. Some researchers have even speculated that such a close pass could provoke a mass extinction event.

Research published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters showed that the passage of Scholz's star was unlikely to trigger such an event; the star is too much of a lightweight and was moving too quickly to significantly jostle the Oort Cloud and rain death upon our world. Given enough time, however, other stars could indeed stir up trouble in the distant reaches of the outer solar system. Happily, we probably have thousands of millennia to prepare.

But such a celestial drive-by can have other unsettling consequences as well.

Many astronomers have wondered about the long-term stability of the solar system's planets, given that they interact with each other gravitationally over the eons. The early solar system was wracked with profound instabilities, but more recently such effects have been far more subtle. Oddly enough, Mercury, the innermost planet, is particularly susceptible to these. The physics behind this is complex, but in a nutshell, small changes in the orbit of Neptune—the major planet most affected by a star passing by—propagate inward. It tugs on Uranus, which tugs on Saturn, which tugs on Jupiter, and the solar system's most massive planet affects everything else. Its orbit and that of Mercury can fall into a resonance in which the orbital periods (the “years” of both planets) are simple ratios of each other. When this happens, Mercury gets an added kick (literally, like when a child on a playground swing kicks at the right moment, pumping up their oscillations).

It's been known for decades that these effects can change the ellipticity of Mercury's orbit, sometimes stretching it out into a long oval. If the orbit were to get too elongated, Mercury could fall into the sun or get close enough to Venus to get flung out of the solar system. Mars, too, could fall prey to this; like Mercury, it has a more oval-shaped orbit than that of Earth or Venus and can find its orbit changing shape radically over a sufficiently long time frame.

In the past, most of those simulations assumed the solar system to be in isolation, with no other stars nearby sticking their noses in our business. But we know that's not the case, and such stellar interference must be accounted for to understand the solar system's evolution.

Many simulations that do include passing stars don't usually take all the effects into complete consideration; for example, they run their models for a few tens of millions of years even though it can take billions for gradually growing instabilities to have an impact. Others have used limited modeling of stellar encounters, meaning that they haven't included the entire possible range of masses, velocities and passage distances expected from stars in the galaxy.

Research published online in the planetary science journal Icarus last month attempts to address all these factors in more robust simulations of the solar system's dynamic evolution. What the authors find is that some celestial bodies are a little less stable than previously thought, given how often stars pass by the sun.

Not surprisingly, Pluto is the hardest hit. (The researchers only modeled the eight major planets plus Pluto.) Previously, Pluto was thought to have a pretty stable orbit, but the new simulations show that over the course of about five billion years, there's a 4 percent chance for Pluto to be ejected from the solar system entirely.

These passes also increase Mercury's odds of an unhappy end. Previous studies showed a roughly 1 percent chance of it dropping into the sun or being ejected from the solar system because of planetary dynamics in the next five billion years or so, but according to the new study, there's an additional 0.56 percent chance that these events could occur via stellar interactions. Mars, too, has a 0.3 percent chance of the fate of getting an extreme sunburn or starlessly wandering the galaxy.

Earth isn't immune, either. The new research finds that our own fair world has a 0.2 percent chance of being involved in a planetary collision or ejected into interstellar space. The odds are low, certainly, but higher than I'd care for given the world-shattering stakes.

At this point I think I should remind you of the timescale involved: we're talking five billion years into the future, which is roughly the same amount of time that's elapsed since the solar system was born in the first place. That's a long time, so this is not something you or I should personally worry about. Plus, we don't know of any stars that will pass terribly close to us for several million years anyway. In the shorter term, I'm more concerned about—in chronologically ascending order—global warming (at the timescale of decades), medium-sized asteroids (centuries), supervolcanoes (hundreds of millennia) and giant-sized asteroids (tens of millions of years).

Remember, too, that the solar system has been around a long time and, crucially, Earth is still here. It's been batted around a bit, but life persists. Over the very long term, the universe is a dangerous place, but for now, for us—cosmically speaking, at least—we can breathe easy.

New Proof Dramatically Compresses Space Needed for Computation

Surprising new work bucks 50 years of assumptions about the trade-offs between computation space and time

By Max Springer edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Once upon a time computers filled entire rooms, reading numbers from spinning tapes and churning them through wires to do chains of basic arithmetic. Today they slip into our pockets, performing in a tiny fraction of a second what used to take hours. But even as chips shrink and gain speed, theorists are flipping the question from how much computation space we can pack into a machine to how little is enough to get the job done.

This inquiry lies at the heart of computational complexity, a measure of the limits of what problems can be solved and at what cost in time and space. For nearly 50 years theorists believed that if solving a problem takes t steps, it should also need roughly t bits of memory—the 0s and 1s that a machine uses to record information. (Technically, that equation was t/log(t), but for the numbers involved log(t) is typically negligibly small.) If a task involves 100 steps, for instance, you'd expect to need at least 100 bits, enough to diligently log each step. Using fewer bits was thought to require more steps—like alphabetizing your books by swapping them one by one on the shelf instead of pulling them all out and reshelving them. But in a surprising finding described this week at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing in Prague, Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist Ryan Williams found that any problem solvable in time t needs only about √t bits of memory: a 100-step computation could be compressed and solved with something on the order of 10 bits. “This result shows the prior intuition is completely false,” Williams says. “I thought there must be something wrong [with the proof] because this is extremely unexpected.”

The breakthrough relies on a “reduction,” a means of transforming one problem into another that may seem unrelated but is mathematically equivalent. With reductions, packing a suitcase maps onto determining a monthly budget: the size of your suitcase represents your total budget, pieces of clothing correspond to potential expenses, and carefully deciding which clothes can fit is like allocating your budget. Solving one problem would then directly solve the other. This idea is at the core of Williams's result: any problem can be transformed into one you can solve by cleverly reusing space, deftly cramming the necessary information into just a square-root number of bits. Thus, the original problem must be solvable with this compact container.

“This progress is unbelievable,” says Mahdi Cheraghchi, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan. “Before this result, there were problems you could solve in a certain amount of time, but many thought you couldn't do so with such little space.” Williams's finding, he adds, is “a step in the right direction that we didn't know how to take.”

While computers have continued to shrink, our theoretical understanding of their efficiency has exploded, suggesting that the real constraint is not how much memory we have but how wisely we use it.

The Williamsburg Bray School predated the United States' official founding. But it has a dark history.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Few schools can say they're older than the countries in which they reside, but the Williamsburg Bray School holds that distinct honor.

The Bray School was also one of the oldest schools in the United States dedicated to educating Black Americans. From 1760 to 1774, head teacher Ann Wager taught both free and enslaved students lessons from the Anglican Church. While the Bray School may seem revolutionary for its time, its history was actually much darker. The school was founded for the flawed purpose of convincing enslaved children to accept their circumstances. 

Today, the school serves as a key chapter in the history of Black education, yet historians know little about the students who actually attended. Luckily, researchers just discovered a few more pieces of the puzzle: the near-complete foundation of the Bray School and an undocumented cellar filled with centuries worth of artifacts. The remains fall on the College of William & Mary's (W&M) campus in Virginia; excavations were led by the school's Center for Archeological Research. 

According to a press release from W&M, the remnants of the cellar are sizable, measuring 36 feet by 18 feet. Tom Higgins, an archeologist for the Center, explained in the release that the cellar likely had multiple levels and was dug soon after the original foundation was laid. These recent excavations revealed the bottom of the cellar to be nearly 18 inches higher than previous research found.

“The discovery of this cellar is thrilling,” W&M President Katherine Rowe said in the release. “The roots of our city and university entwine here. Every layer of history that it reveals gives us new insights into our early republic, from the Williamsburg Bray School through the generations that followed, up through the early 20th century.”

 Perhaps even more valuable than the cellar itself is the historic treasure archeologists found while digging. The artifacts discovered at the site provide a rich story spanning from the 18th to the mid-20th century. The newly found broken pottery shards, slate pencil pieces, buttons, and jewelry painted a picture of everyday life at the Bray School. 

According to the release, one of the team's favorite discoveries was part of a broken glass depicting the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. One researcher at the center, Michele L. Brumfield, explained that the glass may have come from one of the school girls furnishing her dorm room, though the researchers say they're hesitant to draw any conclusions because “it's early days.” 

Now that these once-lost stories have come to light, some of the artifacts will be displayed as a permanent installation in W&M's Gates Hall. Other treasures will be lent to The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and exhibited at the Colin G. and Nancy N. Campbell Archaeology Center once it opens in 2026. 

In the meantime, there's still much more to be done at the site. 

“This is exciting,” Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of the W&M Bray School Lab, said in the press release. “What else are we about to learn? We are not done understanding the history of the Williamsburg Bray School, the history of Black education. We are not done learning the history of this area, and we are certainly not done learning the history of this country.”

When figuring out a solution, it helps to approach a problem from every possible angle. The same can be said for climate change-induced ice melt in the Antarctic, which is why the  International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) programmed an automated underwater vehicle (AUV)—nicknamed “Ran”—to dive into the cavity of the Dotson Ice Shelf, located near Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. 

Over the course of 27 days, the submarine traveled more than 600 miles—including 10 miles directly into the cavity itself—to both figure out the mechanics of how glaciers melt faster near strong underwater currents and glimpse the topography of this all-important ice shelf. What the experts behind this submersible found is that the attributes along the western part of the ice shelf differ greatly with the eastern portion, which is thicker and therefore melting more slowly.

The Ran AUV also produced high resolution maps of the underside of the Dotson Ice Shelf that revealed strange tear-drop features, icy plateaus, and detailed erosion patterns. The results of the study were published last week in the journal Science Advances.

“We have previously used satellite data and ice cores to observe how glaciers change over time,” Anna Wåhlin, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “By navigating the submersible into the cavity, we were able to get high resolution maps of the ice underside. It's a bit like seeing the back of the Moon.”

Unlike glaciers, which rest on land, ice shelves are actually a part of the ocean. They sort of act like a buttress that keeps ice on land from flowing into the ocean and raising sea levels, and are are vitally important to these polar ecosystem as a result. And because these shelves rest on the ocean, it's possible to get under them.

But just because it's possible doesn't mean it's easy.

The 20-foot-long Ran submersible used pulsed sound waves (advanced multibeam sonar) on the ice to map its features, but because of its subantarctic location, Wåhlin and her team couldn't communicate with the AUV or track its movements with GPS. After 14 missions—some lasting a couple hours and others stretching longer than a day—Ran mapped around 50 square miles of ice, and the structures imaged were more complex than anyone imagined. 

“The mapping has given us a lot of new data that we need to look at more closely,” Wåhlin said in a press statement. “It is clear that many previous assumptions about melting of glacier undersides are falling short. Current models cannot explain the complex patterns we see. But with this method, we have a better chance of finding the answers.”

One of the team's discoveries is that the different melt rates between east and west portions of the Dotson Ice Shelf could be explained by a phenomenon known as the modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW), which is when Pacific and Indian Ocean water mix with other local water masses that impact the ice base. This data was supplemented by Ran's measurements of these underwater currents, as well as the high melting rates of fractures that run through the glacier. 

Although the team's initial mission was to study the nearby Thwaites glacier, the environment proved too difficult to access. The Dotson Ice Shelf, however, served as the perfect candidate to test the equipment and methods, according to The New York Times. These surveys were conducted in 2022, and  the team returned earlier this year to see what changes to the ice shelf had occurred. That's when Wåhlin and her team's worst fears were realized—Ran didn't emerge at the pre-planned rendezvous point. The team suspects that the AUV either ran aground or became the target of some curious seals. 

“Although we got valuable data back, we did not get all we had hoped for. These scientific advances were made possible thanks to the unique submersible that Ran was,” Wåhlin said in a press statement. “This research is needed to understand the future of Antarctica's ice sheet, and we hope to be able to replace Ran and continue this important work.”

Biological drugs have improved the lives of many people with severe asthma. However, a new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that some immune cells with high inflammatory potential are not completely eradicated after treatment.

Biological drugs (biologics) have become an important tool in the treatment of severe asthma.

""They help most patients to keep their symptoms under control, but exactly how these drugs affect the immune system has so far remained unknown,"" says Valentyna Yasinska, consultant in pulmonary medicine at Karolinska University Hospital and doctoral student at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medicine in Huddinge.

In a new study published in the scientific journal Allergy, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have explored what happens to the immune cells of patients being treated with biologics. By analyzing blood samples from 40 patients before and during treatment, they found that instead of disappearing during treatment, certain types of immune cell - which play a key part in asthma inflammation - actually increased.

""This suggests that biologics might not attack the root of the problem, no matter how much they help asthma patients during treatment,"" says Jenny Mjösberg, professor of tissue immunology at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medicine in Huddinge. ""Continued treatment might be necessary to keep the disease under control.""

The study is based on data from patients with severe asthma sourced from the BIOCROSS study. The researchers used advanced methods such as flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing to determine the properties and function of the immune cells.

""We were surprised to find that blood levels of inflammatory cells increased rather than decreased,"" says Lorenz Wirth, doctoral student at the same department at Karolinska Institutet. ""This could explain why inflammation of the airways often returns when the treatment is tapered or discontinued. It is important that we understand the long-term immunological effects of these drugs.""

Little is still known about the long-term effects of biologics like mepolizumab and dupilumab since they are relatively new, having been prescribed to asthmatics for less than ten years.

The next stage of the study will be to analyse samples from patients with a long treatment history and to study lung tissue to see how the immune cells are affected in the airways.

The study was financed by grants from the EU (Horizon 2020), the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, the Centre for Innovative Medicine, the Swedish state, the Torsten Söderberg Foundation, Karolinska Institutet and the ChAMP Consortium.

Ultra-intense lasers can accelerate electrons to near-light speeds within a single oscillation (or 'wave cycle') of the electric field, making them a powerful tool for studying extreme physics. However, their rapid fluctuations and complex structure make real-time measurements of their properties challenging. Until now, existing techniques typically required hundreds of laser shots to assemble a complete picture, limiting our ability to capture the dynamic nature of these extreme light pulses.

Ultra-intense lasers can accelerate electrons to near-light speeds within a single oscillation (or 'wave cycle') of the electric field, making them a powerful tool for studying extreme physics. However, their rapid fluctuations and complex structure make real-time measurements of their properties challenging. Until now, existing techniques typically required hundreds of laser shots to assemble a complete picture, limiting our ability to capture the dynamic nature of these extreme light pulses.

The new study, jointly led by researchers in the University of Oxford's Department of Physics and the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, describes a novel single-shot diagnostic technique, named RAVEN (Real-time Acquisition of Vectorial Electromagnetic Near-fields). This method allows scientists to measure the full shape, timing, and alignment of individual ultra-intense laser pulses with high precision.

Having a complete picture of the laser pulse's behaviour could revolutionise performance gains in many areas. For example, it could enable scientists to fine-tune laser systems in real-time (even for lasers that fire only occasionally) and bridge the gap between experimental reality and theoretical models, providing better data for computer models and AI-powered simulations.

The method works by splitting the laser beam into two parts. One of these is used to measure how the laser's color (wavelength) changes over time, whilst the other part passes through a birefringent material (which separates light with different polarization states). A microlens array (a grid of tiny lenses) then records how the laser pulse's wavefront (shape and direction) is structured. The information is recorded by a specialized optical sensor, which captures it in a single image from which a computer program reconstructs the full structure of the laser pulse.

Lead researcher Sunny Howard (PhD researcher in the Department of Physics, University of Oxford and visiting scientist to Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich) said: ""Our approach enables, for the first time, the complete capture of an ultra-intense laser pulse in real-time, including its polarization state and complex internal structure. This not only provides unprecedented insights into laser-matter interactions but also paves the way for optimizing high-power laser systems in a way that was previously impossible.""

The technique was successfully tested on the ATLAS-3000 petawatt-class laser in Germany, where it revealed small distortions and wave shifts in the laser pulse that were previously impossible to measure in real-time, allowing the research team to fine-tune the instrument. These distortions, known as spatio-temporal couplings, can significantly affect the performance of high-intensity laser experiments.

By providing real-time feedback, RAVEN allows for immediate adjustments, improving the accuracy and efficiency of experiments in plasma physics, particle acceleration, and high-energy density science. It also results in significant time savings, since multiple shots are not required to fully characterize the laser pulse's properties.

The technique also provides a potential new route to realize inertial fusion energy devices in the laboratory - a key gateway step towards generating fusion energy at a scale sufficient to power societies. Inertial fusion energy devices use ultra-intense laser pulses to generate highly energetic particles within a plasma, which then propagate into the fusion fuel. This 'auxiliary heating' concept requires accurate knowledge of the focused laser pulse intensity to target to optimize the fusion yield, one now provided by RAVEN. Focused lasers could also provide a powerful probe for new physics - for instance, generating photon-photon scattering in a vacuum by directing two pulses at each other.

Co-author Professor Peter Norreys (Department of Physics, University of Oxford), says: ""Where most existing methods would require hundreds of shots, RAVEN achieves a complete spatio-temporal characterization of a laser pulse in just one. This not only provides a powerful new tool for laser diagnostics but also has the potential to accelerate progress across a wide range of ultra-intense laser applications, promising to push the boundaries of laser science and technology.""

Co-author Dr Andreas Döpp (Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich and visiting scientist to Atomic and Laser Physics, University of Oxford) adds: ""Shortly after Sunny joined us in Munich for a year it finally 'clicked' and we realized the beautiful result underpinning RAVEN: that because ultra-intense pulses are confined to such a tiny space and time when focused, there are fundamental limits on how much resolution is actually needed to perform this type of diagnostic. This was a game changer, and meant we could use micro lenses, making our setup much simpler.""

Looking ahead, the researchers hope to expand the use of RAVEN to a broader range of laser facilities and explore its potential in optimizing inertial fusion energy research, laser-driven particle acceleratorsandhigh-field quantum electrodynamics experiments.

This study was conducted in collaboration with Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, and the John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science. The work was supported by the UKRI-STFC and funding bodies in Germany and the European Union.

Scientists from TU Delft (The Netherlands) have observed quantum spin currents in graphene for the first time without using magnetic fields. These currents are vital for spintronics, a faster and more energy-efficient alternative to electronics. This breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, marks an important step towards technologies like quantum computing and advanced memory devices.

Quantum physicist Talieh Ghiasi has demonstrated the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect in graphene for the first time without any external magnetic fields. The QSH effect causes electrons to move along the edges of the graphene without any disruption, with all their spins pointing in the same direction. ""Spin is a quantum mechanical property of electrons, which is like a tiny magnet carried by the electrons, pointing up or down,"" Ghiasi explains. ""We can leverage the spin of electrons to transfer and process information in so-called spintronics devices. Such circuits hold promise for next-generation technologies, including faster and more energy-efficient electronics, quantum computing, and advanced memory devices.""

On-chip integration

Realizing quantum transport in graphene typically requires applying large external magnetic fields that are not compatible with electronic circuitries. ""In particular, the detection of quantum spin currents in graphene has always required large magnetic fields that are practically impossible to integrate on-chip. Thus, the fact that we are now achieving the quantum spin currents without the need for external magnetic fields opens the path for the future applications of these quantum spintronic devices,"" says Ghiasi.

Spin transport in graphene

The scientists from the Van der Zant lab were able to bypass the need for external fields by layering the graphene on top of a magnetic material: CrPS₄. This magnetic layer significantly altered the graphene's electronic properties, giving rise to the QSH effect in graphene. Ghiasi: ""We observed that the spin transport in graphene gets modified by the neighboring CrPS4 such that the flow of electrons in graphene becomes dependent on the electrons' spin direction.""

Preserving spin information

The quantum spin currents that the scientists detect in the graphene-CrPS4 stack are 'topologically' protected, implying that the spin signal travels stays intact over tens of micrometers long distances without losing the spin information in the circuit. ""These topologically-protected spin currents are robust against disorders and defects, making them reliable even in imperfect conditions,"" Ghiasi says. Preserving spin signal without any loss of information is vital for building spintronic circuits.

This discovery paves the way toward ultrathin, graphene-based spintronic circuits, promising advancements in next-generation memory and computing technologies. The observed spin currents in graphene offer a powerful new route for efficient and coherent transfer of quantum information through electron spins. These robust spintronic devices could serve as essential building blocks in quantum computing, seamlessly linking qubits together within quantum circuits.

For 540 million years, the ebb and flow in the strength of Earth's magnetic field has correlated with fluctuations in atmospheric oxygen, according to a newly released analysis by NASA scientists. The research suggests that processes deep inside the Earth might influence habitability on the planet's surface.

Earth's magnetic field arises from the flow of material in the planet's molten interior, which acts like a giant electromagnet. The flow isn't perfectly stable, and this causes the field to change over time.

Many scientists have argued that the magnetic field is crucial for protecting the atmosphere from eroded by energetic particles coming from the Sun. But, the authors of the study in Science Advances point out, the role of magnetic fields in preserving the atmosphere is an area of active research. Before addressing the complexity of the cause-and-effect relationship between magnetic fields and oxygen levels, the study authors decided to see whether Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere have fluctuated in ways that demonstrate a link.

The history of the Earth's magnetic fields is recorded in magnetized minerals. When hot minerals that rise with magma at gaps between spreading tectonic plates cool down, they can record the surrounding magnetic field. The minerals retain the field record as long as they are not reheated too severely. Scientists can deduce historic oxygen levels from ancient rocks and minerals because their chemical contents depend on the amount of oxygen available when they were formed. Data for both Earth's magnetic field and oxygen extend over comparable ranges in databases that myriad geophysicists and geochemists have compiled. Until now, the authors of the new study say, no scientists had made a detailed comparison of the records.

""These two datasets are very similar,"" said coauthor Weijia Kuang, a geophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""Earth is the only known planet that supports complex life. The correlations we've found could help us to understand how life evolves and how it's connected to the interior processes of the planet.""

When Kuang and colleagues analyzed the two separate datasets, they found that the planetary magnetic field has followed similar rising and falling patterns as oxygen in the atmosphere for nearly a half billion years, dating back to the Cambrian explosion, when complex life on Earth emerged.

""This correlation raises the possibility that both the magnetic field strength and the atmospheric oxygen level are responding to a single underlying process, such as the movement of Earth's continents,"" said study coauthor Benjamin Mills, a biogeochemist at the University of Leeds.

The researchers hope to examine longer datasets to see if the correlation extends farther back in time. They also plan to investigate the historic abundance of other chemicals essential for life as we know it, such as nitrogen, to determine whether they also support these patterns. As for the specific causes linking the Earth's deep interior to life on the surface, Kopparapu said: ""There's more work to be done to figure that out.""

Fatty liver disease, caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver, is estimated to affect one in four people worldwide. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, making it crucial to detect early and initiate treatment.

Currently, standard tests for diagnosing fatty liver disease include ultrasounds, CTs, and MRIs, which require costly specialized equipment and facilities. In contrast, chest X-rays are performed more frequently, are relatively inexpensive, and involve low radiation exposure. Although this test is primarily used to examine the condition of the lungs and heart, it also captures part of the liver, making it possible to detect signs of fatty liver disease. However, the relationship between chest X-rays and fatty liver disease has rarely been a subject of in-depth study.

Therefore, a research group led by Associate Professor Sawako Uchida-Kobayashi and Associate Professor Daiju Ueda at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Medicine developed an AI model that can detect the presence of fatty liver disease from chest X-ray images.

In this retrospective study, a total of 6,599 chest X-ray images containing data from 4,414 patients were used to develop an AI model utilizing controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores. The AI model was verified to be highly accurate, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.82 to 0.83.

""The development of diagnostic methods using easily obtainable and inexpensive chest X-rays has the potential to improve fatty liver detection. We hope it can be put into practical use in the future,"" stated Professor Uchida-Kobayashi.

Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka scientists have discovered that it takes mere minutes for a species of sex-changing fish to develop dominant behavior after a change in the pecking order.

The new study led by the Department of Anatomy and published on Proceedings of the Royal Society B, examines the New Zealand spotty, or paketi, a fish that can change from female to male during adulthood in response to a change in social hierarchy.

It found that the sex change process begins almost immediately when a dominant spotty is removed from a group.

Lead author Haylee Quertermous, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Anatomy, says although the full sex change process takes weeks, it only takes minutes for a second-ranked fish to take advantage of the power vacuum and assert dominant behaviors.

""The aggressive behaviors (called 'rushes') involved the dominant fish swimming rapidly towards subordinate individuals,"" she says.

""Sometimes the dominant fish will make physical contact with the subordinates, including taking bites at them, usually around their tail and fins. These aggressive behaviors are usually accompanied by the subordinate quickly swimming away ('escaping') from the dominant fish.""

While she expected to be able to see behavior changes within an hour of removing the dominant fish, she was surprised by just how rapid the change could be.

""In many of the tanks, second-ranked fish increased their aggression within just a few minutes after removal of the dominant fish.""

She cautions the dominant behavior that accompanies a female to male sex change in spotties does not indicate a change from typically 'female' to 'male' behavior, as other sex-changing fish species such as clownfish for example, change from male to more dominant female fish.

The researchers observed that spotties form linear dominance hierarchies based on size, with larger individuals dominating smaller ones.

They sought to determine which fish in the hierarchy were more likely to change sex when the opportunity arose.

Results show dominant, larger fish are more likely to change sex, and when social hierarchies are disrupted, less dominant fish can quickly change their behavior to seize new opportunities.

The study also delved into the neural mechanisms underlying spotties' social interactions, finding that the social decision-making network in the fish brain is highly involved in establishing dominance.

Fish that attained dominant positions showed significant differences in this network compared to fish of all other ranks.

Dr Kaj Kamstra, who led the neurobiological aspects of the research, says the findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between social behavior and neural processes in these fish.

""They also highlight the importance of social context in shaping individual behavior, shedding light on the evolution of social behavior and the flexibility of brain mechanisms in adapting to changing social environments.

""The research has broader implications for understanding social dynamics in other species, even humans.""

The findings can be applied to other species of sex-changing fish where social dominance appears to be the most common trigger for sex change, and could prove beneficial for aquaculture and open water fisheries, with many commercial valuable fisheries dependent on fishes that change sex, for example, New Zealand's blue cod.

With aging, deviation of human blood counts from their normal range accompanies the transition from health to disease. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) deliver life-long multi-lineage output, but their variation across healthy humans with aging, and their diagnostic utility, haven't been characterized in depth thus far. To address this, we introduced an HSPC reference model using single-cell RNA profiling of circulating CD34+ HSPCs from 148 healthy age- and sex-diverse individuals. We characterized physiological circulating HSPC composition, showed that age-related myeloid bias is predominant in older men and defined age-related transcriptional signatures in lymphoid progenitors. We further demonstrated the potential of this resource to facilitate the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from peripheral blood without bone marrow sampling, defining classes of patients with MDS and abnormal lymphocyte, basophil or granulocyte progenitor frequencies. Our resource provides insights into HSPC reference ranges across the lifespan and has the potential to facilitate the clinical applications of single-cell genomics in hematology.

The basis for understanding and defining human pathophysiological states is a detailed description of interindividual heterogeneity among healthy individuals. Large population studies have identified wide interindividual differences in complete blood counts (CBCs) of healthy individuals1 and exposed different age-related blood count changes, such as high red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW), macrocytic anemia and a reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts2. The establishment of reference values, or population-wide normal ranges for certain blood parameters, has been crucial for patient evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.

Although CBC reference ranges are used in the clinic daily, the equivalent reference range for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has not been established so far. As HSPCs reside mainly in the bone marrow (BM), access to these cells, especially in the healthy population, has been problematic, whereas their general paucity in the circulation made it quite challenging to characterize them efficiently from the blood. This has become feasible given modern technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

Individual heterogeneity in the frequency of circulating HSPCs (cHSPCs) has been reported in the past and was linked to age, sex, smoking status, lipid profiles and hereditary factors3, as well as to different pathological states4. Few studies have analyzed HSPC heterogeneity in higher resolution, but their sample size was limited5,6. Previous studies, including some based on scRNA-seq analysis7, demonstrated that most HSPC subpopulations can be identified in the peripheral blood (PB)8 and functional stem cells were identified in the PB of mice9 and humans7.

We have developed a reference model for healthy cHSPC distributions and provided proof-of-concept evidence supporting potential diagnostic applications. We applied scRNA-seq analysis to cHSPCs from 148 healthy age- and sex-diverse individuals, to capture a spectrum of states, from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), through early common myeloid and lymphoid progenitor states and more specific progenitor populations. All data can be explored in https://apps.tanaylab.com/MCV/blood_aging. We discovered extensive interindividual heterogeneity in the frequency of cHSPC subtypes and found that these correlate with certain CBC parameters, aging and the presence of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). We then developed tools for projecting new samples on our reference model and analyzed 73 additional samples from patients with cytopenia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), to demonstrate our model's potential applications in MDS diagnosis. The healthy reference model and methodologies used in the present study provide a framework for the deployment of single-cell genomics in hematology, for the diagnosis of MDS, and possibly other stem cell-related blood malignancies, from the PB, reducing the need for BM analysis.

To evaluate interpersonal diversity in subtype distribution and regulation of cHSPCs, we combined multiplexed scRNA-seq, bulk DNA genotyping and integrated clinical data (Fig. 1a). Multiplexing was resolved using SNPs identified in the 3′-UTR of cHSPCs' RNA, facilitating precise matching of cells to individuals and improving control for batch effects and doublets. Altogether, we collected cHSPCs from 79 men and 69 women between the ages of 23 years and 91 years (median 61.5 years) (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). We performed deep targeted somatic mutation analysis to identify cases of CH (Supplementary Table 1)10. After quality control and filtering, we retained 840,104 single-cell profiles, which were normalized to control for sequencing-platform batch effects and combined to construct and annotate a metacell manifold model11 (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). We retained 626,966 CD34+ single cells for downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1d). These formed a rich repertoire of states, associated with cHSPCs and their differentiation trajectories (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). The derived model recapitulated and deepened earlier characterization efforts of HSPC states from the BM. We noted that, although we could not assume that cHSPCs fully reflect BM HSPC dynamics, previous studies, as well as our own BM scRNA-seq comparisons, supported at least partial compatibility between the two12 (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3a). One notable characteristic specific to cHSPCs was, however, the repression of cell-cycle gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 3b), previously demonstrated by others7. Importantly, we found our cHSPC model to be consistent across individuals. The median number of individuals contributing cells to each metacell was 84 and all metacells included cells from at least 47 individuals. Expression differences between cell states were greater than between individuals, limiting individually specific differential expression when controlling for each sample's cell distribution over the atlas states (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Altogether, the data suggest that cHSPCs, although not fully reflecting BM hematopoiesis, can serve as a highly accessible proxy for hematopoietic dynamics.

One of the hallmarks of our cHSPC model is a distinct HSC state that is transcriptionally linked with two major differentiation gradients: the first represents a continuum of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs; subdivided into early (E) mid (M) and late (L) states). The second, more common branch, represents multipotent progenitor (MPP) states and their differentiation toward granulocyte–monocyte progenitors (GMPs), erythrocyte progenitors (ERYPs) and basophil, eosinophil or mast progenitors (BEMPs). Platelet contamination prevented precise megakaryocyte progenitor modeling (Extended Data Fig. 3e), such that states at the base of the myeloid trajectory were annotated as megakaryocyte, erythrocyte, basophil, eosinophil or mast progenitors (MEBEMPs, subdivided into early (E) and late (L) states).

Early HSCs are marked by high AVP and HLF expression and were previously shown to represent a rare cell population enriched with self-renewal capacity in both the BM and cord blood13. Our model included data on 14,440 HLF and AVP expressing HSCs that could be matched with cells from independent BM atlases14, suggesting that, under a steady state, HSCs with potential self-renewal capacity are present in the PB (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Further functional studies are needed to establish this finding. Together with HLF and AVP, we discovered 14 genes expressed at least 1.75-fold higher in HSCs compared with their 2 immediate differentiation branches (Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 2). We identified several transcription factors (TFs) enriched in HSCs, including HOXB5, TLE4 and GATA3 (Fig. 1c). GATA3 was previously reported to regulate self-renewal in murine long-term HSCs15. Its role in human HSCs has not been studied thus far. We note that, although the HSC state is defined by unique markers that are symmetrically downregulated on exiting to the CLP and MEBEMP trajectories (Fig. 1c), it also expresses several lineage-specific regulators at intermediate levels, which are bifurcating anti-symmetrically on exiting the HSC state to the CLP and MEBEMP trajectories (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3g). This may suggest that the multipotent capacity of HSCs is associated with intermediate expression of multiple regulators, which is resolved with differentiation.

The cHSPC atlas was enriched for BEMPs. Although classic studies linked these cells with a GMP origin, more recent studies suggested that these emerge, at least in part, from erythroid progenitors in both mice and humans7,16. Our analysis identified a small population of metacells linking BEMPs with their MEBEMP-L precursors (Fig. 1e). This highlighted TFs (Fig. 1f) and other factors (Extended Data Fig. 4a) positively or negatively regulated in this postulated early stage of BEMP specification. Another interesting cHSPC population included lymphoid states with high ACY3 expression and intermediate-to-low DNTT levels, a combination rarely found in human BM but present in PB (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We observed co-variation of key T cell regulators within this population and anti-correlation of these factors with some Hallmark plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) regulators, as demonstrated by comparison of TCF7 and IRF8 expression (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4c). We therefore termed this population natural killer (NK) cell, T cell and DC progenitors (NKTDPs)17,18. To summarize, our map of cHSPCs showed a rich spectrum of progenitor states, which refined previous analyses and a remarkable consistency of these states across individuals. This provided an opportunity for deciphering interindividual hematopoietic variability based on our solid and quantitative definition of cHSPC subtypes.

To study interindividual cHSPC variation, we first analyzed cell-state compositions by quantifying cell-state relative frequencies within each individual's single-cell ensemble (Fig. 2a). These frequencies varied extensively between individuals as shown in Fig. 2b. For example, HSCs and CLP-Ms, representing 2.4% and 12.6% of the CD34+ population on average, showed s.d. values of 1.0% and 6.8%, respectively. The abundant MPP and MEBEMP-E states (mean frequencies of 20.7% and 37.6%) showed smaller relative variations (s.d. values of 4.9% and 5.8%, respectively). To analyze the stability of cell-state frequencies across time and sampling instances, we re-sampled 20 individuals 1 year after their original sampling date. Both CLP (CLP-E, CLP-M, CLP-L and NKTDP) and MEBEMP (MEBEMP-E, MEBEMP-L, ERYP and BEMP) frequencies were stable within the same individual across time (Fig. 2c).

The percentage was calculated from all CD34+ cells within each individual's single-cell ensemble.

The numbers represent the mean ± s.d. for each distribution. c, Comparison of cell-state frequencies between 19 biological replicates and their original samples, for CLP (CLP-E, CLP-M, CLP-L and NKTDP) populations (top) and MEBEMP (MEBEMP-E, MEBEMP-L, ERYP and BEMP) populations (bottom). The diagonal y = x is shown in red. All biological replicates were sampled 1 year after their original sampling date. d, Top: cell-state frequency profiles over the HSC-MEBEMP and HSC-CLP differentiation gradients of six sampled individuals (colored lines), each representing one of six archetypes (classes) of cHSPC composition observed in healthy individuals.

Bottom: cell-state enrichment map over 15 differentiation bins (rows), for all studied individuals (columns) clustered into six classes (Methods).

Panel a created with BioRender.com.

To analyze composition in higher resolution, we profiled each individual's enrichment over the CLP and MEBEMP trajectories. Clustering of these enrichment profiles yielded six archetypes of cHSPC composition within the healthy population (classes I–VI, Fig. 2d). These were composed of individuals with relative lymphoid enrichment (classes I and II) or depletion (classes V and VI), further subdivided by a stemness gradient, enriched in classes II, IV and VI and depleted in classes I, III and V. Analysis of technical and biological replicates confirmed this variation to be robust and individual-specific (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). To summarize, we constructed cHSPC subtype normal reference ranges and showed that, although HSPC cell states are consistent among healthy individuals, their compositions are highly variable.

To extract an initial clinical annotation for the observed interindividual variation in cHSPC state frequencies, we correlated individual compositions with longitudinal CBC data (Methods). We observed a significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between PB mature lymphocyte counts (%) and CLP frequencies (Fig. 2e, left). Given the high variability in female RBC counts and volumes during menstruation, pregnancies and prolonged perimenopausal periods, we analyzed RBC indices (count, hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and RDW) separately for men and women. We observed a significant negative correlation (P < 0.02) between CLP frequencies and HCT (men, Fig. 2e, middle) and a significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between increased RDW and relative CLP depletion (men, Fig. 2e, right). Our previous work19 and the work of others20 correlated high RDW with CH and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. Our data suggest that reduction in CLP frequencies is associated with CH (Extended Data Fig. 6a). A similar trend was suggested by genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT)21 performed on one of our DNMT3A R882H cases, showing a lower fraction of CLP cells within the mutant clone (P < 0.005, Fisher's exact test; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Although this trend was suggested in other GoT data22, sample size is insufficient to prove it statistically and explore the clonal mechanisms underlying it. To further explore the association between CH and RDW, we studied a cohort of 18,147 healthy individuals for whom we had both longitudinal CBCs and DNA available. We identified 602 individuals with a high RDW (>15%, not meeting minimal criteria for MDS diagnosis) and 602 age- and sex-matched normal RDW controls. We performed deep targeted sequencing to identify leukemia-associated mutations on both high-RDW individuals and controls, and found a significant enrichment of CH+ cases in the high-RDW group (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.002; Fig. 2f and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Altogether, the data suggest associations across decreased CLP frequencies and elevated RDW and CH. Determination of the existence of a direct (and perhaps three-way) linkage for these variables requires further investigation.

Analysis of age-linked compositional changes in cHSPCs within CH-negative individuals showed a remarkable increase in myeloid (MEBEMP) to lymphoid (CLP) progenitor ratios in men (when comparing <50 to >60-year-old individuals; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6c). This effect was insignificant in women. Of note, although both men and women experience a decline in lymphocyte counts with aging, it occurs at an older age in women, as confirmed by recent analyses2. Notably, women show a temporary postmenopausal surge in lymphocyte counts, which delays their decline. Within the MEBEMP differentiation trajectory, aging was correlated with over-representation of more differentiated states, once again only in men (Fig. 3b). Of note, the frequency of cHSCs did not significantly change with age (Fig. 3c). Although previous studies suggest that aging is linked with an increase in HSC frequency23,24, this was not observed with the restrictive definitions employed in the present study. We further identified an age-related decline in CD34+ HSPC frequency in a cohort of 1,000 healthy individuals undergoing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) scRNA-seq25 (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6d), which has also been reported by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in the past3. The sex-specific correlation between age and cHSPC myeloid bias could be related to cell intrinsic properties, such as male-specific leukemia-associated mutations predisposing to myeloid differentiation26. This is less likely because canonical CH-positive cases were excluded from this analysis. Alternatively, this predominantly male myeloid bias could be related to cell extrinsic factors such as age-related hormonal and BM microenvironmental changes27,28.

As shown above, individual cHSPC compositions provide an initial blueprint of hematopoietic dynamics along the stemness and CLP or MEBEMP axes, with age-dependent changes. Composition-normalized gene expression profiles were further correlated with age, enabling age prediction based on normalized gene expression alone (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 6e; see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 for additional screening for age-, CBC-, CH- and sex-associated gene expression). We next looked for gene groups (signatures) that co-variate between individuals, filtering out sex-linked signatures and those showing strong batch effects. The most prominent of these signatures included Lamin-A (LMNA) as well as ANXA1, AHNAK, MYADM, TSPAN2 and VIM, among others (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Table 7). Individual LMNA signature expression varied across a range of more than twofold (Extended Data Fig. 6g), exhibiting high expression variability in HSCs and early myeloid and lymphoid cell states, and a homogeneously low expression in late MEBEMPs and CLPs (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Individual LMNA signature expression was consistent in myeloid and lymphoid cell states (Fig. 3g) and was stable in our follow-up cohort (Extended Data Fig. 6i). We observed an age-linked increase in LMNA signature expression in lymphoid, but not myeloid, cHSPCs (Fig. 3h). Future studies on larger cohorts, enriched with clinical data, could further explore the age-related LMNA signature overexpression in CLPs and how it correlates with disease and immune function. Taken together, we show that, in addition to the accumulation of leukemic mutations in HSPCs, aging is linked with changes in the distribution of progenitor cell states within the PB and with notable expression differences in certain gene signatures. The mechanistic basis for this variation and its clinical impact remain unresolved.

The differentiation of HSPCs toward MEBEMP and CLP fates involves coordinated activation and repression of specific transcriptional programs which are conserved across individuals. Yet, our screen for interindividual variation in gene signature expression suggested that individuals differed in the way in which they synchronized the opposing effects of these stemness and differentiation programs. To quantify this variation, we compared AVP (stemness) and GATA1 (MEBEMP differentiation) signatures (Supplementary Table 8) on a 20 × 20 bin expression matrix (Fig. 3i). Although most individuals displayed dynamics close to the diagonal line (individuals N16 and N86, for example), following the typical transition from stemness to differentiation, some individuals deviated from the diagonal, indicating skewed synchronization between AVP and GATA1 signatures. We quantified this deviation (that is, off-diagonal frequency) using a synchronization-score (sync-score). This facilitated the identification of individuals with sync-scores as low as 0.12 (N122 and N172, for example, Fig. 3i, top), indicating delayed activation of GATA1 relative to AVP repression. In contrast, individuals exhibiting a high sync-score (N98 and N121, for example, Fig. 3i, bottom) show early activation of GATA1 expression, which precedes AVP repression. Interindividual sync-score variability (Extended Data Fig. 6j) was positively correlated with RBC levels and consistently anti-correlated with MCV in men (P < 0.01 (Spearman's) for both RBC and MCV; Fig. 3j). Analysis of the correlation between individual sync-scores and cHSPC compositions in men demonstrated a negative correlation with ERYPs (Fig. 3k). In summary, variation in the coordination of stemness and MEBEMP differentiation programs correlated with RBC counts and volumes. More studies on larger cohorts are needed to explore how this coordination relates to age-related macrocytic anemia.

Diagnosis of myeloid malignancies requires the identification of clonal markers (mutations or structural variants) and the detection and quantification of blasts and dysplasia, by next-generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, microscopy and flow cytometry of BM specimens. In Fig. 4a we described a stepwise approach for analysis of myeloid disorders based on sampling of cHSPCs and comparison of their compositions, normalized expression and copy number variations (CNVs) to our normal reference (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). As proof of concept, we focused on MDS diagnosis. First, we reconstructed the reference model using data from 79 healthy individuals, putting aside some normal samples for classifier training. We then performed additional sequencing to obtain data from 44 patients with MDS and 29 patients with cytopenia (Supplementary Tables 9–11). We developed a streamlined in silico sorting scheme for quantifying the cHSPC composition of a new PB sample given the reference (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) and used it to identify cases with abnormal compositions (Fig. 4b,c, Extended Data Fig. 8a and Methods). Classification included subpopulations (GMP-L, pre-B, pro-B and MkP) that were rare in the normal reference model and were not shown in Fig. 1. We then marked MDS or cytopenic samples with normal compositions (matching the reference model, group 1) and organized them along the myeloid and lymphoid spectrum. The remaining cases were clustered into distinctive subclasses. Although most cases of MDS showed significantly lower CLP frequencies (groups 3 and 4; Extended Data Fig. 8b), we identified a subclass of MDS and cytopenia with high CLP frequencies (group 2). Other subclasses included high MPP (group 4.2), high BEMP (group 4.1) and high GMP (group 3) frequencies. This sorting scheme partially separated MDS from other, non-MDS-related, cases of cytopenia, with most cytopenia cases exhibiting normal (group 1) compositions. Cases of MDS with abnormal CNVs (Methods) were enriched in groups 2–4 (P < 0.004, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 12) and patients with high RDW were enriched in group 4 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). In summary, cHSPC compositions reveal molecular features that offer possibilities for identifying MDS subclasses and pathophysiology. Classification of MDS cases with normal cHSPC compositions (group 1) depends on further analysis of genetic and transcriptional states within specific cHSPC subtypes.

Linear fit across all individuals (n = 26) is shown (dashed line), as well as the corresponding r and (two-sided) P value.

To improve our diagnostic accuracy, we next derived specific gene signatures showing additional variation within cell types, from the reference model (Supplementary Table 13), and scored these signatures based on their ability to separate patients with MDS and cytopenia from healthy donors. A group of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes in MEBEMP-L, multi-potency genes in BEMP and S-phase genes in MEBEMP-L (Fig. 4e) emerged as top-ranking. These signatures were overall consistent across different samples of the same individuals (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We then combined CBCs, maximum variant allele frequency (VAF), cHSPC compositions and all afore-mentioned expression signatures into a feature set that formed the basis for construction of an MDS diagnostic classifier using standard machine learning tools. We created two cohorts: the first (cohort 1), composed of 28 patients with MDS, 20 patients with cytopenia and 41 healthy individuals, and the second (cohort 2) composed of 16 patients with MDS and 9 patients with cytopenia. We observed classifier training performance (even when aiming to separate MDS from cytopenia cases) was better when including normal cases in the dataset. Analysis of classifier performance showed very high specificity and sensitivity (Fig. 4f; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.93 in leave-one-out cross-validation for cohort 1 separation of MDS from cytopenia). Performance of the cohort 1 model on cohort 2 (which was not used during classifier training) was even higher (AUC = 0.97). Although cohort 2 data was not used in classifier training or feature selection, it was accessible to us during project analysis phases, such that we were cautious not to treat this as formal validation. The most informative feature used by the MDS classifier was the maximum VAF (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Yet, classifier performance was high even when excluding VAF information (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c).

Diagnosis and risk stratification of MDS rely on quantification of BM blast fractions. Our analysis of cohort 1 and cohort 2 samples, with the addition of three cases of MDS exhibiting complex karyotypes, suggests that we can predict this percentage quantitatively from cHSPC data using the fraction of cells showing a mixed HSC and CLP state (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 9d). All in all, this implies that, with further validation and testing, cHSPC profiling has the potential to replace BM analysis for MDS diagnosis and risk stratification, offering substantial benefits, such as noninvasive follow-ups and watchful waiting protocols. We present two case studies supporting this idea in Extended Data Fig. 10a,b. The first is an 82-year-old man showing progressive clonal expansion over a span of 3 years, accompanied by deteriorating anemia. The second is a 65-year-old woman presenting with clonal del5q showing complete cytogenetic remission after lenalidomide treatment. Additional follow-up examples (Extended Data Fig. 10c) suggest small changes in (normal or abnormal) composition across time, further supporting the idea of using cHSPCs for noninvasive assessment of disease progression.

The present study characterizes interindividual heterogeneity in cHSPCs across 148 healthy individuals using scRNA-seq analysis of PB CD34+ cells. The magnitude of our cohort, along with the potency and resolution of modern single-cell technologies and the computational methods used in the present study, allowed us to characterize in detail the transcriptional programs of diverse, sometimes rare (NKTDP and BEMP), HSPC subpopulations, refining and augmenting previous findings from smaller cohorts (Fig. 1). We defined a normal reference range for cHSPC subpopulation frequencies within an age- and sex-diverse healthy population and showed that cHSPC subtype compositions were highly variable between individuals, whereas the cell states themselves were remarkably general (Fig. 2). These compositions remained stable over a 1-year follow-up period. Future studies will need to further explore and better define the mechanistic and genetic basis for this compositional heterogeneity. With current sample size, we showed that the known age-related myeloid bias in HSPCs is predominantly male driven and that composition-controlled RNA expression can be used to infer chronological age (Fig. 3).

Our data show that cHSPCs are transcriptionally similar to their BM counterparts (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3), except for reduced cell-cycle gene expression. Although not a complete model for BM hematopoiesis, cHSPCs serve as a highly accessible proxy for key hematological processes. Interindividual differences in cHSPC compositions and states can thus serve as a tool for capturing key aspects of a patient's hematopoietic state. The relevance and importance of a cHSPC normal reference (Fig. 2b) can perhaps be better understood in view of the normal CBC reference range, developed in the 1930s1. The development of a population-wide CBC reference enabled the identification of numerous pathological blood states that characterize distinct clinical entities. In a similar fashion, our cHSPC reference can be used to characterize physiological and pathological states. In Fig. 4 we describe a pipeline for the identification and characterization of blood pathologies based on our normal cHSPC reference and show how this can be applied to MDS diagnostics (including inference of cytogenetics and blast counts from the PB). We present scRNA-seq data on cHSPCs from 73 cases of cytopenia and MDS, greatly extending currently available BM MDS scRNA-seq datasets5,29,30,31,32. The data described supports MDS diagnosis (over non-MDS-related cytopenia) and suggests the possibility of MDS subclassification based on over-representation of distinct HSPC progenitor populations. The MDS-related gene expression signatures identified in the present study open avenues for research that might contribute to better understanding of MDS pathophysiology and drug design strategies. Importantly, further follow-up, validation in prospective studies and cohort expansion to ethnically diverse populations are needed to prove that the tools introduced here can become a clinical standard. The diagnostic potential of our reference model may be further enhanced upon acquisition and analysis of additional blood subpopulations and disease states in contrast with the reference. Practically, application of scRNA-seq for diagnostics would have to rely on stable and minimally biased cell acquisition and processing technologies that can be deployed across diverse clinical settings and provide consistent and trustworthy results. Development in this domain is promising, but more work must be done to reach clinical standards.

To conclude, our study delves into the basic molecular physiology of cHSPCs at the population level, uncovering age-related phenotypes and proposing a platform for mechanistic and diagnostic insights into blood malignancies. This resource, along with various other tools for profiling genetics and epigenomics in the blood, has the potential to redefine normal versus pathological states in hematology and provide both clinicians and researchers the means for mapping the transition from health to disease.

All healthy reference model individuals (n = 148, analyzed in Figs. 1–3 and Extended Data Figs. 1–6) volunteered to participate in our study and donated blood at the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) between November 2020 and December 2023. They were recruited from the WIS community and primary care clinics and consisted of 79 men and 69 women aged 23–91 (median 61.5) years. Their demographic data and CBCs are included in Supplementary Table 1. Written informed consent allowing access to their demographic, longitudinal CBC and sequencing data (CH and genotyping panels) was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All relevant ethical regulations were followed and all protocols were approved by the WIS ethics committee (under Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol no. 283-1).

For the main reference model (Figs. 1–3), recruitment was intended to allow characterization of the normal variation in cHSPC states. As no such profiling had been previously performed, we could not assume much about the variance in the population a priori. Participants were therefore required to lack any known hematological condition, including hematological malignancy or premalignant state, or any prior evidence of blood clonality. An Illumina-sequenced subset of these 148 individuals (n = 79) was used for constructing the healthy reference model used in Fig. 4 (‘Fig. 4 reference model'), filtering out individuals with any blood count abnormality (up to 5 years before sampling) and putting aside 41 healthy samples for classifier training.

Recruitment of the cytopenic cohort (including patients with MDS and non-MDS-related cytopenia, analyzed in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 7–10) took place between November 2021 and February 2024. These patients were recruited from several outpatient hematological clinics by collaborating physicians to represent the wide clinical spectrum of MDS, from patients with moderate anemia and mild dysplasia as their sole BM abnormality to those with severe cytopenia and excess blasts on BM analysis. Key patient characteristics, including CBCs, BM FACS blasts and mutational data, are included in Supplementary Tables 9 and 11. Median age for the cytopenic cohort was 73 years (range 27–93 years), with men representing 53% of patients. Patient PB samples were either drawn at WIS or transported to WIS within <2 h of blood drawing. All cytopenic samples were processed in an identical fashion to the healthy ones (described below). Longitudinal CBCs, mutational data and most recent BM analyses were collected from patients and analyzed along with their scRNA-seq data.

The cytopenic cohort included a total of 83 individuals, 50 of whom were labeled as cases of ‘MDS', based on BM morphology and/or mutational and karyotypic abnormalities (as detected in the clinic or by our CH panel and scRNA CNA analysis). The remaining 33 patients with cytopenia not satisfying MDS criteria were labeled as cases of ‘cytopenia'. We note that, consistent with common medical practice in Israel, most of these 33 patients with cytopenia did not undergo BM examination, which may have resulted in missed MDS diagnoses. To address this limitation, we collected the most recent clinical data available for patients with cytopenia, with a median follow-up period exceeding 600 d after cHSPC sampling (Extended Data Fig. 10d and Supplementary Table 9). Importantly, no new diagnoses of myeloid malignancy were recorded in any of the cytopenic cases, except for N193 who was diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome 1 year after cHSPC sampling, exhibiting a UBA1 mutation c.121A>G;p.Met41Val, but had not been diagnosed with MDS yet. In addition, during this follow-up, median change in RDW% was zero. In contrast, over a similar period (looking at historical records before cHSPC sampling; Extended Data Fig. 10e), median RDW% change in cases of MDS was 0.75, significantly higher than in patients with cytopenia (Extended Data Fig. 10f; P = 0.001, two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test). Overall, these data support the accurate classification of cytopenic cases. Eleven cHSPC samples were acquired from patients under treatment, six of which were included in Fig. 4 (Supplementary Table 9). Of the 83 patients with cytopenia, 17 who presented with asymptomatic, mild cytopenia, were also included in the original healthy cohort of 148 individuals.

We drew 50 ml of PB from each individual into lithium–heparin tubes and put aside 1 ml of blood for DNA production. The remaining volume was used for PBMC isolation via Ficoll using Lymphoprep-filled Sepmate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies), followed by CD34 magnetic bead-based enrichment using the EasySep human CD34+ selection kit II (STEMCELL Technologies). We found this enrichment strategy to be simple and reproducible and chose it for a couple of reasons: (1) RNA-seq data were most reproducible when cells were not sorted, but rather enriched for using beads (lower mitochondrial gene fraction); and (2) CD34 purity could be highly regulated by this method, to achieve anywhere between 50% and 95% enrichment of CD34+ cells, which could later be easily distinguished based on their single-cell expression data.

ScRNA libraries were generated using the 10x Genomics scRNA-seq platform (Chromium Next Gem single-cell 3ʹ reagent kit v.3.1). Chip loading was preceded by flow cytometry to verify that enrichment was successful and that enough CD34+CD45int live cells were gathered. All blood samples were either drawn at WIS or transferred from participating clinics on the morning of each experiment day, and time from blood draw to 10x loading was restricted to 5 h. The motivation for working with fresh samples was based on our previous experience with PB CD34+ cells being vulnerable to freezing–thawing rounds and long manipulation times. The 10x libraries were sequenced on two alternative platforms (Illumina and Ultima Genomics). Twelve libraries were simultaneously sequenced on both platforms for comparison purposes and to demonstrate the scalability of our approach. We observed the Ultima-sequenced data to be highly similar to the Illumina-sequenced data (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

All healthy and patient DNA was produced from PB at sampling. DNA sequencing was performed on two targeted panels: the first a rich myeloid CH panel (InfiniSeq Myeloid Malignancies Panel, Sequentify, Israel) covering all known pre-leukemic mutations10 and the second a genotyping panel specifically designed to capture polymorphic sites prevalently expressed by RNA molecules from all cell types in our data. This allowed demultiplexing of individual pools based on individual specific SNP combinations and replaced previous, antibody-based multiplexing methods. Three to six individual samples were pooled on each experiment day after extraction of DNA aliquots, such that CD34 enrichment was performed on the entire pool of PBMCs produced. As with other methods of sample multiplexing, genotype-based multiplexing allows for robust doublet detection during data analysis, which enabled loading of 30,000–40,000 cells on each Chromium Chip lane.

Both our CH and genotyping panels are Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) panels described in detail previously10. For the healthy cohort we used our CH panel v.3, containing 705 probes, covering leukemia-related SNVs and insertions/deletions (indels) in 47 genes, complemented by two amplicon-sequencing reactions to cover GC-rich regions in SRSF2 and ASXL1. For the cytopenic cohort, we used our CH panel v.4 (Supplementary Table 10). For alignment of reads we used Burrow–Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-MEM v.2 (ref. 33). As MIP sequencing is cost-effective yet noisy, we developed an in-house variant calling method to reliably identify low-VAF CH events10. For the genotyping panel we used Varscan for variant calling34. Each DNA sample was sequenced twice with a minimum depth of 106 paired-end reads on an Illumina Novaseq machine. Variant calling was performed as previously reported10. Our genotyping panel allows for the simultaneous detection of >2,000 SNVs. It includes heterozygous sites with at least a 5% minor allele frequency from the 1,000 Genomes project, which were extensively covered in our data (at least 80 unique molecular modifiers (UMIs) across all cells in a test 10x library), excluding sites in repetitive elements and sex chromosomes. Both panels were designed using MIPgen35 to ensure capture uniformity and specificity.

To compare propensity for CH and high-risk CH mutations in high-RDW cases and normal RDW controls, we performed deep targeted sequencing of DNA samples from 602 high-RDW (>15%) individuals, whose blood count did not meet MDS criteria (11.5 g dl−1 ≤ Hg ≤ 15.5 g dl−1 (F), 13 g dl−1 ≤ Hg ≤ 17 g dl−1 (M), 80 fL ≤ MCV ≤ 96 fl, PLT ≥ 100 × 109 l−1, Abs Neut ≥ 1.8 × 109 l−1) and 602 normal RDW, age- and sex-matched controls. Case–control matching was performed using the R MatchIt package, balanced on age and sex, method = ‘nearest', ratio = 1, from a total of 18,147 individuals with longitudinal blood counts and available DNA at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC) Integrated Cancer Prevention Center. All DNA samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were received de-identified from the TASMC. All relevant ethical regulations were followed and all protocols were approved by the TASMC ethics committee (under IRB protocol no. 02-130).

We processed fastq files by executing cell-ranger (v.3.1.0) with an hg-38 reference genome. We filtered out cells with at least 20% mitochondrial expression, then removed mitochondrial genes (as well as few other batch-prone genes) and further filtered cells with ≤500 UMIs.

We performed several steps to assign cells to individuals and to detect doublets. Our pipeline included the following steps:

Demultiplexing cells and calling doublets based on SNPs found in the scRNA-seq data

Building a metacell model using cells from all libraries, including cells previously marked as doublets, identifying and removing metacells made of doublets

Identifying doublet metacells based on expression of marker genes

Building the final metacell model and marking metacells as doublets based on expression markers

In the first step, we identified doublets and assigned cells to individuals using Vireo v.0.3.2 (ref. 36) and Souporcell v.2.4 (ref. 37), which cluster cells based on SNPs found in sequenced RNA molecules. We executed Vireo (preceded by running cellsnp v.0.3.0) and Souporcell on each library separately. Both methods used SNPs from our genotyping panel10 which were covered by at least 20 UMIs in the library (in Souporcell—at least 10 from the major and minor allele each). We observed high agreement in doublet calling between the two methods.

In the next step, we built a metacell model with cells from all libraries. This model included cells that we already identified as doublets. The model was built with metacell2 (ref. 11), with a target metacell size of 200 cells. We then marked all metacells, where at least 35% of the cells were already marked as doublets, and all metacells that expressed key markers of distinct cell types as doublet metacells. All cells that belonged to a doublet metacell were then marked as doublets. We then built an additional metacell model (see below), without cells that were marked as doublets.

Vireo and Souporcell both cluster cells based on SNPs found in the sequenced RNA, such that cells in the same cluster belong to the same individual. We next assigned clusters of cells to the individual to whom they belonged. To this end, we correlated the genotypes of each cell cluster, as inferred by Vireo, to all genotypes that we measured using the MIP panel (only using sites with sufficient sequencing depth). As a control, this matching was performed against the MIP genotypes of all individuals in the cohort and not only those from the specific library analyzed. We observed clear matchings between Vireo clusters and individuals from the expected libraries in all cases. This method also correctly identified related individuals. The sex of all matched individuals was confirmed by expression of XIST in the RNA data.

Droplets with complete or partial megakaryocyte expression (at least 5% of UMIs coming from a megakaryocyte gene program including PF4, PPBP and 131 additional genes) were removed from our model as a result of their overall high doublet rate, and a final metacell model was constructed from the retained cells ((1) not marked as doublets, (2) confidently assigned to an individual and (3) not exhibiting megakaryocyte expression).

Our 10x libraries were sequenced on Ultima Genomics and Illumina sequencers. To minimize batch effects related to these sequencing-platform variations, we used libraries that were sequenced on both platforms to calculate an Illumina–Ultima correction factor per gene as the mean log2(fold-change) in expression of the gene across re-sequenced libraries. We then normalized each Ultima-sequenced library by downsampling genes with at least 0.28 log2(fold) Ultima overexpression and resampling genes with at least 0.2 Illumina overexpression. The downsampling and resampling were performed for each gene independently, across all cells in each Ultima library. The thresholds for downsampling and resampling were chosen such that the overall number of UMIs per cells remained similar; 87 genes with at least 4-fold-change between Ultima and Illumina were excluded from further processing.

Our metacell model was built using metacell2, with a target metacell size of 200 cells, deriving 4,253 metacells. We marked histone, cell-cycle, ribosomal, sex-linked and stress response genes (including FOS and JUN) as forbidden genes, as well as genes with high technical variation, such as those with high or inconsistent differences between Illumina- and Ultima-sequenced technical replicates. These genes were not used for calculating gene–gene similarities but were included in downstream analyses. We annotated metacells using known markers as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1c. We excluded metacells with low CD34 expression, such as mature monocytes, B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and endothelial cells, as well as 20 GMP-L metacells, from most downstream analyses. We used UMAP projections of the metacell expression vector over genes with specific enrichment over cell types for visualization of the metacell manifold.

We used three BM datasets for comparison purposes: a dataset including CD34-enriched cells from two individual BM samples collected by us and processed similarly to PB (Fig. 1a), the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) BM dataset14 and a CD34+CD38− bead-based enriched BM dataset12. We previously processed and annotated the HCA dataset in a metacell model. We further constructed a metacell model for the two CD34-enriched BM samples collected by us using metacell2, in a similar fashion to that described previously, and downloaded the Setty et al. sequencing data12, processed it by running cell-ranger, and created a third BM metacell model from their data. To project our own PB data, our own BM data and the Setty CD34-enriched BM data on the HCA model, we correlated projected metacells from each of these models with HCA metacells over genes showing high variance in the HCA model. We annotated each Setty metacell using the mode of its five most correlated HCA metacells. We annotated our own BM data using both the mode of the five most correlated HCA metacells and expression of gene markers. We projected metacells from each of these models on the HCA UMAP using the mean x and y values of the five most correlated HCA metacells. To compare S-phase genes between PB and BM (Extended Data Fig. 3b), we calculated the S-phase signature (mean expression of six cell-cycle genes: TYMS, H2AFZ, PCNA, MCM4, HELLS and MKI67) for each PB and HCA metacell and plotted the distribution of these scores across metacells for each cell type.

To visualize transcriptional dynamics in HSCs, we sorted MEBEMP and CLP metacells based on their AVP expression. To calculate differential expression (DE) between HSCs and neighboring cell types (Extended Data Fig. 3g), we took the geometric mean expression of each gene across each of these cell states (within HSC or CLP-M or MEBEMP-E metacells) and calculated the difference of means between HSC and MEBEMP-E and between HSC and CLP-M metacells.

We compared each individual's pooled expression profile to a matched expression profile based on the individual's distribution across metacells. We performed this analysis separately for MPPs or MEBEMPs (MPP, GMP-E, MEBEMP-E/-L, ERYP and BEMP) and CLPs (CLP-E/-M/-L and NKTDP). In each of these cell states, we downsampled each cell to have 500 UMIs and summed the UMIs across all cells of each individual, normalized the sum to 1 and calculated the log2(value) to obtain the observed expression. To compute matched expression, we downsampled each metacell to have 90,000 UMIs and summed all UMIs of the metacell to which each cell belongs for each individual. We normalized this matched expression to sum to 1 and took the log2(value). For Extended Data Fig. 3c,d, we plotted all genes that were expressed in either the observed or the matched expression in at least one individual (log2(expression) > 2−14.5 for MPPs or MEBEMPs, > 2−13.5 for CLPs), with at least a twofold change between matched and observed in at least one individual. We excluded genes exhibiting strong batch effects.

To explore variance in cell-type composition between individuals, we first calculated the distribution of each individual's cells across the CD34+ cell states. We further partitioned cells from the CD34+ cell states into finer-grained bins, using one HSC, four CLPs and ten MPP or MEBEMP bins, for a total of fifteen bins. We assigned HSC cells to bin 0, CLP-E cells to CLP bin 1 and CLP-M/-L cells to CLP bins 2–4 based on an AVP expression gradient, such that each of these bins consisted of an equal number of cells. We similarly assigned MPP and MEBEMP-E/-L cells into equal size MPP or MEBEMP bins 1–10 based on decreasing AVP expression.

The bottom panel of Fig. 2d shows individual enrichment across bins (log2(ratio of each individual's cell frequency in each bin to the median cell frequency in that bin across individuals)). We partitioned individuals into three groups based on their mean enrichment across CLP bins 2–4—those with mean enrichment >0.5 are high CLP, those with <−0.5 are low and the rest are intermediate. We next defined the stemness score as the ratio between the number of cells in MPP or MEBEMP bins 1–5 and the total MPP or MEBEMP cells (bins 1–10). Individuals with stemness score >0.5 had enriched stemness. Individuals within each cluster were further sorted based on their stemness score. The combination of CLP enrichment and stemness defines the six classes shown in the figure.

We used permutation tests to test for an association between cell-state distributions and a label, such as CBC indices or sync-scores. We sorted CD34+ cell states into 11 bins from late MEBEMP differentiation through HSCs to late CLP differentiation (as ordered in Fig. 2b). We correlated each of the 11 cell-state frequency vectors to the numerical label vector. We then looked at triplets of adjacent cell states in this order and calculated the mean correlation for each triplet to obtain nine mean correlation values and took the maximal absolute correlation value as a test statistic. We repeated this process after permuting the label vector 10,000× and used the test statistics from the permutations to derive a P value.

We built a metacell model for the cells from Yazar et al.25. We labeled all cells in metacells with high CD34 expression (log2(fraction of UMIs > −14.3)) as CD34+ cells. We then selected individuals with at least 800 cells in the model and randomly sampled 800 cells from each (Supplementary Table 14). To produce Fig. 3d, we pooled these sampled cells by the decade of their individuals' age and calculated the fraction of CD34+ cells in each decade. The 95% confidence intervals shown in the figure assume a binomial distribution, given the very sparse nature of the data.

We detected gene modules with high variance across individuals while controlling for compositional variation. This was performed separately for myeloid and lymphoid states, in the following manner:

For each individual, we calculated the 5th percentile of their number of UMIs across all MPP metacell cells and downsampled all cells to this number. We then pooled all downsampled cells, normalized to sum to 1 and took the log2(value). This gave us the observed expression profile of each individual.

We then created the expected expression profile for each individual as follows: we partitioned all MPP metacells into 30 equal size bins based on their AVP expression, and downsampled metacells to 90,000 UMIs. We then took the average expression of each gene across downsampled metacells in each bin. This defined an expression profile for each of the 30 bins. To obtain an individual's expected expression, we calculated the weighted average expression profile of bins, where the weight of each bin is proportional to the fraction of the individual's cells from that bin, normalized to sum to 1 and took the log2(value). We then calculated the difference between the observed and expected expression profiles.

Our data showed some batch effect distinguishing samples collected in two calendric periods. As this effect could introduce co-variation between genes across individuals, we applied a correction controlling for it. This was performed using a linear model fitting each gene to the sample collection period. We then subtracted the inferred period factor from the samples that were collected in the second period. We found that this approach substantially reduced emergence of gene clusters linked with sample collection date bias.

We screened for genes with high variance that were unlikely to be affected residually by the main manifold differentiation process. We removed genes with high batch effects, genes with high AVP correlation (absolute value Pearson's correlation >0.65), and genes highly correlated (absolute value Pearson's correlation >0.5) with a module of differentially expressed genes between the first and second collection periods. We then calculated each gene's variance in the difference between observed and expected expression across individuals. As some of this variance can be explained by sampling noise, we plotted each gene's variance across individuals against its mean expression across individuals. We sorted genes by this expression value and subtracted from the variance of each gene a rolling mean of the variances of 100 neighboring genes in that ordering. We chose genes with variance at least 0.08 higher than the rolling mean variance.

We calculated a gene–gene Spearman's correlation matrix for the high variance genes and clustered correlation profiles using hierarchical clustering. We removed genes with low mean correlation (<0.2) to their cluster and then removed gene clusters with low mean correlation between their genes (≤0.25 mean correlation for all gene pairs). We further computed gene–gene correlations using only samples from our first library collection period and required gene clusters to have a high mean correlation (>0.25) between their genes when using only these samples. We removed additional gene modules arising from this analysis resulting from batch effects or traces of MEBEMP differentiation not normalized by this approach. This resulted in Fig. 3f.

We performed a similar analysis for CLPs, with few differences. The analysis included all cells from CLP-M metacells. The cells were partitioned into six equal size bins and partitioning was based on the average of their DNTT and VPREB1 expression. Genes with high absolute correlation to the average DNTT and VPREB1 expression were excluded. This was followed by hierarchical clustering of the gene–gene correlation profiles and removal of genes as described for MPPs.

We developed age-regression models for MPP and CLP expression separately. To predict age, we used the difference between an individual's observed and expected gene expression as described above (‘Variably expressed gene modules'). We used genes with minimal expression ≥2−14.5 for MPPs and ≥2−15.5 for CLPs across individuals. We trained a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) model using nested leave-one-out cross-validation. For each left-out sample, we performed cross-validation on the remaining samples to select LASSO's λ parameter, trained a model using the selected λ and made a prediction on the left-out sample.

We used the difference between an individual's observed and expected gene expression and correlated this difference to the difference in LMNA expression separately for MPPs and CLPs. We then summed the MPP and CLP correlation values and kept genes with summed correlation >0.7. We further removed genes with high technical variance, retaining 17 genes in the LMNA signature. To calculate individual LMNA signatures, we took the average value of these 17 genes in the observed–expected matrix of each individual for MPPs and CLPs separately. To plot Extended Data Fig. 6g, we calculated the geometric mean of LMNA signature gene expression for each individual in each one of the ten MPP or MEBEMP bins described earlier in Fig. 2d.

GoT21 performed on sample N122 allowed us to mark this individual's cells as wild-type or mutated. As a result of the low VAF of N122's DNMT3A mutation, and to increase power, we marked cells with a DNMT3A mutation status that could not be determined by GoT as wild-type cells. For Extended Data Fig. 6b, we examined sample N122's cell distribution across cell states.

We defined the AVP signature to include genes with high correlation (>0.6) to AVP across HSC, MPP and MEBEMP metacells and the GATA1 signature to include those with high correlation (>0.7) to GATA1. We filtered out genes with mean relative expression >2−10 in these metacells, to preclude a small number of genes from dominating the signatures. We then scored all HSC, MPP, MEBEMP-E and MEBEMP-L cells by their fraction of UMIs from the AVP and GATA1 signatures and partitioned them into 20 equal size bins of AVP signature expression and 20 equal size bins of GATA1 signature expression. The sync-score is then defined as the fraction of cells in GATA1 bins 13 and above (upper two quintiles of GATA1) that are in AVP bins 9 and above (upper three quintiles of AVP expression). To visualize sync-scores (Fig. 3i), we normalized this 20 × 20 bin matrix to sum to 1, smoothed the obtained matrix by averaging cells using a running window of length 3 and took the log2(value).

DE was performed separately for MPP and CLP cells as well as for men and women. The MPP and CLP-M matrices previously used to detect variant gene modules were used here as well. Individual gene expression levels were correlated with age, maximal VAF of CH mutations and 20 CBC indices using Spearman's correlation; the correlation was then tested for significance. The P values were false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected (Benjamini–Hochberg) for each label separately. For maximal VAF we additionally performed a Mann–Whitney U-test comparing individuals with and without detected mutations. DE between men and women was performed using a Mann–Whitney U-test on the same expression matrices.

For analyzing MDS classification we re-analyzed sequenced libraries of all disease cases and healthy individuals in two groups, separated by sequencing platform (Illumina and Ultima). Cell filtering was then applied for each of the two datasets using the process described above with the following minor modifications:

Re-mapping all cells using cell-ranger v.7.0.1

Both Vireo and Souporcell were limited to 7.4 M SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05 according to the 1,000 Genome project, rather than SNPs from our genotyping panel

Refined filter for cell exclusion, excluding 10× particles (cells) with high mitochondrial content (>20%), platelet signature (PPBP > 0.2%), neutrophil signature (LCN2, CAMP and LTF) or erythrocyte signature (HBB, HBA1 and HBA2), and also excluding cells with low signature of nuclear RNAs (Supplementary Table 9 includes number of excluded cells)

Adjusting the doublet detection algorithm described above with an additional filter involving clustering cells and removal of cells with UMI count that is higher than 2.5-fold of their computed cluster median (thereby compensating for variable cell sizes across types). In addition, cells with high expression of both monocyte and MEBEMP markers were filtered out. Such extra steps were needed because, in some disease batches, highly specific cell states could contaminate other samples more than in standard reference batches.

To estimate cHSPC state for a given single-cell transcriptional profile, an in silico sorting scheme was developed (Extended Data Fig. 7a). First, our original reference model was used to compile gene signatures. Each signature was based on genes differentially expressed in a given cell type, such that the total number of UMIs for the signature is sufficiently high to allow classification at single-cell resolution (selected gene sets in Supplementary Table 13). Extended Data Fig. 7a shows the gating strategy used for classification using signature scores (log2(total signature UMI in cell) − log2(total cell UMI)). Cells with ambiguous gating were defined as unassigned. We confirmed that the gating strategy yields classification that is consistent with the annotation derived by applying metacell analysis to the new Fig. 4 reference model (see below) by projecting inferred classes on the metacell model UMAP projection (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We noted that sorting may reduce the manifold resolution compared with metacell analysis, but it provides robust results for downstream MDS classification purposes.

Samples from 79 individuals who were sequenced on the Illumina platform and showed no evidence for disease were considered as the reference model for MDS classification (Fig. 4). This cohort was used for defining the normal distribution of cHSPC composition. It was also the basis for constructing a reference metacell model used for projecting patient data. This model includes 287,000 cells and 2,090 metacells, constructed using metacell2 with a target metacell size of 140 cells and other parameters similar to the original normal reference model.

We used the inferred cHSPC compositions of 70 donors in the Fig. 4 reference model to score each composition abnormality of patients with MDS and cytopenia. Composition vectors p over cell types were log-transformed first as \({\mathbf{lp}}=\log_2({\epsilon +\mathbf{p}})\) where ϵ = 0.02. The distance between two samples was then defined using a Euclidean distance between their lp vectors. The abnormality score of a new sample was defined as the average distance for the four nearest neighbors in the reference model. The 0.98 quantile of the abnormality score of healthy donors (excluding reference donors) was used as a threshold (Extended Data Fig. 8a) for classifying patient compositions (excluding four patients exhibiting complex karyotypes) as normal or abnormal (Fig. 4b; GRP1 or GRP2-4, respectively). Patients with abnormal compositions were further grouped using hierarchical clustering of their lp vectors. Patients with normal compositions were ordered along a CLP frequency gradient in Fig. 4b (left), in analogy with Fig. 2d.

We constructed a metacell model from the filtered cells of each patient separately. This model was projected over the Fig. 4 reference model, using MCProj38. The result was a set of metacells for the patient, such that each metacell m was defined by its observed gene expression \({e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}\) and projected gene expression \({e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{proj}}}}\), as determined by MCProj using best matching reference behavior. Expression values were calculated using the geometric mean. Genes were filtered to remove sex-specific and sequencing-platform-specific genes (559 genes overall; Supplementary Table 15). Further filtering was done for 107 genes showing a consistent difference between observed and projected values over all individuals, as well as 27,317 lowly expressed genes (Supplementary Table 15).

To correct for batch effects leading to small GC content preference per library, we grouped genes into ten equal size bins according to the average GC content of 3′-scRNA-sequenced tags in representative sequenced libraries. For each gene g, we computed total observed and expected UMI counts, given the model's projection on the reference:

where \({n}_{c}\) is the total number of UMIs for the cell c and \(m(c)\) is its metacell. The bias per GC bin \({{\mathrm{bias}}}_{{{\mathrm{GCbin}}}}\) is now approximately defined as the median of \(\frac{{n}_{g}^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}}{{n}_{g}^{{{\mathrm{proj}}}}}\) across genes in the GC bin. In practice, we calculated the ratio \(\frac{{n}_{g}^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}}{{n}_{g}^{{{\mathrm{proj}}}}}\) after normalizing \({n}_{g}^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}\) and \({n}_{g}^{{proj}}\) by \({\sum }_{g{\prime} }{n}_{g{\prime} }^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}\) and \({\sum }_{g{\prime} }{n}_{g{\prime} }^{{{\mathrm{proj}}}}\), respectively, and adding a regularization term of \({10}^{-5}\). We corrected each observed gene expression value \({e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{obs}}}}\) by dividing by the appropriate \({{\mathrm{bias}}}_{{{\mathrm{GCbin}}}}\) value, generating \({e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{ob}}}{s}^{{\prime} }}\), which is used to obtain a per-gene and metacell observed:expected expression log(ratio) \({\delta }_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}=\log_2\left(\epsilon +{e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{ob}}}{s}^{{\prime} }}\right)-\log_2\left(\epsilon +{e}_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}}^{{{\mathrm{proj}}}}\right)\), whereas \(\epsilon ={10}^{-5}\).

We split each chromosome to contiguous bins encompassing 20 genes (ignoring filtered genes). For each chromosome bin bchrom and each metacell m, the median log ratio was computed: \({\delta }_{m,{{\mathrm{bchrom}}}}={{\mathrm{Med}}}_{g\in {{\mathrm{bchrom}}}}({\delta }_{{{\mathrm{gm}}}})\).

The matrix \({\delta }_{m,{{\mathrm{bchrom}}}}\) of metacells and 20-gene bins describing estimated DE was then normalized by subtracting the median of each row (metacell) and visualized in a heatmap, where metacells were re-ordered using hierarchical clustering. Heatmaps of the derived matrices (see, for example, Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) were examined manually to identify CNAs (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 12).

Within-state correlated gene sets were inferred from the reference metacell model by clustering the gene–metacell expression matrix of each annotated cell type, while considering only highly variable genes within the cell type. Clusters were evaluated and selected manually and expanded by adding correlated genes, resulting in the final gene sets (Supplementary Table 13). An MHC-II gene set was added after observation of MDS DE compared with the reference. The signature score per cell was estimated as the log-transformed normalized total UMI count for each gene set.

Signature scores per patient were extracted using the median signature of cells within a respective cell type (following the in silico sorting process described above). In the case of too few such cells, the signature score was considered missing (NA).

After classification of patients with cytopenia and MDS into groups 1–4 (Fig. 4b), we performed, for each within-state gene signature (and each relevant state), a Kruskal–Wallis test comparing signature expression levels between groups 1–4 and healthy donors. The signatures with the lowest P values were the MEBEMP-L MHC-II, S-phase and BEMP early signatures, which were accordingly shown in Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8d.

The following features were collected to facilitate MDS classification:

CBC values: we used the values with minimal time gap from the cHSPC sampling date

Maximal CH VAF across mutations detected in the same blood sample that was used for scRNA-seq

The cHSPC compositions as inferred through in silico sorting

Twenty-one signature scores

Composition abnormality score (ʽGrouping MDS and cytopenia patients by compositionʼ)

Number of CNAs.

We noted that signature scores might be missing (as a result of insufficient number of cells). In addition, a few individuals were missing CBC values.

All feature values per scRNA sample are included in Supplementary Table 9.

XGBoost (xgboost Python package, v.2.0.3) training was performed on cohort 1 including 89 samples (41 normal, 20 cytopenia and 28 MDS). All of the samples in cohort 1 were sequenced on the Ultima platform. MDS (including MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms) samples were considered positive, whereas cytopenia and normal samples were considered negative.

We applied feature selection separately in each leave-one-out fold, selecting a subset of the features for which the FDR-corrected Mann–Whitney P value for MDS or cytopenia separation was <0.1. We then inferred a classifier using the binary:logistic objective and default hyperparameters, except for tree_method = hist. Model performance was evaluated by pooling accuracy on the left-out samples of their respective folds.

Further evaluation of the approach was done by classifying cohort 2 (16 MDS and 9 cytopenia cases, all sequenced on the Illumina platform) using the classifier trained on cohort 1.

We compared blast fraction from BM samples acquired at most 1 year before or after cHSPC sampling. Comparison was also restricted to cHSPC samples with >500 HSPCs (scRNA samples used in this analysis are specified in Supplementary Table 9). CLP-E-like frequency estimation was as described in Extended Data Fig. 9d.

1A – age distribution (decimals) of studied population by sex. 1B – 2D UMAP projection of our metacell model prior to CD34 metacell filtering. 1C - relative expression heatmap of cell states (columns) and gene markers used for cell state annotation (rows). 1D – Metacell filtration on CD34 expression. 1E - expression plot of MPO and GATA1/VPREB1 showing all 3 differentiation trajectories (GMPs, CLPs, MEBEMPs) from HSCs. 1F - gene-gene expression plot of DNTT and RUNX3, showing early CLP differentiation and their bifurcation into late CLPs and NKTDPs. All gene expression values are obtained by normalizing gene expression to sum to 1 and taking log2.

2A – 2D UMAP projection of a non-CD34-enriched BM metacell model from the Human Cell Atlas14, colored by a BM-specific cell state annotation. 2B - projection of our PB CD34+ derived metacells on the non-CD34 enriched BM metacell model. 2C – projection of our BM CD34+ derived metacells on the non-CD34 enriched BM metacell model. 2D - projection of BM CD34+ derived metacells from Setty et al.12 on the non-CD34 enriched BM metacell model. 2E - gene-gene expression plots comparing PB CD34+ derived metacells with their BM CD34+ counterparts from our study and from Setty et al. for all differentiation trajectories. Panels (top to bottom) represent CLP differentiation, MEBEMP differentiation, GMP differentiation, BEMP differentiation, DC differentiation, and GMP/CLP/MEBEMP trifurcation from HSCs. PB and BM metacells are colored by PB and BM specific annotations.

3A – gene-gene expression plots comparing PB CD34+ derived metacells with their BM CD34+ counterparts from our study and from Setty et al.12 for markers and regulators of CLP differentiation and bifurcation. 3B – cell state specific comparison of S-phase signatures in circulating (left) and. BM14, right) HSPCs. Boxplot centers, hinges and whiskers represent median, first and third quartiles and 1.5× interquartile range, respectively. Outliers are marked by circles. Number of metacells per box (left to right): 89, 124, 261, 1178, 116, 668, 69, 88, 378, 88, 127; 5, 194, 62, 82, 87, 43, 35, 3. 3C,D – Individual-specific differential gene expression after controlling for distribution across the CD34+ PB manifold in MEBEMPs (C) and CLPs (D). 3E - relative expression heatmap of the megakaryocytic markers PF4 and PPBP and cell-state-specific markers, across metacells with high megakaryocytic signature, showing an abnormally high doublet rate involving megakaryocytes. Cells contained in such metacells were accordingly excluded from the final metacell model. 3F - gene-gene expression plots comparing the PB high AVP and HLF HSC population (left) with that found in two BM metacell models12,14 and in our CD34+ BM data.

The diagonal y = x is shown in red. 6J - sync score correlations between 39 technical & 20 biological replicates and their original samples. All biological replicates were sampled 1 year following original blood sampling. The diagonal y = x is shown in red.

7A – In-silico sorting scheme for a CD34-enriched PB scRNA sample. Each scatter plot demonstrates one or two virtual gates, based on total expression of gene signatures that were compiled using our cHSPC reference model. Representative cells shown belong to the 79 healthy donors comprising our Fig. 4 reference model (see Methods). Colors denote sorted cell states. 7B – Validation of in-silico sorting by annotated metacells. UMAP projection of the metacell model comprised of cells in A is shown, colored according to metacell annotation by marker genes (top), as in Extended Data Fig. 1C, and according to in-silico sorted state frequency, for each common cHSPC state (bottom). 7C – Distribution of copy number alterations (CNAs) identified by abnormal RNA expression over chromosomes (rows) and individuals (columns). Duplications and deletions are shown in red and blue, respectively. None of the individuals exhibited both duplication and deletion in the same chromosome. Individuals w/o CNAs are not shown.

8A – Distribution of composition abnormality scores across clinical diagnoses. The vertical grey line marks the 98th percentile score of healthy donors, defining the normal-like composition (group 1) and abnormal composition (groups 2-4) shown in Fig. 4b. 8B – In-silico sorted CLP frequencies across clinical diagnoses. Individuals are further separated by sex (male – left, female – right). Colors denote clinical diagnoses. Stars denote BH-adjusted significant difference from healthy donors of the same sex, determined by two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. 8C – Age and CBC indices values across healthy donors and cytopenia/MDS groups as in Fig. 4e. 8D – For each signature shown in Fig. 4e, biological replicate data is shown, comparing signature expression between the first and second sample. Individuals with insufficient cell counts for the population of interest were excluded. Linear fit across all individuals (n = 28 – MEBEMP-L MHC-II and S-phase signatures, n = 25 – BEMP early signature) is shown (dashed line), as well as the corresponding r- and (non-adjusted, two-sided) p-values.

9A – Features used by the MDS classification model whose performance is shown in Fig. 4f. For each feature used by the model, SHAP analysis shows the estimated impact of the feature on classification for each individual. Colors denote individual feature values. 9B – same as A, but for an MDS classification model that does not use maximal CH VAF as a feature. 9C – ROC curve as in Fig. 4f, but for an MDS classification model that does not use maximal CH VAF as a feature. 9D – Definition of the CLP-E-like state. Distribution of the CLP signature is shown across all HSC/MPP and CLP cells (as defined using our in-silico sorting) in the Fig. 4 reference model, along with thresholds (red) defining an intermediate expression level (shaded grey). HSC/MPP and CLP cells exhibiting these intermediate CLP expression levels are considered to be in a CLP-E-like state.

10A – Case study of disease progression. scRNA cHSPC samples were obtained for MDS patient N180 in 2021 (at which time he was diagnosed as cytopenic), 2022 and 2023, and a metacell model was constructed for each. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis is shown for each of these samples (top). Normalized gene expression (by the Fig. 4 reference model) for each metacell (row) and chromosomal region (column) is shown. This analysis revealed a small clone with trisomy 8 (red), and deletions in chromosomes 3 and 5 (del(5q)) (blue). Estimated clone size, as a percentage of total cHSPCs, is specified for each sample. Cell-state frequencies for cells with and without identified CNVs are shown on the right of each CNV analysis. The number of cells in each group is indicated. Longitudinal hemoglobin counts (bottom) are also shown, with grey vertical lines denoting dates of scRNA sampling. 10B – Case study of remission. Same as A, but for MDS del5q patient N211, sampled before and after lenalidomide treatment (bottom, shaded grey). Initial CNV analysis of her scRNA data revealed a very large clone with del(5q), which could not be detected following treatment with lenalidomide. 10C – Recurring abnormal cell state frequencies. For each of 6 individuals, cHSPC compositions (obtained by in-silico sorting) are shown for two different scRNA samples, demonstrating recurrence of abnormal cHSPC state frequencies (N192 – high BEMP, N235 and N281 – high GMP-L, N204 and N165 – high CLP, N78 – low CLP). 10D – Distribution of follow-up intervals, between cHSPC sampling and most recent available CBC results, across 29 (out of 33) patients with cytopenia. Boxplot indicates first, second and third quartiles. 10E – As a positive control for CBC instability in MDS, earlier CBC results were retrieved for MDS patients, targeting an interval of approximately 600 days between 1st and 2nd CBC measurements, to reflect the follow-up duration observed in patients with cytopenia. Shown here is the distribution of these simulated follow-up intervals for patients with MDS (similar to D). Treated patients and those with follow-up intervals <200 days were excluded from this analysis. 10F – Change in RDW values over follow-up intervals shown in D and E, used as a proxy for disease progression. Colors denote clinical diagnosis at cHSPC sampling.

Microbial ecosystems are fundamental to planetary and human health, yet human activities are accelerating their loss. Disruptions to microbial communities undermine environmental stability, biodiversity, and health. Urgent action is required to preserve microbial diversity. The Microbiota Vault Initiative provides a global framework to safeguard microbiomes from human, animal, and environmental sources. It proactively archives microbial diversity for future needs, prioritizing depositor sovereignty, equitable collaboration, and ethical governance. By sharing limited information on deposits, the initiative fosters microbial conservation and collaboration between local and global researchers. It complements other efforts to ensure the resilience of microbiomes in an era of rapid environmental change.

Microbial ecosystems underpin life on Earth, yet they are increasingly imperiled by human activities, including unsustainable agricultural practices and overuse of antibiotics. These disturbances disrupt microbial networks essential for environmental stability, biodiversity, and animal and human health, contributing to the global rise of chronic diseases and ecosystem degradation. As future restoration efforts will depend on the microbial diversity preserved today, proactive measures are urgently required. In this Perspective, we focus on one such initiative, the Microbiota Vault Initiative (MVI), a not-for-profit non-governmental organization that we have developed to address the urgent need. Inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV), the MVI shares a vision of safeguarding diversity, although its goals and implementation differ substantially. Unlike the SGSV, which provides backup for existing seed banks with well-documented restoration outcomes, the MVI proactively archives microbiota across human, animal, and environmental domains in anticipation of future unknown needs in restoration efforts.

The MVI embodies an integrative One Health approach by safeguarding microbial biodiversity critical to human and animal health, plant resilience, and environmental functions such as soil fertility, nutrient cycling, climate regulation, and pathogen resistance. By fostering equitable collaboration, honoring diverse knowledge systems, and ensuring depositor sovereignty, the MVI provides a culturally attuned framework for mitigating microbial loss (Table 1). Coordinated action through this initiative offers a timely opportunity to protect health, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience through the lens of One Health, underscoring the deep interdependence of microbial diversity, environmental integrity, and well-being across species.

There is broad recognition of the essential role that naturally evolved microbes play in ecosystems, including in humans1,2,3,4. Human activities have disrupted these evolutionary connections in host-associated microbiomes [humans1,2,3,4, animals5,6,7, and plants8,9,10] and have been associated with an alarming rise in chronic diseases such as allergic, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders4,11,12,13,14,15. The loss of microbial diversity extends to environmental ecosystems16,17,18, jeopardizing agricultural systems and environmental resilience.

The loss of crucial microbes in both human and environmental contexts represent a growing but often overlooked crisis. In human health, several key examples illustrate how modernization disrupts the coevolved microbial partnerships19,20. The decline in prevalence of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis—a bacterium that evolved to digest human milk oligosaccharides and support infant immune development—in industrialized societies has been associated with increased risks of allergies, diabetes, and other immune conditions21,22. This decline, likely due to increased use of Cesarean sections, formula feeding, and antibiotics, has become so severe that some pediatricians now recommend probiotic supplementation23. Similarly, the decrease of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema succinifaciens24 from gut microbiomes in industrialized countries shows broader implications of urbanization. While H. pylori's reduction has decreased stomach ulcers, its absence correlates with increased rates of allergic asthma and metabolic disorders20, highlighting the complex roles that these co-evolved microbes have in human health. In environmental systems, the thawing of Arctic permafrost threatens unique cold-adapted microorganisms like Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis, which helps regulate methane emissions25, and various Acidobacteria species crucial for carbon cycling. The loss of these environmental microbes creates a dangerous feedback loop: as climate change kills off permafrost microbes, their absence accelerates the release of greenhouse gases, further warming the planet26,27. These parallel losses in both human and environmental microbiomes demonstrate how changes caused by human activity can disrupt microbial ecosystems that evolved over millions of years, with cascading effects on both human and planetary health. Just as we strive to preserve endangered macro-organisms, urgent global efforts are needed to understand and preserve microbial diversity.

While much microbial biodiversity and mechanisms underlying sustaining natural ecosystems and health remain to be discovered, viewed through the lens of One Health, it is our obligation to future generations to preserve this microbial diversity28. The concept of preserving Earth's microbial heritage draws parallels to seed banks, which safeguard plant genetic diversity. Similarly, the MVI is a non-profit organization that operates as a public charity (www.microbiotavault.org). Its primary aim is to support local collections to preserve microbial biodiversity globally, including environmental, plant, animal, and human-associated microbiota.

The goal of the MVI is to foster an inclusive, global effort to preserve microbial specimens while fostering extramural research. It is intentionally non-commercial and based on an equitable framework that is designed to address the urgent need for microbial preservation amidst global biodiversity loss. Inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (www.croptrust.org), the initiative prioritizes microbial biodiversity preservation, fostering the creation of local collections and offering secure cryogenic storage of microbiomes from diverse human and environmental sources (Fig. 1).

The Microbiota Vault educates scientists and promotes the creation of Local Collections for preservation and research. These local collections can request that the Microbiota Vault preserve a safe backup of their specimens, maintaining all rights over their deposits; they have the option to request sequencing for open access under the license of their choice, and the MV will publish on its webpage a database of the deposited specimens, including metadata, links to sequences, and contact information about depositors. Those in the global community interested in doing research can then contact the depositor from the Local Working Collection. For the use of data derived from the Microbiota Vault, explicit acknowledgments to the specific Local Working Collection and to the Microbiota Vault will be required.

The MVI acts at the request and on behalf of sovereign depositors, and worldwide local collections, to preserve backup copies of specimens of human, animal, plant, or environmental origin. These samples are not accessible to anyone other than the depositors, or their registered agent. Additionally, upon request by the depositing collections, the Microbiota Vault may sequence microbial DNA (or RNA), depositing in open-access databases under the Creative Commons license of their choice (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This helps depositors define the terms of their collaborations29 and foster global research connections, leading to global capacity strengthening in microbiome research. The MVI does not engage in discovery research, therapeutic development, patenting, profit generation, or the assertion of material or intellectual property rights over its collections. Instead, it focuses on building a collaborative, multidisciplinary network. Through initiatives such as the annual Global Microbiome Network Symposia (GloMiNe), the MVI brings together researchers, public health professionals, legal experts, anthropologists, sociologists, and other stakeholders to engage in dialogue around microbiome science, research ethics, standardization, and equitable access and benefit-sharing.

The MVI is committed to educating and preserving microbial diversity while ensuring adequate representation of all people. The initiative fully supports multilateral efforts within the Global Biodiversity Framework towards equitable sharing of benefits from the use of biological materials or their data30,31. The initiative is deeply committed to equity and ethical engagement with local communities, including Indigenous peoples who hold and protect critical microbiome knowledge and biodiversity29,32. The MVI acknowledges that decisions regarding the common good and the future of traditional communities should be made by the communities themselves. Its framework aims to support the development of equitable and inclusive approaches to sovereignty and governance in microbiome research.

As a non-profit organization, the MVI operates under its bylaws and global policies to maximize inclusion, providing fiduciary oversight and educating prospective depositors on ethical research practices, access and benefit-sharing requirements under the Nagoya Protocol, and standardized methods for metadata design.

A cornerstone of the MVI outreach efforts is the annual GloMiNe symposium. These events bring together scientists from diverse disciplines—microbiology, anthropology, ethics, public health, and bioinformatics—to share knowledge, discuss microbial biodiversity conservation, and strengthen local research capacity. Over four years, these symposia have fostered interdisciplinary collaboration and contributed to the establishment of a global microbiome network (Table 2).

In addition to symposia, the Microbiota Vault supports capacity strengthening through mentoring for scientists from low- and middle-income countries, who thanks to collaborating with the Digital Sequence Information Scientific Network (DSI) are offered travel grants to their meetings, further advancing global equity in microbiome research. As part of its global advocacy efforts, the MVI has engaged with United Nations delegations, coordinating educational screenings to highlight the importance of the microbiome, and presented at the UN COP24 conference in Cali, Colombia.

The MVI has just concluded its Launch Phase, refining a model for the interaction between a globally coordinated fundraising initiative and locally operated biobanks. Backup collections are deposited with a contractual legal framework in which Deposit Agreements are signed between depositors and the Microbiota Vault. During this initial phase, Local Working Collections from Benin, Brazil, Ethiopia, Ghana, Laos, Thailand, and Switzerland deposited 1204 human fecal specimens and 190 fermented food samples. These deposits required navigating complex local and global regulations for exporting samples to Switzerland, where they are housed securely in cryo-storage (−80 °C) at the Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich.

The MVI Launch Phase also enabled the development of standardized protocols for sample collection, preservation, transport, metadata development, and data annotation. For metadata, the Microbiota Vault has adopted minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS) standards, a modular framework developed by the international scientific community, which offers flexibility to accommodate additional sample types such as environmental or wildlife specimens33. Best practices emerging from this phase include robust traceability of samples, equitable biobanking frameworks, standardized metadata, harmonized storage protocols, advanced biobanking systems, and quality control adhering to the recommendations of the Swiss Biobanking Platform (https://swissbiobanking.ch/).

The MVI's Launch Phase focused on human-associated microbiomes and fermented food microbes. To support broader ecological goals, it will expand to include environmental microbiota from threatened ecosystems. This aligns with a One Health framework by preserving microbes vital to environmental and planetary health, and by providing a framework for fostering research and strengthening local capacities. While reintroducing preserved microbes remains speculative, and functional restoration from frozen specimens is unproven, preservation offers a valuable opportunity for future research. Indeed, the application of “microbiome therapy” in humans34, animals35,36, and environmental ecosystems37,38, is promising. Stored samples may one day support fundamental microbiological research, ecosystem restoration, or biotechnological advances.

Around the world, other groups of scientists have independently recognized the need to conserve microbial communities through specimen preservation. Among them, the Global Microbiome Conservancy stands out as a research-driven effort actively collecting and studying human microbial samples from diverse geographic regions. While most other initiatives are also research-oriented (Table 3), they align closely with the Microbiota Vault Initiative (MVI) and offer complementary strengths that create opportunities for future collaboration. By partnering with and receiving specimens from local microbial collections, the MVI and similar efforts help safeguard regional ecosystems while advancing education, capacity strengthening, and inclusive governance. In particular, the MVI empowers local stakeholders through depositor sovereignty and strict standards for metadata and preservation protocols.

Many worry that news on social media leaves people uninformed or even misinformed. Here we conducted a preregistered two-wave online field experiment in France and Germany (N = 3,395) to estimate the effect of following the news on Instagram and WhatsApp. Participants were asked to follow two accounts for 2 weeks and activate the notifications. In the treatment condition, the accounts were those of news organizations, while in the control condition they covered cooking, cinema or art. The treatment enhanced current affairs knowledge, participants' ability to discern true from false news stories and awareness of true news stories, as well as trust in the news. The treatment had no significant effects on feelings of being informed, political efficacy, affective polarization and interest in news or politics. These results suggest that, while some forms of social media use are harmful, others are beneficial and can be leveraged to foster a well-informed society.

Over 5.07 billion people, or 62.6% of the world's population, use social media platforms for communication and information access. Social media have been accused of degrading the quality of public discourse by promoting low-quality content that is toxic, sensationalist, misleading and sometimes harmful1. Falsehoods spread fast on some platforms2, algorithms recommend entertainment over news and public affairs3, and negativity, outrage and content denigrating political opponents receive disproportionate attention online1,4. These trends may exacerbate polarization, radicalization5, misinformation and disinformation-induced confusion6,7, ultimately undermining democratic governance.

Scholars have developed numerous interventions to counter these trends. Most have focused on how to minimize or recognize ‘bad' content on platforms (for example, clickbait, misinformative or radical) or how to improve critical thinking5,8, with a focus on making people more sceptical of bad content9. Other scholars have tested various methods for helping people recognize manipulation techniques10. For example, encouraging people to think about accuracy reduces the sharing of unreliable news headlines8 and fact-checking reduces belief in false claims11. These approaches, although effective, may have unintended consequences on the perception of ‘good' content (that is, factual and verified news)12,13,14. A host of other interventions have been tested at the platform level, such as friction15, downranking like-minded sources16, removing reshared content17 or the introduction of chronological feeds18. Yet these interventions may be ineffective in that friction reduces sharing of reliable content15 and chronological feeds increase exposure to untrustworthy, extreme and ideologically congruent sources18,19,20, and can only be implemented by or in collaboration with social media platforms themselves21.

Our approach is markedly different. Rather than focusing on minimizing ‘bad' political content, we enhance users' exposure to ‘good' content, namely factual and verified news and public affairs information that is already freely and widely available on platforms22. We incentivized social media users in France and Germany (total N = 3,395) to follow politically balanced news outlets on Instagram and WhatsApp for 2 weeks. Our preregistered field experiment causally estimated the effects of following the news on social media in naturalistic settings on four crucial outcomes: (1) current affairs knowledge about events that occurred between waves, (2) awareness of circulating true and false claims, (3) belief accuracy (that is, discernment between true and false news stories about national and international political issues, such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza or the European Parliament election) and (4) trust in news media organizations. In addition, we tested whether news consumption on social media impacts participants' feelings of being informed about politics and current events, interest in the news and politics and affective polarization (that is, participants' feelings towards political parties and countries, such as Palestine–Israel or Ukraine–Russia). We tested whether these effects depend on differential levels of compliance, measured using screenshots submitted by the users, as well as self-reported measures of compliance. Last, we used qualitative comments and post-test responses to assess participants' feedback on their experience and their intentions to continue following the recommended news outlets.

We expand past literature in three important ways. First, we build on the work on approaches that ‘promote the Internet's potential to bolster rather than undermine democratic societies'23. Although it is feared that social media facilitate the spread of clickbait, misinformative and low-quality and harmful content, past efforts aimed at reducing exposure to such content often overlook the wealth of verified and factual public affairs information already freely available on platforms24,25,26. Despite its abundance, the vast majority of users do not consume much news or political information on platforms27,28,29,30,31,32. This low consumption of public affairs leads to uninformed citizenry, with various negative consequences for democracy33,34,35,36. By contrast, well-informed citizens are better able to discern between true and false news37,38, more resistant to manipulation39 and more likely to hold stable attitudes40. Recognizing this, recent work focuses on positive incentivization and encouraging social media users to consume news25,26 to make citizens more resilient to informational threats39. For instance, Askari et al.26 created bots that contextually replied to users tweeting about non-political topics and encouraged the users to follow verified and balanced news accounts. This intervention slightly enhanced the following and liking of news accounts. In a YouTube field experiment, Yu et al.25 found that nudging the algorithm by playing videos from news channels in the background increases recommendations to and consumption of news over time and promotes more diverse news diets. Such positive incentivizations align with users' desire for accurate information and educational content, instead of divisive, hateful or false content41.

Second, we offer a comprehensive causal test of the effects of following news on social media on current affairs knowledge, awareness of both true and false news stories, belief accuracy and trust in news media, outcomes crucial to a well-functioning democracy33,42. Researchers worry that news on social media has negative effects by increasing information overload and political polarization or by increasing the feeling of knowing, without actually learning anything43,44. A recent meta-analysis found no association between social media use and political learning in observational studies and substantively small increases in experimental work45. Most experiments, however, rely on forced exposure to news, which users may avoid in their daily lives, and test outcomes immediately after exposure. It is therefore not clear whether similar effects would emerge in naturalistic settings where users have full control over exposure, myriad content options and where the majority seeks entertainment31,46,47,48. The few field experiments that incentivized internet users to increase exposure to news in general25,49 or to partisan news50,51 found null or very limited effects on various outcomes, such as knowledge or polarization.

We build on these field experiments by also maximizing external validity, not forcing exposure, and measuring effects not immediately after (potential) exposure. Furthermore, we assess compliance in several ways (that is, requesting participants to submit screenshots showing that they followed the news accounts and enabled notifications from these accounts and asking them to list and later recognize these accounts), which allows us to systematically test the differential effects of different doses of on-platform exposure to and engagement with news.

Third, we examine these effects across two countries and two distinct, popular and understudied platforms that have been accused of facilitating the spread of harmful content52. In general, social media platforms have transformed the relationship between news media and audiences, such that news organizations create and disseminate news in line with platform logics and constrained by platform affordances, such as interactivity or algorithmic curation53,54. For instance, the use of platforms such as Twitter has been shown to increase political knowledge55,56, probably because many used the platform for news and politics4. Yet the use of Instagram, WhatsApp or Facebook has shown to be mostly detrimental37,57. Possibly this is because news outlets publish ‘softer' articles on these platforms58 or because these platforms are not primarily used for news22. Despite the different features and distinct uses of various platforms, cross-platform evidence on the effect of news use is limited53.

We focus on Instagram and WhatsApp, platforms with different affordances and distinct usage patterns. Instagram is a well-established image and video-based social media platform with over two billion monthly active users worldwide as of early 2024. WhatsApp is a messaging platform with numerous social media features (such as stories) and almost three billion unique active users worldwide59. Each offers distinct opportunities for incidental news exposure: Instagram provides the most opportunities as news content is displayed on the same page as friends' posts and stories, while WhatsApp offers fewer, as users must actively open the news tab to access news. As of September 2023, WhatsApp users can follow news channels for updates in a one-way broadcast. Crucially for our purposes, Instagram and WhatsApp are not typically used for news22 despite news media organizations' presence on the platforms, making it worthwhile to systematically examine the effects of encouraging users to follow news accounts on these platforms. In particular, 65% of the German population uses WhatsApp and 31% uses Instagram, but less than one-third of the users report getting news on these platforms22. In France, 44% of the population uses WhatsApp and 31% uses Instagram, and between a third and a half of the users report getting news on these platforms22. Focusing on distinct platforms and countries minimizes the chances that the detected effects are attributable to any one context, an important advance over past work, which have mostly studied a single platform, typically Twitter or Facebook, in the USA.

Overall, we find that following news accounts on social media increases not only users' current affairs knowledge and their awareness of current events, but also enhances their belief accuracy (that is, discernment between true and false news) and trust in news media—without increasing feeling of being informed, affective polarization or interest in news and politics. These findings show the potential of putting ‘good' information in users' online ecosystems, which disrupts informational silos on social media and provides a robust method to bolster democratic resilience. Our results also offer a positive perspective by challenging the widespread negativity about the impact of social media. Contrary to the idea that news on social media increases the feeling of being informed without informing43,44, our study demonstrates that news on social media can in fact help people become better informed and contribute positively to the democratic process.

Additional details on the data and methodology are provided in Methods and Supplementary Information offers a detailed description of all materials and methods used in this study, as well as additional robustness checks.

We conducted a preregistered online field experiment in France and Germany (N = 3,395) to causally estimate the effect of following news on Instagram and WhatsApp for 2 weeks in ecological conditions. To take part in the study, participants had to use WhatsApp or Instagram and not already be following the news accounts included in the experiment. WhatsApp users were allocated to the WhatsApp branch while Instagram users were allocated to the Instagram branch. All users were later randomly assigned to the treatment or the control within their branch. Participants in the treatment were asked to follow two news accounts while participants in the control followed non-news accounts. Figure 1 details the flow of the experiment, the number of participants in each branch and the social media accounts participants were asked to follow. The news media accounts were selected because they are generally trusted22, reliable and not partisan (for more information see ‘Treatment (wave 1)' section). The non-news accounts were selected because they do not cover news or politics and could be of interest to most people.

On the left side, the figure presents the experimental design for the French sample; on the right, the design for the German sample. WhatsApp and Instagram users were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control condition. Participants answered pre-treatment measures and were then asked to follow accounts on the respective platforms. At this stage, in wave 1 we measured compliance with the screenshots uploaded by the users. Two weeks later participants were surveyed again. In wave 2, we measured compliance with self-reported questions and participants answered post-treatment questions.

Below, we focus on the participants who completed both waves and uploaded at least a screenshot in wave 1 (regardless of whether the screenshot is valid). In Supplementary Information we report all exclusions. In total, 1,700 German participants (985 women, mean age of 40.5 years), and 1,695 French participants (1,042 women, mean age of 44.1 years) completed both waves. Age, gender and education were evenly distributed across control and treatment, and we observed no systematic bias in dropout across the conditions (Supplementary Information).

Our dependent variables were repeated across waves, and in wave 2 we added new political knowledge items and questions about new true and false news stories that appeared between the waves so that participants could not have possibly known them before the treatment. Supplementary Information details the wording of the questions for all the items used in the analyses and in Methods and Fig. 2 we offer an overview of our dependent variables. The use of dynamic dependent variables allowed us to maximize internal validity and assess over-time changes in current affairs knowledge, awareness and belief accuracy. Our field experiment also maximized external validity as we do not force exposure but instead incentivize it as part of participants' daily platform usage and measure effects up to 14 days after (potential) exposure.

On the left, the figure shows the dependent variables measured in wave 1, and on the right, those measured in wave 2. Dynamic dependent variables are highlighted in brown boxes, while static dependent variables are shown in blue boxes.

We estimated the effects of our treatment using linear mixed-effect models with participants as a random effect, and control for age, gender, education and past vote (as well as country and platform), as preregistered. In particular, we modelled whether within-individual changes across waves are greater in the treatment compared with the control.

Figure 3 summarizes our main findings and breaks them down by country and by platform and Fig. 4 breaks them down by compliance levels.

The black asterisks are the preregistered combined estimates across platforms and countries. The blue squares are estimates of the French Instagram treatment and the orange squares are the estimates of the German Instagram treatment. The blue triangles are estimates of the French WhatsApp treatment and the orange triangles are the estimates of the German WhatsApp treatment. The error bands represent the 95% confidence intervals. The β represents standardized regression coefficients.

Full compliers (N = 1,466) uploaded screenshots showing they followed the accounts and activated the notifications, and reported following the accounts in wave 2. Notifications noncompliers (N = 746) are similar to full compliers except that their screenshots do not show that they activated the notifications. Noncompliers (N = 240) did not upload a screenshot showing that they followed even one account. Partial compliers (N = 942) are the remaining participants; they uploaded screenshots showing they follow only one account and/or only activated the notifications for one account and/or reported having unfollowed the accounts in wave 2. The error bands represent the 95% confidence intervals. The β represents standardized regression coefficients.

First, the treatment led to greater gains in current affairs knowledge across waves, measured as the number of correct answers to the news quiz on national and international news. Current affairs knowledge increased among the treatment group by 0.12 points across waves compared with the control (β = 0.07 (0.01 to 0.12), P = 0.024). The gains are greater among participants who fully complied, with an increase in current affairs knowledge of 0.21 points (β = 0.12 (0.05 to 0.36), P = 0.008), and not significant among noncompliers.

Second, the treatments increased gains in awareness of true news stories (but not false news stories), namely the number of news stories participants reported having heard of or read before, while controlling for participants' tendency to report being aware of news stories they have not encountered with a placebo news story. The increase in awareness of true news stories across waves was 0.14 points higher in the treatment group compared with the control (β = 0.08 (0.02 to 0.14), P = 0.006). These gains are greater among participants who fully complied, with an increase in awareness of true news stories of 0.25 points (β = 0.15 (0.06 to 0.24), P = 0.001). The treatments did not significantly increase awareness of false news stories (β = 0.03 (−0.03 to 0.10), P = 0.32), regardless of levels of compliance or country platform-specific effects.

Third, we found substantial and statistically significant positive effects of our treatment on gains in belief accuracy across waves, computed as the difference between the perceived accuracy of true and false news stories60. Following two news accounts for 2 weeks increased belief accuracy by 0.70 points compared with the control (β = 0.06 (0.02 to 0.11), P = 0.004). These gains are larger among participants who fully complied, with an increase in belief accuracy of 1.04 points (β = 0.10 (0.03 to 0.16), P = 0.004), and nonsignificant among noncompliers. Overall, gains in belief accuracy are due to a higher acquisition of true beliefs across waves (β = 0.05 (0.02 to 0.09), P = 0.001) rather than to a lower acquisition of false beliefs (β = 0.01 (−0.04 to 0.06), P = 0.80).

Even though these results show that following news organizations on social media does increase current affairs knowledge and belief accuracy, participants in the treatments did not significantly feel more informed about current events or politics compared with controls (β = 0.01 (−0.04 to 0.05), P = 0.84)—none of the country platform-specific effects come close to statistical significance.

We also clearly show that across countries and platforms, the treatments increased trust in the news as well as trust in the specific news sources participants were asked to follow. Across waves, trust in news increased by 0.13 points on the six-point scale in the treatment compared with the control (β = 0.13 (0.08 to 0.18), P < 0.001). Regarding trust in the specific news outlets, in France, the treatment increased trust in France Info and Hugo Décrypte, while in Germany they increased trust in FAZ and SZ (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Finally, the treatments had no statistically significant effect on political efficacy (β = −0.02 (−0.07 to 0.03), P = 0.46), interest in the news (β = −0.02 (−0.09 to 0.04), P = 0.46), interest in politics (β = 0.01 (−0.04 to 0.07), P = 0.61) or on any of the eight feeling thermometers (Supplementary Information). The full results for these outcomes broken down by country and platform are reported in Supplementary Information.

We conducted a number of robustness checks and provide additional information in Supplementary Information. In sections 1 and 2 we report detailed results for the static dependent variables. In section 3 we break down the results by waves. In section 4 we report various measures of compliance. In section 5 we report qualitative comments from participants. In section 6 we offer the descriptives statistics of all dependent variables. In section 7 and on Open Science Framework (OSF), we report heterogeneous treatment effects. In section 8 we show no differential attrition and correct randomization. In section 9 we report all exclusions and screens. In section 10 and on OSF we report all the questions in the survey, while in section 11, we show that the results hold while controlling for news use.

Social media platforms have been accused of facilitating the spread of toxic, sensationalist, manipulative and otherwise harmful low-quality content, which may foment polarization, increase misinformation endorsement and lower citizen support for democratic processes and institutions. Most interventions have tried to fight exposure to and spread of this ‘bad' political content or teach individuals to recognize or resist such content. In contrast, our approach enhanced the ‘good' content in users' social media ecosystem. As news media organizations have integrated platforms into their communication strategies, we tested whether incentivizing social media users to follow quality news on Instagram and WhatsApp can generate positive democratic outcomes.

Our field experiment on 3,395 WhatsApp or Instagram users in France and Germany offers three key findings. First, prompting social media users to follow news organizations increases current affairs knowledge, belief accuracy and awareness of true news stories, as well as trust in news, journalists and the news organizations followed. These effects are (probably) due to increased exposure to news content: participants in the treatment saw more news and learned from it. The effects on trust may be due to participants underestimating the quality of news coverage before the experiment and updating their perceptions after being exposed to this coverage, which in turn spilled over to perceptions of news and journalists more broadly. We note that these findings are more in line with past deactivation studies, which show that deactivating Facebook reduces knowledge61,62,63, than with other, mostly cross-sectional, work, showing that platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook, have null or negative effects on political knowledge25,45.

We emphasize that our findings emerged despite the naturalistic setting of daily social media use, which offers myriad distractions that could dilute the impact of the intervention. Exposure to news was not 'forced' and the treatment only consisted of following two news accounts for 2 weeks, which pales in comparison to the hundreds of other, potentially more interesting, accounts users follow. Even in the treatment group, news probably only represented a tiny portion of all the content participants saw on the platform. Still, some news content did manage to cut through the noise and produce measurable beneficial effects. For these reasons, it is important to keep in mind that, despite being statistically significant, the treatment effects are small. We also found numerous nonsignificant effects, such as awareness of and belief in false news stories, the feeling of being informed, interest in news and politics, political efficacy and feelings towards Ukraine, Russia, Palestine, Israel, Europe and specific political parties. These null effects are in line with past work showing that attitudes are very resistant to change16,18,25.

Second, the fact that these effects were detected in ecological settings and over time is particularly optimistic. Unlike fact-checking individual news stories or punctual accuracy prompts, our approach may build longer-term capacities and skills among users, helping them situate potentially problematic information in larger associative networks of factual knowledge gained from reliable media. Moreover, the gains in news trust of reliable outlets may translate into further gains in true beliefs, conditional on exposure to such content.

These two core findings together suggest that improving exposure to verified information from news media could be more effective than reducing exposure to low-quality information from junk news. The increased belief in true news and trust in news and journalists is important given the evidence that the rejection of true news may be a bigger problem than the acceptance of false news. For instance, people are sceptical of true news64, distrust news media in general, including reliable news outlets22 and trust mainstream news outlets much less than fact checkers do65. This suggests that improving exposure to reliable information may be more beneficial26,66 than reducing exposure to misinformation, which—after all—represents a small portion of the news people see online67.

Our third key finding regards the qualitative comments from the participants. These comments are overwhelmingly positive (Supplementary Information) and suggest that some users were largely unaware that it is easy and free to follow news organizations on Instagram and WhatsApp. This lack of awareness emerged especially in the comments from the WhatsApp sample, perhaps because the platform is mainly used for one-to-one communication and WhatsApp channels are a relatively new feature. Crucially, 51% of participants indicated that they intend to keep following these news organizations after the termination of the experiment. These qualitative insights suggest that the lack of awareness about the presence of quality news on platforms may partly contribute to the low levels of news consumption on social media (similar to the unawareness of censored information available via VPNs in China68.

These comments add to the recent evidence that social media users report wanting to receive more educational and informative content41 and that increasing recommendations and exposure to news on YouTube does not decrease users' engagement with and activity on the platform25. These comments, and our overall findings, suggest that following news generates positive effects, and calls into question the decisions of some platforms—most notably Meta—to minimize news dissemination. At the time of writing, news is downranked on Facebook, in some countries news outlets have been blocked from posting links to their content on Facebook and Instagram, and by default, the Instagram and Threads algorithms do not recommend news, users have to opt in. Meta claimed that people are not interested in news, that news is ‘highly substitutable'69, and that Meta ‘never thought about news as a way to minimize misinformation/disinformation on our services'70. We suggest that there is a demand for free and reliable news on social media platforms not commonly used for news, and that, in line with past work37,38, news can help people discern facts from fiction. People increasingly consume news on social media, and although they worry about inaccurate news, they find it convenient to use social media for news22,71.

Although this project offers new optimistic evidence, we encourage future research to examine the generalizability of our findings. For one, it is unclear whether similar effects would emerge on platforms with different features or uses. In our case, we do not detect statistically significant differences between platforms, but we lack statistical power to detect small differences. Yet there are reasons to expect that platforms with different algorithms and affordances would yield distinct results. For instance, if participants had followed news accounts on TikTok, they may never have been exposed to content from these accounts because users mostly use the ‘For you' feed, which weakly prioritizes followed accounts. Similarly on YouTube, where the algorithms direct users away from news3, subscribing to news channels may not increase news exposure in any pronounced ways (but tweaking the algorithm itself does generate these increases25). However, holding the quantity and quality of news constant, exposure to news on TikTok, YouTube or other platforms should also yield the benefits documented here.

Studies should replicate our findings in different countries and different times in electoral politics. Our experiment was run in two multiparty systems with strong public-service broadcasting and during relatively contentious times (with EU elections, the Israel-Gaza war and the Russian-Ukraine war). The effects may be different in other periods and contexts. Further, our approach is premised on the presence of reliable news outlets posting on social media, yet, in some countries or on some platforms, such outlets may be scarce. Moreover, our findings are contextual to the design of the platforms and their algorithms at the moment of the experiment72, and so extending our work to different platforms, countries and time periods is needed.

Future work should also investigate the theoretical mechanisms behind the treatment effects. Breaking down the results by compliance levels offers some preliminary insights. The absence of statistically significant effects among participants who followed the news accounts but did not turn on the notifications (compared with participants who turned them on; the full compliers) suggests that notifications may have played an important role. Notifications could expose users to news content directly, cutting through the in-platform noise and informing users about current events and/or serve as a mere reminder for the users to access news. News notifications are not unusual. In wave 1, 47.5% of participants reported having received news notifications on their phones in the past week (in line with ref. 73).

The beneficial effects detected may be explained through cognitive processing theories74: the concise, visually-driven nature of short-form news on platforms such as Instagram and WhatsApp may enhance information retention by reducing cognitive overload, while the interactive features of these platforms could foster deeper engagement. Unlike traditional, longer formats, the processing of which requires deeper, more reflective processing (per the Elaboration Likelihood Model75, short-form news may rely more on peripheral cues such as visuals or source credibility. This could mean that the cognitive and emotional pathways through which these formats influence knowledge retention, trust and content discernment differ substantially from those activated by traditional media. We encourage scholars to explore these understudied mechanisms.

We also encourage studies to assess the potential cumulative or over-time effects of our intervention25,26. If users engage with news on platforms, the algorithms are more likely to classify those users as politically interested, which increases future recommendations to news and public affairs27,28. Currently, there is a likely feedback loop where platforms deprioritize news, lowering users' exposure to news and leading users to seek out news less. Our approach could break these loops and set in motion a cycle where users receive updates from the news accounts they followed and from other accounts recommended by the algorithms26. On the downside, our approach could have negative substitution effects by increasing social media news consumption while reducing the consumption of higher-quality news. Yet such substitution effects are rare18,76, rely on shaky assumptions and, importantly, are incompatible with our treatment effects.

Last, we add to the research on potential interventions to minimize information harms from social media platforms, yet we acknowledge that future research needs to examine whether and how our approach could be scalable. As an intervention, our approach could be implemented at scale either by platforms themselves, which could start prioritizing and recommending, not downranking, news in users' feeds, or by news organizations, which could increase their presence on social media and actively make the users more aware of this presence. Our findings clearly indicate that this could have democratically beneficial effects and—as the aforementioned research shows—would not minimize users' engagement with the platforms25,41. Alternatively, (targeted) social media ads, educational campaigns and informational outreach done by non-profits could be viable encouragement for some users to follow (more) factual and reliable news media organizations.

In summary, following news accounts on social media is a relatively rare behaviour among users, and accounts of celebrities or sports teams have disproportionately greater following on platforms48. Yet, as we show, users are willing to engage with news media when encouraged to do so, and this engagement increases current affairs knowledge, awareness of true news stories, belief accuracy and enhances trust in the news and journalists. This means that, with the right incentives, social media can be a powerful tool for promoting informed and engaged citizenship.

This research project complied with all ethical regulations for research involving human subjects and received ethical approval from the University of Zürich PhF Ethics Committee (ethics approval no. 23.10.14). Participants provided informed consent at the beginning of each survey and were debriefed at the end of wave 2 (all the materials are available on OSF).

The preregistrations, materials, R scripts and the data to replicate the findings are publicly available on OSF.

In 2024, between 1 and 11 March, we recruited 2,009 German and 2,021 French participants via the market research company Bilendi. Participants were recontacted between 18 and 28 March. In total, 1,700 German participants (985 women, mean age of 40.5 (12.5) years; median education of a 2-year college degree, 38% had a bachelor degree or more) and 1,695 French participants (1,042 women, mean age of 44.1 (11.5) years, median education of finished high school, 31% had a bachelor degree or more) completed the second wave. The median distance between waves was 14 days (mean of 13.4 days, s.d. of 1.74 days). In Supplementary Information we report all exclusions and show that randomization was successful and that there was no problem of differential attrition.

Participants first consented to take part in the study and answered screening questions about (1) whether they have Instagram and WhatsApp accounts, (2) how frequently they use them and (3) whether they follow a list of social media accounts. To be eligible, participants had to have either an Instagram account or WhatsApp, use Instagram or WhatsApp, and not already be following the news accounts included in the experiment. After passing the screens, Instagram users were randomly assigned to the Instagram control or the Instagram treatment, WhatsApp users were randomly assigned to the WhatsApp control or the WhatsApp treatment, and those who used both Instagram and WhatsApp were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions (Fig. 1).

After answering the screening questions, participants were told that they would have to follow two (at that moment, not yet specified) accounts on social media for 2 weeks and upload screenshots to show that they complied. At this stage, participants were asked again if they consent to take part in the study.

Those who consented answered demographic questions (gender, age, education and vote at the last presidential election) and reported their news consumption frequency in general, on WhatsApp and on Instagram (from ‘Never' to ‘More than ten times a day'). Participants also reported their main source of news (for example, TV, social media and so on) and whether they received news notifications on their phones last week. TV was the main source of news for 37% of participants, followed by social media (22%), online (19%) and radio (17%). In wave 1, participants reported very low news consumption on WhatsApp and Instagram. In the WhatsApp groups, 62% reported never consuming news on WhatsApp and 15% reported consuming it less than once a day (mean of 1.87 on a six-point scale). In the Instagram groups, 29% of participants reported never consuming news on Instagram and 23% reported consuming it less than once a day (mean of 2.61). The questions on news consumption were taken or adapted from the Digital News report22.

In both waves, participants reported how informed they feel about the news and politics77, how interested they are in the news and politics (from ‘Not at all' (1) to ‘Extremely' (6)22), the extent to which they trust the news and journalists (‘To what extent do you trust the media and journalists?' from ‘Not at all' (1) to ‘Completely' (7)), as well as the extent to which they trust the specific news sources included in the treatments (from ‘Not at all' (1) to ‘Completely' (7)22). We measured political efficacy with the following questions ‘How well would you say you understand the important political issues facing our country?' (from ‘Not at all' (1) to ‘A lot' (5)) and ‘Do you often think that politics and government are so complicated that you can't understand what's going on?' (reverse coded, from ‘Never' (1) to ‘Yes, most of the time' (5)). These questions are commonly used to measure internal political efficacy78.

In wave 1, these outcomes are considered dynamic because they changed between the waves, such that new items were added in wave 2 (Fig. 2). All current affairs knowledge and news stories questions are reported in Supplementary Information.

We measured current affairs knowledge with three multiple-choice questions (with seven options, including ‘Don't know') on the date of the next European election, the name of a French/German minister and the name of the southernmost town in the Gaza Strip. Such questions, in contrast with ‘textbook knowledge' about how politics and governments function, are often used in surveys measuring political knowledge acquisition across numerous waves37,55. Our current affairs knowledge questions do not measure how well participants understand current political events, but rather their knowledge related to current affairs. Current affairs knowledge was computed as the sum of correct responses.

We used feeling thermometers (from 0 to 100) to measure how people felt towards Palestine, Israel, Ukraine, Russia and the European Union, as well as left-wing and right-wing political parties and the party of the current government.

We measured belief in, and awareness of, true and false news stories by asking participants to rate two true news stories selected from mainstream news outlets and two false news stories that have been fact checked as false by independent fact checkers. For each claim, participants were asked ‘Before this survey, had you ever read or heard this statement?' (‘Yes', ‘No' or ‘Don't know/Don't remember') and ‘Do you think this statement is rather true or false?' (from ‘Completely false' (1) to ‘Completely true' (8))37. Awareness in claims was computed as the sum of ‘Yes' responses.

All participants were asked to follow two accounts, activate the notifications and upload screenshots showing that they complied. Participants in the WhatsApp conditions followed accounts on WhatsApp while participants in the Instagram conditions followed accounts on Instagram. Participants in the treatment conditions followed news accounts (France Info and Hugo Décrypte in France or FAZ and SZ in Germany), while participants in the control conditions followed non-news accounts about art (Musée Rodin or farbenfroh art), music (les Inrockuptibles or Sie Klassik radio) movies (Allociné or Serienjunkies) or food (Marmiton or Einfach Tasty).

While Hugo Décrypte is a news influencer (the most popular one by far in France22), his coverage is very similar to mainstream news outlets such as the ones included in the experiment. All the news accounts are popular on Instagram and enjoy a wide reach (followers count: Hugo Décrypte 3.9m, France Info 809k, SZ 811k and FAZ 631k), while they are markedly less influential on WhatsApp (Hugo Décrypte 406k, France Info 230k, SZ 36k and FAZ 16k). Regarding the formats, on Instagram the accounts use mostly videos and images, while Hugo Décrypte relies almost exclusively on images with text. On WhatsApp, France Info has an audio format with some text, Hugo Décrypte a text format with no links, while FAZ and SZ use a text format with links to (their) news stories.

Participants were first asked basic questions about their WhatsApp and Instagram use, and answered questions about their news consumption, their main source of news, as well as the static dependent variables (that is, trust in news, feeling thermometers, political efficacy, news and political interest and feeling of being informed).

Participants then answered the dynamic dependent variables. They answered the same three current affairs knowledge questions as in wave 1, plus four new current affairs knowledge questions about events that took place between wave 1 and wave 2. They rated the same two true news stories as in wave 1, plus five new news stories about events that took place between wave 1 and wave 2. They rated the same two false news stories as in wave 1, plus two additional false news stories about events that took place before wave 1 (we had fewer additional false than true questions because we could not find new false news stories circulating in France and Germany between waves). Participants also rated a ‘placebo' news story that we made up (‘Brazil has introduced a new tropical forest monitoring system that detects and prevents illegal deforestation in real time.'). We used responses to this placebo news story to control for participants' tendency to report being aware of news stories they have not encountered (as they could not have possibly encountered the placebo news stories before): 14.2% of participants reported having heard or read the placebo news stories before, while the median number of news stories participants reported being aware of was 4 (out of 11).

The dynamic dependent variables allow us to measure the acquisition of beliefs and knowledge, as well as gains in awareness. Such design is typically used in survey research37,55 and reflects an interest in the change in the dependent variables (for example, beliefs and knowledge) rather than changes in the independent variables (for example, news consumption). Yet here, we combine this design with a field experiment in which we experimentally manipulate what is typically considered the independent variable (that is, news consumption), allowing us to draw stronger causal inferences.

At the end of the survey, participants were told that they could unfollow the accounts and were asked how likely they were to unfollow them. Fifty-one per cent of participants in the treatments reported being ‘very unlikely' or ‘unlikely' to unfollow the accounts. Qualitative analyses of participants' comments to the open-ended box at the end of the survey also suggest that many participants enjoyed following the news account and will continue to follow them in the future (Supplementary Information).

Independent coders rated all the screenshots uploaded by the participants in wave 1. We found that compliance for the account following was high: 87.9% of the participants uploaded screenshots showing they follow both accounts and 92.8% of participants uploaded at least a screenshot showing that they follow one account. Compliance for the notifications was lower: 48.4% of participants uploaded screenshots showing that they activated the notifications for both accounts and 65.1% of participants uploaded at least a screenshot showing that they activated the notifications for one account.

At the beginning of wave 2, participants had to write down the names of the accounts they were asked to follow in wave 1 without looking them up: 71% of participants in the treatments correctly mentioned both news accounts. Then, participants were presented with a list of seven social media accounts and had to click on the ones that they follow on Instagram and WhatsApp. While in wave 1 we used these questions as a screener, in wave 2 we used them as a compliance check. Eighty-nine per cent of participants in the treatments reported following the news accounts (compared with 0% in wave 1). Participants were explicitly asked whether they stopped following the accounts (knowing that their response would be anonymous and would not affect their payment), 13% of participants in the treatments reported having done so. In Supplementary Information we report additional measures of compliance showing that overall compliance was high.

We ran linear mixed-effect models with participants as a random effect. We preregistered adding wave as a random slope (Wave∣ID) but the models failed to converge. We analysed the responses at the level of the wave participant, that is, two data points per participant, one per wave. We included an interaction term between ‘Condition' and ‘Wave' to estimate treatment effects. This approach allows us to determine whether, for example, within-individual gains in current affairs knowledge between waves are larger in the treatments than in the controls. In all analyses, we controlled for age, gender, education and past vote. All statistical tests are two tailed.

Following the preregistration, the main analyses are conducted across countries and platforms, but in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information we report all treatment effects per country platforms.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering that most HBV-infected individuals remain asymptomatic, the mechanism linking HBV to hepatitis and HCC remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that HBV alone does not cause liver inflammation or cancer. Instead, HBV alters the chronic inflammation induced by chemical carcinogens to promote liver carcinogenesis. Long-term HBV genome expression in mouse liver increases liver inflammation and cancer propensity caused by a carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). HBV plus DEN-activated interleukin-33 (IL-33)/regulatory T cell axis is required for liver carcinogenesis. Pitavastatin, an IL-33 inhibitor, suppresses HBV plus DEN-induced liver cancer. IL-33 is markedly elevated in HBV+ hepatitis patients, and pitavastatin use significantly correlates with reduced risk of hepatitis and its associated HCC in patients. Collectively, our findings reveal that environmental carcinogens are the link between HBV and HCC risk, creating a window of opportunity for cancer prevention in HBV carriers.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that can cause persistent infection in primates1,2,3. It is estimated that the prevalence of HBV infection is around 250 million cases worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis and HCC4,5. HBV's high prevalence has led to the development of a vaccine using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)6,7. However, HBV remains a significant global health threat. Key contributing factors include limited access to the HBV vaccine in certain countries, noncompliance with multi-dose regimens, and the presence of vaccine non-responders, estimated at 16% of the population, which are more prevalent among older individuals, those with obesity, and smokers8,9,10,11. Importantly, these same risk factors have well-known carcinogenic effects and may be the primary drivers of hepatitis and HCC in HBV-infected liver12,13. As such, it is essential to determine the underlying mechanism linking HBV infection to hepatitis and HCC in order to effectively address this global challenge.

HBV DNA can integrate into the host genome, which has been proposed as a mechanism for genomic mutations with oncogenic effects14. However, HBV is typically a non-cytopathic virus programmed for benign episomal replication3. Although 10-30% of HCC cases are associated with HBV infection, the HBV genome integration ratio in tumor cells is lower than in non-tumor tissues15,16. The other proposed mechanism linking HBV to HCC relates to HBV's ability to induce chronic inflammation in the liver17,18. HBV infection tightly interacts with the host immune system3,19,20,21. CD8+ T cell response to HBV infection, as a potential therapeutic target, can lead to viral clearance but may paradoxically contribute to disease pathogenesis during the early stages22,23. CD8+ T cells' attempt to eliminate infected hepatocytes and HBV-associated HCC cells can instead result in T cell exhaustion, resulting in chronic inflammation and the development of malignancy24,25. The impaired function of CD4+ T cells and natural killer cells is another significant consequence of HBV infection26,27. In addition, the elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood and increased number of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are positively correlated with disease progression in patients with HBV-associated HCC4. However, there is limited inflammation in the ‘immune tolerant' and ‘immune inactive' stages of chronic HBV infection28,29,30. While immune imbalance induced by chronic HBV infection is considered the cause of HBV-related HCC development31, the factors that induce this immune imbalance are unclear. In fact, HBV infection often does not cause any overt liver pathology, and up to 60% of HBV-infected individuals remain asymptomatic32. The combination of HBV infection and environmental factors, such as alcohol and smoking, is associated with increased liver injury33,34,35. This suggests that HBV alone may not be sufficient to induce chronic inflammation or liver cancer. Although the incidence of HBV infection is decreasing owing to vaccination, HBV infection remains a serious health problem globally10,36. Thus, it is essential to determine the full biological impact of HBV infection on the liver to uncover suitable therapeutic agents for hepatitis and HCC prevention in HBV-infected individuals.

Herein, we investigated the mechanism linking HBV to chronic hepatitis and HCC development. Importantly, mice chronically inoculated with the HBV genome did not develop liver inflammation or cancer. Instead, HBV modulated the liver response to a tobacco smoke carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)37,38, resulting in severe liver cancer phenotype. HBV-containing liver exposed to DEN upregulated interleukin-33 (IL-33), which was required for liver cancer development. Loss of IL-33 markedly reduced IL-33 receptor (IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) or ST2) expressing Tregs in HBV+DEN-treated liver. Accordingly, ST2 deletion on Tregs blocked liver cancer development in HBV+DEN-treated mice accompanied by increased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the liver. Treatment with pitavastatin, an inhibitor of IL-33 expression39, resulted in reduced risk of chronic hepatitis and liver cancer in mice and humans. Our findings indicate that HBV-infected individuals can be protected from hepatitis and HCC by minimizing their risk of exposure to chemical carcinogens. Furthermore, suppressing IL-33/Treg axis in the liver using statins represents a safe and effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis and its cancer sequelae.

To establish an HBV infection-like model in mice, we employed a pAAV-HBV1.2 vector to deliver the HBV genome to hepatocytes via hydrodynamic tail vein injection40,41. This method resulted in persistent HBV gene expression in the liver, as evidenced by detectable HBsAg in the circulation for 6 months post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Importantly, HBV genome expression in 28-day-old wild-type (WT) mice did not cause any liver cancer over 12 months post-infection (Fig. 1a, b). In contrast, HBV-expressing WT mice that received a carcinogen, DEN, (HBV+DEN) showed a significantly higher liver tumor burden, reduced survival, and increased PCNA+ proliferating hepatocytes compared with the Sham+DEN group (Fig. 1a–f and Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Importantly, HBV DNA and gene expression persisted in HBV+DEN and HBV+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated WT livers up to 8 months post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 1d–g). Thus, the combination of HBV and carcinogen accelerates liver cancer development, whereas HBV alone does not cause hepatocyte proliferation or cancer.

To explore the link between chronic hepatitis and liver cancer development in HBV-positive mice, we examined the immune environment of the liver at 4 months post-infection prior to any cancer development (Fig. 1a, b). HBV genome expression alone did not cause any liver damage measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels or liver inflammation assessed by CD45+ leukocyte counts in the liver (Fig. 2a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 2a). However, CD45+ leukocyte counts were significantly increased in the HBV+DEN group compared with the Sham+DEN, HBV+PBS, and Sham+PBS groups (Fig. 2a, b). Additionally, HBV+DEN-treated mice exhibited elevated serum ALT levels compared with HBV+PBS and Sham+PBS-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To investigate the underlying mechanism leading to more severe chronic liver inflammation in HBV+DEN compared with Sham+DEN-treated mice, we performed whole liver RNA sequencing at 4 months post-infection. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that the HBV+DEN-treated liver upregulated hepatitis-related genes compared with Sham+DEN group (Fig. 2c). Further analysis identified six differentially expressed cytokines: Il33, Il1b, Il4, Il16, Il7, and Il18 (Fig. 2d). Previous studies have linked IL-33 to cancer-prone chronic inflammation39,42,43, prompting us to explore its role in HBV+DEN-associated liver cancer development. HBV+DEN-treated mice exhibited higher IL-33 expression in their liver compared with Sham+DEN-treated mice, which was expressed by E-cadherin+ hepatocytes and α-SMA+ hepatic stellate cells (Fig. 2e–g and Supplementary Fig. 2b). By contrast, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-16 protein levels were not increased in HBV+DEN- compared with Sham+DEN-treated WT liver (Supplementary Fig. 2c-e). We have demonstrated that the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3-4/TBK1/IRF3 pathway drives IL-33 expression in chronic inflammation39. Accordingly, activated TBK1 (phospho-TBK1) and IRF3 (phospho-IRF3) were induced in HBV+DEN-treated liver compared with the other treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 3a). DEN induces immunogenic cell death in hepatocytes44,45. Interestingly, HBV+DEN treatment led to significantly greater DNA damage, as indicated by γH2AX+ cells in the liver, compared with Sham+DEN at 4 months post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). Likewise, HBV+DEN-treated liver showed elevated high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression, a well-known damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and TLR4 agonist46,47,48, in hepatocytes compared with Sham+DEN-treated liver at 4 months post-infection (Fig. 2h, i and Supplementary Fig. 3d). HBV genome expression alone did not impact HMGB1 expression in the liver (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Serum HMGB1 levels were also elevated in HBV+DEN compared with HBV+PBS and Sham+PBS groups (Supplementary Fig. 3f), indicating that increased HMGB1 was secreted from the nucleus to function as a DAMP molecule. These findings indicate that the HMGB1/TLR4/TBK1/IRF3 axis activates IL-33 expression in HBV-positive liver that is exposed to carcinogens, which may lead to hepatitis and cancer development.

To investigate the role of IL-33 in HBV+DEN-induced liver cancer, we subjected Il33 knockout (Il33KO), ST2 knockout (ST2KO), and Il33 transcription factor, Irf3, knockout (Irf3KO) mice to HBV+DEN liver carcinogenesis protocol (Fig. 1a). HBV+DEN-treated Il33KO, ST2KO, and Irf3KO mice showed significantly lower liver tumor burden and decreased PCNA+ proliferating hepatocytes compared with HBV+DEN-treated WT mice at 8 months post-infection (Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 4a). The comparable reduction in liver tumor burden observed in HBV+DEN-treated Il33KO and ST2KO mice demonstrated that IL-33's cytokine function, rather than its nuclear function42, was responsible for HBV+DEN-mediated liver cancer development. Thus, we next examined which ST2-expressing immune cell type(s) is most suppressed in Il33KO compared with WT liver treated with HBV+DEN49. ST2+ Tregs exhibited the most significant reduction compared with other immune cells in HBV+DEN-treated Il33KO versus WT liver at 4 months post-infection (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Tregs create a tumor-promoting environment by releasing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and IL-1050,51. IL-2, a critical cytokine for maintaining Tregs52,53,54,55, increased hepatic Tregs proliferation in combination with IL-33 (Fig. 3f). Interestingly, IL-33 addition to IL-2 significantly upregulated TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression by ST2+ hepatic Tregs compared with IL-2 alone (Fig. 3g, h). Similarly, IL-33 addition to IL-2 significantly upregulated TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression by ST2+ splenic Tregs (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e). Interestingly, we detected ST2+ Tregs in HBV-associated chronic hepatitis in humans, which were increased compared with healthy control livers (Supplementary Fig. 5a)56. We found that ST2+ Tregs were increased in HBV-associated immune active hepatitis compared with chronic resolved hepatitis and healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)57. These findings demonstrate that IL-33 supports ST2+ Tregs in HBV+DEN-treated liver, which upregulate TGF-β and IL-10 expression in response to IL-33.

To determine whether IL-33-activated Tregs contributed to cancer development in HBV+DEN-treated mice, we subjected Foxp3Cre, ST2 flox/flox (TregST2CKO) mice in which ST2 was specifically deleted in Tregs to HBV+DEN liver carcinogenesis protocol (Fig. 1a). HBV+DEN-treated TregST2CKO mice showed significantly lower liver tumor burden, improved liver architecture, and decreased PCNA+ proliferating hepatocytes compared with HBV+DEN-treated WT mice at 8 months post-infection (Fig. 4a–e and Supplementary Fig. 6a). A significantly fewer Tregs expressed IL-10 in TregST2CKO compared with WT liver (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 6b-d). Accordingly, loss of ST2 expression on Tregs compromised their immunosuppressive function, leading to increased CD3+ T and CD8+ T cell infiltration in the HBV+DEN-treated liver at 4 months post-infection (Fig. 4g-i). In addition, activated CD44+CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in HBV+DEN-treated Treg-ST2CKO compared with WT liver (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). Thus, the IL-33/Treg axis plays a critical role in mediating cancer development in the liver exposed to HBV plus carcinogens.

Pitavastatin is a safe and widely used lipid-lowering medication that suppresses the TBK1-IRF3-IL-33 signaling pathway39. To determine the role of pitavastatin for liver cancer prevention in HBV-infected individuals, we treated WT mice with 2 mg/kg pitavastatin or PBS alone (carrier control) once a week during the HBV+DEN liver carcinogenesis protocol until harvest, which suppressed IL-33 levels (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Importantly, pitavastatin treatment significantly lowered liver tumor burden, improved liver architecture, and decreased PCNA+ proliferating hepatocytes compared with carrier control in HBV+DEN-treated WT mice at 8 months post-infection (Fig. 5a–e and Supplementary Fig. 7b). To extend our findings to humans, we measured serum IL-33 levels in hepatitis patients and healthy individuals. HBV+ and HBV- hepatitis patients showed similarly elevated serum ALT levels compared with healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 7c). HBV-associated hepatitis patients showed significantly higher serum IL-33 levels compared with healthy controls, which were also higher than non-HBV hepatitis patients (Fig. 5f, g). Interestingly, serum IL-33 levels were higher in HBV+ versus HBV- patients with other liver diseases, including HCC, cirrhosis, hepatic cyst, fatty liver, and liver hemangioma (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Moreover, serum IL-33 levels positively correlated with serum HBsAg levels across all HBV+ patients in the study (Supplementary Fig. 7e and Supplementary Data 1). Based on these findings, we performed an epidemiological study to determine whether pitavastatin use was associated with a reduced risk of hepatitis and HCC. We compared matched cohorts of patients from the TriNetX diamond network, a global health network comprising electronic medical record-derived data from over 200 million patients across 92 healthcare organizations in North America and Europe (Supplementary Table 1). The risk of hepatitis was significantly reduced in patients treated with pitavastatin compared with those treated with ezetimibe, another cholesterol-lowering agent commonly used in the clinic that doesn't affect the mevalonate pathway (OR 0.727; 95% CI 0.685-0.771; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5h). Furthermore, the risk of HCC associated with hepatitis was markedly decreased in the pitavastatin-treated group compared with the ezetimibe cohort (OR 0.577; 95% CI 0.506-0.657; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5h). Lastly, IL33 and IL1RL1 (ST2) gene expression showed a negative correlation with CD8+ T cell and a positive correlation with Treg infiltration in human HCC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets (Fig. 5i, j). Collectively, HBV infection link to hepatitis and HCC is mediated by its impact on the immune response to environmental carcinogens, which are the primary drivers of hepatitis and HCC (Fig. 5k).

Our findings reveal the essential role of environmental carcinogens in linking HBV to hepatitis and HCC, highlighting the potential for effective strategies to prevent cancer development in HBV-infected individuals. HBV infection alone does not result in liver inflammation or cancer. Instead, HBV infection primarily exacerbates liver inflammation and early cancer development induced by carcinogens. This phenomenon is mediated by HBV, promoting DAMPs (e.g., HMGB1) expression in the HBV-containing hepatocytes that experience carcinogen-induced cellular damage. Importantly, we identify a key immune factor, IL-33, downstream of DAMP induction that significantly contributes to cancer development. IL-33 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HBV plus carcinogen-induced liver injury by binding to ST2+ Tregs in the liver. IL-33-activated Tregs produce higher levels of cytokines, TGF-β and IL-10, which promote chronic inflammation and early cancer development while inhibiting the recruitment of antitumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells58,59,60. Our research demonstrates that blocking the IL-33/Treg signaling axis, particularly through statin treatment, can effectively suppress chronic hepatitis and prevent HCC development in HBV-infected individuals.

Despite the challenges associated with studying liver cancer development in the context of HBV infection, we have utilized an innovative HBV infection-like model employing AAV vector and hydrodynamic injection techniques61,62 to gain insights into HBV-related immune responses and spontaneous liver cancer development. Chronic HBV infection is associated with a dysregulated immune response characterized by compromised adaptive immunity and increased liver damage63,64. Our research provides innovative insights into the mechanism linking HBV to liver damage, which is governed by exposure to carcinogens. We find that Tregs' role in HBV-associated liver pathogenesis is mediated by IL-33 induction in the liver65. IL-33 is an alarmin cytokine induced in response to cellular injury, which has pro- and anti-cancer effects in various contexts43,66,67,68,69,70. IL-33 induced by TLR3/4-TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathways drives cancer-prone chronic inflammation in the skin and pancreas39,42,71. However, IL-33 can enhance the activity of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, thereby inhibiting cancer development72,73. We find that IL-33 induction is associated with HMGB1 upregulation in the liver, a known TLR4 ligand46,74. Interestingly, elevated HMGB1 expression is linked to various liver diseases, including hepatitis B, liver fibrosis, and liver cancer75,76,77,78. Previous research has shown that the HBV X protein could increase HMGB1 expression levels78,79. Furthermore, we find that the TBK1-IRF3 pathway is activated and essential for cancer development in the HBV plus carcinogen-treated liver. Pitavastatin inhibits the TBK1/IRF3 pathway by blocking TBK1 membrane recruitment, which is crucial to activating TBK139. Thus, the TLR3/4-TBK1-IRF3-IL-33 signaling pathway activation by HBV plus carcinogen is a mechanism that explains hepatitis and HCC risk associated with HBV infection, which can be blocked by statin to suppress hepatitis and HCC.

Although IL-33 induction in the liver can serve to combat HBV infection80, it is also elevated in other liver pathologies, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma81,82,83. In fact, IL-33 plays an important role in several liver diseases84,85,86,87, including obesity-associated HCC88. IL-33 targets innate lymphoid cell (ILC) 2 and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, which contribute to liver fibrosis by inducing the expression of IL-1385,87. Moreover, the IL-33/ST2 axis promotes the proliferation of Tregs in the murine liver89. IL-33 supports liver cancer growth by remodeling the tumor microenvironment, leading to the secretion of tumor-promoting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor86. Therefore, targeting IL-33 signaling pathways using statins has the potential to inhibit liver fibrosis and inhibit HCC development. Our epidemiological data support the use of pitavastatin as an effective therapy for hepatitis and HCC. By inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, statins not only block IL-33 induction but also disrupt viral replication by controlling the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of host cells90,91,92,93, potentially extending their therapeutic benefits to controlling HBV infection.

There are several mouse models that mimic hepatitis B virus infection, including transgenic mouse models and adenovirus-based models94,95,96. Although our hydrodynamic injection model does not involve live HBV infection and may not fully represent HBV infection in humans, it leads to the persistence of the HBV genome and its gene expression in the liver following the hydrodynamic injection. To model liver cancer development in mice, DEN injection into 14-day-old male mice has been widely used97,98. However, to specifically investigate HBV-associated liver cancer development, we established a protocol that incorporates HBV infection in young animals followed by several DEN injections to enable cancer development in adult mice. Although RNA sequencing suggested the elevation of other cytokines (e.g., IL-β and IL-4) in HBV+DEN-treated liver, we did not observe any significant elevation for these cytokines at the protein level. Interestingly, Il18 gene expression was found to be suppressed in the HBV+DEN-treated liver, which warrants future investigations to determine its impact on hepatitis and HCC development.

In conclusion, our research sheds light on the intricate interplay between HBV infection and carcinogen exposure to generate immune dysregulation in the liver that leads to cancer development. By targeting the IL-33/Treg axis with pitavastatin, we offer a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis and its cancer sequelae in HBV-infected individuals. We propose the potential of combining statin therapy with conventional HBV treatments like entecavir to improve patient outcomes39.

Massachusetts General Hospital IACUC approved the animal studies. The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC Ethics Committees approved the human sample studies.

All serum and liver biopsy samples were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Hefei, China). All patients in this study provided written informed consent for sample collection and data analysis. The healthy control liver biopsy came from the distal healthy liver tissue of surgical resection samples from patients with liver hemangioma. HBV+ is defined as HBsAg> 0.08 IU/mL. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) (2020-KYLS-124). The clinical data used in this study are anonymized and aggregated (Supplementary Data 1).

All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in an animal facility at Massachusetts General Hospital following animal care regulations. Mice were housed on a 12 light /12 dark cycle, at ~18–23 °C with 40%–60% humidity. Irf3KO mice were purchased from the Riken BioResource Research Center (Ibaraki, Japan). Il33KO mice were a gift from Dr. Marco Colonna, and ST2KO mice were a gift from Dr. Peter Nigrovic. TregST2CKO mice (Foxp3Cre RRID: IMSR_JAX: 016959; ST2flox/flox) were generated by Dr. Richard T. Lee and Dr. Diane Mathis. All mutant mice were maintained on the C57BL/6 background. WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Massachusetts General Hospital IACUC permitted a 20 mm maximal tumor diameter, and the maximal tumor size was not exceeded. Mice were euthanized under anesthesia at predetermined time points, including tumors reaching 20 mm diameter, weigh loss greater than 20% of the initial total body weight, a weigh increase of 20% due to ascitic fluid, a hunchbacked appearance, or a moribund state.

The pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmid, which contains a 1.2 fold over-length HBV genotype A genome, was kindly provided by Dr. Per-Jer Chen. 6 μg of pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmid DNA was hydrodynamically injected into the tail veins of 4-week-old male mice. An empty vector (pAAV-sham) is used as a control. Rapidly injecting a large volume of plasmid (10% body weight in 5–7 sec) results in HBV DNA transfection mostly into hepatocytes62 and provides an immunocompetent mouse model for chronic HBV infection61. HBsAg serum levels were determined by ELISA once a month after pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmid injection.

To establish an HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma model, male C57BL/6 mice received DEN (Diethylnitrosamine, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, catalog no. 73861) administration within 1 week of pAAV-HBV1.2/empty vector plasmid hydrodynamic injection. DEN was intraperitoneally administrated for eight consecutive weeks at increasing concentrations:10 mg/kg body weight for the first two weeks, 20 mg/kg body weight for the second two weeks, 40 mg/kg body weight for the third two weeks, and 60 mg/kg body weight for the last two weeks. Liver tissues were harvested at different time points following both the HBV challenge and DEN exposure.

Pitavastatin in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5 mg/mL) was made as a stock solution for the mice experiment. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 2 mg/kg pitavastatin (Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston, TX, catalog no. S1759) in 100 μL PBS or the same volume of DMSO with PBS. Pitavastatin was given once a week until harvest.

Liver tissues were meshed and lysed by 0.1% TWEEN-20 (Merck, catalog no. P1379) in PBS. Tissue lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed by incubation at 37 °C for further lysis. Lysates were sonicated for 10 seconds and centrifugated at high speed (15,000 g). After checking the protein concentration with Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, catalog no. 23225) in each sample, the identical amounts of total proteins were loaded onto Mini-PROTEIN TGXTM Gels (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, catalog no.456-1083 or 456-1086) with 1X Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (BIO-RAD, catalog no.1610732). After 40 min (according to protein size, 200 Voltage), samples were transferred to Immobilon–P membrane (Merck, catalog no. IPVH00010) with Transfer buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Ashland, MA, catalog no. BP-190). For blocking step, the membranes were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. BP1600) or 5% Skim milk (BD biosciences, San Jose, CA, catalog no. 232100) in 1X Tris-Buffered Saline (Boston Bioproducts, Milford, MA, catalog no. BM301X) containing 0.1% TWEEN, called TBS-T for 30 min. After washing with TBS-T three times, the membranes were subjected to immunoblot with proper antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following day, membranes were incubated with appropriate rabbit secondary antibody after washing. Membranes were developed with Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 32106) and signals were confirmed with BIO-RAD (BIO-RAD, catalog no. 1700140). Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Data 2.

Tissue samples were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck, catalog no. P6148) overnight at 4 °C. Next, tissues were dehydrated in PBS and 30, 50, 70% ethanol, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Five to seven μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were placed on slides, deparaffinized, and stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemistry (IHC), antigen retrieval was performed in 500 μL of antigen unmasking solution (VECTOR Laboratories, catalog no. H3300) diluted in 50 mL distilled water using a Cuisinart pressure cooker for 20 min at high pressure. Slides were washed three times for three minutes each in 1X TBS with 0.025% Triton X-100. Sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. BP1600) and 5% goat serum (Merck, catalog no. G9023) for 1 h. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody diluted in TBS containing 3% BSA (Supplementary Data 2). The next day, slides were washed as above and incubated in 100 μL biotinylated secondary antibody (VECTOR Laboratories, catalog no. PK-6200) for 30 min. Slides were subjected to a 100 μL mixture of reagents A and B from VECTASTAIN Elite ABC universal kit Peroxidase (VECTOR Laboratories, catalog no. PK-6200) for 30 min. After washing, slides were incubated with 100 μL ImmPACT DAB chromogen staining (VECTOR Laboratories, catalog no. SK-4105) for a few minutes (depending on the signal, usually less than 1–2 min). Finally, slides were dehydrated in 70, 90, 100% ethanol and xylene and mounted with a coverslip using three drops of mounting media. For immunofluorescence (IF) staining, rehydrated tissue sections were permeated with 1X PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Antigen retrieval was used similarly to IHC. Slides were washed three times for 3 min each in 1X PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. For the blocking step, slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum for 1 h. The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The next day, slides were washed as above and stained for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes. Next, slides were incubated with 1:5000 DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. D3571) with PBS for 3 min at room temperature, then washed as above. Slides were covered with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. P36930). The number of positive cells was counted in randomly selected high-power field (HPF, 200 x magnification) images in a blinded manner by a trained investigator. A pathologist reviewed clinical samples.

Total RNA was extracted from the mouse liver samples harvested at 4 months after HBV infection, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, catalog no. 74104) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, 1 μg of RNA was retrotranscribed into cDNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no.18080093) as indicated by the provider. Novogene performed and analyzed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Samples were barcoded and run on a HiSeq 2500 in 50 bp/50 bp paired-end run using HiSeq3000 SBS Kit (Illumina) for 30-40 million paired reads. The raw sequencing FASTQ files were aligned against mm10 assembly by STAR (v2.6.1b). FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) values were then computed from gene level counts by using fpkm function from the R package “DESeq2”. Original data are available in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE269528.

The normal liver and chronic hepatitis B single-cell datasets were downloaded from the GEO database. The single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of normal human liver tissues (n = 3) and chronic hepatitis B tissues (n = 13) were from GSE23424156. The single-cell RNA sequencing data of immune cells from HBV-associated immune active (IA), chronic resolved (CR), and HBV-free healthy controls (HC) were from GSE18215957. After filtering out cells with a mitochondrial gene ratio of less than 25%, Seurat (v5.1.0) was used for data analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on single-cell samples, and the top 20 principal components (PC) were selected for subsequent analysis. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was used to perform an overall dimensionality reduction analysis on the top 20 PC pairs of samples. Data visualization was conducted using the ggplot2 package (v3.5.2).

The correlation of IL33 and IL1RL1 expression with CD8+ T cell and Treg infiltration in HCC samples included in the TCGA dataset was obtained from the “GENE” module in the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) (https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) database99.

DNA was extracted from mouse tissue using KAPA Express Extract buffer, and KAPA Express Extract enzyme from Kapa Genotyping kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc, Wilmington, MA, catalog no. KK7302). After the tissue lysis step, PCR was performed using 2X KAPA2G Fast genotyping mix from the Genotyping kit and the primers that are listed in Supplementary Data 3.

Analysis was performed using de-identified data from the TriNetX Diamond Network. A search query was used to identify the cohort of patients within the network who had received pitavastatin. Eligible patients were identified based on the presence of corresponding RxNorm concept unique identifiers (RXCUI) in the patient's electronic medical records. Using International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, patients with a history of chronic hepatitis and HCC prior to statin initiation were excluded from the cohorts to reduce confounding. The control cohort for each analysis included all patients within the network who had received ezetimibe but had no recorded statin use and patients with a history of any of the diagnoses mentioned above before ezetimibe initiation were also excluded. The index event for all analyses was the initiation of pitavastatin for test cohorts and the initiation of ezetimibe for the control cohort. Cases and controls were matched using 1:1 propensity score-matching for age at index event, sex, race, and ethnicity using “greedy nearest neighbor matching” and a caliper of 0.1 pooled standard deviations. Baseline characteristics were reported by count and percentage of the total for categorical variables and mean and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables. Relative risks are presented with 95% confidence intervals. P values are uncorrected and based on Z-tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses were performed in real-time using the TriNetX platform.

HBsAg in the mouse serum was quantified with QuicktiterTM HBsAg ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, catalog no. VPK-5004) as per the supplier's instructions. HBsAg in human serum was determined by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay with anti-HBs Reagent Kit (Abbott, Chicago, IL, catalog no. K4682C). HBV DNA values were measured in human serum using quantitative real-time PCR HBV DNA assay (DA-AN Gene, China, catalog no. DA0041). To detect HBV DNA in mouse serum, we used HBV TaqMan PCR kit (NORGEN BIOTEK, Canada, Catalog no. TM29250), which measures relative HBV concentration in comparison to the positive control provided in the kit.

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was measured for mice and patients with hepatitis and other liver diseases. ALT activity was determined by Alanine Aminotransferase Activity Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, catalog no. MAK052). For the colorimetric assay, the absorbance at 570 nm was determined and proportional to the pyruvate generated as the ALT activity. ALT activity is reported as nmole/min/mL = milliunit/mL, where one milliunit (mU) of ALT is defined as the amount of enzyme that generates 1.0 nmole of pyruvate per minute at 37 °C.

Livers from mice were harvested, mashed through a 100 µm filter and centrifuged at 55 g for 1 min to remove hepatocytes. The samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g to collect cells. The pellets were resuspended in 40% isotonic Percoll (Merck, Catalog no. GE17-0891-01), a mixture of Percoll with 1X PBS and 10X PBS, and the samples were gently layered onto 70% Percoll. After centrifugation at 2000 g with very low deceleration conditions, cells were collected from the interface between the 40% and 70% Percoll layers. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, catalog no. 21870076) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 14140122) (R10 media) along with a cell activator cocktail (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, catalog no. 423301) at 37 °C. After one hour of incubation, monensin (Biolegend, catalog no. 420701) and brefeldin A (Biolegend, catalog no. 420601) were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional three hours at 37 °C. The cells were stained with the following surface marker antibodies: anti-CD45, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-ST2 and anti-CD25 antibodies (Supplementary Data 2). They were then fixed and permeabilized using the True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (Biolegend, catalog no. 424401) for staining with anti-FoxP3, anti-GATA3, anti-IL-10, and anti-TGF-β antibodies (Supplementary Data 2). The stained cells were analyzed using a LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and the data were processed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Commercial ELISA kits were used according to manufacturers' protocols. ELISA kit for the measurement of HMGB1 was purchased from Thermo Scientific (catalog no. EEL102). The mouse IL-33, IL-4, and IL-1β quantification kits were purchased from Biolegend (catalog no. 436407, 431104, 432604). The mouse IL-16 quantification kit was purchased from RayBiotech (catalog no. ELM-IL16). The human IL-33 quantification kit was purchased from MultiSciences (catalog no. 70-EK133-96).

Livers and spleens from C57BL/6 mice were harvested and meshed through a 70 µm filter, and the cells were resuspended in RBC lysis buffer for 3 min. After washing with PBS, the CD4+ T cells were isolated using MojoSort mouse CD4+ T cells isolation kits (Biolegend, catalog no. 480006). After cell counting, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 mL of R10 media containing 2 μg/mL of CD28 antibody (BioXcell, Lebanon, NH, catalog no. BE0015-1). The cells were then plated in a 12-well plate coated with 10 μg/mL of CD3 antibody (BioXcell, catalog no. BE0001-1) and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, PBS, IL-2 (20 ng/mL), or IL-2 (20 ng/mL) plus IL-33 (200 ng/mL) was added to the cells. The next day, monensin and brefeldin A were added and the samples were incubated for an additional four hours at 37 °C. Finally, the samples were stained with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for flow cytometry analysis.

A two-sided t-test for the Pearson correlation coefficient was used for the correlation between IL33 and IL1RL1 expressions and immune cell infiltration, and the correlation between serum IL-33 and HBsAg levels in patients. Statistical differences between the three groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to examine the differences in the mean ranks among all three possible pairwise comparisons. A two-sided unpaired t-test was used to test the significance of tumor area, PCNA-positive cells, leukocyte counts, protein expression levels, and other quantitative measurements. Comparisons of survival were performed with the log-rank test. The risk ratios of epidemiological data were compared using a two-tailed, two-proportion z-test. p-value < 0.05 is considered significant. Bar graphs show mean + SD. Sample sizes were not predetermined based on statistical methods but were chosen according to the standards of the field (at least three independent biological replicates for each condition).

Vice President JD Vance is on top of the world. Once a critic of President Donald Trump and now his right-hand man, Vance is everywhere—with full MAGA backing. He's on television promoting the US bombing of Iran. He's a repeat guest on Theo Von's podcast. He's reportedly been key to negotiating the tenuous détente between Elon Musk and Trump. He's even carved out time to enjoy an offseason soccer tournament match between a German and South Korean team in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

Most importantly, he's also become the highest point of contact in the administration for the Silicon Valley billionaires who helped propel Trump to a second term. The vice president has a much closer relationship with these new players in the GOP than the president does, Trumpworld sources inside and around the administration tell WIRED.

Five sources, who all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, described Vance to me as the most reliable link between the tech industry and the White House, something of a newly constructed bridge between the tech right and the populist MAGA loyalists who stood by Trump through the Capitol riot on January 6. Up-and-comers in the Republican Party have consolidated power thanks to both factions, but with Musk gone for now, Vance is the load-bearing link between the two.

To use a venture capital metaphor, though, Vance has only just progressed from his pre-seed to seed funding.

“That is the newest component to the MAGA coalition: the Silicon Valley libertarian wing,” a Trumpworld source who served in the first administration tells me. “I think they were appreciated and welcomed, but it still remains to be clear how influential they are when it comes to policy. When it comes to personnel, it seems like they've gotten a lot of their girls and guys in … but every billionaire in that room [for the inauguration], what have they gotten for it?”

For the 40-year-old Vance, his time working in venture capital and his Trump-era transformation have led him to become, as one Trumpworld source put it, the poster boy for the so-called loyal converts who may not have been on the Trump train in 2016 but have put enough money and social capital into supporting him that there's no turning back.

“Practically everyone in his cabinet is a convert,” this Trumpworld strategist tells me. “Trump loves nothing more than a convert.”

What Vance converted from, in part, is an Iraq War critic who saw Trump as such a threat that he famously once self-described as a “never-Trumper” and privately said of his future boss, in a Facebook message to a friend, “I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler.” After serving in the Marines and graduating from Yale Law School, Vance bounced around from a stint on Capitol Hill in Texas senator John Cornyn's office to a federal clerkship in Kentucky to a brief stint in corporate law before cutting his teeth in the VC field at Mithril Capital, a firm founded by billionaire Peter Thiel.

Thiel, the Palantir founder and fellow member of the so-called PayPal Mafia alongside Musk, bankrolled much of Vance's 2022 Senate run.

He is perhaps the most mysterious and most feared of Vance's billionaire allies in the Trump administration, the source who served the first time around tells me. And they're happy to see less of him compared to when he played a more publicly active and conventional role as a donor in 2016, including giving a speech at the Republican National Convention, where he notably lamented how “Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East.”

In Trumpworld, Thiel now gets credit for “putting his head down.” (“Now, does that mean he's retreated from politics,” they say, “or retreated from politics in public?”)

Thiel did not return a request for comment.

Although Vance partially established his brand in the party as a critic of “big tech”—including a wariness around data collection, a call to repeal Section 230, and even a willingness to break up some companies under antitrust law—his arrival on the ticket and subsequently in the White House brought with it a worldview and connections to a network of literal elites that have never been a comfortable fit with the populist MAGA wing, the backbone of the Trump movement for the past decade.

“The base always has a suspicion of tech, and Steve Bannon is a good symbol of that,” a Trumpworld source close to the president tells me. “There's always this high suspicion level with the tech crowd, the tech bros.”

“JD continues to hold those cards with the tech bros,” the source close to Trump tells me.

“I think he's only grown in strength, to the point where, we have an election in 2028 and I think he's the front-runner, but is there even a list of challengers right now?” the former Trump administration official adds.

Some Trumpworld sources noted that Vance's role as the ambassador for the libertarian tech right and its eccentric financiers was largely the result of a cash crunch facing the Trump campaign in the run-up to the 2024 general election.

Vance proved to be the right man at the right time, the source close to Trump tells me when recalling what they describe as a “perfect storm” of factors going in Vance's favor this time last year. “At that point, [Trump] realized you kind of had to do something else.”

Just because Silicon Valley figures supported Trump doesn't mean they have his ear directly, at least not all of the time. Larry Ellison, the billionaire executive chairman of Oracle, the expected US buyer of TikTok, has reportedly met privately with Trump several times in recent weeks. But Marc Andreessen, the billionaire investor and former software engineer who writes manifestos in his spare time, gained a reputation in Trumpworld for overplaying his relationship with Trump after he spent time at Mar-a-Lago working on vetting personnel during the transition, a senior administration source tells WIRED. Since then, Trump does not talk to Andreessen “that much,” the source told me. Andreessen, one of the tech right's top thought leaders and influences on the Silicon Valley wing of the party, exercises his influence “through the vice president, primarily,” the senior administration source says.

Andreessen did not return a request for comment.

Another source close to Trump says they have no idea whether the president and Andreessen are close but that the billionaire's chumminess with Vance is well known in Trumpworld. (Andreessen also has a connection to one of Vance's key non-Thiel former employers, Steve Case. Vance progressed in his venture capital career working for Case, the former CEO of AOL who parted ways with a then 28-year-old Andreessen in 1999 after acquiring one of his companies, Netscape, for $4.2 billion.)

Trumpworld's lack of familiarity with many of these tech and VC players has largely worked to Vance's advantage so far. What has OG Trumpworld's attention, however, are the times where Vance has shown a willingness to raise distinct objections to the president and top advisers—or even question how much Trump knows about what his own administration is doing.

What stood out from Signalgate, the former Trump administration official says, “was the dissension around JD Vance, who said ‘Why are we doing this?' He actually questioned whether Donald Trump totally understood or appreciated the situation.”

A source familiar with the vice president's thinking tells WIRED, “This was not ‘dissent.' The vice president was deliberating privately with his colleagues to ensure the president's team had properly briefed the president on the range of options available to him to ensure he was fully empowered to make the best decisions possible, as he did.”

The White House did not return a request for comment.

Vance has gotten adept at anticipating situations where he runs the risk of publicly displaying too much daylight between himself and the president, but a Monday night appearance on Fox News with Bret Baier caught the attention of the source inside the administration. The vice president said he saw a slightly altered draft of Trump's Truth Social post announcing the Israel-Iran ceasefire a few hours before but did not specify what the changes were before Trump made the announcement minutes earlier.

Baier asked Vance if “there's any mixed message” when Trump used the term “regime change” on Truth Social, and the vice president played interpreter—while also finding a way to shoehorn AI into the conversation.

“Well I think what the president is saying very clearly, Bret, is, if the Iranian people want to do something about their own leadership, that's up to the Iranian people,” Vance said, even though Trump did not at all specify that in his “regime change” post that Baier also read aloud on-air. “What the American national security interest here is very simple: it's to destroy the nuclear program, that's what we've done, and now that the 12-day war appears to be effectively over, we have an opportunity, I think, to restart a real peace process. And Bret, this is not just about two countries, Iran and Israel. All of these Gulf Arab states, they want peace, they want to invest, they want to build artificial intelligence, hardware, they want to sort of come into the new economy, and that was impossible when you had Iran, as the president said, acting like a bully across the Middle East.”

Vance creating a little wiggle room for himself every now and then, the Trumpworld source close to the president says, could be key to hanging onto the support of what they derisively referred to as “the tech bros.”

“I don't know if they're still on board with the Trump train or not,” this Republican tells me, “but they certainly have access to a lot of funds if JD eventually becomes the heir apparent in 2028.”

With the money train behind him, at least for the time being, Vance has the keys to the kingdom waiting for him.

“Right now, I think his standing is still strong among the base. We have seen, historically, very icy relationships between presidents and vice presidents,” the former Trump official says. “We have not yet seen that with Trump and Vance. But people are looking for it—they're looking under the hood.”

Former Florida congressman and short-lived Trump 2.0 attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz went semi-viral on TikTok this week when a user posted a video of him appearing to scroll through texts with his mother. The conversation, carried out from Gaetz's end in an exceedingly large font, touched on subjects ranging from President Trump's bombing of Iran to how much money is in Gaetz's bank account ($500,000, he was proud to say).

I had a brief text exchange with Gaetz in which he confirmed the authenticity of the exchange. Around 15 minutes after I texted him, he tweeted the following:

“Apparently someone sitting behind me on a flight recorded me without my knowledge.They found me texting my mother about news of the day, family finances, and working on my laptop. Please let this be a reminder to everyone to CALL YOUR MOTHER! (and maybe get a screen protector)”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","US Supreme Court Upholds Texas Porn ID Law","https://www.wired.com/story/us-supreme-court-porn-age-verification-decision-2025/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:36:00 GMT","

If you try to access Pornhub, one of the world's biggest websites, from any of 17 US states, you'll be blocked. Pornhub's parent company, Aylo Holdings, has restricted access in response to a slew of laws that says Pornhub itself should be responsible for checking that every visitor is over 18. Now, the United States Supreme Court has made a decision on a key age verification law, which could have ramifications for the entire country and the wider internet as a whole.

On Friday, in a 6–3 decision that could reshape the landscape of online privacy and free speech, the Supreme Court upheld in full the Texas age verification law—one of the first passed in the country—requiring many websites publishing pornographic content to check that all visitors are over 18. The law, TX HB1181, says sites that are “more than one-third sexual material” can face fines of up to $10,000 per day if they don't put in place age verification systems, plus extra penalties of up to $250,000. It also states websites should display health warnings about the potential health risks of pornography.

Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said that because the law ""simply requires proof of age to access content that is obscene to minors, it does not directly regulate adults' protected speech,"" adding, ""adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification.""

In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the Texas law imposes a direct and unconstitutional burden on adults' access to protected speech. “A State may not care much about safeguarding adults' access to sexually explicit speech; a State may even prefer to curtail those materials for everyone,” she wrote, “but the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult.”

The ruling marks a major victory for Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, who defended the law amid fierce opposition from digital rights groups and the adult entertainment industry.

Legislators in Texas passed HB1181 in early 2023, but it was struck down in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas for potentially being unconstitutional before the law went into effect. Adult industry group the Free Speech Coalition, among others, challenged the Texas law on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment by restricting adults' access to constitutionally protected speech. In March last year, a Fifth Circuit appeals court upheld the Texas law before the Free Speech Coalition took the case to the Supreme Court in a January hearing.

In recent years, a wave of age verification laws have been proposed in states across the country. More than half of US states have passed or have tried to pass age verification laws, according to a tracker published by the Free Speech Coalition.

“Efforts to regulate online pornography are often the opening move in broader campaigns to censor the internet,” Jess Miers, a visiting assistant professor of law at the University of Akron School of Law, said before the decision. “While this case focuses on mandatory age verification for adult content, state lawmakers are hoping it provides a legal foundation to impose sweeping restrictions on a wide range of online material.”

Attempts to get pornographic websites to implement age checks—more than just clicking a button saying you are over 18—have been accelerating over the past decade, since government officials in the UK passed laws on age verification checks only to delay and abandon them in 2019. Since then, though, a wave of companies and technologies selling age-checking software has rapidly expanded and matured. Adult websites and pornographers aren't against introducing robust age checks; they say they don't want children to be exposed to illicit content.

Multiple methods of age verification, which is often called age assurance, have been proposed or developed in recent years, with regulators and governments around the world pushing for them to be used to stop children accessing content that may not be suitable for them. These age verification methods can include, but aren't limited to, checking someone's identity against government ID, providing banking details, or using face-checking systems that can predict someone's age.

Typically, third-party companies are developing the age-checking methods, with adult websites paying to use their services. This can mean people do not directly share their ID documents or other details used to verify their age directly with pornography websites or the companies that own them. Some companies, including Pornhub owner Aylo Holdings and Meta, have argued that age checks should happen by Google and Apple on their respective app stores. Those companies don't agree.

Repeatedly, privacy and civil liberties experts have stated that any data collection or understanding of how people consume pornography could have devastating consequences if there's a data breach or information is leaked. (One ID verification company suffered a data breach last year.) Unscrupulous companies could also sell or share data, privacy advocates say.

Last week, the preliminary results of an age checking trial in Australia, which has passed laws to ban under-16s from social media apps, found such systems may not be effective. Plus, age checks can often be easily circumvented by using a VPN. Aylo has claimed that current age verification proposals aren't effective and push people to smaller websites, which may have fewer safety tools in place to moderate images and videos.

Despite potential concerns, laws mandating companies use age verification systems are being introduced around the world, and multiple companies are adopting the systems. Since 2022, Instagram has been using facial age estimation software to check people's ages. In April, chat app Discord announced it is testing face scans in the UK and Australia. Regulators in Germany have been pursuing age checks—going as far as to fine individuals posting on X (then Twitter) in 2023—for years. Last week, Pornhub returned to France—it pulled services relating to the country's age checking at the start of June—after a court ruling limited the law. And by July this year, porn sites and social media platforms operating in the UK are required to introduce “robust” age checks. Pornhub owner Aylo announced on Thursday that it would adopt ""government approved age assurance methods” to comply with the law.

With the Supreme Court's Friday decision, the threat to pornography and sexual expression in the country may be more grave. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 plan, which has been partially followed by the US government, has suggested criminalizing pornography and shutting down its producers. Earlier this year, Senator Mike Lee of Utah proposed the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act, which could redefine what's considered “obscene” content and potentially ban pornography entirely.

“Once the state has the authority to restrict access to adult content, it will almost certainly broaden the definition of ‘material harmful to minors,'” Miers says. “This could include reproductive health information, LGBTQ+ resources, and educational content related to race, gender, or diversity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Era of ‘Woke' Brand Activism Is Over","https://www.wired.com/story/the-era-of-woke-brand-activism-is-over/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In May 2019, Gillette released an ad on Facebook just in time for Pride month. It featured Samson Bonkeabantu Brown—a Black Toronto artist and trans man—learning how to shave for the first time.

“I went into my transition just wanting to be happy. I'm glad that I'm at the point where I'm able to shave,” Brown says in the video; later he's seen shaving as his dad smiles and encourages him from behind his shoulder.

“Don't be scared. Shaving is about being confident,” Brown's dad says, repeating, “You are doing fine.”

The ad went viral, receiving national news coverage, industry awards, and praise from LGBT advocates. The Ellen Show tweeted that it was “nothing short of incredible.”

Gillette was not alone in creating a buzzy ad about the LGBT community as a marketing strategy; in the past two decades, there's been a steady uptick in brands and corporations embracing Pride, a trend sometimes criticized as being superficial, or “pinkwashing.” But, as someone who has worked in marketing for over a decade, if you felt like this Pride month was a lot quieter than years previous, you're not imagining it.

Five months into Donald Trump's second presidential term, his executive orders against DEI and LGBT rights have influenced an increasing number of high profile corporate brands to abandon marketing and programming that could be considered too progressive, forcing Pride and Juneteenth celebrations around the country to scale back. At the same time, there's been an influx of brands doubling down on nationalist messages in advertising, at least some of which appear to be tied to Trump's tariffs and fixation on American-made goods.

“I've heard stories of clients wiping out … references to old work or old programs to try to erase that trail online because they're afraid of getting attacked,” says Mark, a creative director and former chief creative officer of a top New York ad agency who did not want his real name used due to potential industry backlash and repercussions. Where there used to be “a lot of activity and a lot of discussion about social justice issues,” he adds, there's now a “void of silence.”

Welcome to the Trumpian era of anti-woke capitalism. Please check your pronouns at the door.

Advertising is one of America's most popular and potent forms of cultural messaging, and signs of Trump's “anti-woke” cultural crusade are all over our TVs, on our Instagram feeds, and in our communities.

According to a poll from Gravity Research, 39 percent of corporations surveyed planned to reduce Pride Month initiatives in 2025, with none planning to increase their engagements. And World Pride, which was just held in Washington, DC, reportedly received only around 30 percent of its previously projected 3 million visitors.

Mastercard, which famously launched a monthlong omnichannel Pride campaign called “Your True Self Is Priceless” in 2022 and, only a few years before, that developed the widely lauded “True Name” initiative that championed the identities of transgender Americans, has failed to debut any Pride messaging so far this year. Instead, it quietly withdrew as a top-level sponsor of this year's New York City Pride, along with PepsiCo, Nissan, Citi, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target, after receiving conservative backlash for its collections of Pride merchandise in years prior, released a scaled-back, beige-heavy line this year, which has been mocked relentlessly on TikTok.

“Mastercard is a long-standing supporter of the many communities our employees are part of, including the LGBTQIA+ community,” said Will O'Connor, Mastercard's senior vice president of communications for North America, in a statement. “This year, we continue that commitment by proudly participating in the NYC Pride March and related events with a strong employee-led presence and a community engagement program designed to uplift and celebrate our workforce.”

In a statement to WIRED, a Citi spokesperson said, “Our Citi Pride Inclusion Network is excited about sponsoring a range of Pride Month celebrations and participating in local marches around the globe, including in New York City where we will march in partnership with SAGE, one of our not-for-profit partner organizations.” Similarly, a Nissan spokesperson said the company remains “committed to promoting an inclusive culture for employees, consumers, dealers and other key stakeholders.” PepsiCo and PricewaterhouseCoopers did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

Granted, corporations' commitment to LGBT rights, even at the peak of their Pride participation, has long been criticized by some as hypocritical, particularly when it comes to police marching in uniform and companies that profit off war; anger over the corporatization of Pride has sparked protests in multiple North American cities over the years. With the shift away from social justice messaging, “it becomes pretty obvious that a lot of these things that brands, agencies, companies do are performative,” Mark says.

But it's not just Pride. For the first time since 2021, the Super Bowl, which Trump attended, did not stencil its “End Racism” slogan onto the field in support of racial justice. Denver's Juneteenth Music Festival lost support from more than a dozen companies, causing the event to scale back from two days to one, an event organizer told the Associated Press.

According to David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, many brands and advertisers appear to have capitulated to Trump's sweeping anti-woke mandates out of fear of being viewed as anti-American.

“We're seeing, more from Mr. Trump, if you're not on board with [him], then you're against America. I think that's part of what he's communicating as American values,” says Reibstein.

Ever since Trump signed a series of executive orders in February calling for the elimination of DEI initiatives across both the federal government and private companies, corporate brands and advertisers have been faced with a tough ethical dilemma: Go MAGA or go moral and risk either conservative boycotts or political retribution.

Mark says brands have grown increasingly terrified to stand behind their once-progressive messaging. “I saw an immediate shift in clients who wanted to not publicize work that they had done for different communities who are underrepresented and … specifically about the trans and LGBTQIA+ community,” he tells WIRED.

Some industry experts suggest the DEI panic from corporations predates Trump's second presidential win and began with the extreme right-wing backlash over Bud Light's 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. According to Matt Skallerud, president of LGBTQ+ marketing agency Pink Media, the Bud Light boycott—which reportedly cost the multinational beer company ​​Anheuser-Busch an estimated $1.4 billion in organic revenue—signaled the beginning of the end of corporate DEI policies in the United States. He says business for firms like his has been much quieter the past two years.

“With this kind of war on DEI, it's now a ghost town,” he says. “A lot of companies [since then] have just decided to wait this out and just see where it's all gonna go … but sadly, like, four years from now,” says Skallerud.

Trump's expansive far-right agenda has also made an indelible impact on Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon, Paramount Global, and Disney have all reportedly walked back their DEI policies following pressure from the Federal Trade Commission, Variety reported. This comes as TV ad spots and social media campaigns are increasingly emulating Trump's vision of a conservative American cultural ideal.

A few weeks ago, Stellantis (parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram) launched its “America Made Us” campaign in honor of America250, the nonpartisan year-long celebration leading up to next year's 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The spot features a gritty manifesto about the nature of the American spirit—one rooted in freedom, revolution, and football—and a call to action for consumers to “remember everything this country still stands for.” Ford recently released its ultra nationalist “For America, From America” campaign, touting its record on creating domestic jobs. Another Ford ad, called “If They Were Like Us,” calls out other car companies with statements like, “if they were like us, they would have said no to the taxpayer bailout and added thousands of American jobs”—seemingly a reference to the 2008 financial crisis.

Similarly, the Secret Service debuted a first-of-its-kind promo video at the Super Bowl called “A History of Protection” featuring footage of key milestones in American history which include JFK's inaugural's address, Ronald Reagan's “Tear Down This Wall” speech, and the 2024 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. Directed by Michael Bay, the spot concludes with a wide-angle shot of eight men walking dramatically toward the camera in front of Air Force One. The closing shot is notably absent of any female Secret Service agents, who along with DEI policies were blamed by many on the right for failing to adequately protect Trump from serious threats. As WIRED previously reported, the Department of Homeland Security has spent more than $500,000 on YouTube ads encouraging undocumented migrants to “self-deport.”

Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, a brand with a history of diverse TV ads celebrating political counterculture, recently awarded Trump with an inaugural Presidential Commemorative Diet Coke.

Trump's anti-DEI mandates may have stymied corporate America's flimsy commitment to social justice, but his war against woke culture is particularly prominent on social media platforms.

Mark Zuckerberg's and Elon Musk's highly publicized presence at Trump's presidential inauguration marked the first time social media companies like Meta and X pandered publicly to an incoming president. Musk reportedly spent a whopping $288 million to Trump's reelection campaign, while Zuckerberg donated $1 million to seemingly curry Trump's favor. Facebook has abandoned fact checkers because they're “too politically biased,” Zuckerberg has said, while X has become a force-fed stream of alt-right content, hate speech, and Trump merchandise. Several major corporations, including Comcast, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Lionsgate Entertainment have resumed spending their ad dollars on X after leaving in 2023 due to antisemitic content on the platform, Adweek reported.

But a number of big brands are publicly bucking Trump's fervent MAGA takeover of corporate America. Chief among them is Costco, perhaps the most famous example of a mega-retailer refusing to roll back its DEI initiatives, even in the face of massive political pressure.

Earlier this month, Walmart heiress Christy Walton was lauded by progressives for taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times to promote the anti-Trump “No King's Day” protests nationwide. Walmart had faced public and investor scrutiny for its flip-flopping position on DEI but recently announced its shareholders had voted down anti-DEI proposals with a 99 percent majority vote.

Vermont-based Ben and Jerry's has famously called out corporate America for reneging on DEI, has protested the genocide in Gaza, and has spoken out about the climate crisis, joining other brands like ELF Cosmetics, Delta Airlines, Cisco, Levi's, Apple, Salesforce, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs in defying Trump's sweeping anti-woke attacks.

Reibstein says the onus is also on consumers to support brands “willing to take a stand.”

“It makes it incumbent on customers to sort of follow not just their product needs, but also their political needs,” he says. “For example, Costco [being] willing to take a stance, that has made me feel better.”

A call-to-action he coauthored after the November election argues that advertising agencies and marketers can heal our fractured political landscape through unifying messages and “constructive dialogue over inflammatory content.”

If we don't, Reibstein tells WIRED, “it's going to narrow our creativity and narrow our perspective because we can't look at things from various angles.”

So far, it looks like Trump's anti-woke measures are limiting the industry from thinking expansively enough to subvert the right-wing new world order currently emerging. But the MAGA threat facing advertising isn't just aesthetic, or even creative—it's existential.

Brands, whether we like them or not, help shape public consciousness by transmitting cultural attitudes and political tastes. Which is why brand CEOs, agency executives, and creative decision makers of all levels must start getting comfortable placing moral imperative over political deference; progressive ideals over short-term gain. Or the American imagination won't just turn MAGA. It will cease to exist at all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","I'm a Certified Sleep Expert. Let Me Crack the Code on Mattress Terms","https://www.wired.com/story/mattress-shopping-terms-to-know/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:43:00 GMT","

Shopping for a mattress online is a lot of work—enough to make you need some rest. Picking the right bed, like the right bet itself, is better if you have enough support. To help you with the arduous process of selection, we've come up with guides that explain the need-to-know about mattress shopping. This includes the varying mattress types, how to select a mattress, and our thoroughly tested guide to the best mattresses you can buy online.

Today, it's time to break down some of the terminology you'll inevitably come across during your research. These words are signposts that point to how a mattress was made, tested, and, subsequently, how it performs. You don't have to be a Spencer Institute sleep science coach to understand these terms—but, lucky for you, I am a Spencer Institute sleep science coach.

Pressure relief is a crucial aspect for certain sleeping positions, like side sleepers, and those who need to show their joints some love. The term refers to a mattress reacting to a person's weight as it contacts the bed, and how well it's able to counteract the pressure from putting your weight on more tender areas of the body. For side sleepers, a bed that is too firm means your hips and shoulders will be crying out for help because of the tension. Materials like latex and memory foam are known for their pressure-relieving capabilities. Memory foam, in particular, is very adaptive and “hugs” the body, which many side sleepers like.

Motion isolation is a term used to describe how well a mattress manages to not transfer movement or shaking across the bed, usually from one person to another. When movement does end up disrupting the stability of the bed, this is known as motion transfer. If you wake up easily or share your sleep space with a partner, pet, or child, motion isolation is typically unwelcome. Memory foam's density is usually right on par with absorbing this feeling, and coils have evolved to include fabric pockets (this is what the term “pocketed coils” means). The idea is that when each coil is contained in its own zone, motion has a harder time moving across the bed as opposed to traditional coils, where everything was woven together. Pro tip: Make sure you have a stable frame, as that's half the battle here, too, and is often overlooked.

Spine alignment, otherwise known as lumbar support, is an evaluation of how well the spine is kept in alignment. When you're standing up straight, you'll notice that your lower back slightly curves. This is aptly called the “S” curve, because healthy alignment of the upper and lower spinal cord does somewhat resemble this letter. But your posture isn't just a concern while upright, as a lack of spine alignment support while sleeping isn't healthy in the long term. Each sleeping position brings about its own set of concerns, as even the smallest degree of sinking in this area can cause misalignment. Stomach sleepers need a firmer surface to keep this area uplifted, as something too soft causes the lower back to sink in. Side sleepers have to keep the hips and shoulders on the same level, and the lower back can't be sinking into too much of a “U” shape. The alignment of your neck is key, as anybody with back pain will tell you. This is where many mattress makers have stepped up with their designs, putting firmer support in the center of the bed by way of extra memory foam layers or reinforced coils.

Edge support is important for a couple of reasons. If you're someone who gets banished to the edge of the bed while sleeping due to a pet or partner making themselves comfy, you need edge support. Sit on the bottom while getting dressed? You need edge support. Engaged in adult extracurricular activities and don't want to feel like you're falling off the mattress? Edge support. Mattress models, especially hybrids, will usually strategically put reinforced coils around the outer edges to make sure weight is supported. This also helps with durability as time goes on, preventing the edges from sagging. Materials like memory foam can be hit-or-miss for edge support, especially depending on the firmness level involved. Too soft, and you may be encroaching on feeling some sagging in any one of the aforementioned situations.

Cooling is going to be something to keep in mind for sleepers who overheat easily. There are many cooling mattresses out there, and measuring how well a mattress can regulate surface temperature is valuable information. Some beds involve natural and organic materials that may not feel cool to the touch, but are able to dispel heat relatively quickly. Others will involve a lot of proprietary cooling tech, which gives off a visceral feeling of coolness. Keep in mind that factors such as the surrounding bedroom temperature, what you wear to bed, what sheets and accessories you use, and ultimately the mattress materials involved will all play a part in the overall mattress's temperature control.

Responsiveness is how well a bed “responds” to the sleeper moving around on top of it. If the bed is softer and sleepers sink in more, they may have a harder time getting in and out of bed or switching between sleeping positions. On the other hand, a highly responsive bed is snappy, feeling as if it is moving alongside you so that you're always receiving support.

Off-gassing is the mattress equivalent of a new car smell, but mattress edition. If you notice a chemical smell radiating from your mattress once unboxed or unpackaged, the materials within the bed are airing out as they inflate. Certifications like CertiPUR-US are crucial here, because it's third-party assurance that the air you're breathing in isn't tainted by anything potentially hazardous. A mattress should be good to go within a day or two of unboxing it.

Don't be daunted by official terms and names in the mattress world—they're actually pretty straightforward. Use this list to decipher what each mattress is being described as, and you'll be good to go.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have succeeded in transforming certain plastic waste into acetaminophen using the natural properties of the common bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). This breakthrough represents a milestone with the potential to drive more sustainable methods of drug production and, at the same time, contribute to the reduction of plastic pollution globally.

The study, led by Stephen Wallace, revealed that E. coli cells contain phosphate, an organic compound capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction known as Lossen rearrangement. In general terms, this process involves the rearrangement of the atoms of a hydroxamate ester molecule to form a new structure called isocyanate, a chemical intermediate that, when reacted with water, produces primary amines. These substances are essential in numerous biological processes and in drug synthesis.

Using synthetic biology, the scientists manipulated the bacteria to redirect their internal chemistry and transform a PET-derived molecule known as terephthalic acid into the active ingredient in acetaminophen. They used a fermentation process, similar to that used in brewing beer, to accelerate the conversion of industrial PET waste into the drug, obtaining results in less than 24 hours. According to the findings, approximately 90 percent of the final product corresponded to acetaminophen.

Importantly, this conversion was done at room temperature and with virtually no carbon emissions, suggesting that the drug can be produced in a more environmentally friendly way.

Wallace noted that what was most surprising about the process was that the Lossen rearrangement occurred naturally within living bacteria, without the need for laboratory catalysts. That is, they took advantage of the microbial cells' own capabilities to trigger the desired reaction.

“The funny thing is that we didn't have to teach the bacteria how to do the reaction: The trick was to realize that they already had the tools, and we just had to guide them,” explained the researcher in statements reported by El País. “We used synthetic biology to build new metabolic pathways within the bacteria that guide their chemistry toward producing the compound we wanted. In this case, a drug.”

The work, published in the journal Nature, could be the first documented case of acetaminophen production from plastic waste using E. coli. However, the authors stress that further studies will be necessary to achieve industrial-scale production. In addition, they caution that the safety and efficacy of the resulting drug in humans have yet to be evaluated, so future research will be required.

Despite these limitations, the scientists emphasize that their results open up new possibilities for addressing the problem of plastic waste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with drug manufacturing.

Currently, the production of drugs such as acetaminophen consumes thousands of tons of fossil fuels, especially petroleum, which contributes significantly to climate change. In turn, PET generates more than 350 million tons of waste per year, causing serious damage to the environment. Although this material is recyclable, current methods often result in products that perpetuate global plastic pollution.

“This work demonstrates that PET plastic is not just a waste product or a material destined to become more plastic: Microorganisms can transform it into valuable new products, including those with therapeutic potential,” concluded Wallace.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","No One Is in Charge at the US Copyright Office","https://www.wired.com/story/us-copyright-office-chaos-doge/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:20:00 GMT","

It's a tumultuous time for copyright in the United States, with dozens of potentially economy-shaking AI copyright lawsuits winding through the courts. It's also the most turbulent moment in the US Copyright Office's history. Described as “sleepy” in the past, the Copyright Office has taken on new prominence during the AI boom, issuing key rulings about AI and copyright. It also hasn't had a leader in more than a month.

In May, Copyright Register Shira Perlmutter was abruptly fired by email by the White House's deputy director of personnel. Perlmutter is now suing the Trump administration, alleging that her firing was invalid; the government maintains that the executive branch has the authority to dismiss her. Despite the firing, Perlmutter still characterizes herself as the Copyright Register. “Despite Mr. Perkins's claim that he is Acting Register of Copyrights, I remain Register of Copyrights and therefore am required by law to fulfill my above-described statutory obligations,” she said in a declaration in May. But much of her lawsuit centers on how she's been rendered unable to effectively perform the duties of the office.

As the legality of the ouster is debated, the reality within the office is this: There's effectively nobody in charge. And without a leader actually showing up at work, the Copyright Office is not totally business-as-usual; in fact, there's debate over whether the copyright certificates it's issuing could be challenged.

The firing followed a pattern. The USCO is part of the Library of Congress; Perlmutter had been appointed to her role by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. A few days before Perlmutter's dismissal, Hayden, who had been in her role since 2016, was also fired by the White House via email. The White House appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who had previously served as President Trump's defense attorney, as the new acting Librarian of Congress.

Two days after Pelmutter's firing, Justice Department official Paul Perkins showed up at the Copyright Office, along with his colleague Brian Nieves. According to an affidavit from Perlmutter, they were carrying “printed versions of emails” from Blanche indicating that they had been appointed to new roles within the Copyright Office. Perkins, the email said, was designated as Acting Register of Copyrights. In other words, he was Perlmutter's replacement.

But was Blanche actually the acting Librarian, and thus able to appoint Perkins as such? Within the Library of Congress, someone else had already assumed the role—Robert Newlen, Hayden's former second-in-command, who has worked at the LOC since the 1970s. Following Hayden's ouster, Newlen emailed LOC staff asserting that he was the acting Librarian—never mentioning Blanche—and noting that “Congress is engaged with the White House” on how to proceed.

In her lawsuit, Perlmutter argues that only the Librarian of Congress can fire and appoint a new Register. In a filing on Tuesday, defendants argued that the president does indeed have the authority to fire and appoint the Librarian of Congress and that his appointees then have the ability to choose a new Copyright Register.

Neither the Department of Justice nor the White House responded to requests for comment on this issue; the Library of Congress declined to comment.

Perkins and Nieves did not enter the USCO office or assume the roles they purported to fill the day they showed up. And since they left, sources within the Library of Congress tell WIRED, they have never returned, nor have they assumed any of the duties associated with the roles. These sources say that Congress is in talks with the White House to reach an agreement over these personnel disputes.

A congressional aide familiar with the situation told WIRED that Blanche, Perkins, and Nieves had not shown up for work “because they don't have jobs to show up to.” The aide continued: “As we've always maintained, the President has no authority to appoint them. Robert Newlen has always been the Acting Librarian of Congress.”

If talks are happening, they remain out of public view. But Perlmutter does have some members of Congress openly on her side. “The president has no authority to remove the Register of Copyrights. That power lies solely with the Librarian of Congress. I'm relieved that the situation at the Library and Copyright Office has stabilized following the administration's unconstitutional attempt to seize control for the executive branch. I look forward to quickly resolving this matter in a bipartisan way,” Senator Alex Padilla tells WIRED in a statement.

In the meantime, the Copyright Office is in the odd position of attempting to carry on as though it wasn't missing its head. Immediately after Perlmutter's dismissal, the Copyright Office paused issuing registration certificates “out of an abundance of caution,” according to USCO spokesperson Lisa Berardi Marflak, who says the pause impacted around 20,000 registrations. It resumed activities on May 29 but is now sending out registration certificates with a blank spot where Perlmutter's signature would ordinarily be.

This unusual change has prompted discussion amongst copyright experts as to whether the registrations are now more vulnerable to legal challenges. The Copyright Office maintains that they are valid: “There is no requirement that the Register's signature must appear on registration certificates,” says Berardi Marflak.

In a motion related to Perlmutter's lawsuit, though, she alleges that sending out the registrations without a signature opens them up to “challenges in litigation,” something outside copyright experts have also pointed out. “It's true the law doesn't explicitly require a signature,” IP lawyer Rachael Dickson says. “However, the law really explicitly says that it's the Register of Copyright determining whether the material submitted for the application is copyrightable subject matter.”

Without anyone acting as Register, Dickson thinks it would be reasonable to argue that the statutory requirements are not being met. “If you take them completely out of the equation, you have a really big problem,” she says. “Litigators who are trying to challenge a copyright registration's validity will jump on this.”

Perlmutter's lawyers have argued that leaving the Copyright Office without an active boss will cause dysfunction beyond the registration certificate issue, as the Register performs a variety of tasks, from advising Congress on copyright to recertifying organizations like the Mechanical Licensing Collective, the nonprofit in charge of administering royalties for streaming and download music in the United States. Since the MLC's certification is up right now, Perlmutter would ordinarily be moving forward with recertifying the organization; as her lawsuit notes, right now, the recertification process is not moving forward.

The MLC may not be as impacted by Perlmutter's absence as the complaint suggests. A source close to the MLC told WIRED that the organization does indeed need to be recertified but that the law doesn't require the recertification process to be completed within a specific time frame, so it will be able to continue operating as usual.

Still, there are other ways that the lack of a boss is a clear liability. The Copyright Claims Board, a three-person tribunal that resolves some copyright disputes, needs to replace one of its members this year, as a current board member, who did not reply to a request for comment, is leaving. The job posting is already live and says applications are being reviewed, but as the position is supposed to be appointed by the Librarian of Congress with the guidance of the Copyright Register, it's unclear how exactly it will be filled. A source familiar at the Library of Congress tells WIRED that Newlen could make the appointment if necessary, but they “expect there to be some kind of greater resolution by then.”

As they wait for the resolution, it remains an especially inopportune time for a headless Copyright Office. Perlmutter was fired just days after the office released a hotly contested report on generative AI training and fair use. That report has already been heavily cited in a new class action lawsuit against AI tools Suno and Udio, even though it was technically a “prepublication” version and not finalized. But everyone looking to see what a final report will say—or what guidance the office will issue next—can only keep waiting.

Alongside bolstering its AI research talent pool, Meta seems to be keen to flesh out its consumer-facing AI features. The company is in discussions to acquire a voice cloning startup called Play AI, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

The tech giant aims to buy the startup's tech and bring on board some of its staff, the report said. 

Play AI lets anyone clone different kinds of voices that they can use for AI-powered use cases, such as customer service, per its website. The startup has raised $23.5 million in total, and its investors include 500 Startups, Kindred Ventures, Race Capital, 500 Global and Soma Capital, per Crunchbase.

Meta currently lets creators on its social platforms build their own chatbots, and has added video editing capabilities to its Meta AI chatbot. Acquiring a voice startup would let the company bake in audio features into its creative suite. 

Meta declined to comment on the story. Play AI did not immediately return a request for comment.

Crossing Minds, a startup that provides AI recommendation systems to e-commerce businesses, said on Thursday that its team is joining OpenAI.

The startup was backed by Index Ventures, Shopify, Plug and Play, and Radical Ventures, and had raised more than $13.5 million across multiple rounds, according to Crunchbase. 

Crossing Minds largely worked with e-commerce companies to improve their personalization and recommendation systems. The company claims it studies customers' on-site behavior data to gather insights on their shopping preferences without compromising privacy.

“Joining OpenAI allows us to bring our work — and our values — into a mission we deeply respect: to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. We're thrilled to bring our experience and energy to a team that's setting the direction for the future of AI. We're excited to learn, to contribute, and to help shape what's next,” the startup's co-founders wrote in a post on its website.

Alexandre Robicquet, one of the co-founders, has updated his bio on LinkedIn, which now reads “Research, Post-training and Agents at OpenAI.” It is not clear if all of Crossing Minds' team is joining OpenAI.

Crossing Minds' website also says that the company won't take up any more clients. Per its archived “About” page, Crossing Mind previously said it was trusted by Intuit, Anthropic, Udacity and Chanel.

AI companies have built a plethora of tools to help customers shop. Google and Perplexity have launched AI features to improve recommendations, while startups like Daydream have received massive investments to launch AI shopping assistants.

Earlier this year, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to provide recommendations, images, and reviews for items its users ask questions about.

OpenAI didn't immediately return a request for comment.

The Danish government is working to change copyright law to give its citizens the right to their own body, facial features, and voice. The landmark law is designed to strengthen protections against the creation and dissemination of deepfakes, reports The Guardian.

Denmark's department of culture still needs to submit a proposal to amend current law, but the agency has already secured cross-party support. 

“In the bill we agree and are sending an unequivocal message that everybody has the right to their own body, their own voice and their own facial features, which is apparently not how the current law is protecting people against generative AI,” Jakob Engel-Schmidt, Danish culture minister, told The Guardian. 

In the U.S., several states have passed deepfake laws, which are mainly tied to misuse during elections and nonconsensual sexually explicit content. Many of those laws are currently at risk as Congress weighs up a proposal in a new budget reconciliation bill that would strip states of their power to regulate AI for 10 years.

A German data protection official has reported Chinese AI app DeepSeek to Apple and Google, saying the app transfers users' information to China illegally.

Meike Kamp, Berlin's Commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told the companies that DeepSeek did not provide “convincing evidence” that users' data was protected as required by EU laws.

“Chinese authorities have far-reaching access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies,” Kamp said, adding that the two tech firms must now review the report and decide whether to remove the app.

Kamp said that her office had asked DeepSeek to comply with EU laws for transferring data outside the bloc or pull its app from the country, but the Chinese company did not do so.

Italy earlier this year banned DeepSeek from app stores in the country, citing similar data protection concerns.

Notably, two key details about DeepSeek that consumer privacy advocate groups in the EU highlighted are that the service is made in and operates out of China. Per its privacy policy, this includes the information and data that DeepSeek collects and stores, which is also housed in its home country.

Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This story was corrected to clarify that Berlin's data protection commissioner reported DeepSeek to the companies.

Tucked between two massive buildings in the hills of the Nevada desert, 805 retired EV batteries lie in neat formation, each one wrapped in nondescript white tarps — and hiding in plain sight. 

A passerby might not realize this unassuming array is the largest microgrid in North America, that it's powering a 2,000 GPU modular data center for AI infrastructure company Crusoe, or that it represents the next big act of JB Straubel, the co-founder and CEO of Redwood Materials. 

Redwood Materials announced Thursday during an event at its Sparks, Nevada facility that it was launching an energy storage business that will leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery recycling business to provide power to companies. And they're starting with AI data centers.

The new business, called Redwood Energy, is kicking off with partner Crusoe, a startup Straubel invested in 2021. The old EVs, which are not yet ready for recycling, store energy generated from an adjacent solar array. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project. 

The scale of Redwood's battery collection operation is staggering — and an opportunity. Redwood said it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America. Today, it processes more than 20 GWh of batteries annually — the equivalent of 250,000 EVs. 

It has apparently been stockpiling batteries that aren't ready for recycling, with more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory already. In the coming months, it expects to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours.

By 2028, the company said it plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage, placing it on track to become the largest repurposer of used EV battery packs. 

Straubel's confidence in the endeavor was apparent in every detail of the launch event. To illustrate the commitment of Redwood — and by extension, Straubel — everything at the event from the music and projection on the big screen to a laser light show that included giant Pac-Man ghosts navigating the rows of EV batteries were powered by the microgrid.

“We wanted to go all in,” Straubel said, breaking into a wide, toothy smile. Splashy effects for the event aside, the microgrid setup with Crusoe is not a demonstration project. Straubel said this is a revenue-generating operation, which was constructed in four months, and one that is profitable. He added that even more of these will be deployed with other customers this year.

“I think this has the potential to grow faster than the core recycling business,” he said.Redwood Materials has been on an expansion tear in recent years. The company, which has raised $2 billion in private funds, was founded in 2017 by Straubel, the former Tesla CTO and current board member, to create a circular supply chain.

The company started by recycling scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. After processing these discarded goods and extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, Redwood supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. Over time, the company has expanded beyond recycling and into cathode production. Redwood generated $200 million in revenue in 2024, much of which comes from the sale of battery materials like cathodes.

The company's footprint has grown too, and well beyond its Carson City, Nevada headquarters. It has locked up deals with Toyota, Panasonic, and GM, started construction on a South Carolina factory, and made an acquisition in Europe.

Redwood Energy is the next step — and one that isn't tied to setting up its systems to be off-grid. The retired EV batteries can be powered by wind and solar, or they can be tied to the grid. In the case of the Crusoe project, the system is powered by solar.

“There's no green intent required here,” CTO Colin Campbell said during a tour of the microgrid. “It's a good economic choice that also happens to be carbon-free.”

The business model addresses a longstanding challenge in the energy storage sector. For over a decade, companies have been promising to build grid-scale storage from used EV batteries, but they've only materialized in small amounts. Redwood, which got its start as a battery materials and recycling company, is creating a new line that promises to deliver gigawatts of much needed energy storage in just a few years.

“This really demonstrates how economical the waste hierarchy actually is,” Jessica Dunn, a battery expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told TechCrunch. That a large recycler like Redwood recognized the profit potential in repurposed EV batteries shows “where this end-of-life market will go,” she added.

Repurposing batteries is a clear business opportunity for Redwood, but it might also be a business imperative. Redwood was founded to build a supply chain that could handle the predicted wave of used EV batteries that will hit the market. But that wave hasn't materialized quite as quickly as some predicted.

“If Redwood didn't enter the repurposing market, then they wouldn't get a share from the repurposed battery. They'd have to wait the five, 10, 15 years until they retired,” she said. In the meantime, other companies would be able to sell the batteries for grid-scale storage, cutting Redwood out of years of revenue.

Straubel acknowledged this, noting in an interview that in many ways Redwood Materials started a bit early. 

“We started really early, and in a way we started Redwood almost too early,” he said, noting the company initially was collecting consumer batteries and production scrap ahead of the coming wave of EVs.

The current state of the recycling market underscores the challenge. “Right now, the recycling market is mostly manufacturing scrap, consumer electronics, and EV batteries that have failed under warranty,” Dunn said. That has been enough for Redwood to process over 20 gigawatt-hours annually. But it pales in comparison to the 350 gigawatt-hours in EVs today and the 150 gigawatt-hours expected to hit the road every year.

Redwood currently has a recycling facility at its 175-acre campus in Sparks, Nevada, and it's developing a 600-acre facility in Charleston, South Carolina. The latter will remanufacture cathode and anode copper foil, both of which contain critical minerals that the U.S. would prefer stayed within its borders.

The company previously said that it will be capable of making 100 gigawatt-hours annually of cathode active material and anode foil by the end of this year. By the end of the decade, it expects production to hit 500 gigawatt-hours.

Henrik Werdelin has spent the last 15 years helping entrepreneurs build big brands like Barkbox through his startup studio Prehype. Now, with his new, New York-based venture Audos, he's betting that AI can help him scale that process from “tens” of startups a year to “hundreds of thousands” of aspiring business owners.

The timing certainly feels right. Mass layoffs across a variety of industries have left many workers reconsidering their career paths, while AI tools have markedly lowered the barrier to building digital products and services. At the center of that Venn diagram is Werdelin's latest venture, with its promise to help “everyday entrepreneurs create million dollar AI companies” without requiring technical skills.

Werdelin's journey from Prehype to Audos reflects the broader transformation happening in entrepreneurship right now. At Prehype, the focus was on working with tech founders to build traditional startups, the kind that might raise millions and aim for billion-dollar exits.

Now, he tells TechCrunch, “What we're trying to do is take all that knowledge, all the methodology that we've created over the years of building all these big companies, and really trying to democratize it.”

The idea is that “everyday entrepreneurs” may sense a shift is afoot but may not be keen to experiment with so-called AI agents or know how to reach customers. Audos is more than happy to help them, supplying these individuals with AI tools to build sophisticated products using natural language, and taking advantage of social media algorithms to find them their niche customers.

“Facebook and a lot of these platforms, they are just incredible algorithms, and they're incredible at figuring out [how to reach your customer] if you define a customer group,” says Werdelin, who co-founded Audos with his Prehype partner Nicholas Thorne. In fact, Audos uses this system to quickly test whether a founder's business idea has sustainable customer acquisition costs.

The approach seems to be working. Audos has helped launch “low hundreds” of businesses since its beta launch, with its own customers discovering the platform through Instagram ads asking “Have you ever thought about starting something, but don't know where to go?” Among them, Werdelin says, are a car mechanic who wants to help people evaluate repair quotes, an individual who is selling “after death logistics” services, virtual golf swing coaches, and AI nutritionists. In a winking reference to billion-dollar businesses, or so-called unicorns, he calls these one- and two-person teams “donkeycorns.”

All went through the same process: they clicked on Audos's ad, its AI agent launched a conversation to figure out the problems these individuals want to tackle and who they want to serve, and, when it was satisfied with the answers, Audos got them in front of potential customers as fast as possible.

As for returns, Audos operates on a fundamentally different model than traditional accelerators or venture capital. Instead of taking equity, the company takes a 15% revenue share from the businesses it helps launch. In return, founders get up to $25,000 in funding, access to those AI-powered business development tools, and help with distribution (again, primarily through paid social media advertising).

“We're not taking any equity in their business,” Werdelin says. There isn't much point. “We don't think these companies might ever get sold,” he says. “What we're really inspired by are the mom-and-pop shops that are the backbone of our society.”

The revenue share continues indefinitely, similar to platform fees charged by Apple's App Store. For founders, that means giving up a significant portion of their revenue in perpetuity — a 15% cut that could cost entrepreneurs hundreds of thousands of dollars over time. Some will undoubtedly see that trade-off as worthwhile; others might question whether the long-term costs justify the benefits.

Audos's value proposition raises other questions, too, given how quickly the landscape is changing. While Werdelin emphasizes helping founders build relationships with customers, it's unclear how much of that work the AI agents can actually handle. There's also the matter of differentiation. As Werdelin readily acknowledges, “the world is full of these tools” and they're getting better rapidly. What happens when entrepreneurs can access similar AI capabilities without paying a permanent revenue tax?

Audos's VCs don't sound worried about those scenarios. True Ventures led Audos's $11.5 million seed round, with partner Tony Conrad explaining the appeal in a Zoom call this week. In addition to having confidence in Werdelin and Thorne, says Conrad, “I think there are just lots and lots of people” who might eagerly embrace the opportunity to work with a platform like Audos.

Conrad draws parallels to Instagram's $1 billion exit with just 13 employees, suggesting that AI could enable even more leverage, even if Audos — which itself employs just five people altogether currently —  isn't chasing unicorns. As Werdelin explains it, “What we're after here is the millions of people who can create million-dollar businesses or half-million dollar businesses that are real and life changing.” 

Adds Werdelin separately of why he spun up Audos, “What we're trying to do is to figure out how you make a million companies that do a million dollars [in annual revenue]. That's a trillion dollar turnover business.”

Midway through 2025, it doesn't sound crazy. Extending the benefits of entrepreneurship to people who traditionally haven't had access to startup capital or technical skills is an increasingly compelling proposition as traditional employment begins to feel less and less stable. 

“We believe that there should be somebody who goes out and really helps these smaller entrepreneurs that are building something that is not venture backable,” says Werdelin. “We believe that the world is better with more entrepreneurship.”

Audos's other investors include Offline Venture and Bungalow Capital, along with numerous high-profile angel investors – Niklas Zennstrom and Mario Schlosser among them.

Redwood Materials plans to repurpose EV batteries to build renewable-powered microgrids.

In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.

Redwood Materials, one of the US's largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26. 

The event marked the launch of the company's new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.

Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity. 

“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood's founder and chief executive, said at the event. 

This first microgrid, housed at the company's facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation's largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries. 

(That's tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to Forbes.)

Redwood's project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn't be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers. Since Redwood's batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.

Redwood Energy's microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they're an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.

“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.

The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as MIT Technology Review recently reported.

Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it “would be logical targets” for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia, and the Midwest as well.

“We're talking to a broad cross section of those companies,” he says.

Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.

Redwood's microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe's local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.

Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)

Redwood's new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.

The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.

If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found. 

“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood's new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions. 

Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.

The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they'll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company's recycling process. 

Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour's worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company's new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.

Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company's core recycling operation someday.

“We're confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says. 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

The AI race is transforming northwestern Nevada into one of the world's largest data-center markets—and sparking fears of water strains in the nation's driest state.

Renewable energy is changing the grid. How can we keep it reliable?

GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health—but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.

Weight-loss drugs are this decade's blockbuster medicines. Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they're fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.

They became so hugely popular so quickly that not long after their approval for weight loss, we saw global shortages of the drugs. Prescriptions have soared over the last five years, but even people who don't have prescriptions are seeking these drugs out online. A 2024 health tracking poll by KFF found that around 1 in 8 US adults said they had taken one.

The ever-increasing use of GLP-1 agonists is uncovering clues about what else they can do.

We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects.

On the one hand, these seemingly miraculous drugs appear to improve health in other ways, helping to protect against heart failure, kidney disease, and potentially even substance-use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

But on the other, they appear to be harmful to some people. Their use has been linked to serious conditions, pregnancy complications, and even some deaths. This week let's take a look at what weight-loss drugs can do.

Ozempic, Wegovy, and other similar drugs are known as GLP-1 agonists; they mimic a chemical made in the intestine, GLP-1, that increases insulin and lowers blood levels of glucose. Originally developed to treat diabetes, they are now known to be phenomenal at suppressing appetite. One key trial, published in 2015, found that over the course of around a year, people who took one particular drug lost between around 4.7% and 6% of their body weight, depending on the dose they took.

Newer versions of that drug were shown to have even bigger effects. A 2021 trial of semaglutide—the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy—found that people who took it for 68 weeks lost around 15% of their body weight—equivalent to around 15 kilograms.

But there appear to be other benefits, too. In 2024, an enormous study that included 17,604 people in 41 countries found that semaglutide appeared to reduce heart failure in people who were overweight or obese and had cardiovascular disease. That same year, the US approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in [overweight] adults with cardiovascular disease.” This year, Ozempic was approved to reduce the risk of kidney disease.

And it doesn't end there. The many users of GLP-1 agonists have been reporting some unexpected positive side effects. Not only are they less interested in food, but they are less interested in alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and other addictive substances.

Move over, BMI. It's time to get SAD.

Research suggests they might protect men from prostate cancer. They might help treat osteoarthritis. Some scientists think the drugs could be used to treat a range of pain conditions, and potentially help people with migraine. And some even seem to protect brain cells from damage in lab studies, and they are being explored as potential treatments for neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (although we don't yet have any evidence they can be useful here).

The more we learn about GLP-1 agonists, the more miraculous they seem to be. What can't they do?! you might wonder. Unfortunately, like any drug, GLP-1 agonists carry safety warnings. They can often cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ,and their use has also been linked to inflammation of the pancreas—a condition that can be fatal. They increase the risk of gall bladder disease.

There are other concerns. Weight-loss drugs can help people trim down on fat, but lean muscle can make up around 10% of the body weight lost by people taking them. That muscle is important, especially as we get older. Muscle loss can affect strength and mobility, and it also can also leave people more vulnerable to falls, which are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

And, as with most drugs, we don't fully understand the effects weight-loss drugs might have in pregnancy. That's important; even though the drugs are not recommended during pregnancy, health agencies point out that some people who take these drugs might be more likely to get pregnant, perhaps because they interfere with the effects of contraceptive drugs.

And we don't really know how they might affect the development of a fetus, if at all. A study published in January found that people who took the drugs either before or during pregnancy didn't seem to face increased risk of birth defects. But other research due to be presented at a conference in the coming days found that such individuals were more likely to experience obstetrical complications and preeclampsia.

So yes, while the drugs are incredibly helpful for many people, they are not for everyone. It might be fashionable to be thin, but it's not necessarily healthy. No drug comes without risks. Even one that 1 in 8 American adults have taken.

Prime Day is two weeks out, but Amazon is already unveiling some of its best tech deals of the year. Among the early gems is an all-time low on one of the world's fastest WiFi 7 routers: the TP-Link Archer BE550.

The tri-band router from the future can be had now for just $179 (including a $20 coupon), a discount from its usual $249 price tag. What's even more awesome is the fact that this sale is open to everyone and not just Prime members, so it's the perfect time to get your home network up to speed.

See at Amazon

The Archer BE550 is a beast of a home router for those that need the absolute best when it comes to wireless performance. With WiFi 7 technology at its core, this router is designed to deliver record speeds and unbeatable reliability. It supports tri-band BE9300 WiFi with a maximum combined throughput of 9,214 Mbps: That includes 5,760 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, 2,880 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 574 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. If you're looking to stream 8K content, or handle ultra-fast downloads, the Archer BE550 is built to keep up with even the most demanding households.

It also delivers impeccable coverage throughout your entire home: With six internal antennas and beamforming technology, the router shoots its signal directly to your devices, and delivers strong and stable connections in every corner. It blankets an area of up to 2,000 square feet, which makes it ideal for apartments and medium-sized homes. And if you need even more coverage, it's simple to extend your network using EasyMesh-compatible routers, range extenders, or wireless adapters.

With a single 2.5G WAN port and four 2.5G LAN ports, you can connect your fastest wired devices (like gaming consoles, desktop PCs, or smart TVs) at speeds that keep up with the pace of new internet plans. And by the way, this router also works with all the latest WiFi standards including 802.11be (WiFi 7), 802.11ax, 802.11ac, 802.11n, and 802.11g.

In our experience, it's unusual to find a WiFi 7 router of this quality fall to only $179: don't pass up this opportunity.

Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, the head of Tesla's sales and manufacturing operations in North America and Europe, multiple outlets reported Thursday. The apparent expulsion of the top exec comes as the billionaire's car company flounders under plummeting sales in both the U.S. and the EU.

Afshar, who was considered one of the more senior executives at the company, reported directly to Musk and has also worked at Musk's rocket company, SpaceX. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Afshar had “left” the company, but did not provide details about why. Not long afterward, Forbes reported that Afshar had been let go by Musk, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. CNBC later claimed to have confirmed the news. Gizmodo reached out to Tesla for more information.

The circumstances surrounding Afshar's departure are unclear (and, again, the company hasn't confirmed his termination yet), though there are plenty of reasons why Musk might be angry about his company's sales operations. In recent months, the number of people buying Musk's cars has continued to drop at a staggering rate. In April, Automotive News reported that Tesla sales had fallen 16 percent in the U.S., year-over-year. On Wednesday, Cox Automotive, which provides car dealerships with business intelligence, projected that Tesla sales were expected to dip another 21 percent during this quarter.

Tesla has also seen humiliating losses across Europe. On Wednesday, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that sales of Teslas in 30 European countries had fallen 28% in May. That continues a trend that has been building for some time. Throughout the first part of this year, sales of the car dropped by double digits throughout the continent—a cratering that represents the single biggest sales decline in the company's history.

Ironically, many onlookers have attributed Tesla's struggles to Musk himself, whose political activities—in both the U.S. and Europe—have angered lots of people and inspired hatred against him and his companies. Specifically, Musk's role in DOGE, the Trump administration initiative to shrink the federal government, as well as his meddling in European politics, have put a target on his (and Tesla's) back. In the U.S., the #TeslaTakedown protest movement saw thousands of Americans take to the streets to denounce Musk's role in the White House, while in Europe, protests against Musk have also taken place.

There are, of course, other potential factors in Tesla's plummeting sales numbers. In Europe, increased competition from Chinese manufacturers and newer EV brands means trouble for the company. It's a more EV-saturated market in Europe these days than when Tesla originally got into the game, and, with more choices, there are more opportunities for customers to say “no thanks” to the billionaire's brand.

Jensen Ackles discusses those DCU Batman rumors. Elijah Wood watches the latest Toxic Avenger trailer. Plus, what's coming on the next Beth-centric episode of Rick & Morty. Spoilers get!



A new poster for the Ryan Gosling movie, based on the Andy Weir novel about a science teacher tasked with figuring out a mysterious substance causing the sun to die out, has dropped.

Entertainment insider Daniel Richtman (via SuperheroHype) suggests Marvel's next Thor project is titled Thor Quest, though has no further details on its story, or even whether it's a film or TV series.

Elsewhere, Jensen Ackles addressed rumors he's in the running to play James Gunn's Batman during a recent interview with Collider.

Oh, man. I don't know. It would be hard to carve out something truly unique amongst all of the performances as Batman. I would probably have to lean heavily on Gunn and whoever's directing and whoever's writing it, and get inspiration from the text. You talk about not wanting to fumble the football — that's one that I would be nervous as hell to carry. But also proud. A certain feather in the cap. Anybody who gets to wear the cowl, they got something.

According to Fangoria, Emilie Bierre and Joelle Farrow have joined the cast of Lice, the upcoming “horror mashup of The Breakfast Club and Lord of the Flies” said to have just wrapped filming in Canada.

Bloody-Disgusting reports the Japanese giant monster/fantasy film Brush of the God will receive a theatrical, digital, and physical media release in the US through SRS Cinema. The story concerns the granddaughter of a recently deceased special effects model maker, a diehard tokusatsu fan, and an actor from the titular unrealized kaiju film getting sucked into the world of her grandfather's unfinished final project.

Elijah Wood reacts to the Toxic Avenger trailer in a new promo.

 

Meanwhile, a Japanese soldier and a British POW in WWII must put aside their differences to battle a humanoid fish monster in a new trailer for Orang Ikan.

Production has officially begun on the fourth season of From, according to the series' official Twitter page.

Old EV batteries get a second life powering data centers.

A data center housing 2,000 GPUs is now successfully run with off-the-grid power using solar panels and repurposed batteries. According to Bloomberg, the site is powered by solar panels that generate at least 12 megawatts of power and backed up by reused EV batteries with up to 63 megawatt-hours of capacity. This should be sufficient power for approximately 10,000 average U.S. homes, with the batteries providing power for over five hours. 2,000 GPUs have an estimated power draw of about four megawatts, so the on-site battery capacity should be enough for around 15 hours.

The company behind this project is Redwood Materials, which was founded by JB Straubel, one of the people behind Tesla. Redwood's main business is battery recycling, and it has been focusing on getting battery materials from old EV modules that are no longer useful for transportation and have since been disposed of. But even though these batteries have already reached their end-of-life, Redwood discovered that they still retain about 50% of their capacity. This meant that they can be reused for other purposes that do not require high performance, such as driving an electric car.

“Think of this almost like a retirement home for these batteries,” said Redwood Materials Chief Commercial Officer Cal Lankton. These reused batteries are much cheaper than buying new ones while simultaneously delivering the same performance. So, aside from reducing the burden of disposing of old batteries, it also allows businesses to save on capital expenditure when setting up a backup power supply.

Crusoe Energy operates the data center that Redwood is powering with its reused EV batteries. The former is part of the $500-billion OpenAI Stargate project, although it's unclear if the Nevada site is part of that initiative. Lankton says that they expect to deploy more similar systems for the remainder of 2025, with 5 GWh capacity slated to go live next year. Redwood also claims that it's working on 100 MW projects — a crucial development for power-hungry data centers that require stable and consistent power.

The exponential growth of data centers is putting a strain on our current electricity supply. Many tech companies are investing in small modular reactors to control their own power, but it will still take years before this technology starts to go online. While already available renewable energy like wind and solar is ideal, they're oftentimes unreliable due to changing conditions, forcing data centers to rely on fossil fuel sources. So, solutions like this help ensure that these tech companies will get the kind of clean power they need without putting a strain on the local electric grid.

Upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 on a laptop is a relatively easy endeavor


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I've never needed to upgrade a Wi-Fi card on a laptop before, but I figured it was something I wanted to at least attempt. With the best Wi-Fi 7 routers becoming more prevalent and prices coming down to a more reasonable level, it stands to reason that laptop owners might want to upgrade to Wi-Fi 7 to replace their older internal Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E cards (if they're M.2 based).

I recently reviewed the Asus ROG Strix G16, which comes from the factory with a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6E (MT7922) M.2 card installed. Since I don't plan on returning the review unit to Asus until next week, I figured that I'd use it as a guinea pig to attempt swapping out the M.2 Wi-Fi card. But before I removed the card, I ran some iPerf3 tests to get baseline numbers using Wi-Fi 6E.

Next, I shutdown the system and removed the bottom cover (which is affixed with 11 screws). I then removed the plastic shield covering the MT7922, removed the two antenna leads, and removed the single screw holding it in place.

To continue the endeavor, I grabbed a Gigabyte Aorus GC-WIFI7 card that I had lying around from my best Wi-Fi adapter testing. The GC-WIFI is a Wi-Fi 7 card using the Qualcomm QCNCM865 chipset. Why would you opt for a desktop-based PCIe card? For starters, that's all that I had on hand. And second, desktop wireless cards use M.2-based cards (that are typically destined for laptops) that slot into a full-size PCIe adapter.

Getting to the bare M.2 card took some time, patience, and a few handy tools. First, I removed the metal shield covering the QCNCM865 M.2 card with my trusty Stanley screwdriver. I then removed one small screw that holds the QCNCM865 M.2 card in place along with a plastic clip that sits over the antenna lead connectors (to prevent the connectors from popping off if shocked).

I then gently pulled the antenna leads and removed the QCNCM865 from the M.2 slot. The whole process took around three minutes, which included the time it took to run upstairs and grab my screwdriver.

To make my life easier, I downloaded the Aorus GC-WIFI7 drivers from Gigabyte's support and installed them prior to installation.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The process of installing the QCNCM865 into the ROG Strix G16 required the use of an additional tool. As I'm in my mid-40s, my up-close vision has recently taken a nosedive, requiring me to use reading glasses for up-close text. But even my reading glasses couldn't help me, so I reached for my YOCTOSUN LED Head Magnifier with the 3.5x lens attached. Although I inserted the QCNCM865 and screwed it in without assistance, I needed the magnifier to attach the tiny metal connectors for the antennas.

I tried repeatedly to connect the antennas without the magnifier, but my stubbornness didn't last long. I next reattached the plastic shield over the QCNCM865 and then reattached the bottom panel.

After booting the ROG Strix G16 with its new Wi-Fi 7 transplant, I noticed that the card was already recognized in Device Manager (thanks to the drivers being installed beforehand) and was able to connect to my test network using a TP-Link Archer BE9700 tri-band Wi-Fi 7 router.

I ran some abbreviated iPerf3 benchmarks, which I use when reviewing Wi-Fi routers, to chart the performance impact of upgrading from Wi-Fi 6E to Wi-Fi 7. Tests were conducted with the ROG Strix G16 first using the default MediaTek MT7922 and then the Qualcomm QCNCM865 at six-foot and 25-foot distances.

The most noticeable performance difference was undoubtedly observed during 6 GHz testing, where the QCNCM865 delivered a 50 percent improvement in maximum throughput at a distance of six feet. At 25 feet, the advantage shrank to 42 percent.

Moving to the 5 GHz band, the QCNCM865 Wi-Fi 7 card had a 26 percent improvement at six feet and a 31 percent uplift at 25 feet. The MT7922 and QCNCM865 were evenly matched when tested on the 2.4 GHz band at distances of six feet and 25 feet.

Upgrading the Wi-Fi card in your laptop isn't all that difficult, and is only slightly more involved than replacing RAM or an M.2 SSD. If you have good vision, you can even skip the head-mounted magnifier that I needed during the process.

With the Qualcomm QCNCM865 installed, I observed up to a 50% improvement in throughput on the 6 GHz band and up to 31% on the 5 GHz band. Whether those gains are worth chasing comes down to personal preference. You can grab a bare Intel BE200 Wi-Fi 7 M.2 card for around $27. Bare QCNCM865 cards are harder to find, although you can grab a Gigabyte Aorus GC-WIFI7 for $54 and dissect it.

One additional note: if you're running an AMD-based laptop (such as the ROG Strix G16), you cannot use an Intel-based BE2xx Wi-Fi 7 card, as they're incompatible. The QCNCM865 is the only upgrade path for those systems.

ASML has introduced an online competition in China to promote knowledge of lithography and identify skilled engineers. The contest is designed to deepen awareness of how lithography works, especially the process of creating circuit patterns on silicon wafers, and to encourage the development of specialized expertise in the country. As a side bonus, the competition will show ASML remains dedicated to the Chinese market despite restrictions imposed by the U.S. and its allies, reports the South China Morning Post.

The event invites participants among professionals working in the semiconductor industry as well as enthusiasts with a scientific background. The initiative aims to offer a way for Chinese participants to explore lithography in depth as well as locate new talent to work for ASML in China. According to ASML's statement, the 16 highest-scoring participants will have the chance to interview for positions at ASML, and an additional 75 individuals will be added to a list of candidates who may be considered for future employment. The competition will run from late June through early July and will include 20 questions.

In 2024, mainland China surpassed Taiwan as ASML's largest regional market, accounting for 36.1% of total revenue, according to the company's annual disclosures. To that end, ASML expanded its presence in the country and established a new and bigger repair center in Beijing, which will replace the old one, in a bid to properly serve its expanded installed base in the country. The center needs employees, so the competition could be a part of ASML's effort to staff its new repair shop.

However, ASML management expects sales in China to decline in 2025 as a result of fulfilling a backlog of orders accumulated in previous periods, as well as stricter export limitations imposed on tools that can be shipped to China.

In response to restrictions imposed by the U.S. and its allies, Chinese companies (including the high-tech giant Huawei) and universities have increased efforts to build domestic lithography systems. The Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, which operates under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, posted recruitment notices offering unlimited compensation for PhD researchers willing to join projects developing domestic lithography systems, reports SCMP.

Cooler Master updated its Mini-ITX case to comfortably fit and run the most powerful GPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Cooler Master has finally made the NR200P V3 available in retail stores, with the Mini-ITX case available on Amazon for around $150. It first appeared at CES 2025, where the company showed off its latest line of cases. The biggest change for the V3 is the addition of a cutout covered with a mesh cover where the GPU is designed to sit, allowing it to get the most optimal airflow. You can even remove the mesh panel if you want unimpeded airflow (at the cost of more dust).

Aside from that, the case is slightly lengthened to 378.2mm (from 372mm), allowing it to accept the larger GPUs like the RTX 5090. Because it's slightly larger, you're getting better clearance for your CPU cooler (70mm vs. 67mm for the V2 model), too. A PCIe 5.0 riser cable is also included in the package, ensuring you can get the most out of your graphics card.

Of course, you're still getting the features of the previous generation of the NR200P, including support for up to two 120mm or 140mm fans on top, up to two 120mm slim fans (max 15mm thickness) on the bottom, and up to a 280mm radiator on top. There are also two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C port, and a 3.5 combo jack at the top front for ease of connection. Unfortunately, the case is only available in black, so you'll have to repaint it if you want it in another color. This might void its two-year warranty, though, so buyer beware.

When we saw the NR200P in action in Las Vegas earlier this year, Cooler Master had it outfitted with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with an AIO cooler plus an Asus ROG Strix RTX 4090 BTF GPU (since the RTX 5090 was yet to launch back then). This shows how capable this case was in delivering the performance you need without causing thermal issues and taking up a ton of space on your desk or under it.

If you want an even smaller case, the Ncore 100 Air is also an available option, giving you a tall and slim PC that still offers good airflow. There's also the highly modular MasterFrame 600 line, allowing you to build your PC as you please. All of these were showcased at CES 2025, showing us the many creative and innovative solutions Cooler Master has in store for the PC building community.

Semaglutide was associated with a 20%-46% reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with other antidiabetic medications, with a particularly strong protective effect against vascular dementia, new research showed.

“There is no cure or effective treatment for dementia, so this new study provides real-world evidence for its potential impact on preventing or slowing dementia development among at high-risk population,” Rong Xu, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, said in a press release.

“Future works are needed to establish causal relationships through randomized clinical trials and to characterize the underlying mechanisms,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by William Wang, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland. It was published online on June 24 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

This retrospective, observational, EHR-based study was limited by potential over-, under-, or misdiagnosis; unmeasured confounders; and a short 3-year follow-up period. Diagnosis of AD-related dementia relied on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and prescription data, which may have lacked precision. This study also lacked data on medication adherence, cognitive function tracking, and genetic profiles, and could not fully adjust for variation of healthcare use.

This study was funded by grants from the National Institute on Aging and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. One investigator reported being the editor in chief of the publishing journal but was not involved in the peer-review process. The other investigators reported having no relevant financial conflicts.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Another phase 3 trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of the dual-neurokinin receptor antagonist elinzanetant in controlling hot flashes in women on adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This time, the sample included younger and older patients with less frequent and severe episodes than patients in the previously published trials had experienced.

“Elinzanetant is the first neurokinin-targeted therapy to demonstrate efficacy in reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS)” — otherwise known as hot flashes — “in women with breast cancer,” Fatima Cardoso, MD, MSc, said as she presented results from the OASIS 4 trial at the breast cancer oral abstracts session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting.

“The effect [of the hormone-free dual neurokinin-1 and -3 receptor antagonist] is rapid at week 1,” Cardoso said. “It is sustained throughout the duration of the study. It is also well-tolerated, which supports its use long term.” Trial results were also published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.

“It is important to treat VSM because they can negatively impact quality of life and lead to women prematurely stopping their breast cancer treatment,” Cardoso, director of the breast cancer unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center and president of the ABC Global Alliance in Lisbon, Portugal, told Medscape Medical News.

OASIS 4 enrolled 474 women aged 18-70 years who were receiving endocrine therapy for HR+ breast cancer or as prevention in those at high risk for breast cancer and had 35 or more moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms a week. The trial assigned 316 participants to receive elinzanetant 120 mg daily for 52 weeks and 148 to receive a placebo daily for 12 weeks followed by elinzanetant 120 mg daily for 40 weeks. The average daily VMS frequency was 11.4 in the elinzanetant group and 11.5 in the placebo group. All participants were evaluated for 4 weeks after a year of treatment.

Reductions in frequency of VMS were observed after 1 week of treatment, Cardoso said. The mean daily number of episodes was reduced by four in the patients receiving elinzanetant and 1.8 in those receiving placebo. By week 4, the daily reductions in VMS were 6.5 and 3.0 in the two groups, respectively. By week 12, the patients receiving elinzanetant had almost twice the reduction in overall frequency of VMS: 7.8 vs 4.2 fewer average daily episodes than baseline, respectively.

Cardoso also noted “a substantial improvement” in reducing the severity of VMS in patients receiving elinzanetant.

She characterized the safety profile of elinzanetant as favorable, during her interview with Medscape Medical News.

“Most side effects were mild, and the most common were headache, fatigue, and somnolence,” she said. “Very low rates of serious side effects were seen.”

During the placebo-controlled period, the rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 70% in the patients receiving elinzanetant and 62% in the placebo group. Fewer TEAEs were reported in both groups after the 12-week placebo period ended, she said.

Elinzanetant “was very well tolerated,” Cardoso said as she presented the results. “Perhaps the best factor to say that it was well tolerated and efficacious is that over 90% of the patients decided to go into the 2-year extension phase.”

The OASIS 4 results are consistent with other phase 3 trials of elinzanetant in women on adjuvant endocrine therapy with VMS, JoAnn Pinkerton, MD, director of midlife health at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, told Medscape Medical News. Pinkerton was principal investigator of the OASIS 2 randomized trial of elinzanetant in postmenopausal participants with more frequent and severe VMS symptoms than those in OASIS 4.

“It is worth noting that the treatment did not have any adverse effects on the endometrium, and there were no significant changes in bone density that were not expected due to aging,” Pinkerton said.

OASIS 4 is significant because it enrolled patients from 90 international sites, including Europe and Canada, and well as women aged 18-70 years with 35 or more moderate-to-severe VMS a week while on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, Pinkerton added. 

“OASIS 4 showed significant relief in menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer, precisely the population that needs an effective, Food and Drug Administration-approved medication to treat their bothersome menopausal symptoms,” Pinkerton said.

The trial was funded by Bayer. Cardoso reported financial relationships with Amgen, Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, GE Healthcare, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, IQVIA, Macrogenics, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merus, Mundipharma, Mylan, Novartis, Pfizer, Pierre Fabre, Prime Oncology, Roche, Samsung Bioepis, Sanofi, Seagen, Teva and touchIME. Pinkerton reported having financial relationships with Bayer, Pfizer, and Merck.

Infant feeding advice has been shown to reduce the development of food allergies in the first year of life, a decade after research found that introducing allergenic foods such as eggs and peanuts at the time of giving first solid food is beneficial.

A recent Australian study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice confirmed that this strategy lowers the prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody-mediated egg, peanut, and cow's milk allergies but also stressed the critical importance of making sure parents get — and receive support in following — the latest dietary guidance on food allergy prevention.

The updated American Academy of Pediatrics guidance on food allergies supports the early introduction of potentially allergenic foods into infant diets.

Led by dietitian Debra Palmer, PhD, an associate professor and head of the Nutrition in Early Life team at The Kids Research Institute Australia in Nedlands, Western Australia, the study compared the prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergies at 1 year of age between two infant cohorts, before and after Australia's infant feeding and allergy prevention guidelines of 2016.

“The immediate trigger for the study was the unexpectedly low rate of food allergies observed in a recent high-risk infant cohort, prompting investigation into whether the provision and explanation of the updated guidelines to families played a role,” study co-author Summer Walker, BSc, a PhD candidate at the institute, told Medscape Medical News. “With existing longitudinal data from before and after the guideline change, the team was well-positioned to compare cohorts and provide valuable real-world evidence bridging clinical trial results and public health practice.”

The babies, at high familial risk for allergies, were born to mothers in Perth, Western Australia. All babies had a first-degree relative with a history of allergic disease: food, skin, or respiratory.

In cohort 1 (n = 506, born 2006-2014), no feeding advice was provided to participants. In cohort 2 (n = 566, born 2016-2022), all families were provided with updated infant feeding and allergy prevention guidelines. when the infants were 6 months of age.

By 12 months of age, 94.2% of infants in cohort 2 had been introduced to peanuts, 99.3% to eggs, and 98.6% to cow's milk in infant formula or dairy foods.

One-year assessment of food allergen sensitization and food allergy found the combined prevalence of IgE-mediated peanut, egg, and cow's milk allergies was just 4.1% in cohort 2 vs 12.6% in cohort 1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.48; P < .001).

By individual allergy prevalence, peanut was 1.1% vs 5.8% (aOR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08-0.76; P = .015), egg was 2.8% vs 11.7% (aOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12-0.45; P < .001), and cow's milk was 0.5% vs 2.4% (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.55; P = .005), respectively, in cohort 2 vs cohort 1.

“The marked improvement appeared to result from the direct provision of clear explanations and written copies of the updated feeding guidelines to parents at the time of solid food introduction, especially when compared with the earlier cohort that received no such advice,” Walker said.

“Given that a previous retrospective study in Australia found no reduction in peanut allergy following the updated guidelines, we believe that direct explanation and timely provision of these guidelines to families — specifically around the time of solid food introduction — is critical,” she added. “This proactive approach appears to be key in encouraging earlier introduction of allergenic foods and achieving the observed reduction in food allergy incidence.”

Because the cohorts included families with existing allergies, some parents were understandably anxious about introducing allergenic foods to their infants, Walker said. “However, targeted education from our research nurses, along with clear reinforcement that the updated guidelines applied to all infants — regardless of allergy risk — helped alleviate those concerns.” The program received positive feedback from parents, who felt well supported and free to ask questions throughout the process.

Walker noted, however, that the Perth study did not capture data on the frequencies or amounts of consumption of food allergens, although tolerance may also depend on the frequency of consumption and amounts eaten regularly. “There is still a gap in knowledge surrounding these variables, and we recommend that this data be regularly captured in future prospective studies.”

Offering a US perspective on the study, John M. Kelso, MD, an allergist/immunologist at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego, noted that previous advice on delaying potentially allergenic foods in hopes of preventing food allergies, “though not illogical, was not evidence-based. It turns out to have been not only unhelpful but rather harmful, instead leading to an increase in food allergy,” he told Medscape Medical News.

He noted that the landmark LEAP trial, published 10 years ago, clearly demonstrated that the early introduction of peanut protein in infancy dramatically decreases the likelihood of peanut allergy, and similar data have emerged for other foods. “Since then, allergists and pediatricians have routinely recommended that these potentially allergenic foods be introduced into the diet of infants — in any form that does not present a choking hazard — as soon as the infant is developmentally able to ingest solid food at around 4-6 months of age.”

Kelso added that the Australian paper clearly demonstrates that directly providing parents with the updated recommendations is key to a significant reduction in the development of food allergy.

According to the authors, theirs is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of direct, proactive provision and implementation of updated infant feeding guidelines to reduce multiple IgE-mediated food allergies.

In a US study of patients without cardiac arrest who required prehospital intubation, rapid sequence intubation (RSI), involving the use of a sedative and paralytic, was associated with increased odds of first-pass success compared with intubation without medication.

""In this analysis of a large national EMS dataset of noncardiac arrest patients undergoing endotracheal intubation, rapid sequence intubation was associated with twofold higher odds of first-pass success compared with sedation-only or no-medication approaches,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Jeffrey L. Jarvis, MD, MS, EMT-P, Burnett College of Medicine, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas. It was published online on June 04, 2025, in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.

The study focused solely on the association between drug combination and first-pass success, without evaluating causation, procedure indication appropriateness, adverse events, or clinical outcomes. EMS treatment protocols were not uniform across agencies, and the dataset lacked information on clinician experience with intubation. Variability in EMS protocols and clinician experience, potential data entry or documentation errors (including reliance on self-reported data), and a small sample size for paralytic-only intubations were additional limitations.

Funding information was not provided for the study. One author reported serving as an unpaid board member for the National Emergency Medical Service Quality Alliance, the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, and the Prehospital Guidelines Consortium, unrelated to this study. He also reported receiving unrestricted honoraria for speaking on various topics at EMS-related conferences.

DISCLOSURES |  June 27, 2025  

The CDC's newly appointed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months or older with no contraindications. Of the seven members who participated in the vote, the vote was yes to recommend vaccination from six members, with one abstention.

The 2024-2025 flu season was classified as high severity across all age groups, said Vivien Dugan, MD, of the CDC's Influenza Division. In children younger than 18 years, a total of 246 influenza-associated deaths from the 2024-2025 season have been reported as of June 7, 2025, she said.

Dugan also presented estimates of the disease burden of influenza and the alleviation of this burden via vaccines. Data from multiple surveillance networks showed an overall vaccine coverage rate ranging from 38% to 56% for outpatient visits and 35% to 71% for inpatient visits, with variation by age group and flu type, she said.

“Estimated influenza disease burden was the highest the US has seen in the last decade,” she noted in her presentation. However, vaccination likely prevented approximately 240,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, mainly in adults aged 65 years or older, she said.

Options for influenza vaccination for the upcoming season include not only an injectable vaccine but also the needle-free FluMist nasal spray (live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent).

A recombinant flu vaccine (Flublok) contains no eggs and was recently approved for use in individuals aged 9 years or older by the FDA after an extensive review of safety and efficacy data. Some of these data were shared at the ACIP meeting.

Pedro Folegatti, MD, an employee of Flublok manufacturer Sanofi, presented data on the safety and effectiveness of the latest quadrivalent flu vaccine (RIV4) among individuals aged 9-17 years compared with those aged 18-49 years in a phase 3 study. The RIV4 showed similar safety and effectiveness in a younger age group, with noninferiority of hemagglutination inhibition immune response and a similar safety profile. A trivalent Flublok was approved by the FDA in March 2025 for individuals aged 9 years or older, according to an approval letter.

“As influenza vaccines are recommended for all individuals over 6 months of age, having multiple products available increases accessibility, particularly in the rare event that a child has a contraindication to other currently available flu vaccines,” said Lori Handy, MD, MSCE, associate director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in an interview.

Having a supply of influenza vaccine that does not rely on eggs puts the US in a better position in the event of influenza pandemics or egg shortages, she noted. Although it is hard to predict whether parents have preferences for different manufacturing processes, the expanded Flublok indication may improve vaccination rates, Handy said.

Dugan also presented the influenza vaccine composition for the 2025-2026 season, which includes:

● A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus for egg-based vaccines or an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus for cell and recombinant vaccines

● A/Croatia/Y10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus for egg-based vaccines or an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus for cell and recombinant vaccines

● B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus

The next ACIP meeting is tentatively scheduled for the third quarter of 2025. 

The study on Flublok was sponsored by manufacturer Sanofi, and Folegatti is employed by Sanofi.

Handy had no financial conflicts to disclose.

DISCLOSURES |  June 27, 2025  

It's well known that medications used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) do more than address the core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. They have also been associated with significant reductions in the risk for serious real-world outcomes such as self-harm, unintentional injury, car crashes, and crime. 

However, a large-scale Swedish study has found that the magnitude of associations between ADHD medication use and these real-world outcomes appears to have weakened, in parallel with rising prescription rates.

“The declining strength of the associations of ADHD medication and real-world outcomes could be attributed to the expansion of prescriptions to a broader group of individuals having fewer symptoms or impairments,” first author Lin Li, PhD, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues wrote.

The findings were published online on June 25 in JAMA Psychiatry. 

The rate of ADHD medication use has risen substantially in many countries over the past two decades. With treatment now reaching a broader population of individuals who may have less severe symptoms, an emerging question is whether there remains a meaningful reduction in real-world harm.

To investigate, Li and colleagues analyzed health data from Swedish national registers for 247,420 individuals aged 4-64 years who were prescribed ADHD medications between 2006 and 2020.

They employed a self-controlled case series design, which allowed individuals to serve as their own controls. Outcomes included rates of self-harm, unintentional injury, traffic crashes, and crime measured during medicated vs nonmedicated periods.

Over the 14-year study period, ADHD medication use rose sharply in Sweden — from 0.6% to 2.8% in children and from 0.1% to 1.3% in adults.

ADHD medication use was consistently linked to reduced risks for self-harm (incidence rate ratio [IRR] range, 0.77-0.85), unintentional injury (IRR range, 0.87-0.93), traffic crashes (IRR range, 0.71-0.87) and crime (IRR range, 0.73-0.84) across all analyzed time periods, age groups, and sexes.

However, the magnitude of risk reduction for these real-world outcomes diminished significantly over time (P < .01) and was not fully explained by the age and sex distribution of people taking ADHD medication.

The study team noted that the strongest associations between ADHD medication and reduced risk for real-world outcomes were consistently observed in women during the earliest study period (2006-2010), a time when only the most severe ADHD cases in women were being diagnosed and treated.

Over time, as more women were prescribed ADHD medication, the sex differences on the various real-world outcomes narrowed, investigators said.

In an accompanying editorial in JAMA Psychiatry, Ryan S. Sultan, MD, Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York City, and colleagues said it's “critically” important to remember that the purpose of ADHD treatment is not primarily to prevent arrests, car crashes, or self-harm crises but to improve patients' daily functioning and quality of life. 

“The accumulation of evidence makes one thing clear: When used appropriately, ADHD medications can help affected people not just feel better but live safer, more productive lives. This message is important as many individuals with ADHD still do not receive medication as their first-line treatment, despite medications having the most robust evidence for ADHD,” the editorialists wrote.

The study had no commercial funding. The authors and editorial writers had no relevant disclosures.

Could a kitchen spice help stop colorectal cancer before it starts? New research shows curcumin selectively attacks the stem-like cells that fuel early tumors, pointing to a promising, low-risk addition to current prevention strategies.

Study: An old spice with new tricks: Curcumin targets adenoma and colorectal cancer stem-like cells associated with poor survival outcomes. Image Credit: Tatiana.Sidorova / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Cancer Letters, a group of researchers investigated whether physiologically achievable curcumin can inhibit colorectal tumor initiation by inducing cancer stem-like cells in adenomas and early cancers to exit self-renewal and differentiate.

Every four minutes, someone in the United States (US) learns they have colorectal cancer, the nation's second-deadliest malignancy. Lifestyle shifts mean incidence is climbing fastest in adults under 50, amplifying the need for prevention. Most tumors arise from benign adenomas that evolve over decades, offering a long interception window. Evidence links daily aspirin to risk reduction, yet bleeding risks and incomplete protection leave many people unserved. Plant-derived compounds with proven safety, such as the kitchen spice curcumin, intrigue researchers but often fail because their mechanisms remain vague. Unlocking how curcumin works could turn a low-cost seasoning into a precision prevention tool. However, further research is needed to confirm efficacy in at-risk populations, particularly for sporadic CRC (distinct from familial forms, such as FAP, where trial results have been mixed).

Investigators collected fresh colorectal adenoma, carcinoma, and matched normal tissues from 66 consented patients for initial cancer stem cell (CSC) profiling (with additional samples used in subsequent assays). They dissociated samples into single cells, then quantified aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and epithelial surface antigen expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cancer stem-like cells. Cells grew as three-dimensional spheroids in serum-free media containing 0.01–10 μM curcumin or vehicle for four weeks, mirroring chronic oral intake. Parallel patient-derived explants (PDEs), intact micro-tissues, incubated for 24 h, assessed short-term responses. To gauge in vivo relevance, researchers implanted 2,000 ALDH-high cells subcutaneously into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice pre-fed a phytosomal (Meriva®) 0.2% curcumin diet.

Tumor onset, size, and survival were tracked for 20 weeks. Flow cytometry quantified proliferating NANOG-positive cells by Ki67 co-staining. Western blotting, affinity pull-down with linker-conjugated curcumin beads, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays probed direct curcumin binding to the transcription factor NANOG. Finally, RNA sequencing of NANOG-overexpressing HCT116 spheroids after 24-hour and 72-hour exposures followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed pathway shifts toward differentiation. All procedures met institutional and national ethical standards.

Curcumin suppressed stem-like behavior across various laboratory models, although its efficacy varied by patient sample and dose. In human spheroids, curcumin concentrations of 0.1–5 μM reduced sphere numbers by up to 95% in responsive patients and halved the ALDH-high fraction, with activity spanning multiple molecular subtypes, including those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Adenomas harbored the greatest baseline load of ALDH-high/CD133-negative cells (11.8% vs. 4.8% in normal mucosa), a population specifically enriched in premalignant tissue and highlighting a prime prevention target that curcumin efficiently depleted.

In NOD/SCID mice, phytosomal curcumin delayed palpable tumor appearance from 80 to 105 days and extended median survival from 117 to 160 days. Treated tumors exhibited 50–83% fewer ALDH-high and CD133-positive populations, indicating durable stem suppression in vivo. Importantly, curcumin trimmed doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-marked tuft stem cells in ApcMin/+ mutant mice yet spared normal intestines, underscoring selectivity.

Mechanistically, curcumin bound the homeodomain and C-terminus of NANOG, a master regulator of colorectal cancer stem-like cells, and disrupted its DNA interaction. Low-dose exposure halved NANOG-driven luciferase activity and downshifted the focal adhesion kinase and BMI1 proto-oncogene pathways, without altering overall NANOG phosphorylation, suggesting a direct transcriptional blockade rather than protein destabilization.

Patient-derived explants mirrored these effects after only 24 hours: curcumin eradicated the proliferative NANOG-positive/Ki67-positive compartment in 5 of 20 cases and reduced it by more than 35% in 8 additional cases; however, four samples showed no response or an increase in NANOG⁺ cells. Notably, effects were non-linear, with stronger responses at lower doses (0.1–1 μM) in some tissues. Furthermore, long-term spheroid culture demonstrated no acquired resistance to curcumin, with sustained sensitivity over repeated exposures spanning 142 days. The stem-quieting action proved clinically meaningful—tumors from an independent cohort whose proliferative stem fraction sat in the lowest quartile enjoyed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 1,111 days, versus 379 days for the highest quartile.

Transcriptomic profiling confirmed phenotype shift. Within 72 hours, with effects intensifying by 72 hours compared to 24-hour exposures, curcumin down-regulated embryonic stem gene signatures and up-regulated intestinal differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition brake pathways. These changes aligned with an emerging population of non-stem proliferating cells, supporting the idea that curcumin pushes aggressive precursors to mature into less dangerous lineages rather than merely killing them.

To summarize, clinically attainable curcumin reprograms colorectal cancer stem-like cells, especially within early adenomas, steering them away from endless self-renewal and toward differentiation. By directly disabling NANOG, the spice depletes the proliferating stem pool associated with poor survival, prolongs life in xenografted mice, and leaves healthy intestinal stem cells intact. Dosing effects were complex, with U-shaped responses in some systems.

These findings connect a familiar culinary ingredient to cutting-edge precision medicine and suggest that regular low-dose curcumin could complement existing measures, such as colonoscopy and aspirin, where bleeding risk or genetic background limits their use. Ongoing trials must verify long-term benefit and optimize dosing for diverse at-risk groups.

Blood cancer patients who may have previously struggled to find a donor for transplantation now have more options.

A new study shows that patients achieve good outcomes with a partial match drawn from the national public registry of donors when they are treated with the immune-suppressing drug cyclophosphamide. Survival rates at one year were on par with rates seen in other studies with fully matched donors.

These findings should expand the donor pool for patients who have difficulty finding a full match, said Antonio Jimenez Jimenez, M.D., senior author of the study and a physician-scientist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

Results from the phase 2 nonrandomized trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Outcomes were comparable to fully matched donors, which means your pool of potential donors is now huge. Not only can you now offer every patient a transplant, but you can also optimize other factors when looking for a donor.""

Antonio Jimenez Jimenez, M.D., senior author of the study and physician-scientist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center

Physicians often turn to the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) registry when a matched sibling donor is not available. The chance that a sibling is a full genetic match is approximately 25% for patients with one or more siblings. About half of siblings are haploidentical, or half-matched, donors.

Jimenez Jimenez posted about the new study on social media, in a message directed to other oncologists.

""If you're still hesitating to offer an unrelated transplant without an 8/8 match, this study should shift that thinking,"" he said in the post. ""It's not about settling for a second-best option. It's about expanding access to hematopoietic cell transplantation without lowering the bar.""

Jimenez Jimenez was chair of the 21-center study, along with Monzr M. Al Malki, M.D., at City of Hope National Medical Center. The trial was sponsored by NMDP and conducted by CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). NMDP operates the U.S. registry of volunteer donors, providing access to over 42 million potential donors worldwide.

A matched donor has a fully compatible set of immune system proteins on their cells, called HLA markers. Historically, a partial match raised the risk of immune attack by the donor cells, resulting in a potentially deadly condition called graft-versus-host disease.

The new study found that cyclophosphamide eased this risk when combined with a mixture of other immune-suppressing agents after transplantation.

The researchers reported on 145 adult patients who received transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells, which has largely supplanted bone marrow as a donor source. They were prepared for transplantation using standard regimens, either reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative (RIC/NMA) conditioning, typically used for older frailer patients, or myeloablative conditioning (MAC). None of the patients had a fully matched family member or unrelated donor available.

All donors were sourced and graft collection facilitated by the NMDP. The vast majority of donors matched at 6/8 or 7/8 markers. All patients received cyclophosphamide to prevent GVHD.

Patients showed overall high one-year survival rates, at 78.6% for RIC and 83.8% for MAC. They also showed low rates of moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, at 8.6% for RIC/NMA and 10.3% for MAC. What's more, patients who had a match lower than 7/8 showed similar outcomes to patients with a higher match.

These data are comparable to those from prior studies with fully matched patients treated with cyclophosphamide, including a study where RIC/NMA patients received the same post-treatment drug mixture.

The findings also align with a previous smaller trial of cyclophosphamide by the researchers, on mismatched patients receiving bone marrow instead of stem cell transplantation.

The researchers are still collecting and analyzing data on longer-term outcomes, additional enrolled patients and a cohort of pediatric patients. A separate clinical trial is testing a lower dose of cyclophosphamide, which can have side effects such as increased risk of infection. Another planned study will combine cyclophosphamide with a different mixture of drugs.

While about 70% of patients from well-represented backgrounds can find a full match in the NMDP registry, only a fraction of others can. Some populations have even worse odds.

""This trial was born of necessity,"" said Jimenez Jimenez, who presented interim findings from the trial last year at the annual meeting of the European Hematology Association (EHA). ""We partnered with the NMDP/CIBMTR to offer this option to patients while advancing the science. It also built on the strengths of Sylvester's transplant program and helped further elevate its standing. We are now recognized globally.""

A new study by Professor José Villalaín, Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Miguel Hernández University of Elche (UMH), provides a detailed description of how nymphaeol A - a compound found in propolis - behaves when interacting with cell membranes. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, the research is featured on the June cover of the scientific journal Membranes.

Nymphaeol A is one of the main bioactive compounds in propolis, a resinous substance produced by honeybees and used since antiquity for its therapeutic effects. It has also been isolated from Macaranga tanarius, a tropical tree known as the parasol leaf macaranga, which is traditionally used in Asian medicine. Previous studies have shown that this molecule has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer potential, making it a promising candidate for developing new therapeutic agents.

To better understand how this molecule exerts its biological activity, Professor Villalaín used molecular dynamics simulations, a technique capable of recreating complex cellular membranes like those found in human organisms.

""This allowed me to study how nymphaeol A behaves within a complex biological membrane, which helps explain its therapeutic effectiveness,"" explains the researcher, who is affiliated with the Institute of Research, Development, and Innovation in Health Biotechnology of Elche (IDiBE-UMH).

The results show that nymphaeol A spontaneously inserts into the membrane and tends to adopt its most extended conformation, which may enhance its interaction with membrane lipids. While it mostly acts as a monomer, it can also form small aggregates. Its ability to position itself among the lipid chains slightly alters the membrane structure, increasing its fluidity. ""This flexibility and mobility within the membrane could help explain its strong biological activity,"" Villalaín adds.

The study highlights the value of computational simulations for exploring molecular interactions that are difficult to observe directly in the lab. It also opens up new avenues for investigating other natural compounds with potential biomedical applications.

A cup and a half of leafy green vegetables could go a long way to addressing atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ASVD's), new research from Edith Cowan University (ECU), the University of Western Australia and the Danish Cancer Institute has found. 

ASVDs are a subgroup of cardiovascular disease, which are current leading causes of death world-wide, primarily due to heart attacks and strokes. ECU PhD student Ms. Montana Dupuy noted that in Australia, cardiovascular diseases claim the life of one person every 12 minutes. 

Research led by Ms. Dupuy has found that the higher dietary intake of Vitamin K1 could reduce the risk of ASVD. 

Leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, like spinach, kale and broccoli, contain Vitamin K1 which may assist in preventing vascular calcification processes that characterize cardiovascular disease. The great news is that these vegetables can be easily incorporated into your daily meals.""

Ms. Montana Dupuy, ECU PhD student

In addition to its' potential role in vascular calcification inhibition, Vitamin K may also be beneficial for musculoskeletal health, through its impact on bone strength. 

ECU Senior Research Fellow Dr. Marc Sim noted that a cup and a half of such vegetables is an easy way to increase our daily vitamin K intake and may lower our risk for cardiovascular disease"". 

""This research found women who consumed approximately 30% higher intakes of Vitamin K1 than currently recommended in the Australian Dietary Guidelines had lower long-term risk of ASVD,"" he said. 

""Of importance, when we examined the blood vessels in the neck, those with a higher Vitamin K1 intake also had less thickening of these blood vessels, a marker of atherosclerosis."" 

The work led by Ms. Dupuy and Dr. Sim on the impact of Vitamin K to vascular health, as well as musculoskeletal health, will now help to inform future research at ECU's Future Foods and Digital Gastronomy Lab and to deliver specialised meals as part of clinical trials to improve population health. 

""This research has provided key evidence to support our future studies. We are now creating new foods which pack more leafy greens that are rich in Vitamin K1. These novel foods can be used in communities with special nutritional and dietary requirements, such as aged care residents,"" said ECU Post Doctoral Research Fellow Dr. Liezhou Zhong. 

""We are consolidating all our epidemiological data and converting that into a tangible product that would benefit the community,"" he added.

Antibiotics are one of the greatest triumphs in the history of medical science - but these lifesaving tools have a dark side.

Their persistent use can produce ""superbugs"" - drug-resistant microbes that pose a danger to humans, animals and the environment.

In a first-of-its-kind pilot project, researchers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture and Arizona State University tested the novel integration of a handheld DNA sequencing device within Indonesia's national antibiotic resistance surveillance system across six chicken slaughterhouses in the Greater Jakarta area. They collected samples from both wastewater and surrounding rivers.

The goal: to determine whether portable DNA sequencing could improve national efforts to track drug-resistant E. coli, a key indicator of antibiotic resistance.

The study found signs that antibiotic-resistant bacteria from slaughterhouse wastewater may be reaching nearby rivers. In many cases, downstream sites had higher levels of resistant E. coli than upstream, pointing to a possible route for resistance to spread from animal waste into the environment.

However, the study also showed how portable DNA sequencing can strengthen national surveillance efforts - making it easier to detect antibiotic resistance hotspots and paving the way for more targeted, cost-effective solutions to reduce its spread. Resistant E. coli strains can cause a range of illnesses, including diarrhea, especially in children, older adults and immunocompromised individuals.

In certain settings, diarrhea isn't just uncomfortable - it's life-threatening.""

Lee Voth-Gaeddert, senior author, researcher with the ASU Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes

He is joined by his Biodesign Institute colleagues and international collaborators.

The mobile sequencing approach could be expanded to farms and wet markets, or adapted to track other pathogens such as bird flu.

The research appears in the journal Antibiotics.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing global crisis. It occurs when bacteria evolve to survive the drugs meant to kill them. When people are infected with these bacteria, the usual antibiotics won't help. In 2021 alone, antibiotic resistance was linked to nearly 5 million deaths. That number is expected to double by 2050.

Traditional monitoring relies on culture-based techniques. This requires transporting samples to a lab. For a nation like Indonesia, home to more than 14,000 islands, that presents a challenge.

The new project tested a device called MinION, which uses portable nanopore DNA sequencing to rapidly analyze genetic material at the point of collection. The device is small enough to fit in the palm of a hand and powered by a laptop. It delivered results comparable to high-cost laboratory systems.

The project monitored a strain of bacteria that is resistant to a broad class of antibiotics and recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a significant threat. This strain of E. coli is often used as a proxy for detecting the presence and spread of other dangerous resistant bacteria.

""It's not the nastiest one, but it is on the CDC list of pathogens of concern,"" said Voth-Gaeddert, who is also a senior Global Futures scientist with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory. ""We often use it as a primary indicator of antibiotic resistance.""

Samples were taken from slaughterhouse wastewater, as well as upstream and downstream river sites. Most of the E. coli found in wastewater was antibiotic resistant. That same resistance pattern was seen downstream but not upstream, suggesting that slaughterhouse waste was the source.

""This wasn't overly surprising,"" Voth-Gaeddert said. ""A lot of these slaughterhouses are positioned right next to rivers. You need water for the slaughtering process, but it also makes waste disposal easier - especially when it's liquid waste.""

The study documented large differences in how facilities managed their waste. Some had treatment systems in place, while others released their waste without treating it.

Although the researchers did not assess how effective the treatment systems were, they detected antibiotic-resistant bacteria in both treated and untreated samples. This raises concerns not only about gaps in infrastructure, but also about the maintenance, regulation and oversight of existing systems.

Globally, wastewater from households, hospitals and agricultural runoff is a major source of antibiotic residues in rivers - especially in Southeast Asia, according to a recent study. When antibiotics linger in the environment, they create conditions that allow bacteria to develop new ways to resist them, making high-quality surveillance even more urgent.

To better understand the risk, the team went beyond simply identifying bacteria - they also sequenced their genetic material. Many of the resistance genes they found were located on plasmids - small mobile pieces of DNA that can move between bacteria and spread resistance across species.

Using the MinION device, the researchers identified these genes as well as virulence factors and specific bacterial strains with up to 100% agreement compared with traditional lab methods. The findings show that high-resolution genomic surveillance is feasible even outside elite research settings.

This project is rooted in the One Health framework, which recognizes that human, animal and environmental health are deeply interconnected.

""If we only use a narrow lens, we miss a lot of potential leverage points to control the spread of antibiotic resistance,"" Voth-Gaeddert said. ""There's a lot of opportunity here. That's why there's been such a big push to promote One Health.""

Indonesia's environmental diversity and experience with antibiotic resistance surveillance made it an ideal location for piloting new tools. But the insights are globally relevant as antibiotic resistance spreads across borders and ecosystems.

Fast, affordable and locally accessible tools like the MinION may significantly advance our efforts to track and control a broad range of microbial threats.

Babies as young as eight months old can adapt their learning style to changing situations, according to research by Francesco Poli of the Donders Institute at Radboud University. This is the first time that babies have been shown to learn in such a flexible way.

The conventional wisdom is that eight-month-old babies passively absorb knowledge.""

Francesco Poli, neuroscientist

New research now shows that this is not the case. 'We see that babies are able to adapt their learning strategies to their environment from a very young age.

Poli investigated this by showing babies a screen displaying a colourful monster. Sometimes the monster appeared on one side of the screen, sometimes on the other. ""For example, we sometimes let the monster appear only on the left side for a while and then suddenly on the other side. Meanwhile, we used eye tracking [a camera in the screen with harmless infrared light] to monitor where the baby was looking and whether the pupil size changed."" The most likely location of the monster remained either the same for a long time (stable environment) or changed frequently (changing environment).

At a certain point, the babies had learned where to look: they were already looking at the place where they expected the monster to appear. ""When the environment changed, they adjusted their viewing behaviour accordingly. They learned whether the monster's location was stable or not and were able to actively adapt their learning strategy. It was surprising to see that babies learn in such a flexible way.""

In the study, Poli also asked parents to complete a questionnaire in which they had to indicate how their baby deals with new situations. How does a baby respond to a game of peek-a-boo, for example? And how quickly does a baby go to new toys? Poli: ""We saw that babies who had difficulty adapting their learning strategy, or who adapted too much, also had difficulty with change in everyday life.""

In adults, we know that there is a link between difficulty coping with change and anxiety or depression. It is possible that babies who do not adapt their learning strategies efficiently are more likely to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression later in life. 'But this is still speculation. To be able to say this with certainty, longitudinal research is needed,' says Poli.

Policymakers and drinkers are speaking different languages when it comes to alcohol consumption, according to new research.

A new study by a team psychologists, linguists and policy experts from University of Staffordshire, University of Liverpool, Oxford Brookes University and London South Bank University reveals stark differences in the way that policymakers and the public talk about alcohol consumption – and argues for a new approach to alcohol interventions and health campaigns.

Using linguistics software, the team analyzed the language used in England's three most recent alcohol policies, compared to how young adults talk about drinking.

Dr. Emma Moreton, researcher in Applied Linguistics at University of Liverpool, explained: ""By examining the language used to talk about alcohol in different contexts and by different individuals and groups, it becomes possible to identify some of the underlying attitudes, assumptions and beliefs around alcohol consumption and alcohol harms.""

The findings show that although policymakers and drinkers often reference similar topics – such as alcohol-related health risks and intoxication – the ways they frame these narratives differ significantly.

The policy documents frame alcohol use in predominantly negative terms, often as a behavioural problem to be corrected, whereas drinkers talk about the negative and positive impact of alcohol consumption.

Our new paper shows that policymakers and drinkers talk about drinking in different ways. While policymakers focused on drinking behavior, drinkers talked about how drinking made them feel different emotions: embarrassed, happy, guilty, sad.

Policymakers need to construct policies to reflect the importance of emotions in drinkers' narratives. This fits in with psychological theories of drinking behaviour which propose that people drink for different reasons – to socialise, to relax, to cope with negative emotions, to fit in with their friends. Policy initiatives telling people to cut down, or drink within the guidelines of 14 units per week, will work for some but not all; if people are worried that cutting down will isolate them from others or their social life, they are likely to ignore such messages.""

Richard Cooke, Professor of Health Psychology, University of Staffordshire

The findings also challenge the continued focus on young drinkers, pointing to rising alcohol use among older adults, whose consumption is more closely linked to long-term health issues like cancer and heart disease.

Alcohol accounts for around 17,000 cancer diagnoses every year and World Cancer Research Fund recently launched a petition calling on Government to introduce a National Alcohol Strategy for England, including improved alcohol labelling, minimum unit pricing, and marketing restrictions.

The Government's most recent Alcohol Strategy was published in March 2012 and the paper's researchers are backing calls for a new strategy – with drinkers involved in the policymaking process.

They argue that policies must reflect real-life behaviours and motivations if they are to make a meaningful difference and that dialogue, not just directives, is key to reducing alcohol-related harm.

Professor Cooke added: ""As most people in England drink within the guidelines, we need acceptable messages that fit with people's lives. We call on policymakers to talk to drinkers about their experiences, find out what policies they like, and don't like, and move away from an exclusive focus on harm. Given the recent calls for a new National Alcohol Strategy, our study is a timely reminder to involve everyone in discussions about alcohol.""

A research team led by Associate Professor Ayako Okado-Matsumoto from the Department of Biology at Toho University has made a significant finding that sheds new light on Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). This study was conducted in collaboration with Professor Ryuji Sakakibara from the Department of Neurology at Sakura Medical Center, and Professors Hitoshi Nukada and Soroku Yagihashi from the Department of Exploratory Medicine on Nature, Life and Man at Toho University.

The team discovered a notable change in a specific protein found in the blood of patients with DLB. Their research revealed that individuals with DLB have significantly lower levels of α-synuclein in their red blood cells, compared to healthy individuals and patients with other neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. α-synuclein is a protein known to play a role in the development of several neurodegenerative disorders when it accumulates abnormally in brain cells.

This finding may contribute to improving the diagnosis of DLB, which is often difficult to detect at an early stage. The possibility of developing a simple blood-based biomarker for early detection could offer meaningful benefits for both patients and their families.

The research findings were published online in The Journal of Biochemistry on April 16, 2025.

Lower α-synuclein levels in DLB patients:
	The study revealed that individuals with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) have notably lower levels of α-synuclein in their red blood cells compared to healthy individuals or patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

Elevated α-synuclein in plasma extracellular vesicles:
	The researchers also found that α-synuclein levels are elevated in small membrane-bound particles called extracellular vesicles-released by cells and present in the plasma-in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and DLB, compared to healthy individuals.

Implications for early diagnosis:
	These findings may contribute to the development of a blood-based test that could enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis of DLB, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes and better patient care.

A new study led by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School has found that damage to a specific region of the brain may contribute to criminal or violent behavior.

The study, titled ""White matter disconnection in acquired criminality"", was published recently in Molecular Psychiatry.

The investigation analyzed brain scans from individuals who began committing crimes after sustaining brain injuries from strokes, tumors or traumatic brain injury. The study compared these 17 cases to brain scans from 706 individuals with other neurological symptoms such as memory loss or depression. The investigators found that injury to the region of the right uncinate fasciculus was the most commonly affected area in the brains of those people who developed criminal behavior. The same pattern held true among individuals who committed violent crimes.

""This part of the brain, the uncinate fasciculus, is a white matter pathway that serves as a cable connecting regions that govern emotion and decision-making,"" said Christopher M. Filley, MD, professor emeritus of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and one of the study's co-authors. ""When that connection is disrupted on the right side, a person's ability to regulate emotions and make moral choices may be severely impaired.""

While it is widely accepted that brain injury can lead to problems with memory or motor function, the role of the brain in guiding social behaviors like criminality is more controversial. It raises complex questions about culpability and free will.""

Isaiah Kletenik, MD, assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study

Kletenik said during his time in behavioral neurology training at the University of Colorado School of Medicine he had the unique opportunity to evaluate patients who began committing acts of violence with the onset of brain tumors or degenerative diseases.

""These clinical cases prompted my curiosity into the brain basis of moral decision-making and led me to learn new network-based neuroimaging techniques at the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School,"" said Kletenik.

To strengthen the findings, the researchers conducted a full connectome analysis, employing a detailed map of how brain regions are interconnected. They confirmed that the right uncinate fasciculus was the neural pathway with the most consistent link to criminal behavior.

""It wasn't just any brain damage, it was damage in the location of this pathway,"" said Filley. ""Our finding suggests that this specific connection may play a unique role in regulating behavior.""

The uncinate fasciculus links brain regions involved in reward-based decision-making with those that process emotions. When that link is damaged, particularly on the right side, people may have difficulty controlling impulses, anticipating consequences or feeling empathy, all of which can contribute to harmful or criminal actions.

While not everyone with this type of brain injury becomes violent the study suggests that damage to this tract may play a role in new onset criminal behavior after injury.

""This work could have real-world implications for both medicine and the law,"" said Filley. ""Doctors may be able to better identify at-risk patients and offer effective early interventions. And courts might need to consider brain damage when evaluating criminal responsibility.""

Kletenik said that the findings raise important ethical questions.

""Should brain injury factor into how we judge criminal behavior? Causality in science is not defined in the same way as culpability in the eyes of the law. Still, our findings provide useful data that can help inform this discussion and contributes to our growing knowledge about how social behavior is mediated by the brain."" said Kletenik.

Experts from Vanderbilt University, University of California San Diego and Salk Institute, also collaborated on the study.

Compared with a Mediterranean diet, dietary acid load decreased significantly on a low-fat vegan diet and was associated with weight loss, according to a randomized cross-over trial conducted by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and published in Frontiers in Nutrition.

Eating acid-producing foods like meat, eggs, and dairy can increase the dietary acid load, or the amount of acids consumed, causing inflammation linked to weight gain. But replacing animal products with plant-based foods like leafy greens, berries, and legumes can help promote weight loss and create a healthy gut microbiome.""

Hana Kahleova, MD, PhD, director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee and lead author of the study

This new research included 62 overweight adults who were randomized to a Mediterranean or a low-fat vegan diet for 16 weeks, separated by a four-week cleansing period, followed by an additional 16 weeks on the alternate diet.

Participants' dietary records were used to calculate dietary acid load, which is commonly estimated by two scores: Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) and Net Endogenous Acid Production (NEAP). A higher score indicates a higher dietary acid load.

Animal products including meat, fish, eggs, and cheese cause the body to produce more acid, increasing dietary acid load, which is linked to chronic inflammation that disrupts metabolism and can lead to increased body weight. Plant-based diets, which are more alkaline, are associated with weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower blood pressure.

In the new analysis, both PRAL and NEAP scores decreased significantly on the vegan diet, with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet. The reduction in dietary acid load was associated with weight loss, and this association remained significant even after adjustment for changes in energy intake. Body weight was reduced by 13.2 pounds on the vegan diet, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet.

The authors say that a vegan diet's alkalizing effect, which increases the body's pH level to make it less acidic, may also help promote weight loss. Top alkalizing foods include vegetables, particularly leafy greens, broccoli, beets, asparagus, garlic, carrots, and cabbage; fruits, such as berries, apples, cherries, apricots, or cantaloupe; legumes, for example lentils, chickpeas, peas, beans or soy; and grains, such as quinoa or millet.

Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.

Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. ""It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,"" she said.

In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. ""There's too much abuse in the system,"" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.

""That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,"" she said.

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.

Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid ""for people who rightly deserve"" coverage, ""not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.""

Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.

Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.

A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.

According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.

The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. ""That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,"" he said.

Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.

Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.

""We're making it easy"" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.

""We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,"" Carlton said. ""We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.""

Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.

""This is not a conversation America should be in,"" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. ""Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.""

The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)

But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.

Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.

The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.

But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.

""It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough"" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. ""Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.""

He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.

In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.

Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.

Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.

Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a ""modification"" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.

Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.

Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.

Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.

""Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,"" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. ""People struggle with the documentation process.""

Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.

Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. ""It will be messy,"" he said.

Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. ""People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study maps brain structure differences in individuals with psychopathic traits","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250626/Study-maps-brain-structure-differences-in-individuals-with-psychopathic-traits.aspx","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:33:00 GMT","

A new study published in the European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience has shed light on the brain structure differences associated with psychopathy - a condition known to be one of the strongest predictors of persistent violent behavior. Using advanced neuroimaging and the Julich-Brain Atlas, researchers from Forschungszentrum Jülich, RWTH Aachen University ,Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Georg August University, (Germany) and University of Pennsylvania (USA) have identified specific brain networks that appear to be structurally altered in individuals exhibiting psychopathic traits. The Atlas can be freely accessed via the EBRAINS Research Infrastructure. 

The study examined structural MRI data from 39 adult male participants diagnosed with psychopathy, compared with matched control subjects. Researchers assessed psychopathic traits using the Psychopathy Check-List (PCL-R), a well-established diagnostic tool that evaluates two key dimensions: interpersonal-affective traits (factor 1) and lifestyle-antisocial behaviour (factor 2). 

Results revealed that higher scores on factor 2 - related to antisocial tendencies - were linked to reduced volumes in multiple brain regions. These included subcortical areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain, as well as parts of the brainstem (pons), cerebellum, and cortical areas in the orbitofrontal and insular regions. These areas are known to play roles in emotion regulation, decision-making, impulse control, and social behaviour. 

In contrast, associations with factor 1 traits, such as pathological lying and lack of empathy, were weaker and more variable. Some volume differences were noted in the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral-frontal and left hippocampal areas, but the patterns were less consistent across individuals. 

Group comparisons also revealed a significant reduction in total brain volume in the psychopathy group, with the most notable localised difference in the right subiculum, a part of the hippocampus involved in memory. 

The study's authors highlight that the findings suggest a particularly strong neurobiological link between antisocial behaviour and reduced brain volume across widespread regions. 

The study advances research on the neuropsychobiological correlates of aggression, which will be intensively investigated in the next years at RWTH Aachen together with the universities in Heidelberg and Frankfurt, the Central Institute in Mannheim, as well as Forschungszentrum Jülich within the research initiative SFB TRR 379 (Neuropsychobiology of Aggression: A Transdiagnostic Approach in Mental Disorders.)

MATCH HUB | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW

USWNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (Including this match): Lavelle (111), Sonnett (109), Girma (47), Coffey (36), A. Thompson (20), Sentnor (10), Cooper (7), Patterson (5), Hutton (4), Reale (1), Dickey (1)

Notes: 

Today's starting lineup has an average of 31.9 caps, including this match. Today's starting lineup has four players with 7 or fewer caps.

Two players in the starting lineup will earn their first senior USWNT caps today: Claudia Dickey in goal and Lilly Reale at left back. They are the 278th and 279th players to earn a cap for the WNT.

Dickey and Reale are the 20th and 21st players to debut under Emma Hayes.

This venue – DICK'S Sporting Goods Park -- was the site of Emma Hayes' first-ever game at the helm of the USWNT, back on June 1, 2024 vs. South Korea, a 4-0 win.

This is the first time that Michelle Cooper (22), Ally Sentnor (21) and Alyssa Thompson (20) have started on the front line with each other for the senior National Team. They also started the final group stage game together in the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, a 3-1 loss to Japan; Lilly Reale also started that match for the USA.

Claudia Dickey, 25, earns her first USWNT cap at the senior level. Dickey is the 29th goalkeeper in USWNT history to earn a cap. The former college basketball player at UNC is having a fine season with Seattle Reign FC. Dickey was a goalkeeper on the U.S. team at the 2020 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship, which the USA proceeded to dominate, outscoring its opposition 44-1 en route to the title, but the FIFA U-20 WWC was cancelled that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She played four games in that tournament which were her four career U-20 caps.

Naomi Girma, 24, earns her third cap and makes her third start of 2025 after missing the USA's first three events of the year. At 24, and playing in just her 47th international game, she is already a veteran leader and considered one of the top defenders in the world. This is her 45th career start, and she started all 18 matches she played in 2024. While she has worn the captain's band in prior matches, this match will mark the second time she has been the U.S. captain from the start of the match and her second consecutive game captaining the squad.

Avery Patterson, 23, will earn her fifth cap and make her third start, after making her first appearance on April 5 vs. Brazil in Los Angeles when she came on at the end of the match. Patterson, who has three goals from the outside back this year for the Houston Dash, has been in the USA's Youth National Team program at the U-14, U-20 and U-23 levels.

Ally Sentnor, 21, hits double figures in caps with 10 and makes her fifth start. She has four goals and one assist in her first nine caps and leads the USA in goals so far this year. She recorded her first USWNT brace in the USA's most recent match, a 4-0 win over Jamaica on June 3.

Alyssa Thompson, 20, will make her fifth consecutive start, the most consecutive starts in her career, and earn her 20th cap. This will be just her ninth career start. Thompson had the assist on Trinity Rodman's goal against Brazil on April 5. It was her second career USWNT assist to go with one goal. She helped set up the USA's first goal against China PR on May 31 with a hard run into the box and scramble for the ball but was not credited with the assist.

Michelle Cooper, 22, earns her seventh cap and makes her third career start. She will be looking to add to her one career goal, scored against Australia in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, but she did earn her first career assist on May 31 vs. China PR.

Emily Sonnett starts in the center of the defense to earn her 109th career cap. She played full 90-minute games in both April matches vs. Brazil. She will be making her 57th start today, meaning she has started 52% of her career caps.

Claire Hutton, 19,will earn her fourth cap and make her fourth start. She got starts against Australia at the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and against Brazil on April 8, a match in which she went the full 90 minutes, and against Jamaica on June 3.

Rose Lavelle, 30, earns her first cap and makes her first start since Dec. 3, 2024, in the USA's final game of last year, a 2-1 win over the Netherlands. The World Cup and Olympic champion will earn her 111th cap and will be looking for her 25th career goal. Lavelle needs a combination of two goals or assists to become the 25th player in U.S. history with a combined 50 career goals and assists.

Sam Coffey, 26, earns her 36th career cap and makes her 27th career start. She started 19 games in 2024 after just two combined starts in 2022 (her debut year) and 2023. She scored her second career goal on May 31 vs. China PR on an excellent finish via an assist from Cataria Macario.

Lilly Reale, 21, earns her first cap and makes her first start. She attended the Futures Camp in January, the U-23 WNT training camp in LA in April and traveled with the U-23s to Germany during the last FIFA window, scoring the first goal in the USA's 2-1 win over Germany in the first game. She also played for the U.S. U-23s in 2023 and has four U-23 caps and one goal. Reale was a starter for the USA at the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and ended her U-20 international career with nine caps and one goal. She had four caps with the U.S. U-17s, but her U-17 cycle was basically cancelled by COVID-19.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (June 26, 2025) – The United States Women's National Team opened a three-match window with an assertive 4-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland in a match played on a warm night at altitude and in front of a packed house.

Goals from defender Avery Patterson, midfielder Sam Coffey, midfielder Rose Lavelle and forward Alyssa Thompson led the United States to its third consecutive win and clean sheet.

The starting XI featured five players with seven caps or fewer – Michelle Cooper, Patterson, Claire Hutton, Lilly Reale and Claudia Dickey. It also included four gold medalists from the 2024 Olympics – captain Naomi Girma, Lavelle, Emily Sonnett and Coffey. The USA's leading scorer so far this year, Ally Sentnor, and Thompson, who made her fifth consecutive start, rounded out the lineup for head coach Emma Hayes.

Playing in her first cap in more than six and a half months, Lavelle gave the crowd of 18,504 some excitement in just the third minute. Patterson, working with Cooper on the right flank, passed the ball centrally to Sentnor. The forward curled a beautiful ball over the top of Ireland's defense to Lavelle waiting on her toes on the backside. The World Cup winner delivered a low-driven shot that clanged off the post, but Lavelle was a few steps offside, and the sideline official raised the flag.

Bold chances from United States attackers forced Irish goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan to make two big saves in the first 10 minutes of action. First, Thompson received a long ball from Coffey and went 1v1 with the 'keeper, striking a low-driven shot with her right foot that Brosnan dove to block. Moments later, Hutton received Girma's pass after the center backdrifted high on the wing, then turned and ripped a shot from the right side of the box that resulted in another save.

Not long after, Lavelle was involved in the opening goal in the 18th minute. The U.S. went short on a corner kick, giving the ball to Lavelle. The midfielder cut from her left foot to her right to make space for a cross and lifted an excellent service into the box. Patterson rose for a header that Brosnan got a hand to but couldn't turn away and scored her first international goal. It was USA's second set piece goal in as many matches.

Just before the halftime break, the United States scored again. Coffey created the play, laying the ball off to teammates, but through her diligent run, quickly got it back from Thompson near the top of the box. The holding midfielder took it herself, taking a few dribbles then striking the ball low with her left foot into the lower right corner. The finish gave the USA a more comfortable 2-0 lead heading into the second 45 and Coffey her third international goal.

A strong sequence in the 53rd minute resulted in history for Lavelle, who scored her 25th career goal in her first game back since December after recovering from ankle surgery. The attack worked well together and moved the ball up the field with tempo. Hutton and Cooper combined to get the ball to Sentnor on the right wing and she crossed on the ground into the box for Lavelle who finished a no-doubter to extend the lead for the United States and become the 19th player in USWNT history with 25+ goals and 25+ assists.

A gorgeous golazo from Thompson in the 63rd minute produced the fourth goal of the night. The play started with a good effort from Reale to keep the ball inbounds down the left wing from the USA's defensive half. Thompson picked up the ball and raced down the sideline, skillfully pushing the ball around a defender and then racing in on goal. After getting close several times on the night, Thompson took her moment and smashed a curling strike off her right foot just inside the right post.

The pace of Thompson, Cooper and Sentnor, who started on the front line together for the first time for the full USWNT, put pressure on the Irish throughout the night. With Patterson pushing high on the wing and Lavelle finding good spaces, the United States created plenty of chances. The USWNT had the overwhelming advantage in shots (26), possession (68%) and corner kicks (7), holding the Irish to zero shots in the first 45 minutes and one attempt the whole match.

Ireland hardly tested Dickey in her debut in goal for the United States, though she had a chance to show her quality with a stop in the 61st minute. In one of their few moments of the night, the Irish served the ball into dangerous territory and Kyra Carusa's shot from close range was on target. The play ended up being called offside, but the 5-foot-10 goalkeeper made the big play, stopping a first-time shot from the six-yard box.

The United States nearly scored goal No. 5 after exercising some patience. The ball ended up with Olivia Moultrie, who entered the match as a second-half substitute in the 59th minute for Lavelle. One of the youngest players on the roster wasn't afraid to take a crack on goal from distance, and the 19-year-old's firm strike clanged off the crossbar and bounced downward, missing by inches in the match's waning moments.

Thursday's game was the first of three in a week for the USWNT. Next, the group heads to Cincinnati, Ohio for the second of back-to-back matches against Ireland on Sunday, June 29 at TQL Stadium. Then, it's a meeting with Concacaf rival Canada in the Allstate Continental Clásico on Wednesday, July 2 at Audi Field in Washington D.C. 

USA – AVERY PATTERSON (ROSE LAVELLE), 18th minute: After creating several chances in the opening minutes, the United States converted the first goal of the night off a set piece. Lavelle, receiving the short corner, sent a long cross into the box with her right foot. Avery Patterson rose above her defender to head the ball into the back of the net. USA 1, IRL 0

USA – SAM COFFEY (ALYSSA THOMPSON), 49th minute: Coffey started the play and finished it. After receiving a ball from Thompson, Coffey carried the ball forward on the dribble and finished a driving low shot to double the lead for the United States. USA 2, IRL 0

USA – ROSE LAVELLE (ALLY SENTNOR), 53rd minute: Looking to increase their tempo in the second half, the United States attack moved the ball quickly up the pitch and into their attacking third. The play landed at the feet of Sentnor, who served a right-footed cross into the box first time. Lavelle finished with her right foot to score her 25th career goal. USA 3, IRL 0

USA – ALYSSA THOMPSON (LILLY REALE), 63rd minute: Hustle from Reale to keep the ball in play led to an epic moment for Thompson, who scorched the pitch using her speed to carry the ball forward the length of the half. Just inside the 18-yard box, the attacker put the ball on her right foot and delivered a beautiful curling shot into the side netting for her second international goal. USA 4, IRL 0

In the past few years, women's sports have gained popularity. Now, the world's oldest sport is taking Colorado by storm. 

A new Nielsen Sports report shows that women's soccer is set to reach 800 million fans by 2030, which would make it the fifth largest sport in the world. 

In Denver, the National Women's Soccer League is set to begin playing in the 2026 season. On Thursday night, there was a glimpse of what that could look like as excitement erupted at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, as fans witnessed the best of the best in women's soccer take the pitch.

""I think it's really cool because whenever I watch these girls play, I'm like, 'Oh, they're going to win',"" said Lucy Brower, a young fan and soccer player.

While the U.S. Women's National Soccer team dominated 4-0 in Thursday night's international friendly against Ireland, it was more than just a game for glory for fans in attendance.

""The passion that the women have, the creativity, the non-robotic movements that the men don't have,"" said soccer fan Hutch Brower. ""I like to watch that.""

For young soccer players, watching the women's team excel on the pitch gives them inspiration.

""It kind of motivates me to want to be better so I can someday be like them,"" said Fan Maci Falk.

""To not only inspire young generations, but to also remind all of us who are more adult and aged, that we can all be women who support women, that we can all be people who support women,"" said Erika.

A visible fervor for women's soccer in the metro, the Denver NWSL President Jen Millet says, will soon translate into a permanent club presence in Colorado. 

 ""This is really where it started, where there was a group of fans, women's soccer fans in Colorado, that campaigned the NWSL to get a club here, and they succeeded,"" said Millet.

Millet says it was important to show up at Thursday's match to highlight that success and lend an ear to what fans want to see as the city inches closer to picking players for the new team and building up a new stadium for fans to come and watch next year.

""We talk a lot about women's sports being important for girls, but it is equally important for boys to see female athletes on the pitch competing at the highest level,"" said Millet.

While every spectator had a different player, they were excited to see that it is the love for the game that continues to bond this soccer fan base.

""I think it's really cool to see how much these women have bonded over the years, and how far women's sports has come,"" said Brower.

As for next year's NWSL team in Denver, Millet says they plan to unveil a team name and logo in the coming months.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Before the U.S. Women's National Team beat Ireland 4-0 in front of thousands of fans at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park Thursday night, Denver7 spoke with several girls' soccer players from the Denver metro area who were in attendance.

Sisters Luna, Milania and Aria Bernhardt and their friend, Avery Wilson, play soccer together and have big dreams. They say they hope to play on the USWNT someday after being inspired by Golden native and USWNT star Lindsey Heaps.

“She's a captain, and she's born in Colorado, and she grew up here, and she played for [club team Colorado] Rush, and I play for Rush,” said Wilson. “So she's kind of a really big role model.”

Denver7 spoke with several other young players inspired by the USWNT.

“I'm a full-time goalkeeper, and I hope to play in college and then maybe extend my career farther than that,” said Lucy Crandall from Arvada.

Friends and soccer players Maisie Tolle, Laine VanDyke and Emery Unruh also couldn't wait to get to the seats Thursday, arriving more than two hours early.

“They don't go to everywhere,” said VanDyke. “So it's really special that they're coming here, and I get the opportunity to watch them.”

“I love how they're like role models for younger kids,” said Keira Butler, a high school sophomore who also plays soccer. “And it's really fun to just watch them and imagine yourself out there.”

But now, fans won't have to wait for the USWNT to visit to watch women's soccer.

Denver7 has covered the city's National Women's Soccer League team starting play next year, and what it will mean when it comes to financing a new stadium and how local businesses are hopeful for a boost. But for these young players, the new team has already made a difference.

Butler said her family already has season tickets for the new squad.

“It can show young girls that they can be soccer players too, not just older men,” she said.

“I love that so much because I've been waiting for it for so long, and it's going to have more, even more people that we can actually connect with,” said Tolle.

All three Gotham FC call-ups made the USWNT Starting XI as Rose Lavelle returned to the lineup with a Player of the Match performance, and Lilly Reale earned her first cap.

It was a dream night for Rose Lavelle, who made her return to the US women's national team on Thursday in Commerce City, CO. The 30-year-old midfielder contributed a goal and assist in the USA's 4-0 win over Ireland in the first of three friendlies the USWNT will play over the international break. 

Defender Avery Patterson opened the scoring – with an assist from Lavelle – for her first international goal, followed shortly by a second goal from midfielder Sam Coffey. Lavelle scored the team's third goal in the 53rd minute, then Alyssa Thompson added a fourth 10 minutes later. 

Gotham FC's Lilly Reale made her USWNT debut, along with Claudia Dickey and Jordyn Bugg. Both Reale and Dickey were in the Starting XI, providing a glimpse of US women's head coach Emma Hayes's vision for a new US national team following the departure of several veteran players.

After nearly seven months out recovering from an ankle injury, Lavelle is officially back.

If her return to Gotham earlier this month wasn't convincing enough, last night's performance certainly was. In her 111th cap, the 30-year-old sent a right-footed assist to Patterson for a header into the net. She went on to score her 25th international goal after a straight-forward cross from Ally Sentnor met her right foot in a goal that gave the US a 3-0 lead.

""It feels really great,"" Lavelle said in a pre-match press conference. ""It was a long time away, which just made me miss it a lot. Really happy to be back with the girls, happy to be back in the environment."" 

Lavelle is the 19th player in USWNT history to attain more than 25 goals and 25 assists. She earned the Player of the Match title for her efforts last night, not only for her contribution to the scoreline, but for consistently moving the ball up the field in key moments to create scoring opportunities.

It's a moment of triumph for the Gotham midfielder as she continues to make her way back to regular play.  

There's something to be said about Hayes's vision for the USWNT squad. 

It's noticeably younger. The team's starting lineup against Ireland had an average age of just 23.8 years, with seven of the 11 players under the age of 25. That's in stark contrast to national teams of the past. The intent is clear: Hayes is molding a team from the ground up, prioritizing youth and long-term development rather than a reliance on established veterans.

Under Hayes, 17 players received USWNT call-ups for the first time. It's the most debuts in a new manager's first 20 games since Anson Dorrance in the late 1980s. 

""One thing about the US is that we always have young talented players coming up, and I think you're seeing that now,"" Lavelle said before the game. ""I think we have a lot of really, really exciting players. Even though we don't have the bigger names that we're used to, I still think we have a lot of talented younger players who can impact the game the second they step on the field.""

The goal is to create a pool of players capable of winning the 2027 World Cup by October. Hayes believes the team has ""a lot of catching up to do"" against the top players in the world with Champions League and Nations League experience. The introduction of the U-23 program was one of the ways Hayes is closing the gap. Another is having her younger players continuously face high-level opponents to ""determine if [they] are world-class."" 

""I don't believe in perfection,"" Hayes said press conference prior to last night's friendly. ""I think you can chase something like that knowing that rarely if ever it comes. What I do believe in is development. I know as a developer of people, there is not a quick route to it.""

Hayes's experiment paid off in last night's win, but only time will tell if her youthful squad can sustain their momentum.

Lavelle, Reale, and defender Emily Sonnett started for the team in last night's game. Reale joined Bugg, Dickey, Izzy Rodriguez, Sam Meza, and Angelina Anderson in earning their first caps. The 21-year-old made her debut with a position in the starting lineup as a left-back, notching her first international goal contribution by providing an assist to Alyssa Thompson with a pass up the left flank.

Sonnett made her 57th international start out of 109 caps, playing as a defensive center for all 90 minutes, while Lavelle made her first start since December 2024. Sonnett and Lavelle were one of three players older than 25 in the starting lineup, bringing World Cup and Olympic experience to a team with an average of 31.9 caps. 

""I have been one of the more experienced players now for a little bit,"" Lavelle said before the game. ""I feel like I've obviously been in that position before where I was the newer, inexperienced player. I always say I had a lot of really really great older players to look up to to help usher me into the position where I now can be that for the younger players.""

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, Jeff Carlisle explains Mauricio Pochettino's reaction to the USMNT's high-profile Gold Cup absentees. (1:56)

There were undoubtedly some close calls in the group stage, but the U.S. men's national team have so far gotten the job done in the Gold Cup. Winning their group with a perfect three wins from three matches against Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti, head coach Mauricio Pochettino and his title contenders have picked up momentum and avoided a disastrous early exit in the competition.

Preparing for Sunday's quarterfinal against Costa Rica in Minneapolis and still in the race for an eighth title as they've managed sweltering temperatures, there's one scorching hot talking point that has yet to be doused in American soccer circles: Where are the Americans' best players?

For a variety of reasons ranging from injuries, rest and Club World Cup duty, the USMNT are currently without a long list of marquee names, which includes Sergiño Dest, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic.

Because the Gold Cup is played every other year, it's not out of the ordinary to have alternate squads like the one the U.S. is fielding this summer, but one year out from the FIFA World Cup, it's fair to ask if this will hurt the ongoing evolution of the national team under Pochettino. Especially considering how infrequently these big names have suited up alongside each other since last year.

""You never know six months from now what players are available, who's hurt, who's playing at their club ... I don't think that [time] is as important as most people may think. I think that you can put the team together at the end,"" Tab Ramos, who has played for the USMNT and coached within the national team structure, said to ESPN.

""[But] we're likely going to go into the World Cup, not really with Pochettino, not really understanding 100 percent what his roster can do because he hasn't been able to utilize the roster in different situations.""

Dest, Robinson, McKennie, Pulisic and Tyler Adams (who is on the Gold Cup roster), have not all been on the field at the same time since a Concacaf Nations League final win over Mexico in March 2024. Under Pochettino, they've also played sparingly, with Pulisic being the sole member of the aforementioned quintet to earn more than 350 minutes under the coach since he was hired last September.

Digging deeper, it's easy to begin to feel worried when you find more examples. Fullbacks Robinson and Dest have not shared the field in the past year, and during the same time frame, midfielders Adams and McKennie have played just 294 minutes together.

Will this lack of familiarity harm the team on the world's biggest stage in one year? Ramos is unsure.

""We are obviously giving ourselves less of a chance. There's no question,"" he said. ""When you don't have the team together, you give yourself less of a chance to be successful because you don't know the reaction as a head coach. You don't understand the reaction of players and of different combinations at a certain game against a certain opponent. That's where you're going to be missing.""

The reality is those lessened chances could be the difference between winning or losing a knockout game. Given the USMNT's record in such matches -- just one knockout game victory in its entire World Cup history, spanning 10 tournaments -- that is a factor that has to be considered, although Ramos still feels it's more about the form of the players.

""In terms of having the team together, it's really who's going to be playing great by May of next year,"" he said. ""That really matters.""

Looking at the summer roster, defender Mark McKenzie didn't show any signs of worry when asked if there's enough time to find cohesion before the World Cup.

""Chemistry is a relative thing. I think when you come into camp, I think we're all understanding of a goal we have in mind. Each camp we get into, there's an opportunity to continue to build on that,"" he said to media during the Gold Cup group stage. ""That doesn't matter whether it's now, whether it's in a couple months, and each match will have its own challenges.""

Hugo Perez, a former USMNT midfielder who coached players such as Pulisic, McKennie and Adams during their youth national team days, also didn't sound the alarm.

""Pochettino knows what the nucleus of players are ... it's good for Pochettino to see if the [Gold Cup] players from the MLS ... [are] at that level,"" the former El Salvador manager said to ESPN. ""You miss [the stars] being here and maybe being with the group, but I don't see that as a big deal in the end.""

When chatting with Perez, it became clear that he was more preoccupied with finding a way to get the best out of the U.S.'s top players through a more varied tactical approach, and not about needing an extended period to jell together.

""I still believe that the U.S. is lacking an identity in a style of play where they're going to have to mix it [up],"" he said. ""We know we run, we know we attack by the flanks, but I still think that they can improve on short spaces, maintaining more of the ball and then, boom, explode the big space. I think we need to add that kind of play in order to compete.

""I know these players: I coached them when they were 14 and 15. They're capable of playing that type of soccer, but again, the coach has to make that decision. That's, for me, more important than having them every time come to FIFA [international] dates.""

However, those opportunities have been limited.

In the past 12 months, the U.S. has played only nine competitive matches. In that same time frame, South American champions Argentina and European champions Spain each has played 14.

With no qualifiers on the schedule for next year's World Cup given the U.S.'s status as co-hosts, the chance to test and analyze a larger sample size just hasn't been the same. And in the few high-pressure situations the Americans have played in, things have been bleak: a group stage exit in the 2024 Copa América and a fourth-place finish in the Concacaf Nations League.

""Developing the chemistry on the field is really, I think, the need,"" Ramos said. ""In order to develop that, you need to have some games where you struggle together and see how you get out of it.

""And I think if you look at some of the -- I don't want to say failures because they haven't been failures, but if you look at the times where we haven't been as successful with this team because the expectations have been so high, we have not passed a lot of tests in which situations got difficult. That's a little bit of a concern for me.""

Does that concern also extend to some players seeming to prioritize their club careers abroad? When considering the high level of intensity of the European game, is there something to be said about scrutinizing players' balance of club vs. country?

Perez doesn't believe so. He also doesn't believe that it halts any sort of on-field chemistry.

""These kids are playing in very competitive leagues, and when you play in leagues like the English Premier League, Serie A, in France, you are surrounded in your team by some of the best players in the world,"" he said. ""Second, when you're surrounded by those players who are some of the best players in the world in your club, that's helping you to grow as a player individually.

""When they come here, we have to be honest also. I mean, these kids have played together before ... they know each other. I mean, they're in contact with each other in Europe. I don't think that's the issue.""

For Ramos, there's enough time to develop a good team, but with the caveat that there will be a ""disadvantage of knowing less"" due to not having enough answers from in-game tests. As for Perez, he also believes there's ample time, especially if there's a lengthy summer camp next year, but stated that the true test lies in Pochettino's ability to still get the best of his stars.

""[That's] the most difficult work that a coach has,"" Perez said.

Even with an alternate roster, things are looking promising for the USMNT at the Gold Cup. Following some wake-up calls and a four-game losing streak ahead of the tournament, they've since avoided a nightmare scenario in the group stage and qualified for the knockout rounds.

Whether the competition helps answer some questions regarding roster depth, or highlights a need to continue relying on familiar faces, the countdown to the World Cup will truly begin in September with just five FIFA windows between then and next June. That will be the only time Pochettino has to make final adjustments through friendly matches.

Is that enough runway to reintegrate the U.S.'s biggest stars? With each passing month, we'll get a clearer idea of whether the USMNT are in fact ready for 2026.

""I think there's plenty of time before the World Cup, there's plenty of games,"" said Brenden Aaronson, who is part of the Gold Cup squad. ""I think the thing that people don't really understand: Yeah, it's friendlies that are coming up, but friendlies still, you treat them like they're international games. They're going to be really good games and it's not like something we're [just] going to walk in there. We want to win these games.

""We're going to treat them like World Cup games.""

If Aaronson & Co. are going to be ready for the World Cup in less than 12 months, they'll have to.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Next up for the U.S. men's national team is a CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinals clash against Costa Rica on Sunday (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

To recap their group stage. A 5-0 drubbing of Trinidad & Tobago, followed by 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia (an invited team to the tournament) and then an entertaining 2-1 victory over Haiti.

Those aren't the biggest brand-name wins, but that's okay. The way the U.S. entered the tournament amid drama of which players are here (and who isn't), any positive momentum for coach Mauricio Pochettino and his crew was welcome.

So, which players have made the most of it with the 2026 World Cup next summer? Can the U.S. finish this Gold Cup as winners?

Here's what stood out from the group stage of the Gold Cup and what's for this weekend's quarterfinals. 

Which USMNT player has made the best case for a World Cup spot?

McIntyre: Malik Tillman, without a doubt. Three years after almost making the 2022 World Cup roster as a 20-year-old, Tillman began 2025 as a coin flip for next summer. But with three goals in three games at this Gold Cup, he's staking a claim for a starting spot at main event — even when regulars like Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah return. The silky attacker seems well-suited to occupy a central playmaking role between Pulisic and Weah — the job Gio Reyna has at times filled for the U.S. Tillman's emergence this month is more bad news for Reyna, who didn't play in either of Borussia Dortmund's first two matches at the FIFA Club World Cup. But it's great for Tillman and the USMNT.

Litman: Outside of Tillman, I would say Sebastian Berhalter has raised his profile. He was especially noticeable against Saudi Arabia, where he won most of his one-on-one battles and stood up for Tyler Adams when he was pushed to the ground. Berhalter has been extra impressive when it comes to set pieces, too, offering a perfect ball on Chris Richards' goal in that same match. Set pieces have been a thorn in the USMNT's side. In the past, Christian Pulisic has taken them – the overall service was suboptimal and the Americans didn't capitalize enough. Berhalter, meanwhile, offers this critical skill set that will be important for Mauricio Pochettino to take into consideration when he's mulling over roster selection for the 2026 World Cup. 

Who has been the biggest surprise at this Gold Cup?

McIntyre: It has to be Panama's Ismael Diaz. Díaz scored five goals in the group stage, leapfrogging Tillman and into the top spot in the Golden Boot race with his hat trick against Jamaica on Tuesday. I know he also scored a hat trick in the 2023 Gold Cup, but his production so far is still a surprise.

Litman: It was surprising to see Jamaica eliminated in the group stage. The Reggae Boyz went 1-2 in the group stage to skid to a third-place finish in Group C. They were surprisingly upset by Guatemala 1-0 in their first match (after beating that same squad 3-0 the week prior) and were crushed by Panama 4-1 in the third match to seal their fate. 

Mexico and Canada: What has stood out from the biggest rivals?

McIntyre: I don't think either has looked invincible, or even all that good, at this Gold Cup. El Tri struggled to beat the Dominican Republic and settled for a scoreless tie with a banged up and shorthanded Costa Rican side (though add my name to the list of people who think Santi Gimenez's late golazo should've counted). 

Meantime, Les Rouges have been wholly unconvincing since their tourney-opening thumping of Honduras. Canada couldn't beat Curaçao in their second match, and they couldn't score in Tuesday's group finale until El Salvador had been reduced to nine men. They're also missing their best player in captain Alphonso Davies — and maybe some swagger because of it. 

Litman: I'll take Canada. From the controversy around manager Jesse Marsch which resulted in a two-game suspension, to the team tying Curaçao and only beating El Salvador 2-0 when they were down two men doesn't give good feelings that this is a team who has what it takes to win it all. If they're not careful, Canada could be ousted by Guatemala in the quarters this weekend.

True or False: Will the U.S. win the Gold Cup?

McIntyre: False. I think the U.S gets past Los Ticos and advances to Wednesday's semifinal against either Canada or Guatemala. Beating Canada won't be easy, though not impossible, assuming they prevail as expected. But beating Canada and then either Panama or especially Mexico, who'd take the field for the finale in front of a sea of green shirts in Houston on July 6, might be a little bit beyond a U.S. squad that is missing more than a dozen of its top players. Can it happen? Sure. It did in 2021. This group, like that one, is tight off the field and has been building momentum on it. If they play their hearts out, play together and get a bounce or two, they can win this thing. I just wouldn't bet on it. Litman: True. The USMNT should beat Costa Rica in the quarterfinal and advance to the semi, where it would face the winner of Canada-Guatemala. If it's Canada, the U.S. has an opportunity for Nations League revenge. And if this motley crew of an American squad can come together and do that, they would have the momentum to potentially take on a quality Mexico squad in the final. Playing El Tri in front of what would likely be a pro-Mexico crowd in Houston will be challenging, but that's the kind of test the team needs a year before the World Cup. Plus, wouldn't it be quite the story if the USMNT came together after all the pre-tournament drama and raised the Gold Cup trophy?

U.S. men's national team icon and former goalkeeper Tim Howard picked three players from the Gold Cup group stage that have stood out the most to him this summer for the Stars and Stripes.

The USMNT bounced back from two frustrating losses to Türkiye and Switzerland in friendly action by dispatching all three teams they faced in the Gold Cup group stage. Victories against Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti have the vibes somewhat restored as a young group chases silverware this summer.

Without big names like Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and more, multiple players have the opportunity to announce themselves not only to their coach but to fans across the country. 

Sports Illustrated talked with Howard ahead of the USMNT's quarterfinal game against Costa Rica highlighting which players stood out in Mauricio Pochettino's team.

“Malik was really good. Diego Luna is going to be a cult hero. He's so fun and good to watch, but my top three are Tillman, [Patrick] Agyemang and Chris Richards,"" Howard told SI. ""Tillman because when you get the goals, and you're dangerous, you have to be top. Agyemang, for me, he's the best fit No. 9 we have. He's showing that, while he frustrates people in glimpses, he also shows that he's a handful. Defenders don't like playing against him. He creates chances for himself and others. He's only at the start of his potential and he's starting to find that.

“With Richards, he's not a new name. He's been playing at [Crystal] Palace, his expectation is that every week he's on the team sheet. He mentioned before the tournament that he wants to be the guy. I like when players put that pressure on their shoulders.”

Tillman scored four goals in the group stage while Richards scored the pivotal goal against Saudi Arabia. Agyemang was also on the scoresheet against Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti.

Howard also praised the team overall given perceptions of the tournament and quality of opponent in their first three games.

“I think they had to navigate some tricky games. It's super hard when it's hot, sticky and a team puts 11 behind the ball. They don't value possession and [opponents] are like ‘You have it, try and break us down.' On the surface, you and me with our remote controls are like, ‘C'mon, score the goal!' But it's really difficult to do that and I think they managed the situations very well. They have an opportunity where the games are going to open up, they're going to be tested more, there will be more space and I feel good about the team,” Howard told Sports Illustrated.

The USMNT continue their Gold Cup run against Costa Rica on Sunday, June 29. A win would see them play the winner of Canada vs. Guatemala.

The United States struggled in friendlies but went on to win all three of its Gold Cup group games. On Sunday against Costa Rica, they face their biggest test yet.

For as much as the Gold Cup gets denigrated, it's a much tougher tournament than it might appear. The ongoing tournament is the 11th edition in the last two decades, and this year's US are just the 10th team to make it through three group matches unscathed (Panama became the 11th on Tuesday).

US manager Mauricio Pochettino has to be pleased with his team's performance. After rough showings in the pre-tournament friendly matches, a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago was cathartic, while a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia and a 2-1 victory against Haiti also showed that the US are trying to make winning a habit as their manager has asked.

If Pochettino took lessons from those exhibitions and applied them to the tournament, it stands to reason that he'll take the learnings from the group stage and put them toward what the US hopes will be three knockout contests.

Here are four things we learned from the USMNT in the group stage:

The days ahead of the tournament began were filled with worry about the fact that Christian Pulisic would not be part of the competition, opting for summer rest rather than trying to win what would be his first career Gold Cup title (a decision that caused no shortage of drama and discourse).

There is no doubt the US would be a better team with Pulisic, and when he wants to come back into the team, he'll likely go straight back into the XI barring a real showdown with manager Mauricio Pochettino. But in the group stage, the US has shown that it has players in the pool who can provide an attacking spark.

Malik Tillman is most notable among them, scoring three goals in the group stage including a pair against Trinidad and Tobago and the opener against Haiti. Consistently dangerous and also hard-working, Tillman has been the breakout star of the tournament, putting the form he has often displayed with PSV on the field with the national team.

“What a player, no? What a player that is showing in this camp his talent and (ability),” Pochettino said.

Indeed. It's not just Tillman, a Bayern Munich product who reportedly is drawing interest for a Bundesliga return, who is bolstering the US. Diego Luna continues to inject energy and try to create chances when he's on the field, and Quinn Sullivan certainly isn't afraid to try a few things – notably going for a rabona against Haiti but also putting a number of shots on target and linking up well with Tillman and the other attackers when he's on the field.

While Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte had to pull out with injuries, Pochettino's top two goalkeepers remained in camp and look to be in open competition for the starting spot going forward. Or maybe the newer of those faces, NYCFC shot-stopper Matt Freese, is ahead for now.

Freese started the first friendly of the summer against Turkey, while previous US No 1 Matt Turner played the friendly match against Switzerland that saw the Americans concede four goals in the first half.

While it seems the competition is somewhat cut-throat, Pochettino laughed off the idea that Freese conceding on an error against Haiti would lead to some sort of conversation between the manager and the goalkeeper.

“Remember, the most important action is the next one. If you're thinking about the last one, you're dead. You're going to make another mistake,” Pochettino said. “This type of accident happens and it'll happen in the future, but we're so happy with him and the quality of our keepers, of course, the way they're supporting each other.”

For his part, Freese said he immediately put the error out of his mind and focused on not allowing another goal. “You have to move on very quickly, so, thankfully, the guys we all support each other in the bad moments and in the good moments,” he said.

We'll see where the coaching staff's thoughts are when the starting lineup comes out against Costa Rica, a team with no goalkeeping battle thanks to anchor Keylor Navas.

The US came into the summer hoping they would enjoy the returns of right back Sergiño Dest, left back Antonee Robinson and striker Folarin Balogun. Instead, all three are missing the tournament because of injuries.

Though striker Patrick Agyemang has scored twice in the group stage, the balance of his play has yet to convince that he's polished enough at this point in his career to be a consistent option up top. The US needs Balogun and Ricardo Pepi fit and ready to go at the 2026 World Cup. Otherwise, the may find themselves in a situation like 2022, with no great goal-scoring options in a knockout game.

A similar dynamic exists among the wide defenders. While Alex Freeman has been a pleasant surprise as a serviceable option at right back, both of Robinson's replacements – Max Arften and John Tolkin – have had a few adventures, and it's clear Robinson is the best American left back by a wide margin.

While the US has looked great through three group games, their chief Concacaf rivals haven't.

Mexico managed just a draw with Costa Rica, and while they still have far more of their key contributors than the US does, they've struggled to score from open play, even struggling a bit against the Dominican Republic in the opener. Their Gold Cup has seen them relying on set pieces and a defense that is stingy with center back Johan Vázquez back and partnering César Montes once again, allowing Edson Álvarez to break things up in midfield. Canada struggled, and eventually drew, with Curaçao.

The US will have no such margin for error now. It wouldn't be out of the question for a team with as much experience and talent as Costa Rica to relish being a stumbling block on the US's road to redemption after the last-place Nations League Final Four finish and the miserable friendlies. A great day from Navas (and perhaps a goal from Alonso Martínez) are both within the realm of possibility.

It was a strong start, but the finish will matter much more, not just for this Gold Cup, but for momentum heading into the big show next year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

It's Take Two for Mauricio Pochettino in tournament knockout rounds for the United States men's national team when the Yanks face Costa Rica in a 2025 Gold Cup quarterfinal in Minneapolis on Sunday.

Pochettino led the Yanks to the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals before they bowed out earlier this year, and he's engineered a near-perfect group stage at the Gold Cup.

The USMNT have won all three of their matches, conceding a single goal to win Group D and set up a showdown with Costa Rica.

Los Ticos were hard-luck runners-up in Group A, beating Dominican Republic and Suriname but drawing Mexico to finish behind El Tri on a single goal in goal differential.

Led by former Mexico manager Miguel Herrera, Costa Rica should prove the toughest test of the tournament so far for the Yanks after Pochettino oversaw wins over Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti.

It's been a breakout tournament for Malik Tillman, and the USMNT's midfield is deep and strong even without several key names. Tyler Adams, Johnny Cardoso, and Luca de la Torre are among the players who will patrol the middle of the park. Tim Ream and Chris Richards have proven solid at the back, though Pochettino has to choose his man behind them. Matt Freese had been good but made a bad error on the lone concession of the tournament.

Los Ticos are a threat with 23-year-old Spartak Moscow star Manfred Ugalde leading the line, and he scored three goals in the group stage after leading the Russian top flight in goals this season. Young Rio Ave midfielder Brandon Aguilera has also been excellent on this stage, and Westerlo 20-year-old Josimer Alcocer has bagged a pair of goals. Questions were raised off three conceded goals to Suriname and another one to the Dominican Republic, but a nil-nil over 90 minutes against Mexico shows that Keylor Navas and his back line are no slouches.

The Yanks are due for a scare, and Costa Rica are their toughest foe since the friendly losses to Turkiye and Switzerland. Keylor Navas was solid in a 0-0 draw against Mexico, but Los Ticos back line is not what it's been in the past. Costa Rica's Manfred Ugalde is a player but the U.S. has the most dangerous playmaker in Malik Tillman. Herrera's tournament nous is a wild card here, but Pochettino has looked more and more comfortable with both his Best XI and this tournament. Should the USMNT be on upset alert? Only if they are not alert. The Yanks have shown entitlement in the past but seem to have been properly awakened by the chastening loss to Switzerland. Ultimately, the USMNT depth in midfield and relative strength at center back — speaking in CONCACAF terms — should be enough for a place in the semifinal round. USMNT 2-1 Costa Rica.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham (left) and Manchester City's Erling Haaland could still get their hands on the Club World Cup trophy

Fifa's expanded Club World Cup in the United States has reached the end of its group phase, with two weeks of knockout matches to come.

Having risen from seven teams to 32, the competition has received criticism over player welfare concerns with matches played in extreme temperatures, often with poor attendances.

Critics say the Club World Cup is purely there to boost Fifa's finances, while football's governing body argues the event is needed to build up to next summer's five-week World Cup, which will feature 48 nations and be held in 16 cities across Canada, the US and Mexico.

This has been a competition of massive contrasts. From hugely one-sided thrashings, such as Bayern Munich setting a new tournament record when they crushed New Zealand part-timers Auckland City 10-0, to thrilling matches, including 4-4 and 4-3 scorelines.

We have taken a look at five talking points so far.

Bayern Munich's Sacha Boey tries to cool down during a match against Benfica

Ever since the tournament expansion was announced, there have been major concerns over the workload of the players, especially with the World Cup coming up in 12 months.

Since the main European seasons began in August, Real Madrid have now played 65 times, Inter Milan 62, Paris St-Germain 61 and both Chelsea and Manchester City 60 apiece, with four more games to come if they reach the final.

What has made it worse is the temperatures the matches are being held in. Temperatures reached 36C during the game between Bayern Munich and Benfica in Charlotte, North Carolina, while Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said it was ""impossible"" to organise normal training sessions amid a ""code red"" severe heat warning in Philadelphia.

Cooling breaks have been used with players dashing to get some shade, often while wearing an ice-cold towel or throwing bottles of water over their heads in an attempt to cool down.

The threat of thunderstorms has caused lengthy delays to five matches because play in American stadiums has to be halted when lightning is recorded within a 10-mile radius.

With three venues in Mexico, as well as cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Miami hosting matches in the 2026 World Cup, weather delays could well be a feature of that tournament as well.

The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California hosted the 1994 World Cup final and has registered the highest attendance so far in this year's Club World Cup

There have been crowds of more than 40,000 at 18 of the 48 group games with numerous superb atmospheres.

The highest attendance so far has been the 80,619 that watched European champions Paris St-Germain thrash Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

Top 10 attendances of the Club World Cup

80,619 - Paris St-Germain 4-0 Atletico Madrid (15 June, Pasadena)

70,248 - Real Madrid 3-1 Pachuca (22 June, Charlotte)

64,811 - Red Bull Salzburg 0-3 Real Madrid (26 June, Philadelphia)

63,587 - Bayern Munich 2-1 Boca Juniors (20 June, Miami)

62,415 - Real Madrid 1-1 Al-Hilal (18 June, Miami)

60,927 - Al Ahly 0-0 Inter Miami (14 June, Miami)

55,574 - Boca Juniors 2-2 Benfica (16 June, Miami)

54,619 - Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea (20 June, Philadelphia)

However, many games have not sold as well, with nearly 50,000 seats left unfilled for Chelsea's opener against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta.

Eight of the 10 lowest attendances have come from matches played between Monday and Friday and six of those 10 started between midday and 3pm local time with Fifa struggling to balance the local demand for tickets, tournament prices and scheduling matches to satisfy the lucrative television markets in Europe and Asia. 

Worst 10 attendances of the Club World Cup

3,412 - Ulsan HD 0-1 Mamelodi Sundowns (17 June, Orlando)

Jude Bellingham on Club World Cup pitches

PSG manager Luis Enrique has been among those criticising the playing surfaces, saying Fifa needs to ""bear in mind"" the quality of both match and training pitches if it wants the Club World Cup to be ""the most high-level competition in the world"".

""I wouldn't imagine an NBA court full of holes,"" the 55-year-old said after his side beat Seattle Sounders 2-0.

""What I really care about is the state of the field of play. The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.""

Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham also found fault with the pitch following his team's 3-1 victory over Pachuca.

""The pitches aren't great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,"" said the England midfielder. ""It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year.""

There have been 144 goals scored in 48 games, an average of three per match

In short, very seriously. But then that is understandable considering there is a £775m prize pot, which will be split between the 32 teams, with the winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round they reach. A win in the group stage earns them £1.5m, a draw £800,000, while they get an additional £5.8m for reaching the last 16, another £10.1m for getting to the quarter-finals, £16.2m for making the semi-finals, £23.2m for being in the final and £30m for winning the whole thing.

Manchester City were the only team to win all three of their group matches, beating Moroccan side Wydad AC 2-0, Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates 6-0 and then Italy's Juventus 5-2 on Thursday.

Man City put five past Juventus in Club World Cup

Inter Miami are the last side left in from the host nation and Lionel Messi will be up against his former team Paris St-Germain in one of the standout matches of the last 16

Before the tournament started, football data specialists Opta said the 11 most likely teams to win the trophy were all from Europe.

However, three of the continent's 12 sides have gone out in the opening phase with Porto, Atletico Madrid and Red Bull Salzburg all exiting after finishing third in their respective groups.

There were six sides from South America and while both of those from Argentina have been eliminated, all four from Brazil have made it through with Palmeiras taking on Botafogo in a last-16 tie.

Two of the five teams from North America - Inter Miami and Mexico's Monterrey - are still going, while Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal, who play Manchester City in the first knockout round, are the only Asian side left in.

All four African teams failed to make it out of their groups, as did Oceania's only representative Auckland City, although the part-timers did gain a memorable 1-1 draw with Boca Juniors of Argentina.

Last 16 fixtures (all times BST)

Sat, 28 June 17:00 - Palmeiras (Brazil) v Botafogo (Brazil)

Sat, 28 June 21:00 - Benfica (Portugal) v Chelsea (England)

Sun, 29 June 17:00 - Paris St-Germain (France) v Inter Miami (United States)

Sun, 29 June 21:00 - Flamengo (Brazil) v Bayern Munich (Germany)

Mon 30 June 20:00 - Inter Milan (Italy) v Fluminense (Brazil)

Tue 1 July 20:00 - Real Madrid (Spain) v Juventus (Italy)

Wed 2 July 02:00 - Borussia Dortmund (Germany) v Monterrey (Mexico)

The quarter-finals will be played across 4 and 5 July, the semi-finals on 8 and 9 July, with the final taking place on 13 July.

At the conclusion of the group stages, there's a five-way tie in the race to become the tournament's top scorer.

Bayern Munich duo Michael Olise and Jamal Muisala both have three goals, with the latter scoring a hat-trick in the German side's 10-0 win against Auckland on the opening day of the tournament.

Former Manchester United winger Angel Di Maria, 37, scored twice for Benfica in a 6-0 win against the Kiwis, as well as another in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors. 

Juventus playmaker Kenan Yildiz, 20, has been the standout performer so far for the Italians, scoring three times in his three appearances in the United States.

Al Ahly forward Wessam Abou Ali is the surprise inclusion in the race, with the 26-year-old netting a hat-trick in his side's 4-4 draw with Porto in the final group stage but with his side eliminated, the striker will be unable to add to his tally.

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, James Olley shares his frustrations with the Club World Cup tournament as it currently exists. (1:41)

We've reached the knockout rounds of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, and the tournament has given us so much to talk about, celebrate and criticize since Inter Miami and Al Ahly battled to a 0-0 draw at Hard Rock Stadium. We've had shocks, surprises and stunning scorelines; we've also had difficult weather, uneven attendance and some lackluster pitches, too.

So, with the knockout rounds set to start Saturday in Philadelphia when Palmeiras take on Botafogo, we asked our Club World Cup reporters for their thoughts on the good, bad and ugly of the 2025 tournament so far, as well as their picks for who will win it all at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

Rob Dawson: Better. The attendance has been good, for the most part, and there's been enough intrigue around the games to keep it interesting. It would have been bad for the tournament if the UEFA clubs had blitzed everyone else. The South American teams and their fans have made it a spectacle.

It was obviously never going to compare to a World Cup, but there has at least been a flavor of it. It's also important to remember that this is the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup: Attitudes might be very different in eight years.

Gab Marcotti: It was so tough to know what to expect partly because it's a new tournament, and partly because of the rushed way it was organized. But the football itself has been reasonably good. We've learned that there isn't some sort of huge gulf between Europe (and South America) and the rest of the world, despite the massive imbalance in resources. Other than Auckland City (but they made up for it in the third game), the only team to really get blown out were Atletico Madrid.

Fans of African and South American teams brought a ton of color and proper tifo, so their games, at least the ones I attended, felt very much like ""real"" games. Maybe my expectations weren't very high, but I think they showed it's a viable competition.

Mark Ogden: It has been better, because the South American teams have shown up and jolted some of the European heavyweights out of their complacency (and, perhaps, arrogance) in thinking that they could coast through the competition and bank the huge prize money for reaching the latter stages. That may still happen and we might end up with a Champions League quartet in the semifinals, but Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and River Plate have all risen to the occasion -- so did South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns -- and it's made this competition feel like a genuinely global event.

But we can't escape the fact that attendance has been worse than anticipated. FIFA president Gianni Infantino should take the blame for that because he has driven the whole tournament, from the match scheduling, the venues, even the teams that have taken part (hello, Inter Miami). Had more games been staged at smaller MLS venues rather than huge NFL stadiums, the games might just have been played to a full house, making for a better spectacle.

Lizzy Becherano: The Club World Cup has slowly exceeded my expectations on and off the field. Prior to June 14, concerns about the level of football and lack of support dominated the narrative. Now, after witnessing Boca Juniors supporters at Hard Rock Stadium and Inter Miami's shocking victory over FC Porto, this feels like an actual competition. Botafogo triumphing against Paris Saint-Germain or CF Monterrey holding Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw allowed spectators to believe each team showed up to this tournament wanting to prove their worth and the value of each league. This isn't the pre-season tournament or Europe-dominated competition many anticipated.

Though FIFA can continue to improve certain aspects of the Club World Cup, maybe considering a different point in the year to avoid player exhaustion and weather concerns, this first edition proved international interest for these matchups.

Alex Kirkland: Better. Yes, there have been lots of predictable negatives, notably the impact of the heat and afternoon kickoff times on players' performance, and the fan experience. But a lot of the games have been really fun to watch, and the sight of Brazilian, Argentinian and Mexican sides going up against -- and often competing with -- European teams has been refreshing. It's the first edition of this tournament in this format, and given that, it's gone about as well as could reasonably be expected. And it should get even better in the knockout stages, with more at stake.

Paulo Cobos, ESPN Brazil: Worse. South Americans, especially Brazilians, have reason to celebrate. But the fact is that the technical level of play has been nothing special, many stadiums are worryingly empty, and the suffocating heat has been a serious problem.

James Olley: Elements of it have surprised me, but overall the tournament has been more or less what I expected: mixed attendance figures, complaints about the heat and the pitches, tired European players, and a lukewarm domestic reception. The positives have largely come from the South American sides injecting a real sense of passion and determination -- both on the field in wanting to rival the Europeans, but also off the pitch, where large traveling supporters have made the host cities feel like they do during a major international tournament: an exciting blend of colors and cultures.

The tournament was always too big at 32 teams, but there have still been moments that will live in the memory, perhaps creating continental rivalries that can give the Club World Cup a proper heritage in time. What has surprised me, though, is the lack of exposure in some cities. It varies, but in many cases, marketing of the tournament is minimal and finding the games on in a bar isn't as straightforward as it should be.

Craig Burley explains why you can't use the Club World Cup to determine which sides are stronger than others.

Ricardo Carino, ESPN Mexico: It's been 100 percent better. Logic doesn't exist in this tournament. The strongest teams have been surprised by the smaller clubs, and this has caused some of the favorites to return home early. It's a fact that European teams are on the right track, but their stars and their million-dollar salaries haven't been fully reflected on the pitch, nor in some of the results we've seen these past few days.

Dawson: I think Thembinkosi Lorch has impressed for Wydad AC. The 31-year-old South African forward caught the eye in his first game against Manchester City and gave Pep Guardiola's young back four a number of nervous moments. On a different day he might have scored twice as Wydad gave City's problems on the break in the middle of the first half.

Lorch did find the net in the second game against Juventus, although Wydad were eventually beaten 4-1 to seal an early exit from the tournament. Lorch, though, can be happy that he made the most of his time in the spotlight.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Marcotti: Don't know about the best, because the stupid way TV rights were assigned means that it was actually difficult to watch most of the games on anything other than my phone or laptop (which sucks), but I'll mention two guys who stood out. Al Ahly's Danish-Palestinian striker Wessam Abou Ali, who got a hat trick against Benfica, and Boca Juniors' Miguel Merentiel, who looked great in the first two games only to fluff his lines in the third.

Ogden: Michael Olise (Bayern Munich), Jobe Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus) and Igor Jesus (Botafogo) have all impressed, but my pick at this stage is Angel di Maria. At 37, he is still going strong with Benfica and his performance in the group stage 1-0 win against Bayern Munich, which secured top spot in Group C for Bruno Lage's team, was incredible considering his age and the searing temperatures in Charlotte.

Di Maria was all energy in driving his team on, but it was merely a continuation of his earlier performances in the competition. He has already scored three goals in three games, living up to his pedigree as a World Cup winner with Argentina and a player who has spent his career at the highest level with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.

Becherano: Angel Di Maria is waving goodbye to European football by inspiring Benfica to a first-place finish in the group stage, surpassing Bayern Munich, Boca Juniors and Auckland City to qualify for the round of 16. He's one of five players tied for tournament lead with three goals scored, with every goal important: Di Maria kicked off the come-from-behind draw against Boca Juniors with a penalty in the first half, propelling Benfica to the crucial point. After an emotional goodbye to the Argentina national team last summer, it seems he wants to make this year memorable as well.

Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley explain the struggle to balance making Club World Cup games available for the global audience with making it safe for the players.

Kirkland: The best team performance I've seen was Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atletico Madrid, and the star at the Rose Bowl that day -- ahead of other candidates like Fabián Ruiz, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi -- was Vitinha. It wasn't just the lovely goal he scored: he was everywhere, taking the most touches and completing the most passes.

After PSG's Champions League win, everybody knows how good the Portuguese midfield maestro is, so it's no surprise: it's been more of the same here.

Cobos: Jhon Arias, from Fluminense. It's not easy to stand out in a team of average quality like Fluminense, but the Colombian attacker shows great technique and intellectual wisdom on the field.

Olley: This is a bit of left-field call, but what about Jorginho? Intelligent use of possession is vital in sweltering temperatures, and Jorginho has slotted straight into Flamengo's midfield since his arrival from Arsenal on a free transfer, seemingly developing an almost instant understanding of his new teammates. He completed 52 of his 59 passes in Flamengo's 3-1 win over Chelsea, registering eight ball recoveries -- more than any other player on the pitch.

The 33-year-old was often praised at Arsenal for his influential role off the field. This tournament is so far proving he can still do it on the field, too.

Carino: It's hard to have a favorite. The statistics point to Bayern Munich's top scorers, Jamal Musiala or Michael Olise, though another standout is Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid goalkeeper has become his club's best player. Madrid picked up seven points in the group stage, but they haven't been brilliant and their results could have been a lot different were the Belgian not between the posts.

Courtois was key against Al Hilal and was the best player against Pachuca. Real Madrid were decisive and won 3-1, but Courtois was instrumental in maintaining the result. Eleven shots on goal and five shots saved against Pachuca are the difference between lost or remaining unbeaten, and he followed that with three good saves in Thursday's 3-0 win over Salzburg.

Dawson: The weather is clearly an issue, and not just that. Part of the same issue is the differing conditions depending on different cities and stadiums. It's summed up best by Manchester City's schedule. They played their second game in Atlanta in air conditioning at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Their third and final game was played in 90-degree heat at 3 p.m. in Orlando, Florida.

Playing in air-conditioned stadiums, or in cities with cooler climates, is clearly an advantage. World Cup schedulers will have to look at that before deciding which games are played where in 2026.

Marcotti: The weather. We've been here before (in 1994), but it feels as if it has actually gotten worse. The heat and humidity in certain venues are really an issue if games are going to kick off at noon or 3 o'clock local time, and they sort of need to kick off at those times -- partly for TV purposes, partly because there are a ton of games, and you can't play them all at night. I guess you can figure out how to play the early kickoffs in Canada or the Pacific Northwest or domed stadiums, but it's going to be tricky.

It's not just the heat, either, but the lightning and thunderstorms. We had three games delayed in the group stage alone due to ""adverse weather.""

Ogden: The weather. The poor attendances so far at the Club World Cup won't be repeated next summer -- that's a totally different ballgame -- but the unpredictable and severe weather that has led to several games being suspended for long periods is a concern that won't go away.

It may be too late to make all the necessary changes to help minimize the weather disruption next summer, but things can still be done. For instance, more games could be scheduled for stadiums with retractable roofs and climate control to make life easier for players and spectators and kickoff times should be reassessed to ensure there are no games starting at midday.

It will be hot throughout the host nations (U.S., Canada and Mexico) next summer, regardless of where games are staged. With only four of the 16 venues having a retractable roof, FIFA should reevaluate whether some cities / stadiums are really up to the requirements.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discusses how Inter Miami should feel after late goals from Palmeiras result in the MLS side facing off against PSG.

Becherano: Between the dangerous weather conditions and unsatisfactory pitches, FIFA must address these concerns heading into the 2026 World Cup. Several coaches pointed out the sweltering heat throughout the group stage, with some figures blaming the conditions for substandard performances on the field. Even when winning, players cite the climate as upsetting. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca went as far as to say it is impossible to train.

Beyond the heat, PSG manager Luis Enrique mentioned the pitches force the ball to bounce like ""rabbits,"" disturbing their style of play. While spectators tune into these tournaments to be entertained, FIFA must consider accommodating the players first.

Kirkland: The heat, and not just for the players, but for the fans. Pictures of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich substitutes watching their matches in their locker rooms to stay out of the sun are one thing, but expecting fans -- some of whom have paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, and are attending games with their families, with young children -- to sit in the stands at midday, in a stadium with no roof, and no protection from the summer sun, is unacceptable. We all know TV audiences are the priority, but match-going fans need to be treated better.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Cobos: The World Cup will have problems on and off the field. The heat of the U.S. summer will lower the technical level and intensity of the matches and with 48 teams, many of them unremarkable, it will be difficult to fill stadiums.

Olley: Public transport for the supporters and the differing conditions for the players. The popularity in the U.S. of driving to major sporting events is pot replicated in many other countries, and a little like when Wimbledon but the roof on Centre Court, the conditions in the U.S. can create two different tournaments. Imagine during the group stage, one team has to play in 40C heat while another is in an air-conditioned stadium. The latter will have an undeniably have an advantage as the competition progresses.

Nobody can expect FIFA to control the weather, but at the same time, just five of the 16 arenas to be used across the U.S., Canada and Mexico next summer have a fixed or retractable roof. There is a delicate balancing act to be found between sharing the use of those stadiums around and finding late kickoff times, doing their best to avoid any team being unduly affected by the heat.

Carino: Schedules have been one of the main issues in this tournament. Ratings matter on television, as they do in the European and Asian markets, but the spectacle on the field has to be the most important thing. The players have suffered with the weather in some areas. In California, Atlético Madrid, Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain played in temperatures north of 95°F and extreme humidity, and it has been noticeable on the field. For the World Cup, they need to find a solution and decide whether ratings matter more than the integrity of the players and a good spectacle.

Dawson: You can argue as much as you like about whether Auckland City -- essentially an amateur team -- deserve their place in the Club World Cup alongside the likes of Real Madrid and River Plate. But after they were smashed 10-0 in their opening game against Bayern Munich, surely no one can deny that their 1-1 draw against Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their final group game was the feel-good story of the group stage. Yes, they're going home early, but they deserve immense credit for their performance and result.

Marcotti: I'll go with Mamelodi Sundowns for the way they nearly came back against Borussia Dortmund, losing 4-3, and held Fluminense to a draw in their final game. Bouncing back like this after the disappointment of the CAF Champions League final is big enough; playing with the sort of style they showed is a bonus. They more than lived up to their Brazil-inspired jerseys.

Julien Laurens explains why he thinks River Plate's exit from the FIFA Club World Cup is a ""huge failure"" for the club.

Ogden: Christian Gray's goal for Auckland City in their surprise 1-1 draw with Boca Juniors epitomized what this kind of tournament should be about: a part-time player scoring a goal that he and his teammates will remember forever.

Gray, a PE teacher in New Zealand, and the majority of his Auckland squad had to take time off from their day jobs to participate in the Club World Cup, and it had been a chastening experience due to a 10-0 defeat against Bayern Munich and a 6-0 loss to Benfica.

With Argentine giants Boca needing a big win to have any hope of qualification, another hammering seemed to be inevitable for Auckland in Nashville. But despite falling behind in the first-half, the Oceania champions fought back with Gray earning them a draw with his goal.

""I'm from a small town, a long way from here and a lot different to this environment,"" Gray said after the game. ""So it is somewhat of a dream.""

Becherano: The Lionel Messi free kick against FC Porto marked the group stage for me. Inter Miami was practically written off against the European side, but that moment from the Argentine forward seemed to silence all that doubted in the stadium and from afar.

Kirkland: It didn't matter if it was on the beach, at a nightclub, or in Walmart: Boca Juniors fans were everywhere in south Florida during this Club World Cup. The unrivalled, passionate support of tens of thousands of Los Xeneizes, inside and outside stadiums, was just what this tournament needed.

Sadly, on the field, their team didn't come close to living up to that backing, crashing out thanks to an embarrassing 1-1 draw with amateurs Auckland City, a result which was another highlight.

Cobos: The South American fans' party, which saved FIFA from total failure in this Club World Cup in terms of the football atmosphere.

Olley: Let's give Lionel Messi his due. He was shoehorned into this tournament in a typically cynical way by FIFA -- Inter Miami were awarded a spot as ""hosts"" -- but his free-kick against Porto was the social media viral clip they were desperate for in return. Messi turned 38 this week and any chance to see him on a major stage like this is of significant value.

Oh, and Inter Miami's surprising level of performance has earned him what nobody thought possible: a reunion with Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.

Carino: The atmosphere generated by the Monterrey and River Plate fans at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena. Any Mexican team can feel like the home team in Los Angeles, but the Rayados fans have organized their own party before their matches, and the passion of Los Millonarios was also on full display. The match was key for both teams in the group stage, but both fan bases also had their own cheering matches before and during the game. More than 15,000 Argentines tried to silence the more than 40,000 Mexican fans who were in attendance.

Dawson: It's hard to look past Real Madrid. They haven't had the easiest group stage, but they're clearly desperate to win it. If there's a club who are all about earning the title of world champions it's Real Madrid. They're still a bit of an unknown while they get used to life under new manager Xabi Alonso, but it would be typical of them to turn up in the knockout rounds and win it all.

Marcotti: I think Manchester City are really well equipped. Guardiola has rotated a fair bit, they're deep and given the way last season went, they may well feel they have a point to prove.

Ogden: For the sake of the tournament, I would love to see one of the Brazilian teams emerge as champions, but the reality is that one of the European giants will probably build the momentum required to go all the way. On that front, it's hard to look beyond Paris Saint-Germain who, despite losing to Copa Libertadores champions Botafogo, look the most likely to emerge from the pack.

Luis Enrique's team are full of belief after their Champions League success and they have enough youth in the side to be able to cope with the physical demands of the competition. They will be far too strong for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in the Round of 16, and they should also overcome Flamengo or Bayern Munich in the quarters, so I'm backing them to add the Club World Cup to their Champions League title.

Rob Dawson believes Pep Guardiola will be happy with his team after their impressive display vs. Juventus.

Becherano: Between group stage performances and the path forward to the final, Bayern Munich stand as my top contenders. The team seem to be taking this tournament extremely seriously, especially as Harry Kane looks to add more trophies to his name.

Kirkland: Paris Saint-Germain. It's not a particularly original prediction: They're the best team in Europe right now, and probably the world. They've got a very winnable last-16 tie against Inter Miami. It gets trickier after that, with a possible quarterfinal clash with Bayern Munich or dark horses Flamengo, and maybe Real Madrid in the semifinals, but PSG are a better team than any of them.

Cobos: Manchester City.

Olley: It would be very Manchester City to put recent difficulties behind them and find a way to win. Manager Pep Guardiola has heavily rotated his teams to this point and they are still bedding in new signings, but they've looked as strong as anyone so far.

Carino: History dictates that this spot has to be reserved for Real Madrid. The Champions League's biggest winner is still the favorite, but they must show it on the field. They've left doubts, but they're still Real Madrid. Controversy or not, they're the favorites to advance and win.

Dawson: You probably can't be classed as a ""surprise team"" if you come into a tournament as champions of Brazil, but Botafogo have got the opportunity to go deep. They've already beaten Paris Saint-Germain and despite finishing second in Group B, they're in the kinder half of the draw -- with Benfica or Chelsea awaiting the winner of Saturday's game -- which gives them a great chance of reaching the semifinals. Once there, anything could happen.

Marcotti: I guess it comes down to what we define as a ""surprise"" team. It feels weird to call, say, Flamengo or Benfica ""surprise teams,"" but I guess I'll go with Monterrey. I didn't think they'd qualify ahead of River Plate, and their Round of 16 game against Borussia Dortmund is manageable.

Ogden: Benfica. Their performance in the 1-0 win against Bayern Munich highlighted Benfica's quality, but also their ability to cope with the demanding conditions. Bruno Lage's team will be underdogs to beat Chelsea in the Round of 16, but they look a more cohesive unit than the Premier League side and I expect them to emerge with a win and book a quarterfinal against Palmeiras or Botafogo.

Once it gets to the quarterfinal stage, every team still involved will believe they can go all the way and Benfica will face a tough challenge against either of the Brazilian teams. But they have been a surprise package so far and Benfica look capable of extending their stay in the U.S. for quite a while yet.

Ale Moreno reflects on Real Madrid's win over RB Salzburg in the Club World Cup and how the players are adapting to Xabi Alonso's new system.

Becherano: I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as a surprise after their victory over PSG, but Botafogo could be the Brazilian side to stun most opponents from here. The team came into the competition with something to prove and are set to represent the Conmebol region well.

Kirkland: Do Flamengo, the best team in Brazil right now, count as a surprise? They've got one of the best young coaches around in Filipe Luis, and their win over Chelsea showed they can beat top European opposition. Sunday's last-16 game with Bayern Munich will tell us how seriously they should be taken -- win that, and they can go all the way.

Cobos: Botafogo. They advanced in the most difficult group and even beat the Champions League champions, Paris Saint-Germain, which was a feat. Without a doubt, they are my bet among the surprises to go furthest.

Olley: It does feel as though the cat is out of the bag with the South American teams, but I'll go with Botafogo to run deep. Igor Jesus scored the famous winning goal against PSG and has impressed with his physicality. On paper, their portion of the bracket offers hope of further progress given after Palmeiras, they would face either a Chelsea side still searching for rhythm and Benfica, who were surprise winners of their group.

Carino: Any of the Brazilian teams that qualify for the next round. The Brazilians have caused European clubs to suffer and while they've lost some of these games, I think this competition has caused UEFA to look at Latin American soccer with a bit more respect.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

To anyone who managed to watch every minute of every group-stage game of the Club World Cup, we applaud you.

With 48 games played across 13 days, there has been endless action to unpack. We have had shock results, extreme weather conditions, and plenty of strikes that would be worthy of winning goal of the tournament already.

For those who have not been glued to their television screens, what has caught the eye from the opening fortnight?

Allow The Athletic to catch you up on some interesting themes we have spotted…



There have been plenty of examples of the Club World Cup pitches not being up to standard, and it is affecting the way the players are playing in the United States.

As evidenced by the change in grip and aerodynamics of the balls themselves, small details matter to professionals operating at the highest level. With players so finely tuned to the zip of a quality, well-watered pitch, a yard of distance could be the difference between an underhit pass and an assist, so you can understand why comments are being made.

“The pitches aren't great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” Jude Bellingham said after Real Madrid's win against Pachuca. “It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully, there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year.”

The bounce of the ball has been particularly notable, even from television coverage, with a comical example from Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior in that Pachuca clash. Before taking a corner, the Brazil international throws the ball, expecting it to bounce back up with similar force. Instead, the ball barely reaches his knees as the turf swallows it up.



“It was a little bit dry,” said Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel after their first-game 0-0 draw against Fluminense.

“You can feel the turf beneath it, so the ball was not bouncing the way it usually bounces. It was a little bit soft. The ball didn't get the height it normally gets.”

Dortmund seemingly had similar issues in their second game as they failed to read the run of the ball in Lucas Ribeiro's solo finish for Mamelodi Sundowns. Ribeiro's heavy touch forward would typically have zipped off the turf, but the ball held up as defender Ramy Bensebaini slid in, allowing Ribeiro to run through the whole Dortmund defence in a goal that looked like a glitch from a 2002 video game.



Bellingham's reference to next year's World Cup feels pertinent given that little has changed in the pitch quality since the U.S. hosted the Copa America 12 months ago, with similar complaints dominating the post-match analysis among players and managers.

In the interest of sticking to our analytics principles, readers might be interested to know that AI-driven turf management does exist, with a new company, Turfcoach, allowing clubs to collect data on their pitch.

One of Turfcoach's research papers highlights the effects of surface and climate towards the tactics and performance of the team, meaning those who do best in this summer's tournament might be the ones who simply adapt best to the conditions.

The sweltering U.S. heat — and the creative approaches teams have taken to adapt — has been one of the tournament's most eye-catching aspects.

Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich housed their substitutes in the dressing room to shield them from the oppressive conditions in Cincinnati and Charlotte, while Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca cut training short, calling it “impossible to train” under a code red heat warning.

With this tournament also acting as a dry run for next summer's World Cup, it raises the question: could this be the hottest World Cup on record? While historical weather data is limited before 2010, data from the last four World Cups — sourced from weather provider Visual Crossing — suggests the U.S. edition is likely to be the warmest in modern times.



How players and teams adapt to hot World Cups has always been a point of fascination, but next summer might take that challenge to another level.

Unlike an international World Cup, it feels a little trickier to spot any reliable tactical trends that unite teams from the group stage of the tournament. However, have we seen a disciplinary issue at the Club World Cup?

Players would be forgiven for (literally) feeling a little hot under the collar, but there have been 10 red cards across the 48 games played in the group stage. For context, that is more than each of the past three Champions League group stages after gameweek three, and more than the past two World Cup group stages combined (two in 2022 and three in 2018).

All in all, there have been seven fouls for every yellow card shown — about average compared with other tournaments listed above. However, it may be the case that two Argentine clubs are doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. River Plate's 11 yellow cards and three reds across three games were rather shocking, with Marcos Acuna's red mist particularly notable as he chased Inter's Denzel Dumfries towards the tunnel before being tackled to the ground.

With 104 fouls, River were the only club to hit triple figures by this measure, nearly 40 more than Boca Juniors, who clocked up 67 fouls, five yellow cards and two reds — both against Benfica — as the Argentine contingent failed to control their emotions.

Ander Herrera's dismissal did not even see him get on the pitch, as he clashed with a member of tournament staff after showing his disdain for a VAR review for a penalty incident.

To balance things out, Boca's Group C opponents, Auckland City, were the only side not to receive a yellow card during the group stages.

At times, you might have to do some mental gymnastics or sophisticated data modelling to accurately determine whether a player can cut it if they move to a new league.

Some might be familiar with the ‘Bundesliga tax', speaking to the idea that there is often an ‘exchange rate' in a player's output when they transfer from one country to another.

Within Europe, for example, you can determine a league's strength by looking at clubs' performances from the respective leagues in European competitions, be it the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League. Therefore, if a player goes from League A to League B, you can adjust expectations accordingly.

However, aside from friendlies, we rarely get a decent calibration of this league exchange rate across continents, with previous iterations of the Club World Cup being a smaller selection of champions from the respective confederations.

This summer has provided more cross-pollination than ever, with Chelsea's clash with Los Angeles FC being the first time that a club from England had played a club from the U.S. in a competitive fixture. Sure, a single game between two teams is not going to provide a robust output on the respective league strengths, but it can be a good snapshot.

There have been a fair few shocks already to help with this calibration. Inter Miami's 2-1 victory over Porto sent shockwaves through Portugal after an incredible winning free kick scored by a certain Lionel Messi. Botafogo shocked Paris Saint-Germain with a 1-0 victory and a disciplined defensive performance against the UEFA Champions League winners. Meanwhile, lowly Auckland City arguably had the result of the tournament with a 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors in their final group-stage game.

For all that we can use this information, the timing of the Club World Cup means some clubs might be taking the tournament more seriously than others. European leagues have come to an end, while South American and MLS teams are in a different stage of their conditioning, being halfway through their respective domestic seasons.

Still, any analysis can only work on the information it has been given, and there are positives to be taken from the fact that an intercontinental tournament has drummed up some clashes between leagues that have never faced off before.

The data models will be so happy.

It is not uncommon to see South American sides perform well in the Club World Cup.

In the previous iteration of the tournament, CONMEBOL has been the only true competitor (four wins) to UEFA in the number of victories (16) since its inaugural year in 2000.

In truth, that glory has been propped up by Brazil, who have the joint-second highest number of wins as a nation (level with England — four) across the tournament's history, behind only Spain (eight). Corinthians were the last Brazilian club to clinch the title in 2012, after Paolo Guerrero's header saw off Chelsea in a 1-0 victory.

While the Argentine pair of River and Boca went into self-destruct mode, Brazilian lights are shining bright once again this summer.

Flamengo, Palmeiras, Botafogo and Fluminense have all advanced to the knockout stages, with Mexico's Monterrey (representing Concacaf) also joining the South American contingent. Just one loss between them across the group games shows that none of them are willing to roll over easily against the bullies from Europe.

With Botafogo and Palmeiras facing each other on Saturday, twisted logic might mean that fans of Brazilian football should be happy that at least one club will be guaranteed to make it to the quarter-finals. Of course, supporters of either side would not take kindly to the suggestion that they could not have progressed past European opposition themselves, such is the pride, optimism and quality that the pair possess.

Could a South American side go all the way this summer? European clubs remain the favourites to win the trophy on July 13, but given the fierce desire to make a dent in the tournament — coupled with favourable physical conditioning compared with other confederations — you would not bet against it.

The group stage has featured some great games and indelible moments, thanks mostly to the participants who took things seriously.

Inside the corporate monstrosity hides something that's actually quite lovely and joyful and organic. It's burrowed down real deep, beneath layers and layers of maximalist nonsense. But it's in there somewhere, a good soccer tournament, cloaked by all the avarice and bombast, in spite of itself and those responsible for it.

It's true: the Club World Cup and its new summer format haven't been all bad. The group stage, which concluded on Thursday, offered fun and competitive teams. It served up a few genuinely enthralling games, especially in the clashes between the European and South American sides. The fans of some teams – the indefatigable singing and chanting of Boca Juniors' and River Plate's barras; the churning sea of red hopping up and down for the Urawa; the clapping and singing Wydad fans; the drumming and dancing Brazilians crisscrossing the nation in the wake of their four thriving clubs – injected the proceedings with exactly the kind of summer tournament folklore and fever you should hope for. We've even seen some kit design excellence – thank you, Botafogo.

We've gotten some Lionel Messi almost-heroics and then some certified Messi heroics. We were given a vintage Luis Suárez goal, bullying the ball into the net. We saw the European champions Paris Saint-German savage Atlético Madrid 4-0, only to turn around and lose to one of those pesky Brazilian sides, Botafogo. Like many World Cups, there was a European giant that disappointed in not making it past the groups. This time, it was Atléti.

While the Brazilian delegation offered up good teams and good fans, the Argentinian mission only sent good fans, bringing color and noise as both River and Boca were knocked out in the group stage and looked decidedly overwhelmed even by mediocre opposition.

Meanwhile, Flamengo comprehensively beat 10-man Chelsea 3-1. Borussia Dortmund was held scoreless by Fluminense and almost embarrassed by Mamelodi Sundowns, flirting with giving away a 4-1 lead. The only group not to yield compelling theater was G – which was dominated by Manchester City and Juventus (until City smashed Juve 5-2), at the cost of Al Ain and Wydad – since Group H saw Real Madrid stunned by a Al-Hilal in a 1-1 tie.

After all the overcooked buildup and grandiose promises, the tournament's opening fell flat, clouded over by the rumors of Ice raids. That the urgency in the action arrived eventually should be credited to the non-European teams. They have been the primary suppliers of the fun.

Still, all of these pleasing displays of soccer and the things that make it wonderful have materialized as a kind of act of defiance. A great many things are still wrong with the unwieldy Club World Cup.

Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer

after newsletter promotion

The venues are too big. While 14 games have drawn over 50,000 fans, there have been no sellouts. The impact of good crowds was diminished by Fifa's insistence on playing in America's biggest arenas. Another 14 games drew fewer than 20,000, suggesting using Major League Soccer facilities for a lot more games might have been a good idea.

It was also a grind, with four games a day for most of the group stage, and requiring a finalist to slog through seven matches on the back of, or in the midst of, the punishing domestic club seasons. The timing is all wrong, confronting the players with the same catastrophically hot weather that will bewitch next summer's World Cup proper. There was Fifa's cowardice in removing anti-racism signage, and then bringing it back for a single day. For 63 games, we must suffer the ludicrous spectacle of bored players ambling through the thin puffs of smoke and shimmering lights as an announcer gives them the full heavyweight-championship-of-the-world boxing match treatment during pre-game introductions. Also, whatever the hell that was in the Oval Office with Donald Trump, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, and the bewildered Juventus players and executives – hopefully a nadir in Infantino's persistent cozying up to Trump.

It's a lot – probably too much – of everything. And in failing to meet its own impossible ambitions, the Club World Cup has made no imprint whatsoever on the culture.

And yet the idea of the thing clearly isn't the problem. There is a more modest, pared-down version of this competition that could be a success, with an emphasis on the competition rather than the revenue and the overplayed stakes. If it was brought along slowly and nurtured as a growth play, rather than announced as the biggest thing to ever happen right at the outset, there is an event there that could enrich the sport. Eventually.

Real Madrid have won the Fifa Club World Cup a record five times

A new-look Real Madrid beat RB Salzburg 3-0 to finish top of Group H and advance to the last 16 at the Fifa Club World Cup.

Manager Xabi Alonso deployed a five-man defence for the first time since replacing Carlo Ancelotti in the dugout.

Wing-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Fran Garcia were given licence to get forward with Aurelien Tchouameni dropping in between central defenders Antonio Rudiger and Dean Huijsen.

Previous managers Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane preferred a 4-3-3 structure, but Alonso's approach is reminiscent of Vicente del Bosque's Champions League-winning side of 2000.

Real looked at ease in the new formation and claimed a comfortable win at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.

Vinicius Jr opened the scoring with a drilled finish into the bottom corner after gliding away from two defenders.

The Brazil winger's cute back heel pass set Federico Valverde on his way to double their lead on the stroke of half-time.

Academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia wrapped up the win with a chipped effort.

""We're taking it step-by-step,"" Vinicius Jr told Dazn. 

""Of course, we can't fully adapt to the coach's ideas so quickly, it takes time. But today was a good game for that, especially in the first half.""

Real Madrid head to Florida to face Group G runners-up Juventus in the last 16 at 02:00 BST on 1 July.

RB Salzburg picked up four points across three fixtures but could only finish third - a point shy of runners-up Al-Hilal - and are heading home.

FIFA Club World Cup

Real Madrid expect defender David Alaba to miss the remainder of the Club World Cup after he suffered a fresh injury set-back.

Alaba, 33, underwent assessments which revealed an injury to his left calf muscle and the club anticipate he will be sidelined for around three weeks.

The Austria international has missed Madrid's opening three Club World Cup group stage fixtures as he continues his recovery from a meniscus injury in his left knee that he sustained in April.

He is yet to be named in a matchday squad at the tournament in the United States but was expected to be able to play a part in the latter stages before his latest set-back.

Injury restricted Alaba to just 14 appearances across all competitions during the 2024-25 campaign after returning from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in January, which he suffered in December 2023.

He then suffered a meniscus injury in April that required minor surgery, ruling him out of the remainder of the campaign.

Madrid beat Red Bull Salzburg in their final Club World Cup group game on Thursday and will play Juventus in the last-16 on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Brazilian teams have excelled at the Club World Cup. How far can they go?","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/27/brazilian-teams-club-world-cup-flamengo-botafogo-palmeiras-fluminense","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 10:02:00 GMT","

Brazil's four teams – Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and Fluminense – breezed through the group stage 

“Many people didn't believe this would happen. It is happening,” said Fluminense manager​ Renato Gaúcho​ as he reflected on the performances of the Brazilian teams at the Club World Cup​. ​With Fluminense​, Palmeiras, Botafogo and Flamengo​ all on their way to the last 16, Renato said that Brazilian football and people ​should be “very proud” of what their clubs ​have done in the US.

The results in the group stage were impressive. Botafogo beat European champions Paris Saint-Germain; Flamengo won convincingly against Chelsea; and the only defeat for a Brazilian team – when Botafogo lost to Atlético Madrid – came when they had an eye on the knockout stage. In all, they played 12 games, lost one and only conceded nine goals.

The last 16 kicks off on Saturday, with Botafogo v Palmeiras in Philadelphia. The tie resumes a rivalry that has been at the forefront of Brazilian football in recent years. While it's not an historic conflict or one based on geographical proximity, the clubs have been at loggerheads as they have battled for the Brasileirão title. Consider it a Brazilian version of the Manchester City v Liverpool rivalry – but with a bit more spice.

In 2023, Botafogo built up a 15-point lead in the title race but started to fritter it away. By the time they met Palmeiras towards the end of the campaign, their lead was down to six points. Botafogo raced into a 3-0 lead in their crunch match but Endrick inspired a 4-3 comeback​. In the end, Palmeiras denied Botafogo the title and snatched it for themselves. 
  Afterwards, Botafogo's majority owner John Textor went on a rampage​, accusing Palmeiras ​of corruption. Leila Pereira, the Palmeiras president, called Textor's accusations “irresponsible and criminal” and dubbed him the “embarrassment of Brazilian football”. The feud between the two leaders is one of the biggest subplots before their match on Saturday, with rival fans telling Botafogo supporters to enjoy themselves before Textor sinks their club à la Lyon.

Botafogo ​recovered from their heartbreak in 2024​, becoming just the fourth team in history to do a league and Libertadores double​. To make their revenge even sweeter, they eliminated Palmeiras in the last 16. They have struggled in the league this season though, especially after losing their best players in Luiz Henrique and Thiago Almada (who is on loan at one of Textor's other clubs​, Lyon), as well as their manager.​ So their success at the Club World Cup – including that standout victory against PSG – has come as a welcome surprise.

We've been talking to their defender Vitinho – who spent a few years at Burnley – and he is feeling confident. “We have a very strong team, we know our potential and we never stopped believing,” he says. “As long as we have a chance, we will fight to the fullest. We worked hard, we believed and we achieved our goal, which was to qualify from the group stage. We knew we would face a very tough team in the round of 16. It will be like that until the end. We have had great duels against Palmeiras in recent years, memorable moments for both teams, and this will be another very important game for both clubs.”

On the other side of the rivalry, Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton says he and his teammates have been preparing for the Club World Cup for a long time and are satisfied with their performances so far. “It was a good start, we're on the right track,” he said. “This competition, playing against the best teams in the world, is a great opportunity for everyone to show their worth. And the Brazilian teams are doing it very well. It is up to us to maintain this level and improve, because the pressure will only increase. We have great opportunities to advance in the competition.”

He knows that Botafogo will be tough opponents. “A Brazilian confrontation is always difficult because you know the characteristics of the players, but at this point you can't choose your opponents. It will be difficult for Palmeiras, as it will be difficult for Botafogo; they are two great teams. Brazilian football has won here; we will have a Brazilian team in the quarter-finals. This values our football.”

Flamengo, the current league leaders in Brazil, have been dealt a tough draw in the last 16, where they face Bayern Munich. Having won their group, it looked as though Flamengo would play Benfica or Boca Juniors in the last 16 but Vincent Kompany's decision to rest players against Benfica backfired on Bayern – and Flamengo. The winner of their last-16 tie will meet Paris Saint-Germain or Inter Miami in the quarter-finals then possibly Real Madrid in the semis.

Focusing on the first task in hand, club icon Zico joked that “we have an advantage, because we've only ever played one game against Bayern and it was 3-1 to Flamengo”. He's not referring to a past Intercontinental Cup, though, but rather a match at the Kuala Lumpur International Tournament in 1994. Flamengo were awarded $20,000 for that victory. The stakes will be far higher in Miami on Sunday night.

Flamengo manager Filipe Luís is full of respect for Bayern, calling them “dominant”, a “colossus” with “an extraordinary squad” and “an excellent coach” and one of the top tier of European clubs that are above anything South America can offer. “They're a club that inspires us and gives us ideas to copy, but in a game anything can happen,” he added.

Filipe Luís knows Flamengo face an uphill battle but he wants his team to keep their identity and, if they are to go out, to do so on their own shield. “Flamengo's DNA requires you try to take the ball away from the opponent, try to press, control the game and be as vertical as possible,” he said. “That is what we will try to do. We know their quality and the way they play. They will try to impose their rhythm, and we will try to do the same. In the end, may the best team win.”

Some Flamengo fans have taken umbrage with what they perceive to be Bayern rolling over for Benfica and settling for second place. It's a strategy Fluminense appeared to adopt as well. They rested players and drew with Mamelodi Sundowns, perhaps as a means of playing either River Plate or Monterrey in the last 16. With Dortmund and Inter winning, though, and Fluminense picking up just a point, the 2023 Libertadores winners will now face Inter.

“Now, there is no easy game,” says their manager Renato, who has also echoed the idea that knockout football is about more than money. “It's no use having a team of 500m, football is on the field,” he said. Fluminense have their own veterans, such as Thiago Silva at the heart of their defence, but perhaps it's the perfect moment to pounce on a crestfallen and ageing Inter side after their hammering against PSG.

The FIFA Club World Cup group stage is in the books as 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage with hopes of lifting the trophy this summer.

The new-look tournament has been met with mixed feelings so far. As debates regarding the packed match calendar rage on, scenes of empty stadiums early in the tournament was a cause for concern. On the other hand, there's been some feel-good stories this summer—including Flamengo and Botafogo—and positive additions like the referee camera. 

Certainly a precursor to the World Cup next year in the United States, the action and interest should heat up during the bracket as blockbuster matches come to fruition.

Nearly every major European side advanced to the bracket sans Atlético Madrid who fell in Group B. Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are perceived favorites in the bracket.

Here's every round of 16 game at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Here are all the confirmed matchups for the next stage of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup:

Saturday, June 28

Sunday, June 29

Monday, June 30

Tuesday, July 1

Of the knockout games, PSG's match with Inter Miami should take center stage given Lionel Messi facing off against his old team. As far as Champions League-esque matches, Real Madrid vs. Juventus will have that big match feel as well. 

Plus, Flamengo vs. Bayern will be a must-watch game given both teams' performances in the group stage.

The round of 16 will conclude Tuesday, July 1 with the quarterfinals beginning on July 4.

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, James Olley shares his frustrations with the Club World Cup tournament as it currently exists. (1:41)

We've reached the knockout rounds of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, and the tournament has given us so much to talk about, celebrate and criticize since Inter Miami and Al Ahly battled to a 0-0 draw at Hard Rock Stadium. We've had shocks, surprises and stunning scorelines; we've also had difficult weather, uneven attendance and some lackluster pitches, too.

So, with the knockout rounds set to start Saturday in Philadelphia when Palmeiras take on Botafogo, we asked our Club World Cup reporters for their thoughts on the good, bad and ugly of the 2025 tournament so far, as well as their picks for who will win it all at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

Rob Dawson: Better. The attendance has been good, for the most part, and there's been enough intrigue around the games to keep it interesting. It would have been bad for the tournament if the UEFA clubs had blitzed everyone else. The South American teams and their fans have made it a spectacle.

It was obviously never going to compare to a World Cup, but there has at least been a flavor of it. It's also important to remember that this is the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup: Attitudes might be very different in eight years.

Gab Marcotti: It was so tough to know what to expect partly because it's a new tournament, and partly because of the rushed way it was organized. But the football itself has been reasonably good. We've learned that there isn't some sort of huge gulf between Europe (and South America) and the rest of the world, despite the massive imbalance in resources. Other than Auckland City (but they made up for it in the third game), the only team to really get blown out were Atletico Madrid.

Fans of African and South American teams brought a ton of color and proper tifo, so their games, at least the ones I attended, felt very much like ""real"" games. Maybe my expectations weren't very high, but I think they showed it's a viable competition.

Mark Ogden: It has been better, because the South American teams have shown up and jolted some of the European heavyweights out of their complacency (and, perhaps, arrogance) in thinking that they could coast through the competition and bank the huge prize money for reaching the latter stages. That may still happen and we might end up with a Champions League quartet in the semifinals, but Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and River Plate have all risen to the occasion -- so did South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns -- and it's made this competition feel like a genuinely global event.

But we can't escape the fact that attendance has been worse than anticipated. FIFA president Gianni Infantino should take the blame for that because he has driven the whole tournament, from the match scheduling, the venues, even the teams that have taken part (hello, Inter Miami). Had more games been staged at smaller MLS venues rather than huge NFL stadiums, the games might just have been played to a full house, making for a better spectacle.

Lizzy Becherano: The Club World Cup has slowly exceeded my expectations on and off the field. Prior to June 14, concerns about the level of football and lack of support dominated the narrative. Now, after witnessing Boca Juniors supporters at Hard Rock Stadium and Inter Miami's shocking victory over FC Porto, this feels like an actual competition. Botafogo triumphing against Paris Saint-Germain or CF Monterrey holding Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw allowed spectators to believe each team showed up to this tournament wanting to prove their worth and the value of each league. This isn't the pre-season tournament or Europe-dominated competition many anticipated.

Though FIFA can continue to improve certain aspects of the Club World Cup, maybe considering a different point in the year to avoid player exhaustion and weather concerns, this first edition proved international interest for these matchups.

Alex Kirkland: Better. Yes, there have been lots of predictable negatives, notably the impact of the heat and afternoon kickoff times on players' performance, and the fan experience. But a lot of the games have been really fun to watch, and the sight of Brazilian, Argentinian and Mexican sides going up against -- and often competing with -- European teams has been refreshing. It's the first edition of this tournament in this format, and given that, it's gone about as well as could reasonably be expected. And it should get even better in the knockout stages, with more at stake.

Paulo Cobos, ESPN Brazil: Worse. South Americans, especially Brazilians, have reason to celebrate. But the fact is that the technical level of play has been nothing special, many stadiums are worryingly empty, and the suffocating heat has been a serious problem.

James Olley: Elements of it have surprised me, but overall the tournament has been more or less what I expected: mixed attendance figures, complaints about the heat and the pitches, tired European players, and a lukewarm domestic reception. The positives have largely come from the South American sides injecting a real sense of passion and determination -- both on the field in wanting to rival the Europeans, but also off the pitch, where large traveling supporters have made the host cities feel like they do during a major international tournament: an exciting blend of colors and cultures.

The tournament was always too big at 32 teams, but there have still been moments that will live in the memory, perhaps creating continental rivalries that can give the Club World Cup a proper heritage in time. What has surprised me, though, is the lack of exposure in some cities. It varies, but in many cases, marketing of the tournament is minimal and finding the games on in a bar isn't as straightforward as it should be.

Craig Burley explains why you can't use the Club World Cup to determine which sides are stronger than others.

Ricardo Carino, ESPN Mexico: It's been 100 percent better. Logic doesn't exist in this tournament. The strongest teams have been surprised by the smaller clubs, and this has caused some of the favorites to return home early. It's a fact that European teams are on the right track, but their stars and their million-dollar salaries haven't been fully reflected on the pitch, nor in some of the results we've seen these past few days.

Dawson: I think Thembinkosi Lorch has impressed for Wydad AC. The 31-year-old South African forward caught the eye in his first game against Manchester City and gave Pep Guardiola's young back four a number of nervous moments. On a different day he might have scored twice as Wydad gave City's problems on the break in the middle of the first half.

Lorch did find the net in the second game against Juventus, although Wydad were eventually beaten 4-1 to seal an early exit from the tournament. Lorch, though, can be happy that he made the most of his time in the spotlight.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Marcotti: Don't know about the best, because the stupid way TV rights were assigned means that it was actually difficult to watch most of the games on anything other than my phone or laptop (which sucks), but I'll mention two guys who stood out. Al Ahly's Danish-Palestinian striker Wessam Abou Ali, who got a hat trick against Benfica, and Boca Juniors' Miguel Merentiel, who looked great in the first two games only to fluff his lines in the third.

Ogden: Michael Olise (Bayern Munich), Jobe Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Kenan Yildiz (Juventus) and Igor Jesus (Botafogo) have all impressed, but my pick at this stage is Angel di Maria. At 37, he is still going strong with Benfica and his performance in the group stage 1-0 win against Bayern Munich, which secured top spot in Group C for Bruno Lage's team, was incredible considering his age and the searing temperatures in Charlotte.

Di Maria was all energy in driving his team on, but it was merely a continuation of his earlier performances in the competition. He has already scored three goals in three games, living up to his pedigree as a World Cup winner with Argentina and a player who has spent his career at the highest level with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.

Becherano: Angel Di Maria is waving goodbye to European football by inspiring Benfica to a first-place finish in the group stage, surpassing Bayern Munich, Boca Juniors and Auckland City to qualify for the round of 16. He's one of five players tied for tournament lead with three goals scored, with every goal important: Di Maria kicked off the come-from-behind draw against Boca Juniors with a penalty in the first half, propelling Benfica to the crucial point. After an emotional goodbye to the Argentina national team last summer, it seems he wants to make this year memorable as well.

Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley explain the struggle to balance making Club World Cup games available for the global audience with making it safe for the players.

Kirkland: The best team performance I've seen was Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atletico Madrid, and the star at the Rose Bowl that day -- ahead of other candidates like Fabián Ruiz, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi -- was Vitinha. It wasn't just the lovely goal he scored: he was everywhere, taking the most touches and completing the most passes.

After PSG's Champions League win, everybody knows how good the Portuguese midfield maestro is, so it's no surprise: it's been more of the same here.

Cobos: Jhon Arias, from Fluminense. It's not easy to stand out in a team of average quality like Fluminense, but the Colombian attacker shows great technique and intellectual wisdom on the field.

Olley: This is a bit of left-field call, but what about Jorginho? Intelligent use of possession is vital in sweltering temperatures, and Jorginho has slotted straight into Flamengo's midfield since his arrival from Arsenal on a free transfer, seemingly developing an almost instant understanding of his new teammates. He completed 52 of his 59 passes in Flamengo's 3-1 win over Chelsea, registering eight ball recoveries -- more than any other player on the pitch.

The 33-year-old was often praised at Arsenal for his influential role off the field. This tournament is so far proving he can still do it on the field, too.

Carino: It's hard to have a favorite. The statistics point to Bayern Munich's top scorers, Jamal Musiala or Michael Olise, though another standout is Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid goalkeeper has become his club's best player. Madrid picked up seven points in the group stage, but they haven't been brilliant and their results could have been a lot different were the Belgian not between the posts.

Courtois was key against Al Hilal and was the best player against Pachuca. Real Madrid were decisive and won 3-1, but Courtois was instrumental in maintaining the result. Eleven shots on goal and five shots saved against Pachuca are the difference between lost or remaining unbeaten, and he followed that with three good saves in Thursday's 3-0 win over Salzburg.

Dawson: The weather is clearly an issue, and not just that. Part of the same issue is the differing conditions depending on different cities and stadiums. It's summed up best by Manchester City's schedule. They played their second game in Atlanta in air conditioning at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Their third and final game was played in 90-degree heat at 3 p.m. in Orlando, Florida.

Playing in air-conditioned stadiums, or in cities with cooler climates, is clearly an advantage. World Cup schedulers will have to look at that before deciding which games are played where in 2026.

Marcotti: The weather. We've been here before (in 1994), but it feels as if it has actually gotten worse. The heat and humidity in certain venues are really an issue if games are going to kick off at noon or 3 o'clock local time, and they sort of need to kick off at those times -- partly for TV purposes, partly because there are a ton of games, and you can't play them all at night. I guess you can figure out how to play the early kickoffs in Canada or the Pacific Northwest or domed stadiums, but it's going to be tricky.

It's not just the heat, either, but the lightning and thunderstorms. We had three games delayed in the group stage alone due to ""adverse weather.""

Ogden: The weather. The poor attendances so far at the Club World Cup won't be repeated next summer -- that's a totally different ballgame -- but the unpredictable and severe weather that has led to several games being suspended for long periods is a concern that won't go away.

It may be too late to make all the necessary changes to help minimize the weather disruption next summer, but things can still be done. For instance, more games could be scheduled for stadiums with retractable roofs and climate control to make life easier for players and spectators and kickoff times should be reassessed to ensure there are no games starting at midday.

It will be hot throughout the host nations (U.S., Canada and Mexico) next summer, regardless of where games are staged. With only four of the 16 venues having a retractable roof, FIFA should reevaluate whether some cities / stadiums are really up to the requirements.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discusses how Inter Miami should feel after late goals from Palmeiras result in the MLS side facing off against PSG.

Becherano: Between the dangerous weather conditions and unsatisfactory pitches, FIFA must address these concerns heading into the 2026 World Cup. Several coaches pointed out the sweltering heat throughout the group stage, with some figures blaming the conditions for substandard performances on the field. Even when winning, players cite the climate as upsetting. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca went as far as to say it is impossible to train.

Beyond the heat, PSG manager Luis Enrique mentioned the pitches force the ball to bounce like ""rabbits,"" disturbing their style of play. While spectators tune into these tournaments to be entertained, FIFA must consider accommodating the players first.

Kirkland: The heat, and not just for the players, but for the fans. Pictures of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich substitutes watching their matches in their locker rooms to stay out of the sun are one thing, but expecting fans -- some of whom have paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, and are attending games with their families, with young children -- to sit in the stands at midday, in a stadium with no roof, and no protection from the summer sun, is unacceptable. We all know TV audiences are the priority, but match-going fans need to be treated better.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Cobos: The World Cup will have problems on and off the field. The heat of the U.S. summer will lower the technical level and intensity of the matches and with 48 teams, many of them unremarkable, it will be difficult to fill stadiums.

Olley: Public transport for the supporters and the differing conditions for the players. The popularity in the U.S. of driving to major sporting events is pot replicated in many other countries, and a little like when Wimbledon but the roof on Centre Court, the conditions in the U.S. can create two different tournaments. Imagine during the group stage, one team has to play in 40C heat while another is in an air-conditioned stadium. The latter will have an undeniably have an advantage as the competition progresses.

Nobody can expect FIFA to control the weather, but at the same time, just five of the 16 arenas to be used across the U.S., Canada and Mexico next summer have a fixed or retractable roof. There is a delicate balancing act to be found between sharing the use of those stadiums around and finding late kickoff times, doing their best to avoid any team being unduly affected by the heat.

Carino: Schedules have been one of the main issues in this tournament. Ratings matter on television, as they do in the European and Asian markets, but the spectacle on the field has to be the most important thing. The players have suffered with the weather in some areas. In California, Atlético Madrid, Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain played in temperatures north of 95°F and extreme humidity, and it has been noticeable on the field. For the World Cup, they need to find a solution and decide whether ratings matter more than the integrity of the players and a good spectacle.

Dawson: You can argue as much as you like about whether Auckland City -- essentially an amateur team -- deserve their place in the Club World Cup alongside the likes of Real Madrid and River Plate. But after they were smashed 10-0 in their opening game against Bayern Munich, surely no one can deny that their 1-1 draw against Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their final group game was the feel-good story of the group stage. Yes, they're going home early, but they deserve immense credit for their performance and result.

Marcotti: I'll go with Mamelodi Sundowns for the way they nearly came back against Borussia Dortmund, losing 4-3, and held Fluminense to a draw in their final game. Bouncing back like this after the disappointment of the CAF Champions League final is big enough; playing with the sort of style they showed is a bonus. They more than lived up to their Brazil-inspired jerseys.

Julien Laurens explains why he thinks River Plate's exit from the FIFA Club World Cup is a ""huge failure"" for the club.

Ogden: Christian Gray's goal for Auckland City in their surprise 1-1 draw with Boca Juniors epitomized what this kind of tournament should be about: a part-time player scoring a goal that he and his teammates will remember forever.

Gray, a PE teacher in New Zealand, and the majority of his Auckland squad had to take time off from their day jobs to participate in the Club World Cup, and it had been a chastening experience due to a 10-0 defeat against Bayern Munich and a 6-0 loss to Benfica.

With Argentine giants Boca needing a big win to have any hope of qualification, another hammering seemed to be inevitable for Auckland in Nashville. But despite falling behind in the first-half, the Oceania champions fought back with Gray earning them a draw with his goal.

""I'm from a small town, a long way from here and a lot different to this environment,"" Gray said after the game. ""So it is somewhat of a dream.""

Becherano: The Lionel Messi free kick against FC Porto marked the group stage for me. Inter Miami was practically written off against the European side, but that moment from the Argentine forward seemed to silence all that doubted in the stadium and from afar.

Kirkland: It didn't matter if it was on the beach, at a nightclub, or in Walmart: Boca Juniors fans were everywhere in south Florida during this Club World Cup. The unrivalled, passionate support of tens of thousands of Los Xeneizes, inside and outside stadiums, was just what this tournament needed.

Sadly, on the field, their team didn't come close to living up to that backing, crashing out thanks to an embarrassing 1-1 draw with amateurs Auckland City, a result which was another highlight.

Cobos: The South American fans' party, which saved FIFA from total failure in this Club World Cup in terms of the football atmosphere.

Olley: Let's give Lionel Messi his due. He was shoehorned into this tournament in a typically cynical way by FIFA -- Inter Miami were awarded a spot as ""hosts"" -- but his free-kick against Porto was the social media viral clip they were desperate for in return. Messi turned 38 this week and any chance to see him on a major stage like this is of significant value.

Oh, and Inter Miami's surprising level of performance has earned him what nobody thought possible: a reunion with Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.

Carino: The atmosphere generated by the Monterrey and River Plate fans at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena. Any Mexican team can feel like the home team in Los Angeles, but the Rayados fans have organized their own party before their matches, and the passion of Los Millonarios was also on full display. The match was key for both teams in the group stage, but both fan bases also had their own cheering matches before and during the game. More than 15,000 Argentines tried to silence the more than 40,000 Mexican fans who were in attendance.

Dawson: It's hard to look past Real Madrid. They haven't had the easiest group stage, but they're clearly desperate to win it. If there's a club who are all about earning the title of world champions it's Real Madrid. They're still a bit of an unknown while they get used to life under new manager Xabi Alonso, but it would be typical of them to turn up in the knockout rounds and win it all.

Marcotti: I think Manchester City are really well equipped. Guardiola has rotated a fair bit, they're deep and given the way last season went, they may well feel they have a point to prove.

Ogden: For the sake of the tournament, I would love to see one of the Brazilian teams emerge as champions, but the reality is that one of the European giants will probably build the momentum required to go all the way. On that front, it's hard to look beyond Paris Saint-Germain who, despite losing to Copa Libertadores champions Botafogo, look the most likely to emerge from the pack.

Luis Enrique's team are full of belief after their Champions League success and they have enough youth in the side to be able to cope with the physical demands of the competition. They will be far too strong for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in the Round of 16, and they should also overcome Flamengo or Bayern Munich in the quarters, so I'm backing them to add the Club World Cup to their Champions League title.

Rob Dawson believes Pep Guardiola will be happy with his team after their impressive display vs. Juventus.

Becherano: Between group stage performances and the path forward to the final, Bayern Munich stand as my top contenders. The team seem to be taking this tournament extremely seriously, especially as Harry Kane looks to add more trophies to his name.

Kirkland: Paris Saint-Germain. It's not a particularly original prediction: They're the best team in Europe right now, and probably the world. They've got a very winnable last-16 tie against Inter Miami. It gets trickier after that, with a possible quarterfinal clash with Bayern Munich or dark horses Flamengo, and maybe Real Madrid in the semifinals, but PSG are a better team than any of them.

Cobos: Manchester City.

Olley: It would be very Manchester City to put recent difficulties behind them and find a way to win. Manager Pep Guardiola has heavily rotated his teams to this point and they are still bedding in new signings, but they've looked as strong as anyone so far.

Carino: History dictates that this spot has to be reserved for Real Madrid. The Champions League's biggest winner is still the favorite, but they must show it on the field. They've left doubts, but they're still Real Madrid. Controversy or not, they're the favorites to advance and win.

Dawson: You probably can't be classed as a ""surprise team"" if you come into a tournament as champions of Brazil, but Botafogo have got the opportunity to go deep. They've already beaten Paris Saint-Germain and despite finishing second in Group B, they're in the kinder half of the draw -- with Benfica or Chelsea awaiting the winner of Saturday's game -- which gives them a great chance of reaching the semifinals. Once there, anything could happen.

Marcotti: I guess it comes down to what we define as a ""surprise"" team. It feels weird to call, say, Flamengo or Benfica ""surprise teams,"" but I guess I'll go with Monterrey. I didn't think they'd qualify ahead of River Plate, and their Round of 16 game against Borussia Dortmund is manageable.

Ogden: Benfica. Their performance in the 1-0 win against Bayern Munich highlighted Benfica's quality, but also their ability to cope with the demanding conditions. Bruno Lage's team will be underdogs to beat Chelsea in the Round of 16, but they look a more cohesive unit than the Premier League side and I expect them to emerge with a win and book a quarterfinal against Palmeiras or Botafogo.

Once it gets to the quarterfinal stage, every team still involved will believe they can go all the way and Benfica will face a tough challenge against either of the Brazilian teams. But they have been a surprise package so far and Benfica look capable of extending their stay in the U.S. for quite a while yet.

Ale Moreno reflects on Real Madrid's win over RB Salzburg in the Club World Cup and how the players are adapting to Xabi Alonso's new system.

Becherano: I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as a surprise after their victory over PSG, but Botafogo could be the Brazilian side to stun most opponents from here. The team came into the competition with something to prove and are set to represent the Conmebol region well.

Kirkland: Do Flamengo, the best team in Brazil right now, count as a surprise? They've got one of the best young coaches around in Filipe Luis, and their win over Chelsea showed they can beat top European opposition. Sunday's last-16 game with Bayern Munich will tell us how seriously they should be taken -- win that, and they can go all the way.

Cobos: Botafogo. They advanced in the most difficult group and even beat the Champions League champions, Paris Saint-Germain, which was a feat. Without a doubt, they are my bet among the surprises to go furthest.

Olley: It does feel as though the cat is out of the bag with the South American teams, but I'll go with Botafogo to run deep. Igor Jesus scored the famous winning goal against PSG and has impressed with his physicality. On paper, their portion of the bracket offers hope of further progress given after Palmeiras, they would face either a Chelsea side still searching for rhythm and Benfica, who were surprise winners of their group.

Carino: Any of the Brazilian teams that qualify for the next round. The Brazilians have caused European clubs to suffer and while they've lost some of these games, I think this competition has caused UEFA to look at Latin American soccer with a bit more respect.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

One side of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup knockout-round bracket looks significantly easier to manage than the other. 

Manchester City sits on the easier half of the draw, where Inter Milan, Chelsea and Benfica also reside. Erling Haaland and Co. have an easy round-of-16 match on paper with Al-Hilal.

At minimum, City's knockout-round opener looks far easier than what Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Juventus have in store for them. 

PSG, Bayern, Real Madrid, Juve, Inter Miami, Monterrey, Flamengo and Borussia Dortmund reside on the bottom half of the bracket.

Whichever team emerges from the bottom half will be battle-tested and potentially worn out, while Man City could cruise into the final.

Predictions

Manchester City will be expected to reach the final from the top half of the bracket. 

City has one of the best strikers in the world in Haaland plus a loaded attack around him that includes Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden and Savinho.

City proved just how strong it can be against a top opponent during its 5-2 rout over Juventus to close out group play on Thursday.

The only true challenge to Man City before the final could come from the South American powers, whether it be Palmeiras, Botafogo or Fluminense. 

Man City is more than comfortable with playing Chelsea, Benfica or Inter Milan at any point of the competition, and if its attack is firing like it did against Juve, it will be hard to stop no matter the opponent.

The bottom half of the bracket is a who's who of world club soccer powers, which makes that bracket more difficult to predict. 

PSG owns the easiest matchup on paper against Inter Miami, but the Major League Soccer side has Lionel Messi to its advantage. The Messi-Luis Suarez combination might at least make life difficult for the newly-crowned UEFA Champions League winner. 

Bayern-Flamengo, Real Madrid-Juventus and Dortmund-Monterrey are powerhouse matchups on paper. Do not be surprised if one, or both, of the German clubs fall in the round of 16. 

Real Madrid should pull away from Juventus, and you could make the case Los Blancos have a relatively easy path to the semifinals since it will be heavily favored against the Dortmund-Monterrey winner. 

Staying fresh in the American summer heat is a factor to longevity in the tournament as well. Man City and Real Madrid could be poised to rest their stars in second halves due to the stature of their matchups. 

PSG probably will not have that luxury because of the Messi matchup and a quarterfinal clash with either Flamengo or Bayern. 

A Man City-Real Madrid final might be boring because it's a matchup we see all the time in the UEFA Champions League, but that's what the bracket could produce.

Prediction: Manchester City over Real Madrid

The FIFA World Cup is coming to North Texas next year and the Irving Police Department is already expressing concerns about staffing and safety.

Tom Hover, the assistant chief of police of Field Operations for IPD, explained the department's concerns during a city council meeting on Thursday. 

""Everybody compares the World Cup games to a Super Bowl,"" said Hover. ""But the difference between a Super Bowl and what's happening with FIFA is there's only one Super Bowl, while there's 104 games that are going on for FIFA World Cup.""

The department is requesting that the city council consider $1,706,277 to $5,921,266 in overtime based on team selection, which IPD cannot confirm until after January 1.

While AT&T Stadium is where nine marquee matches are scheduled — the most in North America, Irving is a base camp, and the city will still see a lot more action than many anticipate, Hover said.

""While Arlington hosts the games themselves, the rest of the cities in [North Texas] that'll be contributing, the movements of the teams, the security of the teams, whether it's to and from practice or to and from the events itself or back and forth into the airport,"" he said.

Here are a few things happening simultaneously with the massive sporting event:

Hover said police still have to maintain daily life for Irving as well. Parking, for instance, may become an issue.

""Our day-to-day lives, our community still does their normal, normal, everyday work,"" he said. ""And so not only do we have to prepare for what the World Cup is, but we have to continue on providing the same services and the same level of services to our community. So it's going to be it's going to be a challenge.""

Council members were uncertain whether they had voted to approve the funding if the city would be reimbursed.

There's a common phrase in Argentina that is synonymous with the country's sporting culture.

In English, it's best described as ‘grit' or ‘tenacity'. In Argentina, where male athletes and men's teams are judged by their steel and resilience, the ultimate badge of honor is linked to the strength of their nether regions.

Advertisement

‘Poner huevo', in the figurative sense of the definition, is to leave everything on the field. To fight for your teammates, club or country at all costs and against all odds. The literal definition is to ‘have balls, or eggs (huevos)', and that's River Plate fullback Marcos Acuña's calling card. Nicknamed ‘El Huevo', Acuña has made a living by playing football on the edge.

Diminutive in stature but built like an Olympic wrestler, the former Sevilla star earned his moniker with Club Ferro Carril Oeste, a proud second-division team with a unique relationship with Aston Villa. Acuña came up through the Ferro, which is located in the Caballito neighborhood of Buenos Aires.

Acuña stood out as a young player for his relentless play and his fearless desire to tackle despite his size. He moved to Racing Club in 2014, two years before making his senior international debut for Argentina. A period at Sporting CP in Portugal was preceded by his most noteworthy spell in Spain with Sevilla, where he cemented his reputation in La Liga as a technical and bruising defender. He started four matches for Argentina during the title run at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

His profile at the top level has been understated, but highly valued by Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni; Acuña is the type of player most coaches would relish having on their side.

“He's quiet, but if you're going to war, you go with ‘El Huevo' Acuña,” Scaloni told ESPN in 2021. “El Huevo is a guy we appreciate in a special way — and he knows it. Getting words out of him is hard. But when he speaks, he says just the right thing. And when he has to play, he plays, he gives it everything… He's the kind of player we like to have.”

On Wednesday in Seattle, Acuña played like his alias. The 33-year-old was among River Plate's top performers in their 2-0 loss to Champions League runners-up Inter at the Club World Cup. But Acuña's fiery personality got the better of him after the final whistle. It took a handful of River Plate players, plus Inter coach Cristian Chivu and River Plate's team bodyguard, to restrain Acuña, who became enraged and ran after Inter's Denzel Dumfries as the Dutch international headed to the stadium's tunnel.

Dumfries and Acuña aren't strangers. They last faced each other in 2022, during a highly combative World Cup quarterfinal in Qatar.

Argentina and the Netherlands battled to a 2-2 draw before the former prevailed 4-3 in the penalty shootout. There was also a bench-clearing scuffle between both sides that raised the temperature to a boiling point.

After Lautaro Martinez scored the winning penalty, several Argentina players taunted their opponents as they celebrated their qualification to the semifinals. The images of Argentina's players laughing in the faces of the devastated Dutch side were seen by the football world. But there's one video that was obscure, and that may have led to the clash between Acuña and Dumfries in Seattle.

Aca no se acuerda nadie porque estaban todos festejando pero lo de Acuña y Dumfries viene de aca. pic.twitter.com/BZzQl7EAIl

— lautaro (@notlauti_) June 26, 2025



An overhead angle of Argentina's celebrations sees Acuña bait Dumfries. A melee ensued and Dumfries was shown a second yellow. Acuña, a left fullback, was Scaloni's answer to containing the speedy Dumfries. The two players became very familiar with each other that day. When the Club World Cup groups were announced, the River Plate and Inter match was among the most anticipated of the group stage.

There wasn't a great deal of friction between the two during the match. Both players got the better of each other at times, but they kept it professional until Alessandro Bastoni put the game on ice in second-half stoppage time. Acuña had previously been triggered by something one of Inter's assistant coaches had said, so the tensions were rising.

With River Plate's elimination a certainty, Acuña became enraged and tangled with Dumfries on the ground after he dragged the Inter defender down by his shirt. They both shared a sinister grin and that's when the two began to exchange pleasantries. Perhaps Acuña reminded the Dutch fullback that Dumfries had left Qatar without a medal.

After the match, Inter captain Martinez, Acuña's Argentina teammate, revealed how the ordeal was resolved.

“I spoke with Marcos. He's a great person, and that's that,” Martínez said. “I've known him for years. These are situations that happen in the heat of the match. It happened, it was a momentary bout of anger, but everything stays on the field. The confrontation… stayed on the field. Acuña and Dumfries made peace inside the locker room.”

River Plate manager Marcelo Gallardo lauded his team's effort against one of the strongest teams in Europe. The incident between Acuña and Dumfries, though, marred the Argentine club's participation in the tournament. Fans and pundits in South America blasted River Plate and Acuña for failing to lose honorably.

“I understand the emotions of the players, but the ending is not the image we want to show,” Gallardo said. “A fight between two players causes everyone to get involved. It's not River's style for things to end that way.”

Gallardo wasn't proud of his player's behavior after the final whistle. But for El Huevo Acuña, the question remains whether he's a modern-day hard man or a victim of his own pride.

The Reds have already spent big this summer, but they have plenty more work to do before their Premier League title defence begins

For a club that likes to go the odd year without a signing, Liverpool sure are getting some major business done early this summer. They've secured long-term successors to full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson in Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong and Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez, while there was also the small matter of breaking the British transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz for £116 million ($158m), add-ons dependent.

There were plenty of jokes over Richard Hughes' appointment as sporting director when all he did in his first window was make the low-risk signing of Federico Chiesa on a cut-price deal from Juventus. They all laughed at him, and you have to say, they aren't laughing now. The Reds mean business, and are cleary not content on simply winning the Premier League. Their window of opportunity is open and they are doing all they can this summer to ensure they take advantage.

Three marquee signings down, there's still work for Liverpool to get done before the window closes, be that internally or externally. GOAL runs through the seven priorities left to sort ahead of the deadline:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL US presents CWC XI: Key observations from the conclusion of the group stage, and a look ahead to the knockouts

You'd be forgiven for being a bit blurry-eyed during the second week of the Club World Cup. Major tournaments - yes, we're calling this a major tournament now - sometimes get like that. There's a bit of a mid-group tedium. Results sort of matter, sort of don't.

Everyone is basically waiting for the last matchday. And it delivered. The final games of the group stage properly ironed things out. The pretenders are all gone, while the real teams with real quality showed that they really want to win.

Mostly, though, this was charmingly about football heritage, with the names that you grew up watching or playing FIFA with showing they can still kick a ball a bit. Does the world still need Sergio Ramos, 39, kicking the living daylights out of strikers? TBD. But it sure is loads of fun to watch him do it for a Mexican side in 100-degree weather.

Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola realized he can coach a team to play very good football again, and Xabi Alonso is doing some tactically groovy things with Real Madrid.

Hubert Hurkacz announced his withdrawal from Wimbledon on Friday afternoon due to irritation of his synovial membrane.

One year ago, the Polish star tore his right meniscus during his second-round Wimbledon match against Arthur Fils. Hurkacz will not be able to compete in the grass-court major this year at all.



“Over the past few weeks, you've seen me on court through both the highs and the more challenging moments. Unfortunately, today I have to share some difficult news,” Hurkacz wrote in a statement. “After careful consideration and consultation with my team, we have made the decision to withdraw from this year's Wimbledon. 

“During my preparations, my body reacted with irritation of the synovial membrane. This is a part of the ongoing recovery process following my recent surgery and requires rest and appropriate treatment.”

pic.twitter.com/7eg6nTM5mC

The 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist, currently No. 39 in the PIF ATP Rankings, lost in the first round at Roland Garros to Joao Fonseca and began his grass-court season in 's-Hertogenbosch, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut before withdrawing from his second-round match.

Hurkacz owns a 15-11 record this season. He helped Poland to the United Cup final at the start of the year and recently reached the Geneva final.

“It is not easy to step away from such a prestigious tournament,” Hurkacz said. “But I know this is the right decision for my long-term health and performance.”

Hurkacz was set to play Briton Billy Harris in the first round. He will be replaced by lucky loser Dusan Lajovic, who will face Harris for the first time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Jannik Sinner's pursuit of a maiden Wimbledon crown could hinge on a heavyweight semi-final clash with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner opens against countryman Luca Nardi at the grass-court major, following the draw on Friday morning. Djokovic, competing at his lowest seeding (sixth) since 2018, will begin his campaign for a record-tying eighth Wimbledon title against Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

Djokovic, who defeated Sinner at the All England Club in 2022 (QF) and 2023 (SF), is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with British No. 1 Jack Draper. The fourth-seeded Draper starts against Sebastian Baez and could face a testing third-round clash with in-form Halle champion Alexander Bublik.

In the bottom half of the draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz starts against 38-year-old Fabio Fognini. The 22-year-old Spaniard is riding an 18-match winning streak — the longest of his career — and could meet eighth seed Holger Rune in the quarter-finals.

If Alcaraz prevails, he will take on a qualifier, Oliver Tarvet or Leandro Riedi. Both men are competing in a Grand Slam main draw for the first time.

World No. 3 and three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, who takes on Arthur Rinderknech, is seeded to meet Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals. If the two stars clash in the last eight, Fritz will take confidence from owning an 8-5 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including a stretch of five consecutive victories that began at Wimbledon last year.

The fifth-seeded American Fritz begins against big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who memorably reached the fourth round on his first appearance at the grass major last year.

Rising star Joao Fonseca has been handed a popcorn opening match in his Wimbledon debut against British No. 2 Jacob Fearnley. Fonseca's fellow #NextGenATP players and main-draw debutants at SW19, Learner Tien and Nishesh Basavareddy, will face each other, with the winner setting a potential second-round clash with Rune.

The 19-year-old Czech, Jakub Mensik, is seeded to meet home favourite Draper in the fourth round, having defeated the Briton en route to his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami.

 The 2025 Wimbledon draw has thrown up some tantalising first-round men's singles clashes. They include two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz's meeting with former Top 10 star Fabio Fognini, while home favourite Jack Draper and fast-rising #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca face tough opening assignments. 

 ATPTour.com highlights five first-round matches to watch at the grass-court major. 



 [2] Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) vs. Fabio Fognini (ITA) 
Having defeated Novak Djokovic in the championship match to triumph at Wimbledon in both 2023 and 2024, Alcaraz will begin his campaign on a 14-match winning-streak at the grass major. He will bid to make that 15 by overcoming Fognini, a former No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Alcaraz has triumphed in each of the pair's two previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, both of which took place on clay in Rio de Janeiro (2022, 2023). While Alcaraz undoubtedly starts the match as a heavy favourite, he will be wary of a player whose shotmaking ability has earned him 17 victories against Top 10 opponents.

 [4] Jack Draper (GBR) vs. Sebastian Baez (ARG) 
The highest-seeded Briton in a Wimbledon singles draw since two-time champion Andy Murray competed as top seed in 2017, Draper will aim to show his home fans just how far he has come in the past 12 months with a big opening display against Sebastian Baez. Although he has never been past the second round at Wimbledon, Draper is 28-8 in 2025 and lifted his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in March in Indian Wells. 

 The 23-year-old lefty Draper will be hoping to build on his solid start to the 2025 grass season, a semi-final run at the Queen's Club last week, and he leads Baez 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Baez holds a 3-7 career record on grass, but the Argentine is a seven-time ATP Tour champion who was inside the Top 20 as recently as last August. 

 [5] Taylor Fritz (USA) vs. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (FRA) 
Grass-court tennis is known as a favourite of big servers and there are few more suited to the surface than Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Fritz is a four-time ATP Tour champion on grass and is into another semi-final in Eastbourne this week. 

 Meanwhile the 6' 8” Mpetshi Perricard, the Most Improved Player of the Year in the 2024 ATP Awards, finished last year with the best Serve Quality (9.5) on Tour according to Tennis Data Innovations' INSIGHTS. The Frenchman, who has struggled for wins in 2025, will need his biggest weapon to fire if he is to upset the fifth-seeded Fritz in the pair's maiden tour-level meeting. 

 Jacob Fearnley (GBR) vs. Joao Fonseca (BRA) 
The 18-year-old Fonseca has generated big atmospheres and hype around the world in 2025, but the Brazilian will likely be up against a crowd pulling for his opponent on his Wimbledon main-draw debut. Jacob Fearnley is the No. 2 Briton in the PIF ATP Rankings, having reached a career-high No. 49 earlier this month. 

 Still cutting his teeth on grass, Fonseca will be aiming to make a big impact at his third consecutive Grand Slam. He stunned then-Top 10 star Andrey Rublev at January's Australian Open and did the same to Hubert Hurkacz en route to the third round at Roland Garros. Can the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion silence the home crowd early against Fearnley? 

 [18] Ugo Humbert (FRA) vs. Gael Monfils (FRA) 
A pair of highly-skilled French favourites meets in a popcorn opening showdown at Wimbledon. The 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert is a seven-time tour-level titlist, a tally that includes an ATP 500 title on grass in Halle. Meanwhile his countryman Monfils remains a daunting opponent and crowd favourite, even at the age of 38. 

 Humbert leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-2, but Monfils won two of the pair's three meetings in 2024 (all of which took place on hard courts). The former Top 10 star will be hopeful of levelling his rivalry with Humbert in the pair's second grass-court meeting.

She knows what I care about and vice vers","https://en.as.com/other_sports/former-atp-no-1-if-something-were-to-happen-to-me-its-all-hers-she-knows-what-i-care-about-and-vice-versa-theres-a-lot-of-trust-n/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 09:45:37 GMT","

Eight-time Grand Slam winner André Agassi has spoken of the deep “trust” he shares with wife Steffi Graf, a fellow tennis legend.

André Agassi has spoken of the “trust” that underpins his relationship with his wife, fellow former tennis star Steffi Graf.

Talking on the Action Plan financial podcast, Agassi lifted the lid on the multimillionaire couple's estate planning, telling host Rich Roll that he and Graf know exactly what each other's needs are.

“If something were to happen to me, it's all hers,” the 55-year-old said. “Because she knows what I care about and vice versa.

“And so she would take care of everybody and everything that she knows I would. So there's a lot of trust in that.”

Asked what legacy he hopes to leave as a person, Agassi told Roll he wants anyone he has met to have benefited from the encounter. 

“My hope would be that anybody that I contact with, whether it was 25-year marriage, whether it was my children, whether it was the waiter at the restaurant, for whatever time spent with me, they felt better off for it,” he said.

“On a small level or a big level. A meaningful level. Just are you better off for the time spent? I would have loved for everybody to be able to feel that way around me.”

Agassi and Graf, who have a combined net worth reported to be around $300 million, have been together since 1999. They married in October 2001 and share two children: son Jaden, born the year of their wedding, and daughter Jazz, born in 2003.

Agassi, who won eight Grand Slam titles during his tennis career, has frequently spoken publicly about his devotion to Graf, a 22-time major winner.

Notably, the American paid a memorably heartfelt tribute to the German during a 2004 speech at her International Tennis Hall of Fame induction ceremony. 

“As I attempt to find words worthy to introduce the person that has changed my life, I realise the words have yet to be invented that are large enough, colorful enough, or true enough to express the heart and soul of this woman that I love,” Agassi said.

Top seed and seven-time champion land in same half

The Wimbledon draw was conducted on Friday and there's plenty to look forward to at the All England Club.

Two-time defending men's singles champion Carlos Alcaraz is the No.2 seed and he'll open proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against Italian veteran Fabio Fognini.

Meanwhile, reigning women's champion Barbora Krejcikova is the No.17 seed and she'll kick off Centre Court action on Tuesday against Filipina rising star Alex Eala.

Here's what we learned from the 2025 Wimbledon draw…

As the No.6 seed, Novak Djokovic managed to dodge Sinner's and Alcaraz's quarters of the draw but the Serb landed in the top half, which is headlined by the No.1-ranked Sinner.

Before he can get to a potential semi-final against Jannik Sinner, Djokovic must navigate a tricky path that includes possible meetings with in-form American Alex Michelsen in the third round, Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur in the last 16, and fourth-seeded Jack Draper, or Halle champion Alexander Bublik, or Czech big-serve Jakub Mensik in the quarter-finals.

The seven-time Wimbledon champion will open his campaign on Tuesday against France's Alexandre Müller, whose reaction to the draw on social media was classic.

Sinner will begin his quest for a maiden Wimbledon crown and a fourth major title against fellow Italian Luca Nardi in round one.

The world No.1 has been drawn to potentially face another compatriot, last year's semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti in the quarters and has the likes of Grigor Dimitrov, Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton in his way.

Alcaraz arrives at these Championships riding an 18-match winning streak that includes title runs in Rome, Roland-Garros, and Queens.

The last player to beat Alcaraz was Holger Rune, in the Barcelona final on April 20. The pair could reunite at Wimbledon in the quarter-finals.

The first seed Alcaraz could bump into in the draw is Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is having a decent run on grass in Mallorca this week.

Besides Rune, Frances Tiafoe and Jiri Lehecka are also possible quarter-finalist opponents for Alcaraz, while the likes of Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev or Matteo Berrettini are all potential match-ups for the Spaniard in the semis.

Alcaraz is looking to become just the second man in the Open Era, behind Bjorn Borg, to pull off the Roland-Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive seasons.

As a British No.4 seed, Draper will have the weight of a nation's hopes on his shoulders when he steps on the court on Tuesday against Argentina's Sebastian Baez.

His route gets tougher and tougher with each round.

The 23-year-old could get former Wimbledon finalist and recent Nottingham Challenger champion Marin Cilic in round two, Halle champion Alexander Bublik in round three, Jakub Mensik in round four, Djokovic in the quarter-finals, and Sinner in the semis.

It would be remarkable if he pulls this off!

Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka will open her Wimbledon account against Canadian Carson Branstine, who dispatched Roland-Garros semi-finalist Loïs Boisson and former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in the qualifying rounds this week.

In the third round, Sabalenka might square off with 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, who last week knocked out the world No.1 in straight sets en route to the Berlin title.

Vondrousova has a tough opener though against Nottingham champion McCartney Kessler.

Sabalenka could face her Australian Open final conqueror Madison Keys in the quarter-finals, and has last year's Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini, or fifth-seeded Zheng Qinwen as potential semi-final opponents.

Reigning Roland-Garros champion Coco Gauff has a difficult opening match against Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska, who handed the American a bagel in their most recent meeting in Madrid before Gauff rallied back to win.

Sofia Kenin, the No.28 seed, possibly looms ahead for Gauff in round three, before a potential quarter-final against 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina or five-time major champion Iga Swiatek.

Third-seeded Jessica Pegula, defending champion Barbora Krejcikova, and seventh-seeded Mirra Andreeva are all possible semi-final opponents for Gauff.

LONDON — Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff are helping usher in a new era for tennis.

Wimbledon — the year's third major championship tournament, the oldest of all four and the only one played on grass — starts Monday at the All England Club. The sport's most recent Grand Slam singles champions are Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and Gauff, a 21-year-old American, each at No. 2 in their respective tour rankings and coming off French Open titles secured in riveting finals against the sport's No. 1 players.

They are young, they are charismatic as an be on the court, and they are media-friendly off it.

Along with current No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and former No. 1 Iga Swiatek on the WTA Tour, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner on the ATP Tour, Gauff and Alcaraz offer a bright future for tennis. The timing couldn't be better for a sport with a fan base that in recent years saw all-time greats Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal walk away and currently might be pondering how much longer Novak Djokovic will contend for the biggest prizes.

""Tennis is just in such a great, great place right now. We are so fortunate to have not only Coco, not only Carlos, but a deep bench of young stars that are just propelling the growth of our sport,"" said Stacey Allaster, the director of the U.S. Open, a hard-court major in New York that is played in September and caps the Grand Slam year.

Allaster was the chair and CEO of the WTA from 2009-15.

""I've been around a long time, and when we have lost great, iconic champions in the past, there's generally been a little bit of a dip,"" she said. ""We have had the exact opposite during this transition. ... I always like to say the champions of today are standing on the shoulders of the champions of the past. These champions have jumped off the shoulders of the past champions.""

One key for a sport — especially one mostly based on individual success — to gain attention and grow popularity is to have rivalries that demand buy-in.

Alcaraz versus Sinner on the ATP Tour clearly provides that, much in the way that Federer-Nadal or Djokovic-Nadal did in the ""Big Three"" era for men's tennis.

Alcaraz and Sinner, a 23-year-old Italian, added a chapter to their rivalry earlier this month at the French Open. The five-set, 5 1/2-hour men's singles final on the red clay of Roland-Garros was as full of momentum swings, terrific tennis and athleticism as anything the greats that came before them conjured.

""The level was insane,"" said Alcaraz, who will be seeking a third straight Wimbledon title and sixth major championship overall.

The way he and Sinner are currently divvying up the biggest prizes — they've split the past six major trophies for men's singles and eight of the past 11 — is certainly reminiscent of the Big Three's dominance, albeit over a much smaller sample size so far.

""Having these two guys fighting for big trophies — I think we have to be very happy about it in the sport of tennis,"" said Juan Carlos Ferrero, who was the men's singles champion at the 2003 French Open and currently serves as Alcaraz's main coach. ""For them, for sure it's something that they raise their level every time that they go on the court. They know they have to play unbelievable tennis to beat the other guy, and it's something that is going to help for sure each player to raise the level even more.""

It sure does seem as though Gauff versus Sabalenka could provide that sort of dynamic and buzz, too.

Consider that, like Alcaraz and Sinner, they occupy the top two spots in the rankings. And consider that, like those other two, both own multiple major titles. Gauff's two Grand Slam singles triumphs came via three-set victories over Sabalenka in the finals, with the first at the 2023 U.S. Open.

Plus, their latest meeting, at Roland-Garros less than a month ago, came with some added spice because of Sabalenka's comments after the match that were seen as less than fully gracious toward Gauff.

It became such a thing that the 27-year-old from Belarus felt the need to issue a pair of apologies: one privately via writing to Gauff, and one publicly in an interview at her next tournament.

Add that sort of off-court intrigue to the on-court interest, and if there are rematches at the All England Club a couple of weeks from now, no one who is invested in tennis will be displeased.

""There's incredible momentum and wind in our sales as we think about the sport, in total,"" said Lew Sherr, who is about to leave his role as the CEO of the U.S. Tennis Association. ""We've had five consecutive years of participation growth ... and that certainly is being, in part, fueled by the great talent and inspiring players we have at the professional level, and also is feeding record attendance, record interest, record viewership.

""Those things go hand in hand. We have not missed a beat.""

Defense in danger?

Barbora Krejcikova's bid to repeat as Wimbledon women's singles champion is in doubt after the 29-year-old from Czech Republic withdrew Thursday from the Eastbourne Open on Thursday due to what she described via a released statement as ""soreness"" in her right thigh.

Krejcikova, who gave Varvara Gracheva a walkover win in the quarterfinals at Devonshire Park, initially felt pain on Wednesday during her second-round victory over Jodie Burrage. The problem worsened overnight, and she was going for a medical scan as part of further testing. Her opening match at Wimbledon is scheduled for Tuesday.

""I think it's better with Wimbledon in the next couple of days just to rest it and to see what's going on and to resolve that,"" Krejcikova, current ranked 17th in women's singles, added in her statement.

Krejcikova beat Jasmine Paolini in last year's Wimbledon final, adding a second major titles in singles competition to her resumé after winning the 2021 French Open for her first. She is a seven-time major champion in women's doubles with a career Grand Slam, and she has won the Australian Open in mixed doubles three times.



Murray monument

Two-time Wimbledon men's singles champion Andy Murray will help design a statue of himself to mark the tournament's 150th anniversary in 2027.

Wimbledon organizers said Tuesday they aim to unveil the statue of the British tennis great during the 2027 edition.

""He's got to rightly be very involved in that, and him and his team will be,"" All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans said.

Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a home champion in men's singles in 2013 when he beat Djokovic in the final.

The Scotsman won a second title — and his third Grand Slam singles title overall — in the 2016 final against Milos Raonic.

An inspiration for the statue project is the way Nadal was honored, with Murray in attendance, this month at Roland-Garros, where he won 14 French Open men's singles titles.

""We looked at Rafa Nadal having that sort of plaque unveiled to him at Roland-Garros, which was all very special,"" Jevans said. ""But we thought, what do we want for Andy?""

A bronze statue of Fred Perry, the previous British men's champion before Murray in 1936, was put up at Wimbledon in 1984, marking 50 years after his first singles title at the tournament.

If you didn't see the men's final at this year's French Open, you likely heard about the match that was almost instantly dubbed one of the best of all time. After holding three match points on his serve against Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner saw the next two sets slip away until Alcaraz seized victory with a fifth-set tiebreak win. After the accolades (and the heartbreak) had a moment to settle, the question then became: How does Jannik Sinner, the world's number-one ranked player, recover from this? What does he do next? And how is he preparing for Wimbledon, which starts Monday, as Alcaraz goes for a three-peat? We called the three-time Grand Slam champion to find out.

Vogue: Where did you go and what did you do after that epic final at Roland-Garros?

Jannik Sinner: I went home to my parents' place [in the South Tyrol region of northeast Italy] and spent some time with them and with my friends and doing just normal stuff. We made barbecue, I played some table tennis with my friends—it was some good time off, and then after some days, I came to prepare for the tournament here. So, yeah—everything was good, was relaxed, and now I'm back—so let's see what we can do.

I'm sure you're eager to move forward from the French, but if I could just ask: Is it easier to deal with this kind of loss when everyone's saying it's one of the greatest matches in recent tennis history? Does that make you somehow more proud to be part of that—or does it make it even harder to deal with?

No, no—look, when I see how people talk about this match, I'm honestly happy to have been a part of it. People will, of course, remember who won and who lost, but they will also remember how good the match was—and to make a good match, you need two players, and I was one of them. So, of course it hurt—it still hurts at times—but it is what it is. When I was a kid, I would have never expected to play a final of a Grand Slam, or to be in the position I am in, so everything now is just positive. I understood the potential I have, but on the other hand, you just have to keep working, keep believing, keep searching for things you have to do better if you want to become a better player.

These are all things I'm trying to learn, and at 23 years old, you cannot know everything. It's impossible. Even if you're number one or number two or number three in the world, you always have to have people around you that you trust—about tennis, yes, but also in your personal life. It's maybe more important to have people around you whom you can trust completely—and that's exactly what I'm trying to do. At the moment, I have such great people around me—I have an amazing family, I have amazing friends who give me the possibility to be safe around them. For me, it's the only thing that matters. And with the right values off the court, having good people around you is going to help you, especially in tough moments.

This was, for sure, one of the tougher moments I've had in my career. Losing in a Grand Slam final, having had match points? It's tough. It's very, very tough. But it's happened before, and maybe in the future it can happen again, so it is what it is. But now it's also important to leave this behind—to remember what happened, because it was an amazing match and an amazing atmosphere—but to try to keep going. I'll try to make the best out of it, and try to be ready for Wimbledon.

Sinner during his men's singles final against Carlos Alcaraz at the 2025 French Open.

Is there anything specific that your friends or your family or your team told you?

No—everyone was just very proud of how I handled the situation: how I played tennis, yes, but also how I handled the situation after the loss. The only thing I wanted to do after that was to go back home to my parents and stay there and surround myself again with friends. That's exactly how I felt when I first left home when I was 13 years old [to train full-time for tennis], and I was searching again for these kind of feelings.

Do I understand it right that at that time, when you were 13 and you decided to leave home to pursue tennis, you were actually only playing maybe twice a week?

In the summer, yes—in winter, I was only playing once a week, maybe; there were weeks where I didn't play at all, because I was skiing and then I was playing indoor football with my friends. I never really played tennis until I was basically 12 years old, but then I put away the skis and started to play more football and also more tennis. But I never had one full week of practice—I had two or three sessions each week. I also never used to go to the gym, because I was always in nature.

It's just amazing to me.

I lived my childhood how I wanted to, and this is also thanks to my parents, who gave me the possibility to ski and play tennis—and I come from a normal family. As I said earlier, we never would've thought to be in the position we are in now. It's all very surprising, still, for all of us.

Does coming to tennis so relatively late mean that when you were very young, your childhood sports dreams had nothing to do with tennis? Did you dream about scoring the game-winning goal in the World Cup—or winning the downhill skiing gold at Kitzbühel or something?

No—when I was young, my dream was always to become a Formula 1 driver, but we never had money, and we understood straightaway that Formula 1 is so expensive, so we didn't even try. It was completely impossible to even think it. Later, when I started playing tennis, you could say my dream was to win some tournaments on the pro tour or whatever, but that was just not realistic: It was just a dream, not a goal. I never said my goal was to become number one in the world; most likely, that could only be a dream. It was not realistic in my head.

Your highest ranking as a junior was 133rd—and in 2018, you only played one juniors event. That same year you decided to go pro anyway. Did you have a vision that there was more to your game than what was being shown? What gave you the confidence—or the audacity—to commit to the pro tour?

For me, it was not important if I was a good junior player—I always wanted to see myself competing with the real players, and that's why I decided to try some Futures tournaments. I also had a couple of wild cards on the Challengers tour. Juniors are for experience, for trying to have some matches under your belt, but I wanted to see what I could learn if I played against the best players and older players with more experience. Everyone thinks differently, but that was my vision.

Why did you pick Halle for your Wimbledon warmup tournament, versus, say, Queens?

Halle is nearer to my hometown—and if I had gone to Queens, I would be staying in London for so long. You arrive half a week before the tournament, then you play one full week, have the next week off, and then after all that starts Wimbledon. And if I stay too long in one place… it's a bit too much for me.

So that's one of the reasons. But also, this tournament helped me so much when I was young—when I was 17 and basically nobody, they gave me a wild card and we started this good relationship, and I like to come to places where I've built up a kind of relationship. It's also just a good tournament, and a different tournament, because we sleep very near the courts—you don't have to take a car anywhere. It's all very simple, and I like that.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz 'could beat' Rafael Nadal on clay says Grand Slam finalist","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/stefanos-tsitsipas-carlos-alcaraz-rafael-nadal-clay-debate","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:53:45 GMT","

Tennis legend John McEnroe created a big stir when he suggested Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could have beaten a prime Rafael Nadal at the French Open, but Stefanos Tsitsipas has suggested that comment was not misplaced.

McEnroe admiration for Alcaraz and Sinner saw him claim the duo may have had a chance to dethrone the 14-time Roland Garros champion on a court he made his own, in comments that sparked a huge debate among tennis fans.

“You would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best,” the American said on TNT Sports. “The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.”

The notion that the greatest clay court player of all-time would have met his match against Alcaraz and Sinner was given some credence when the two young guns at the top of the men's game contested an epic Roland Garros final earlier this month.

Yet the idea that Nadal's Roland Garros levels have already been bettered by the players currently holding the top two positions in men's tennis is hard to imagine when we are talking about a player who has a statue to mark his greatness at the Paris venue.

Patrick Mouratoglou issues verdict on whether Alcaraz or Sinner would beat Nadal at his peak

John McEnroe offers an intriguing take as he answers Carlos Alcaraz question

Several leading names have dismissed McEnroe's comments, but former French Open finalist Tsitsipas has told Tennis365 that they carry plenty of weight.

Having played against Nadal, Alcaraz and Sinner on clay court, the Greek star is in a great position to evaluate McEnroe's statement and his verdict may be seen as a surprise.

Speaking exclusively to Tennis365 at the launch of Adidas' The London Originals Collection at a lavish pre-Wimbledon barbecue in London, he joined the debate on the level being produced by Alcaraz and Sinner as he compared them to the most successful clay court player of all-time.

“I have played both of them,” Tsitsipas told Tennis365 as he spoke about Alcaraz and Sinner. “Both of them are great ball strikers, both on clay and hard, but I would favour, as a creative player more, more of a creative player on clay, I would favour Carlos.

“I feel like he has way more options when he plays and it's quite evident and clear. I mean, it's not something absurd. And I would favour obviously Sinner on hard courts.

“So I would give Carlos more chances on Nadal on clay. If I have to bet my money somewhere.”

He went on to add: “I feel like Carlos would have chances against prime Nadal on clay. I think so. I'm not saying he would have beaten him, but he would have had chances to create something special against him.”

Tsitsipas went on to suggest the emergence of Alcaraz and Sinner should not be a surprise as he predicts more names will join them at the top of the game in the coming years.

“It's not annoying that these two guys are playing so well,” he added. “This is what you expect. It's going to keep happening that we have new champions, new stars. It's going to keep happening.

“It's part of the circle of the game and how things work. I'm telling you, in the next five years, we'll see more superstars enter the game and more players that have a different identity from those that are playing now.”

Swiatek came through against the Italian 6-1, 6-3. She'll play Jessica Pegula, the top seed, in Saturday's final

Iga Swiatek earned a significant breakthrough by reaching a career-first grass-court final, breezing past second-seeded Jasmine Paolini 6-1, 6-3 to reach Saturday's showpiece at the Bad Homburg Open.

In a repeat of last season's Roland-Garros final, the contest played out much the same as an irrepressible Swiatek simply overawed last year's Wimbledon runner-up, breaking five times in total compared to just the single break for Paolini.

The Pole, who has endured an underwhelming twelve months relative to her usual stratospheric standards, has yet to fully master grass-court tennis. Simply formidable on clay and already a hard-court Grand Slam champion, Swiatek has never make it past the quarter-finals of Wimbledon and her grass-court trophy cabinet remains empty.

That could be about to change, however, as the five-time major titlist looked as sharp and dangerous on the grass courts of Bad Homburg as she has on any other surface throughout her career.

Testament to Swiatek's woes over the past year is her current ranking of eighth in the world, having relinquished her iron-clad grip on the No 1 ranking before slumping alarmingly down the ladder.

A painful semi-final exit at her beloved Roland-Garros to arguably her biggest rival in Aryna Sabalenka brought a difficult year full circle with no titles to the Pole's name.

Since arriving on her less favoured grass courts, however, Swiatek has looked like she has received a fresh lungful of air, sweeping past three talented opponents without dropping a set.

As last season's Wimbledon runner-up, Paolini perhaps entered this match as the favourite against a wounded Swiatek who has typically been far less comfortable than the Italian on the grass. But this semi-final was one-way traffic from start to finish.

Swiatek broke three times without reply en route to taking the opening set comfortably.

Paolini struck first at the start of the second set, but it was a short-lived fightback, as the Pole broke straight back in the second game before surging rapidly into a 5-2 lead. A couple of games later and Swiatek had wrapped up an unexpectedly straightforward victory to move into her first final since Roland-Garros last year.

She will take on Jessica Pegula, the top seed in Bad Homburg, in tomorrow's final.

With hopes of a fourth straight Roland-Garros title dashed, perhaps this year Swiatek can attack Wimbledon with more purpose than in previous years, where she has often looked stuck in the aftermath and fatigue of her recent French Open triumphs.

A maiden grass-court title in Bad Homburg would provide a huge boost of confidence and momentum in the Pole's ongoing quest to conquer SW19.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Hurkacz withdraws from Wimbledon","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/hurkacz-wimbledon-2025-withdrawal","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 16:10:54 GMT","

Hubert Hurkacz announced his withdrawal from Wimbledon on Friday afternoon due to irritation of his synovial membrane.

One year ago, the Polish star tore his right meniscus during his second-round Wimbledon match against Arthur Fils. Hurkacz will not be able to compete in the grass-court major this year at all.



“Over the past few weeks, you've seen me on court through both the highs and the more challenging moments. Unfortunately, today I have to share some difficult news,” Hurkacz wrote in a statement. “After careful consideration and consultation with my team, we have made the decision to withdraw from this year's Wimbledon. 

“During my preparations, my body reacted with irritation of the synovial membrane. This is a part of the ongoing recovery process following my recent surgery and requires rest and appropriate treatment.”

The 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist, currently No. 39 in the PIF ATP Rankings, lost in the first round at Roland Garros to Joao Fonseca and began his grass-court season in 's-Hertogenbosch, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut before withdrawing from his second-round match.

Hurkacz owns a 15-11 record this season. He helped Poland to the United Cup final at the start of the year and recently reached the Geneva final.

“It is not easy to step away from such a prestigious tournament,” Hurkacz said. “But I know this is the right decision for my long-term health and performance.”

Hurkacz was set to play Briton Billy Harris in the first round. He will be replaced by lucky loser Dusan Lajovic, who will face Harris for the first time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

The Australian Open winner is ready for another tilt at Wimbledon after her injury heartbreak in last year's tournament

Before she won her first grand slam tournament at the Australian Open in January, Madison Keys had spent more than a year talking to a therapist about her life rather than just her tennis career. “When I'd gone to see sports psychologists in the past it had been a little tunnel-focused on routines and big moments on the court,” she says on a sleepy Sunday afternoon in London. “So being able to talk to someone about broader life philosophies helped me get to the root of why I was feeling that way instead of just being uber-focused on decisive moments in a match.”

The 30-year-old American, who is ready for another tilt at Wimbledon, remembers some of the wayward suggestions that specialist sports psychiatrists would advise her to follow at crucial stages of a match.

“It would be, like: ‘Make sure you look at your strings and do this specific thing and that'll just help the nerves go away.'”

Keys pauses when I ask if it was hard to open up to a stranger about her deeper and usually more hidden emotions during a therapy session. “I don't know if I would say that was hard,” she replies. “It was more that I was actually trying to be honest with myself about what I felt. There were a lot of instances where I would say something and I was surprised that's actually how I felt. Those are the kind of things that live in the back of your head you don't ever really pay attention to.”

She still talks to the same therapist and says: “One of the biggest things I've learned about myself is that, because of our sport, and our constant striving to be better, there's always something else [to do]. Sometimes you don't really take a moment to acknowledge how you feel or think about what's going on inside. You just put your head down and keep going into the next thing. At some point that catches up with you and so it was really important for me to learn how to actually just sit and be introspective and figure out what I was feeling and why. And then just being OK with that and not immediately trying to fix it and make it go away.”

The best tennis players are so consumed by their careers, and life on tour, that it often seems as if their true selves, as people, are forgotten. Did Keys become better at separating her personal identity from her tennis-playing persona? “I was able to do it more, but there are times when it feels like you've figured it out and things are great only for you to find it's not so simple.

“The hardest part about focusing on your mental health is that you've never done it [completely]. It's never box-checked off, so it's something I'll have to continue to be conscious of, because it's easy to fall into bad habits.”

Keys faced a difficult draw in Melbourne and had to win five three-set matches, beating four opponents in the top 10, including Iga Swiatek, world No 2 at the time, in an epic semi-final, and then the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka. She survived a match point against Swiatek and was pushed to the brink by Sabalenka before winning 7-5 in the third set. “I was most proud of how I took every round just as that round,” Keys says. “I was so focused and never got ahead of myself. Playing all these hard matches against top players really allowed me to focus and keep persevering. The fact that I played so many three-setters and was able to hold the trophy at the end of the two weeks was amazing.”

Eight years had passed since her only previous slam final when, at the 2017 US Open, she was crushed 6-3, 6-0 by her friend Sloane Stephens. The pressure of the occasion had been too much against Stephens and, in Melbourne, Keys said: “I've obviously thought of that match endlessly for the past eight years.” So, did her recent therapy help in those clutch moments of her first slam victory? “It helped me be a lot more free and have a clear mind in the moment,” Keys confirms. “I was able to force myself to be a little braver in those moments instead of being careful and tentative, and just go for it. It got to the point where a lot of the time you'd rather be brave. Maybe things don't go exactly how you want but you did them on your terms and you feel you have no regrets, versus if you're a little tentative or trying to be careful and it doesn't work out. That's when you really have regret.”

That regret had also been felt acutely in the semi-finals of the 2023 US Open. Keys led Sabalenka 6-0, 5-3 but, rather than maintaining her positivity, she became passive and hesitant and lost the match on successive tie-breaks. “I don't know if that was the exact moment, but obviously it was a tough loss,” Keys says of what prompted her to seek therapy. “Being in that position and not to be able to cross a line was definitely a kind of final reminder that: ‘Oh yes, maybe there's something that we can work on.'”

Keys also switched from using a Wilson racket to the larger Yonex and she tweaked her serve, but she admits that, apart from working on her mind, the most positive change in the past two years has been the appointment of her husband, Bjorn Fratangelo, as her coach.

“I was struggling when I asked him to help me out,” Keys recalls of the June 2023 move. “At the time it was supposed to be short term but then we immediately had success. I think the biggest hurdle for him was being comfortable in telling me what to do. That took time to get used to but, now, we're finding our stride.”

Fratangelo was a player who briefly cracked the world top 100 in 2016, but what are his best attributes as a coach? “He's really great at analysing what's going on [in a match] and he does it so quickly. Coupled with the fact that we obviously know each other very well and know how to communicate, he's able to see some things that I'm not seeing on the court. He then communicates in a way that I can actually do it.”

Keys says that as a couple, away from the court, “we do a pretty good job of balancing things. When we're home, we're very much home and tennis is off. Home is home and work is work. Sometimes it's harder to do than say but, for the most part, we've done a good job.”

In the French Open this month Keys looked on course for the semi-finals when she won the first set against Coco Gauff. But she crumbled in the third set of an error-strewn match and her fellow American went on to beat Sabalenka in another dramatic final in Paris.

“I was able to watch the last set,” Keys says, “and it's so amazing for Coco. I thought I could have won our match but nearly beating someone doesn't actually count.”

Keys laughs and then says of Gauff: “She's playing some great tennis and her clay season was phenomenal. It's obviously disappointing to be so close and then lose to the eventual champion. But at the same time it gives you a lot of confidence.”

Wimbledon is next and it is a tournament where she has reached two quarter-finals. In 2015 she beat Petra Kvitova and Venus Williams before losing to Serena Williams while, eight years later, she lost to Sabalenka in the quarters. Last year was even more painful when, in the fourth round, she was 5-2 up in the third set and two points from victory against Jasmine Paolini.

“I then tore my hamstring,” Keys says with a grimace. She retired at 5-5 and Paolini went on to make the final. “Hopefully this is the year I make it past the quarters because Wimbledon has always been something that I dreamed of. It has this aura which means that, I think, for all tennis players it's the tournament.”

It's hard to believe that Keys, a teenage prodigy, has been playing professionally since she was 14. “I feel every one of those past 16 years,” she says with a groaning kind of laugh.

Staying in Chelsea for a change, Keys reveals: “I wish I could say I'll be doing some sightseeing but I'd be lying if I feel like that actually might happen. But it's been nice to see a different part of London. I'm notorious for being stuck at Wimbledon all the years I've been here, so it's fun just to be in another part of the city.”

What would she most like to do in London? “When I'm in a big city I've always really loved doing that touristy bus thing where you can kind of see everything in one trip. If I have an afternoon off that would be the one thing I'd love to do – just hop on a bus and see all of the sights at least once.”

Kindness Wins is the non-profit foundation she set up in 2020 and its very name offers insight into her character and philosophy of life. “It means a lot to me,” she says, “because tennis has brought so much into my life and it's opened so many doors for me. I felt it was important to also give kids that opportunity because tennis teaches so many important life lessons. It helps kids learn those in a way where they can be competitive but also a good sport.

“So I wanted to make sure that I did whatever I could to make tennis more accessible for as many people that wanted to play it. Tennis also gives so many opportunities to go to college and meet new people – but it's a really expensive sport. So we try to help.”

The world seems short of kindness right now so how does she feel as an American living under Donald Trump? “It's definitely a tough time and it's hard to balance where you want to be informed and know what's going on but, at the same time, it's crazy.

“Sometimes it's hard to shut it off enough that you don't pull your hair out but also not being oblivious to what's going on and the realities of everything. It's definitely difficult at the moment.”

Keys smiles ruefully when I say that there are just three and a half more years of Trump's presidency to survive. “I know. After a few months I was like: ‘Oh, it's only been a few weeks!'”

At least the first month of Trump's return to the Oval Office also marked her victory at the Australian Open. Keys grins more broadly when I ask if the reality of winning her first grand slam lived up to the dream she had pursued for so long.

“It was great,” she says with another pealing laugh. “Being able to do it with that group of people around me was really special. So, yes, it was just pretty great.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Tennis

Wimbledon begins June 30, and the draws for the men's and women's singles are intriguing, while also throwing up some blockbuster first-round matches.

Novak Djokovic goes in pursuit of his 25th Grand Slam title, while defending champion Carlos Alcaraz seeks the French Open, Queen's and Wimbledon treble that has not been done since 2008.

On the women's side, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka enters as favorite after missing two recent editions, while 2023 champion Markéta Vondroušová is in form and ready to rekindle her fire in south-west London.

The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, analyze the match-ups and offer some of their picks for the best matches of the opening days.

The key to the men's draw? What kind of path it would pave for seven-time champion Novak Djokovic's pursuit of tennis history. His seeding, at No. 6, meant that he could have faced one of world No. 1 Jannik Sinner or defending champion Alcaraz in the quarterfinals.

Everyone wanted him as far away from them as possible. In the end, it was Alcaraz who got lucky, with Djokovic drawn in the top half and given a projected quarterfinal against Jack Draper. His semifinal path sets him up to face Sinner, who beat him during the same stage at Roland Garros a few weeks ago, as well as at last year's Australian Open. Alcaraz has lost his last two matches against Djokovic and four of his previous six, but the two victories brought him Wimbledon titles.

For Djokovic, looking for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam, the sharp end of any draw looks tough when seeded No. 6. But at Wimbledon, where he is looking for an eighth title, and where he last year reached the final last year a few weeks out from knee surgery, he knows he holds a major fear factor over the rest of the draw.

If he gets to the quarters, even as he approaches 40 and even with Sinner and Alcaraz in his way, he will fancy his chances of Grand Slam title No. 25.

Another good day for Alcaraz. He's had a lot of them lately.

The defending champion and world No. 2 should have plenty more good days in the coming week. There are some dangerous lower seeds in the men's draw, who are decent grass-court players: Jakub Menšík or Ugo Humbert. Alcaraz ended up with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Andrey Rublev in his quarter.

That could have meant tough times in 2021 or 2022. In 2025, not so much. Auger-Aliassime and Tsitsipas are now in the mid-20s in the rankings, far removed from the time when they looked like they might threaten to be big forces. Rublev rarely shows up in a Grand Slam against a player of Alcaraz's caliber.

Alcaraz will start off with Italian showman Fabio Fognini at 1:30 p.m. Monday on Centre Court. Fognini is at the tail end of his career, and then Alcaraz will play the winner of Oliver Tarvet and Leandro Riedl, both of them qualifiers.

Defending women's champion Barbora Krejčíková comes in at the other end of the spectrum, seeded No. 17. She withdrew from the Eastbourne warmup event with a thigh injury and faces a matchup with a dangerous newcomer in Alexandra Eala, a lefty from the Philippines who beat Iga Świątek in Miami and has been winning matches on grass this month.

As for the women's favorite, Sabalenka could have some early trouble in the shape of Vondroušová, the 2023 Wimbledon champion who has recovered from a shoulder injury to find her form and who beat Sabalenka in Berlin a week or so ago. Emma Raducanu, who knows her way around a grass court and would relish a Centre Court matchup in the third round, is there too.

Sofia Kenin (28) vs. Taylor Townsend (Q)

Kenin is on a steady climb back and is into the top 30. Townsend, who qualified here this week, is a lefty on grass who brings the vibes.

Tatjana Maria vs. Katie Volynets

It's grass. A grass-court specialist, Maria, against a scrambler with speed, Volynets, is good fun.

Dayana Yastremska vs. Coco Gauff (2)

If it's anything like their three-setter in Madrid, it could be a whale of a first-round test for Gauff.

Learner Tien vs. Nishesh Basavareddy

These two are super-close and have been playing each other since they were about 12 years old. Now they are on the Wimbledon grass in the main draw for the first time. How cool is that?

Jakub Menšík (16) vs. Hugo Gaston

Menšík's serve means he should have a great career on grass, but the Gaston drop shots and craft could seriously scramble his brain early.

Dan Evans (WC) vs. Jay Clarke (WC)

A good old battle of Britain. Bring the Pimm's!

In a tennis world of homogenised surfaces and playing styles, there's something refreshing about the fact that there are still dangerous grass-court floaters. Over 20 years ago, when the Wimbledon courts were quicker, pretty much anyone with a big serve could be considered a factor in the draw.

Nowadays, dangerous floaters are much more of a rarity, but there were some standout names across the two draws that everyone wanted to avoid — and one in particular who has ascended from floater to seed on the back of his recent form.

Alexander Bublik, who bamboozled Draper out of the French Open before beating Sinner en route to the Halle title in Germany, is slated to face Draper again in the third round. Bublik's devastating touch game and cannon of a serve become most dangerous on grass, and the Brit will hope for some misfires.

In the women's draw, Tatjana Maria was the player all the favorites wanted to avoid: unseeded and fresh from winning the HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club a couple of weeks ago, where she bewitched her opponents and the spectators with her slice-heavy, throwback game. Maria's run to the title there included wins against Leylah Fernandez, Karolina Muchová, Elena Rybakina, Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova, all seeded players at Wimbledon and two of them Grand Slam champions.

The seeds all managed to avoid a first round against Maria, but she has a possible second round against the No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula. It's the kind of matchup that Pegula, a line-and-length baseliner really wouldn't relish.

Yes, the Wimbledon grass isn't what it used to be, just as the red clay at Roland Garros is faster than it was before the era of surface homogenization.

But it can still tilt matchups in dangerous ways, which go beyond the floater issue.

In terms of first-round matchups, Taylor Fritz probably did not want to see Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard of France below his name. Mpetshi Perricard can serve the ball 150 miles per hour. He caused all kinds of trouble at Wimbledon last year and rumbled into the round of 16, where Lorenzo Musetti finally solved him.

Reilly Opelka, who is nearly seven-feet tall, can have the same effect on a match, though the grass has given him some trouble in the past because of the low bounce. But he's not around a major seed until he potentially faces Musetti in the third round, which feels very far away.

Jessica Pegula isn't the type to look past her first round, but if she did, she'd see the potential for a match with Maria. She isn't the only one right to be looking askance. Hugo Gaston could cause Menšík more problems than usual. Dayana Yastremska, who can take the felt off the ball, is a tougher matchup for Coco Gauff than she might be elsewhere: just look at their three-setter in Madrid earlier this year, which is faster than typical clay conditions.

No. 10 seed Ben Shelton has the serve to solve the grass, but less so the movement — qualifier Alex Bolt of Australia is not to be sniffed at on the surface. The same goes for Tommy Paul, who needs to find his health after abdominal and leg injuries on the clay. He should manage wild card Johannus Monday of Britain — if he can walk and do a sit-up.

Frances Tiafoe loves Wimbledon and the grass. He played one match at Queen's — and lost it. Elmer Møller of Denmark and his ridiculous backhand await, while Emma Navarro might fear the returning Petra Kvitová, a two-time Wimbledon champion, more than she might at other tour stops.

Yulia Putintseva vs. Amanda Anisimova (13)

The American No. 13 seed is one of the biggest hitters in the game, and is up against one of its most mercurial and provocative talents, who can be extremely dangerous on grass and loves causing an upset. Just ask Naomi Osaka and Świątek, both of whom have lost to her here.

Paula Badosa (9) vs. Katie Boulter

Badosa has struggled with injury recently and has a tough first assignment against a home player who loves playing on grass. This will surely be on a big court with a lively atmosphere.

Barbora Krejčíková (17) vs. Alexandra Eala

The defending champion Krejcikova has had rotten luck with injuries since winning here last year. Her opponent, Eala, is one of the most exciting young talents on the tour.

Taylor Fritz (5) vs. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard

Two huge servers, so granted this may not be one for the purists. But watching players, especially on grass, try and work out a way to neutralise Mpetshi Perricard's lightning-quick serve is oddly compelling.

Gaël Monfils vs. Ugo Humbert (22)

Two hugely talented Frenchmen who like to put on a show, this should be a lot of fun. Monfils is a star turn wherever he goes, while Humbert pushed Alcaraz for a couple of sets in the fourth round here last year.

Jacob Fearnley vs. João Fonseca

The hugely hyped 18-year-old Brazilian up against an in-form Brit will surely get a big court and plenty of attention. This is Fonseca's main-draw debut at Wimbledon and he will be determined to put on a show.

World No. 1s Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka take part in an accuracy training drill ahead of Wimbledon. (0:35)

Carlos Alcaraz will begin his quest for a third straight Wimbledon title and put his career-best 18-match winning streak on the line against dangerous Italian Fabio Fognini, and women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka will open her campaign versus Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine.

Friday's draw conducted at the All England Club produced its usual intrigue with some eye-catching first-round clashes.

Men's top seed Jannik Sinner, beaten by Alcaraz in the French Open final, meets fellow Italian Luca Nardi, and sixth seed Novak Djokovic, seeking to tie Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon singles titles, has a tricky opener against world No. 40 Alexandre Muller.

Defending women's champion Barbora Krejcikova, the 17th seed who pulled out of the Eastbourne tournament Thursday with a thigh strain, faces Alexandra Eala of the Philippines.

No. 2 Coco Gauff's first-round opponent is Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska. Third seed Jessica Pegula, Gauff's potential semifinal opponent, plays Italian qualifier Elisabetta Cocciaretto.

Potential men's quarterfinals
No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 7 Lorenzo Musetti
No. 4 Jack Draper vs. No. 6 Novak Djokovic
No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz vs. No. 8 Holger Rune
No. 3 Alexander Zverev vs. No. 5 Taylor Fritz

Potential women's quarterfinals
No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka vs. No. 6 Madison Keys
No. 4 Jasmine Paolini vs. No. 5 Zheng Qinwen
No. 2 Coco Gauff vs. No. 8 Iga Swiatek
No. 3 Jessica Pegula vs. No. 7 Mirra Andreeva

Fourth seed Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up at Wimbledon last year, faces Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia and is seeded to meet Sabalenka in the semifinals.

Britain has 23 players in the singles events, the most for the home nation since 1984, with men's fourth seed Jack Draper carrying the weight of expectation on his shoulders after a rapid rise. Draper faces a tough path, though, if he is to emulate two-time champion Andy Murray.

Draper, 23, has a tricky opener against 38th-ranked Sebastian Baez and could face past runner-up Marin Cilic of Croatia in Round 2 and Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, whom he lost to at Roland Garros, in the third round.

To win the title, Draper could have to beat Djokovic in the quarterfinals, Sinner in the semis and Alcaraz in the final.

Britain's women's No. 1 Emma Raducanu opens against compatriot Mingge Xu, one of three British teenage wild cards in the women's draw. Should 2021 US Open champion Raducanu win that, she would play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova or 32nd seed McCartney Kessler in the second round before a potential third-round meeting with Sabalenka.

One potential standout second-round match could feature Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen against four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.

Alcaraz, who warmed up for Wimbledon by winning the Queen's Club title, will be wary of the threat posed by the enigmatic Fognini, although the 38-year-old Italian player is not the force he was when he reached ninth in the rankings in 2019 and has never been past the third round in 14 previous appearances at Wimbledon.

Alcaraz could then face British qualifier Oliver Tarvet, the world No. 719 whose reward for reaching the main draw is a first-round match against Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi. Alcaraz's potential semifinal opponent is No. 3 Alexander Zverev, who plays France's Arthur Rinderknech in his opening match.

Gauff, coming off her second major title at the French Open, will open Wimbledon on Tuesday against Dayana Yastremska, a 2024 Australian Open semifinalist.

Win that, and Gauff might face former No. 1 and two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka in the second round, while a rematch with No. 28 seed Sofia Kenin could await in the third. Kenin eliminated Gauff in the opening round at Wimbledon two years ago.

Petra Kvitova, the 2011 and 2014 Wimbledon champion who announced she will retire later this year, takes on No. 10 Emma Navarro in the first round.

As defending men's champion, Alcaraz will open play on Centre Court on Monday, which will feature the bottom half of the men's draw and the top half of the women's draw.

Krejcikova will begin play on Centre Court on Tuesday.

Forget center court – this past weekend, all eyes were on the sidelines at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where more than 500 aspiring ball kids and adults competed for a different kind of dream: a coveted spot on the 2025 US Open Ball Crew. 

On June 20-22, more than 1,600 applicants, kids aged from 14 and up, were sprinting to make the cut as there were only 80 positions eager to be filled. 
Participants were tested on agility, speed, rolling, and court awareness – skills that soon will be on full display in front of packed stadiums and millions of viewers. 

For many trying out, the appeal goes far beyond chasing balls — it is the rare chance to get up close to their tennis idols. With the world's top players set to compete in Flushing later this summer, the thought of standing just feet away from tennis royalty was enough to fuel some serious hustle on the courts.

“The reason I want this is, I get to meet my favorite players and I get to use tennis to make good connections with players that I can use my whole life,” said one of the aspiring ball crew members. 
For many of those teens and adults participating, the experience was also a way to be part of one of New York's biggest sporting traditions —and maybe to snag the best view of tennis history in the making. 
“Being a ball boy, you have the best seats in the house. It doesn't get much better than that,” said one of the hopeful kids. 
The ball crew members earn an hourly wage — but for most of the kids on the court, the experience is priceless. From getting a front-row seat to world class matches to standing inches from their favorite players, it is a Summer job unlike any other.

""When I got the opportunity to partner, it just felt like the easiest partnership.""

Senior Digital News Writer


	“I've always been a fan of [Brilliant Earth] from the very start. And I've also always been a pretty avid jewelry-wearer, as I'm sure many people can see,” Madison Keys told WWD in an exclusive interview. The American tennis star joined forces with the global leader in ethically sourced jewelry, Brilliant Earth, as a new brand ambassador, with a launch of new styles coming later this summer ahead of the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, New York City, where Keys will compete. 


	Even before she joined Brilliant Earth as an ambassador, Keys always admired the company's vision and mission. “I like the very clean and simple but modern style that they've always had. I've always loved the option to have lab-grown, as well,” Keys said, citing “the ethical sourcing” Brilliant Earth uses for their gems and jewelry pieces.

	“It was just kind of all these things that I already feel so strongly about. When I got the opportunity to partner, it just felt like the easiest partnership.” From the start of her professional tennis career, which began when Keys was just a teenager, the athlete used jewelry as a “way to express my personality and kind of show my personal style a little bit more, just because on court we obviously have our match kits that are scripted,” she said.


	More than just the designs, the accessibility of Brilliant Earth's pieces further validated her choice to partner with the company.


	“I'm a big believer that anyone and everyone deserves sparkly things. For [Brilliant Earth] to be, basically, the first company to offer that was always something that I was really excited about,” she said, referencing Brilliant Earth's ethically sourced and lab-grown gems.


	Part of Keys' ambassadorship duties includes the athlete's role in crafting the forthcoming jewelry launch, which will drop toward the end of the summer just in time for Keys to compete on the hard courts of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for the U.S. Open. “Being able to work with the team from Brilliant Earth to kind of create something that is very meaningful and special to me was really cool,” she said. 

	











	“I've never really gotten to create anything from the concept space all the way to having a final product. I'm really excited that so many of the things that I talked about and were really important to me — not only just my journey within tennis but my entire life — we were able to put that into this launch,” Keys said.


	Keys' partnership with Brilliant Earth also opened the chance for the athlete to muse on the brilliant trailblazers, tennis stars and moments that come to mind ahead of the grass court Grand Slam event, Wimbledon, which begins Monday. Who came to mind for the athlete? Venus and Serena Williams. “They have done so much for the sport, just as themselves just being true to who they are,” Keys said.


“Serena's career has been the greatest thing that I think we'll ever see,” Keys said of the 23-time Grand Slam champion and Wynn Beauty founder. “Seeing her do all of the amazing things that she's done on the court but then off of the court be such a creative person and a great business woman — it's very inspiring to see someone that has the level of success that she does,” she said.


	“Venus is the reason that I started playing tennis,” Keys added. “On top of that, her having such a huge role in equal prize money for women on our tour…we're all so forever grateful for both of them.”


	Now a Grand Slam champion herself after winning the 2025 Australian Open Women's Singles title in Melbourne last January, Keys is trailblazing her own path through tennis history. “Australia was obviously the biggest thing that I've done in my career. I think the reason that it still is probably going to be really hard to top as my most brilliant moment is just because of the people that I had around with me,” Keys said.

	











	Keys had come close to winning a Grand Slam on previous occasions, but to have her “favorite people” by her side in January to lift the Australian Open trophy was a “truly raw, emotional experience and we were just all so happy. To be able to do all of that together with the people I had around me, it'll be a really hard moment to ever top.”

LONDON — Just in case anyone might have wondered whether there was any lingering animosity between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka after their French Open final, the two tennis stars offered proof that all is well by dancing together at Wimbledon on Friday and posting videos on social media.

“TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together,” Sabalenka wrote on her Instagram feed below a clip of the duo showing off their moves on the Centre Court grass to the strains of the 1990 hit “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory.

Gauff, a frequent TikTok user, put up a video of the pair standing outside the main stadium at the All England Club and mouthing along to a track with the words: “OK, guys, we're back. Did you miss us? 'Cause we missed you.”

Gauff wrote: “the olive branch was extended and accepted! we're good so you guys should be too.”

The No. 1-ranked Sabalenka and the No. 2-ranked Gauff held a practice session together at Centre Court ahead of the year's third Grand Slam tournament, which begins on Monday.

Three weeks ago, Gauff beat Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in the championship match at the last major, the French Open. Afterward, Sabalenka drew criticism from some for saying Gauff “won the match not because she played incredible; just because I made all of those mistakes from ... easy balls.”

Later, Sabalenka called her comments “unprofessional” and said she had written to Gauff to apologize.

Sabalenka, a 27-year-old from Belarus, is a three-time Grand Slam champion and was the runner-up both times Gauff, a 21-year-old American, won a major trophy, including at the 2023 U.S. Open.

At Wimbledon this year, they only could face each other in the July 12 final.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's photos and videos from the Tight End University (TEU) summit in Nashville recently went viral, with an expert claiming the pop sensation is allegedly the one “in charge.” The couple was spotted flaunting their love for each other as they took over the dance floor. According to a body language expert, the singer seemed to be “doing the heavy lifting” in their relationship. The specialist highlighted that “she's the more focused and certain one.”

oh……….. like,,,,,,,….it's that serious pic.twitter.com/NS6b4aXXam

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce turned heads with the viral photos and videos of the pair dancing intimately at the TEU event. They recently made their red carpet debut as they walked hand-in-hand into the venue. A few clips, shared on X (formerly Twitter), showed the couple grooving to the singer's popular songs.

Body language expert Judi James went through the pair's red carpet and dancing photos and videos. She referred to a footage where they danced to Swift's 2014 hit, “Shake It Off,” and shared her analysis with the Daily Mail.

She stated that the couple followed an “exclusivity ritual,” in which they only had eyes for each other. “Their togetherness signals do seem to be becoming less inhibited [for Kelce], but it is still Taylor doing the heavy lifting in terms of showing their love and their romantic narrative off to the world,” she said.

The expert highlighted how the pop star's actions on the red carpet showed “loving surrender” and “trust” in her beau. Additionally, Swift made sure that she got Kelce's “undivided attention” on the dance floor. James mentioned that the singer being “in charge of the romantic choreography” is much better. The NFL star looked “a little more diffident but happy to be led.”

Kelce and Swift were also spotted grooving to her 2008 track, “Love Story,” at the same event. Their PDA-packed moves have again sparked engagement and wedding rumors, with fans highly anticipating the same.

World No. 1s Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka take part in an accuracy training drill ahead of Wimbledon. (0:35)

It's been a long journey to this Wimbledon for Emma Raducanu. After making history at the 2021 US Open, she has continued to struggle to repeat that success.

However, Wimbledon has been a welcoming home comfort for her. She made her breakthrough at the All England Club by memorably reaching the fourth round months before her US Open success, and she equalled that run at last year's championships.

Will she go further this time round?

Here's everything you need to know.

Raducanu will face 17-year-old British wild card Mingge Xu in her opening match at the All England Club.

Xu, from Swansea, Wales, is ranked world No. 302. She will be Raducanu's first hurdle if she is going to make a run at this year's championships.

She will face a difficult task if she is to repeat her fourth-round run from last summer as she is on a path to play first-seed Aryna Sabalenka in the third round.

The match will be broadcast live on BBC. ESPN will also be providing a live blog, as well as news and feature coverage.

It's been a typically roller coaster year for Raducanu. She has had to overcome challenges on and off the court -- she was followed by a male stalker at WTA events in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha earlier this year.

The most important tennis dates to put in your diary.

Her deepest run this year came at the Miami Open where she made the quarterfinals before being defeated over three sets by Jessica Pegula.

She has played twice on grass before Wimbledon. She made the quarterfinals at Queen's in the single's while teaming up with compatriot Katie Boulter for ""Boultercanu"" in the doubles, following that up with a round-of-16 defeat to 19-year-old Maya Joint at the Eastbourne Open.

It wouldn't be a Raducanu season without a coaching change, though. She split with coach Vladimir Platenik after just one match in March. However, she has since enjoyed a part-time coaching set up with Mark Petchey

After having some choice words about Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open, Channel Nine sports anchor Tony Jones of Australia will not be on the job for Wimbledon.

The channel will instead “utilize its London bureau and fly in tennis experts Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic for commentary duties,” according to GB News.

“Welcome back to Melbourne Park, where you can see the Novak Djokovic fans, they're in full voice. The chants are quite extraordinary,” Jones said live for Channel Nine in front of Djokovic's chanting fans at the Australian Open in January, which was won by Jannik Sinner.

Jones then chimed in with a chant of his own: “Novak, he's overrated. Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out. Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me. Anyway, let's get on to the tennis.”

Djokovic, a 24-time major champion, didn't tolerate the disrespect, as he swiftly denied interviewing with Jones and Channel Nine while demanding an apology.

“Channel Nine here in Australia made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments towards me,” Djokovic said.

Jones did later apologize, explaining that the Serbian fans “bring flags, so much color, passion and there was banter” and that he thought his words were “an extension of that banter.”

Jones' “kick him out” comments particularly struck a chord for many, as Djokovic was deported from Australia over his vaccination status in early 2022.

“If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd ‘kick him out,'” Jones said in his apology.

The 63-year-old has been a longtime correspondent for the Australian network's coverage of Wimbledon but will remain in Melbourne this time around.

Jannik Sinner's pursuit of a maiden Wimbledon crown could hinge on a heavyweight semi-final clash with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner opens against countryman Luca Nardi at the grass-court major, following the draw on Friday morning. Djokovic, competing at his lowest seeding (sixth) since 2018, will begin his campaign for a record-tying eighth Wimbledon title against Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

Djokovic, who defeated Sinner at the All England Club in 2022 (QF) and 2023 (SF), is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with British No. 1 Jack Draper. The fourth-seeded Draper starts against Sebastian Baez and could face a testing third-round clash with in-form Halle champion Alexander Bublik.

View the full draw here.



In the bottom half of the draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz starts against 38-year-old Fabio Fognini. The 22-year-old Spaniard is riding an 18-match winning streak — the longest of his career — and could meet eighth seed Holger Rune in the quarter-finals.

If Alcaraz prevails, he will take on a qualifier, Oliver Tarvet or Leandro Riedi. Both men are competing in a Grand Slam main draw for the first time.

World No. 3 and three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, who takes on Arthur Rinderknech, is seeded to meet Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals. If the two stars clash in the last eight, Fritz will take confidence from owning an 8-5 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including a stretch of five consecutive victories that began at Wimbledon last year.

The fifth-seeded American Fritz begins against big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who memorably reached the fourth round on his first appearance at the grass major last year.

Rising star Joao Fonseca has been handed a popcorn opening match in his Wimbledon debut against British No. 2 Jacob Fearnley. Fonseca's fellow #NextGenATP players and main-draw debutants at SW19, Learner Tien and Nishesh Basavareddy, will face each other, with the winner setting a potential second-round clash with Rune.

The 19-year-old Czech, Jakub Mensik, is seeded to meet home favourite Draper in the fourth round, having defeated the Briton en route to his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz vs. Fognini, Draper vs. Baez among first-round matches to watch at Wimbledon","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/wimbledon-2025-first-round-matches-to-watch","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:06:50 GMT","

 The 2025 Wimbledon draw has thrown up some tantalising first-round men's singles clashes. They include two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz's meeting with former Top 10 star Fabio Fognini, while home favourite Jack Draper and fast-rising #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca face tough opening assignments. 

 ATPTour.com highlights five first-round matches to watch at the grass-court major. 



 [2] Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) vs. Fabio Fognini (ITA) 
Having defeated Novak Djokovic in the championship match to triumph at Wimbledon in both 2023 and 2024, Alcaraz will begin his campaign on a 14-match winning-streak at the grass major. He will bid to make that 15 by overcoming Fognini, a former No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Alcaraz has triumphed in each of the pair's two previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, both of which took place on clay in Rio de Janeiro (2022, 2023). While Alcaraz undoubtedly starts the match as a heavy favourite, he will be wary of a player whose shotmaking ability has earned him 17 victories against Top 10 opponents.

 [4] Jack Draper (GBR) vs. Sebastian Baez (ARG) 
The highest-seeded Briton in a Wimbledon singles draw since two-time champion Andy Murray competed as top seed in 2017, Draper will aim to show his home fans just how far he has come in the past 12 months with a big opening display against Sebastian Baez. Although he has never been past the second round at Wimbledon, Draper is 28-8 in 2025 and lifted his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in March in Indian Wells. 

 The 23-year-old lefty Draper will be hoping to build on his solid start to the 2025 grass season, a semi-final run at the Queen's Club last week, and he leads Baez 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Baez holds a 3-7 career record on grass, but the Argentine is a seven-time ATP Tour champion who was inside the Top 20 as recently as last August. 

 [5] Taylor Fritz (USA) vs. Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (FRA) 
Grass-court tennis is known as a favourite of big servers and there are few more suited to the surface than Taylor Fritz and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Fritz is a four-time ATP Tour champion on grass and is into another semi-final in Eastbourne this week. 

 Meanwhile the 6' 8” Mpetshi Perricard, the Most Improved Player of the Year in the 2024 ATP Awards, finished last year with the best Serve Quality (9.5) on Tour according to Tennis Data Innovations' INSIGHTS. The Frenchman, who has struggled for wins in 2025, will need his biggest weapon to fire if he is to upset the fifth-seeded Fritz in the pair's maiden tour-level meeting. 

 Jacob Fearnley (GBR) vs. Joao Fonseca (BRA) 
The 18-year-old Fonseca has generated big atmospheres and hype around the world in 2025, but the Brazilian will likely be up against a crowd pulling for his opponent on his Wimbledon main-draw debut. Jacob Fearnley is the No. 2 Briton in the PIF ATP Rankings, having reached a career-high No. 49 earlier this month. 

 Still cutting his teeth on grass, Fonseca will be aiming to make a big impact at his third consecutive Grand Slam. He stunned then-Top 10 star Andrey Rublev at January's Australian Open and did the same to Hubert Hurkacz en route to the third round at Roland Garros. Can the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion silence the home crowd early against Fearnley? 

 [18] Ugo Humbert (FRA) vs. Gael Monfils (FRA) 
A pair of highly-skilled French favourites meets in a popcorn opening showdown at Wimbledon. The 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert is a seven-time tour-level titlist, a tally that includes an ATP 500 title on grass in Halle. Meanwhile his countryman Monfils remains a daunting opponent and crowd favourite, even at the age of 38. 

 Humbert leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-2, but Monfils won two of the pair's three meetings in 2024 (all of which took place on hard courts). The former Top 10 star will be hopeful of levelling his rivalry with Humbert in the pair's second grass-court meeting.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool continued their stellar grass-court season Friday at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where they claimed their second consecutive ATP Tour title.

The British duo delivered a 6-4, 7-6(5) championship-match triumph against Ariel Behar and Joran Vliegen in windy conditions to lift its fourth trophy of the season. After reaching the final in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and winning the ATP 500 on home soil at Queen's Club last week, Cash and Glasspool improved to an 11-1 record on grass this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“[It's been] a crazy three weeks for us, going three finals in a row,” said Cash. “Thanks to our team for putting in the hours. It's been a tough shift but I'm glad we've been able to pick up some trophies, and this one's a special one.”



After improving to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Behar and Vliegen, Cash and Glasspool are up to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. They are aiming to make their team debut at the Nitto ATP Finals after teaming for the first time in Hangzhou last September.

“You guys coming out and being so supportive, it really feels like a home tournament,” added Glasspool. “It's amazing to play in such a great atmosphere, we really do appreciate it.”

After Swiatek beat Paolini in straight sets in their first three career meetings, Paolini pushed her hard in their most recent meeting—in the semifinals of the Billie Jean King Cup Finals last year—though Swiatek ultimately won that one too, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.But their fifth meeting went much like the first three, as Swiatek rolled through the first set, then—after getting broken in the opening game of the second set—broke right back and started rolling again, eventually serving it out after 66 minutes on court.Awaiting the No. 4-seeded Swiatek in the final will be the winner of the second semifinal between No. 1 seed Jessica Pegula and unseeded Czech Linda Noskova.

Peru has produced only a few world-class tennis players over the years. Apart from Alejandro Olmedo, born in Peru but later competing for the United States and inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the country's tennis legacy has been shaped by Jaime Yzaga, Luis Horna, and Pablo Arraya. All three managed to win at least one ATP singles title- an impressive feat for the Andean nation.Now, a new generation is preparing to follow in their footsteps, led by 21-year-old Ignacio Buse from Lima. Alongside Juan Pablo Varillas, Buse is one of only two Peruvians currently ranked in the ATP Top 250, and he is widely seen as his country's most promising future prospect.A promising path through the junior ranksBuse was a successful junior, competed in all four Grand Slam events and broke into the Top 10 of the ITF Junior Rankings - clear indicators of his potential. In October 2023, he claimed his first ITF World Tennis Tour title in Mendoza, Argentina, and went on to win two more in the months that followed.In December, the young South American made a key decision for his development: he moved to Europe and joined the TEC Carles Ferrer Salat Academy in Barcelona. ""The training conditions are simply better there,"" says Buse of the move.

From Barcelona to Bad Rappenau: First ATP Challenger Tttle in GermanyEarlier this month, Buse made headlines at the Neckarcup 2.0 in Bad Rappenau. Despite persistent rain, he captured his first ATP Challenger title in the small town near Heilbronn, celebrating the biggest success of his career so far.“I was in Austria a few weeks ago, and we had similar conditions there. The balls are heavy, but I managed to adapt well,” he said during the tournament in the Kraichgau region. “The courts are slippery, but in really good shape. Most of the time, they were playable just 30 minutes after the rain.”German roots, global ambitionsRanked World No. 153, Buse doesn't quite fit the classic mold of a South American clay-court specialist. He prefers an attacking game style, enjoys playing on faster surfaces, and dreams of winning Wimbledon or the French Open. “I've improved in many areas,” he states confidently. He already represents Peru in the Davis Cup, something he calls “the greatest honor.”His family history also reflects an international background: his great-grandfather was German. “I don't really know the exact family history, and I don't have any relatives left here.

Cooking skills and career goalsOff the court, Buse is pursuing an online degree in business, though balancing it with tennis isn't easy. “It's impossible to study during tournament weeks. I manage to catch up during practice weeks,” he says with a smile. Still, he's committed to both paths.Unlike many athletes, Buse is only mildly interested in football. “I keep up with the results of my club, Universitario de Deportes in Lima, but I rarely watch the games. I used to follow them more when my cousin was on the team. Now that I live in Spain, I keep an eye on FC Barcelona instead.”Healthy eating is a bigger passion for him, and it runs in the family. Buse is the nephew of Gastón Acurio, a world-famous Peruvian chef. Culinary talent seems to be in his blood. His most recent dish? “Baked salmon with some pasta,” he says. Simple, but as we know, simplicity often makes the best meals.Aiming high: The dream of a Grand Slam finalHis goals on the court are just as clear. “Of course, I don't want this to be the peak. I'm working hard to keep moving up,” says Buse. The ultimate dream? To reach a Grand Slam final someday. He knows it's a long road, but the young man from Lima seems to have everything it takes to make that dream a reality.

‘The confidence in FP2 felt much better' – Tsunoda

Williams pace ‘better than it looks' after Friday practice, insists Sainz

George Russell set the pace for Mercedes during Free Practice 1 at the Austrian Grand Prix.

George Russell has topped the timesheets during Friday's opening practice session ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver continuing his run of good form as he led the way from Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri.

There were a couple of new faces joining the action for FP1 at the Red Bull Ring as two teams opted to run a rookie; Formula 2 standings leader Alex Dunne stepped into Lando Norris' McLaren – making him the first Irish driver to take part in an F1 weekend for 22 years as he finished an impressive fourth – while fellow F2 driver Dino Beganovic was at the wheel for Ferrari in place of Charles Leclerc.

Dunne was amongst the first to hit the track when the green light appeared, with the MCL39 sporting aero rakes to kick off a weekend in which several teams have brought upgrades. The Irishman was also the only driver to run the soft tyres during the initial runs, the rest of the pack bolting on the medium and hard compounds.

While Canadian Grand Prix winner Russell had set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, Verstappen did not seem happy in the Red Bull, the Dutchman experiencing a lock-up in the RB21.

Verstappen reported back about the problems on the radio – but on this occasion the World Champion was speaking to Simon Rennie rather than his usual Race Engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, with ‘GP' taking the weekend off.

Also seemingly struggling in the sister Red Bull was Yuki Tsunoda, who experienced a wide moment of his own as he continues in his mission to get to grips with the car. Elsewhere, Lewis Hamilton was informed that his SF-25 had an “issue with the gearbox”, forcing the Briton to return to the pits.

The problems did not look to have ended there for Ferrari, with Beganovic's car up on the stands in the other side of the garage as the crew removed the floor. Russell, meanwhile, was sitting atop the timesheets, having pumped in a 1m 05.776s after running the soft tyres.

A yellow flag briefly appeared following a spin for Fernando Alonso, with the two-time World Champion running onto the grass thanks to a moment at the final corner. “That was the worst out-lap we can do – good to do it in FP1!” the Aston Martin driver commented.

As the majority of the field switched to the soft tyres and the times started to tumble – with Ferrari also getting both cars back out on track – Esteban Ocon sparked another yellow flag after locking up and going straight on at Turn 1. The Haas driver was able to rejoin, albeit with a flat spot on his front left tyre.

With Russell still leading the way from Verstappen and Piastri as the session entered its final quarter, Dunne caught the eye by going fourth fastest, his time just seven-hundredths away from Piastri's.

“A few small raindrops,” Russell reported as the last 10 minutes of FP1 approached, with clouds hovering above the Red Bull Ring. But questions over the weather did not prevent the Silver Arrows driver from maintaining his place at the top of the timesheets, having set the pace on a 1m 05.542s.

Verstappen – who has won at this track a record four times – was 0.065s adrift in P2, while Piastri and Dunne held third and fourth for McLaren ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in fifth. Gabriel Bortoleto slotted into an impressive sixth for Kick Sauber, while the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz, Hamilton and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the top 10.

Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli claimed 11th – off the back of completing his school exams – ahead of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg (12th), Aston Martin's Lance Stroll (13th), Alonso (14th) and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson (15th). Franco Colapinto put his Alpine into P16, while Tsunoda, Beganovic, Ocon and Haas' Ollie Bearman classified P17 through to P20 respectively.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

As F1 moves on to the Austrian Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more ahead of the race at the Red Bull Ring.

After making the trip to Canada last time out, Formula 1 returns to Europe for Round 11 on the calendar, the Austrian Grand Prix.

Free Practice 1 and 2 will take place on Friday, June 27, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, June 28, and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, June 29.

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Austria is a picturesque circuit, really undulating, which makes it nice to drive and characterful.

You've got to be careful with the kerbs as it's very easy to get straddling or to get over some more abrasive kerbs, which can inflict a bit of damage to your car. But beyond that, it's a short and relatively simple circuit with some hidden technicalities.

Turn 1 is always quicker than you think it's going to be, but braking is the order of the day for the first sector. Turn 4, a downhill braking zone, is the easiest one to mess up – so many drivers end up in the gravel there on the exit.

There's overtaking aplenty in Turns 3 and 4, and then the flow through the second half of the lap is really good as it just comes around so quickly. It's one of the fastest on the calendar and it really feels it at the wheel. You barely get a breath through this Grand Prix.

“The choice of compounds the teams can use is the same as last year's, namely C3 as hard, C4 as medium, and C5 as soft,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The track surface at the Red Bull Ring is rather old and is highly abrasive, but wear is not a key factor.

“With very few corners, the track is not very severe in terms of the lateral forces exerted on the tyres, while degradation is mainly thermal in origin, which is down to the track layout with several hard braking and acceleration points.

“Managing tyre overheating, particularly on the rear axle, is a significant challenge. Furthermore, air and track temperatures can be quite high at this time of year.”

In terms of strategy, the tyre manufacturer adds: “Last year's race was very linear, at least over the first two thirds of the race.

“As expected, the most effective strategy was a two-stop: those who did three or more – Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Fernando Alonso and Logan Sargeant – did so for unforeseen circumstances, not by choice. All the drivers lined up on the grid on medium tyres while, starting from pit lane, Zhou Guanyu went with the hard.

“The C4 and the C3 were the undoubted protagonists of this race, with the C5 only putting in an appearance at the end, used by Verstappen for the last seven laps after his enforced stop and by Alonso, who was trying for the race fastest lap, which he did indeed set.”

On paper, the picture has not dramatically changed standings-wise in the aftermath of the Canadian Grand Prix; Oscar Piastri continues to head the Drivers' standings, while McLaren have a significant lead in the Teams' Championship.

But several talking points emerged following the race that affect the battle at the top, including how the papaya squad will handle things going forwards following the dramatic collision that occurred between Piastri and Lando Norris in Montreal.

Norris immediately took the blame for the incident, a reaction that was appreciated by Team Principal Andrea Stella. But the Briton will need to bounce back this weekend in Austria in order to avoid losing further ground to Piastri in the World Championship.

Mercedes, meanwhile, arrive at the Red Bull Ring off the back of their strongest outing of the year in Canada, with George Russell taking pole position and victory. This has put the squad back into P2 of the Teams' standings after previously losing the position to Ferrari – but can the Scuderia launch a fightback after a tough weekend in Montreal?

Elsewhere, Max Verstappen remains one penalty point away from an automatic race suspension – but, after a clean weekend at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, the Red Bull driver showed that he is not feeling any extra pressure from this risk as he continues to hold P3 in the Drivers' Championship.

In terms of the midfield battle, Williams still hold a clear edge in fifth place of the Teams' leaderboard – but the margins are increasingly close behind them, with the gap from Haas in sixth through to Kick Sauber in ninth standing at just eight points. Can any of these outfits claim a valuable position by further adding to their tally this weekend?

It was an already unusual weekend in Austria back in 1999, which marked the first race since Michael Schumacher was sidelined by a broken leg, leaving it up to Eddie Irvine to lead Ferrari's charge and take the fight to the McLaren drivers.

Having been comfortably outpaced by Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard in Qualifying, the Northern Irishman was handed a gift at Turn 3 when the leading pair dramatically collided – Coulthard nudging his team mate into a spin to the dismay of those watching on in the McLaren garage.

From there, it got worse for Coulthard, who was reeled in by Irvine and overhauled as the strategies unfolded, giving the Ferrari man a boost in his quest for the title and leaving Coulthard to apologise as Hakkinen (that year's eventual champion) salvaged third.

Watch the drama as it unfolded in the video player below...

McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris look set to continue their title battle this weekend in Austria, despite collision last time out in Canada

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri cut relaxed figures when they arrived at the Red Bull Ring on Thursday for the Austrian Grand Prix, a little under two weeks after they collided in Canada.

Norris immediately admitted his mistake after he ran into the back of his McLaren team mate's car as he battled to find a way through in Montreal and said later that he was sorry for ""being stupid"", while team boss Andrea Stella said two McLarens making contact is ""not acceptable"".

It's no surprise, then, that when the paddock regrouped in Austria, Piastri and Norris – who currently sit first and second in the Drivers' Championship – were still the big topic of conversation.

Piastri was first to face the media, through his appearance in the official press conference. Naturally, the subject dominated the half an hour session and, as has been the case throughout his time in F1 and indeed junior formulae, Piastri handled every question with his trademark coolness.

The first topic was the post-race debrief, which Piastri joked began ""on the way to the stewards room"" in Montreal after the collision before adding more seriously: ""We spoke about it honestly before we even got back to the team. Lando put his hands up and apologised, so all good and looking forward to racing again.""

Norris faced the media via the TV pen later in the day and a separate session with written media.

While it's clear the Briton remains disappointed at the way things went down in Canada, he does appear to have picked himself up and brushed himself off quickly.

""Obviously a little different to normal but it was good,"" he said of the debrief. ""I think the team handled everything very well. Of course it's never the nicest position to be in but I think more for myself rather than anyone else.

""It was more my pain than anyone else but it was all good. Everyone was very much onboard on resetting and making sure we're ready to focus on here and not letting it effect our races and our championship and what we're here to fight for which is a very good thing.""

McLaren has been keen to avoid team orders and let their drivers fight it out, but within their permitted so-called papaya-rules.

As a reminder, boss Zak Brown defined those rules as ""race him [your team mate] hard, race him clean, don't touch"". That obviously happened in Canada but McLaren have no plan to change things.

""Same as always,"" said Piastri of McLaren's intention to keep things as they were. ""What happened in Canada wasn't ideal, but we're still free to race, we are still fighting for a championship each. So, no, keep going racing and make sure that we don't come into contact again.""

Norris has become engrained in McLaren since joining the operation in 2017, initially as part of their development programme, and he considers them family. That's why the incident hurt even more because he felt he had let everyone down.

But he dealt with the tough conversations and reaction head-on and has since reflected that it has ultimately made McLaren stronger.

""I think from that point it was, yeah, an unfortunate positive,"" he said. ""Between the trust and the honesty I think that Oscar and I have for one another, it's important that we keep it up, we stay strong as a team because we don't want to have the downfall that we know many other teams have had in the past.

""We want to race each other fair and hard and on the limit and not have a repeat of what happened last time out, and that takes both of us, even though Canada was on me, so, yeah, from a mentality point of view, from a constructive point of view, I think that's why it was positive.""

Piastri leads Norris by 22 points - almost a Grand Prix win. When a team haven't won a drivers' championship for nearly two decades, it's inevitable that there will be questions about when and if the team will choose to favour one over the other at some stage. The Australian, though, gave such talk short-shrift.

""I think, for me, I just want – and we all want – a fair opportunity trying to win both championships, especially in the Drivers' Championship, because ultimately, it can only be one of us,"" he said.

""I think the situation has to change dramatically to start having those conversations, and they're a very long way away at the moment.

""So at the moment, all I can ask for is a fair chance to try and win the championship, and that's what I want as well. No, I'm not willing to enter those talks at all.""

After one of their more challenging weekends in Canada, where Mercedes seemed to have the edge on them, both Piastri and Norris, whose McLaren team have brought upgrades to Austria, were optimistic Spielberg's Red Bull Ring should be a happier hunting ground.

""We got taken by surprise a little bit that we weren't as strong as we hoped in Canada, but hopefully it's a one-off,"" said Piastri. ""By the time we got to qualifying, I think we were in a better place and in the race, our pace was actually not bad, just we qualified a bit further back.

""I think we kind of understand what went wrong in Canada. So, we'll try and have a better weekend here, but I'm confident we'll be back on top form.""

Norris was in the fight for the win last year before a collision with rival Max Verstappen at Turn 3 ended his race and left the door open for George Russell – winner of the last race in Canada – to sneak through to win.

And the place holds a special place in his heart as it was the scene of his first podium. That's perhaps another reason why he's feeling better than expected ahead of this weekend.

""If there is any track that I kind of would say I would go to, to give myself the best feeling and make myself most comfortable, it's probably here, just from my stats, from my enjoyment of the circuit and, yeah, some of the memories that I've had here as well, so a good one,"" he said.

""But every weekend's new and there's already a lot of good learnings from last weekend.""

And naturally Piastri, who has won five races so far this season and tops the table, is feeling like he's in a good place, too.

""I'm enjoying the position I'm in at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a position I've been in before in my junior career.

""I look at it quite simply, it normally means you're doing something right if you're leading a championship. That's not to say there aren't things I can improve on; Canada was a scrappy weekend.

""There have been a couple this year that have not been as good as I wanted, but there have also been a lot that have looked as good as I wanted.

""I'm just trying to make every weekend look like that - that's the most important thing. What's happening with anyone else on the grid, I'm not really concerned by.

""Ultimately, to try and win the championship, I need to put my best foot forward. If I do that, then I know it's enough to win.""

So, it's as you were, then. We've got two drivers, in arguably the best car on the grid, with the bit between their teeth and anxious to snatch the momentum in the championship fight. Bring it on.

'Positive first day' in Austria for Piastri and McLaren

Alonso's Aston Martin ‘still not in the window, still difficult to drive' after Friday practice

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, from the driver tipped as most likely to win through to who might join them on the podium.

The F1 circus heads to Austria for the 11th race weekend of the year, but who are the favourites at Red Bull's home track? Will McLaren triumph yet again this season, or can Max Verstappen chalk up another victory in front of what could be a very partisan crowd? Here are what the odds tell us...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

George Russell claimed his and Mercedes' first win of the season last time out in Montreal while it proved to be a tough weekend for McLaren, culminating in late-race collision between Piastri and Lando Norris that put the latter out of the running while Piastri crossed the line in fourth.

Despite this setback, Piastri is rated as most likely to take victory in Austria, with Norris just behind him in the odds. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, is also tipped as being in with a shot, the Dutchman having scored a record four Grand Prix wins at the Red Bull Ring.

Outside of those aforementioned three names, Russell is tipped as being the next favourite to stand on the rostrum this weekend. The Silver Arrows enjoyed a double podium at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, with Kimi Antonelli taking his maiden top-three finish in Formula 1.

Charles Leclerc also has favourable odds, the Ferrari driver having sprayed the champagne on three occasions so far in 2025.

Up until Montreal, Norris had been the only driver to finish every race of the season so far within the top six – but this run came to an end with his dramatic retirement from the race, meaning that he now joins Piastri and Verstappen as having one finish outside of the top-six positions.

Like Ferrari team mate Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton has consistently crossed the line within the top six across the last four races. The seven-time World Champion will be hoping for a good result again this time around at a track he previously took victory at back in 2016.

The Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have been regular points scorers in 2025, though only Sainz made it to the finish last time out in Canada. They will be keen to further add to their tally as they continue to hold a solid fifth in the Teams' standings.

Some other names have also troubled the top 10 in recent Grands Prix, with the veterans Fernando Alonso and Nico Hulkenberg both scoring back-to-back points at the last two rounds on the calendar.

McLaren have secured the most pole positions so far this season and the Woking-based outfit are tipped as favourites to do so again in Austria, with Piastri just beating Norris in the odds.

Verstappen started last year's race at the Red Bull Ring from P1 on the grid but ultimately lost out on the win following a late-race collision with Norris, meaning that Russell swept through to claim victory.

This category has been dominated by McLaren throughout the campaign to date, and the reigning Teams' Champions are again deemed as most likely to be the winning outfit this weekend.

Behind them in the odds are Red Bull – with Verstappen leading their charge as Yuki Tsunoda continues to get to grips with the RB21 – while Mercedes are ranked in third ahead of Ferrari off the back of their positive outing in Montreal.

Lando Norris headed a McLaren 1-2 at the end of second practice for the Austrian Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen completing the top three for Red Bull.

McLaren driver Lando Norris topped the timesheets during Friday afternoon's second practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, leading the way from team mate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull rival Max Verstappen.

A couple of hours on from an initial outing topped by George Russell and Mercedes, who claimed pole position and victory last time out in Canada, the 20-strong field had another 60 minutes to dial in their cars through an increasingly overcast but warm and dry FP2.

Back in action after Alex Dunne's eye-catching FP1 run, Lando Norris soon stated his intentions when the session began by clocking a 1m 05.437s on medium tyres, putting him just ahead of Russell (softs), Verstappen (softs) and Piastri (hards) at the one-third mark.

Elsewhere, there was some drama for Charles Leclerc, who also missed first practice and went for a trip through the gravel at Turn 6, while Kimi Antonelli had to take avoiding action when he approached a slow-moving Lewis Hamilton at Turn 4.

As the session developed and every driver pumped in laps on the red-marked soft rubber, Norris maintained his superiority with a 1m 04.580s – a tenth-and-a-half quicker than Piastri and three-tenths faster than Verstappen, who used two fresh sets.

Continuing to bounce back from wrist surgery, Lance Stroll impressed en route to fourth position for Aston Martin, from Leclerc, Russell and the sister Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda, whose best lap put him within four-tenths of team mate Verstappen.

Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto was another driver to make their mark with a run to eighth, just in front of Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin and Hamilton, who lamented to his engineer over the radio that “for some reason I've just got no pace, mate”.

Antonelli wound up just outside the top-10 places, followed by the Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson – who had to return to the pits early on thanks to his steering wheel “pulling me massively to the right” – and Isack Hadjar.

Pierre Gasly was the first driver with a deficit of more than a second to pace-setter Norris in another ultra-close session, taking 14th in his Alpine over the Haas and Williams machines – Esteban Ocon leading Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz and Ollie Bearman.

Fresh from points-scoring runs in Spain and Canada, it was a quieter practice session for Nico Hulkenberg, who was around half a second slower than Sauber team mate Bortoleto in 19th.

Hulkenberg reported over the radio that “I'm not feeling the love” from the car as the chequered flag approached, leaving the German ahead of only Alpine's Franco Colapinto on the FP2 timing screen.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Red Bull Ring paddock to dig through the data and ponder set-up changes before the third and final practice session, which is due to begin at 1230 local time on Saturday.

Amid growing talk of Sebastian Vettel potentially succeeding Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko in the future, Max Verstappen admits “there's always a spot available” for him at the team.

Max Verstappen has thrown his support behind Sebastian Vettel after the legendary German driver confirmed talks with Helmut Marko about one day taking on an advisory role at Red Bull Racing.

Vettel has a deep, successful connection with Red Bull, earning the team's first F1 pole position and race win back in 2009, and becoming their maiden World Champion a year later – kicking off a run of four straight title-winning seasons.

He left the Milton Keynes-based squad at the end of the 2014 campaign, completing stints at Ferrari and Aston Martin, before retiring from the sport at the end of 2022 with 53 victories, 122 podium finish and 57 poles to his name.

Now, the 37-year-old has openly admitted to conversations with long-time Red Bull junior chief Marko, 82, about the possibility of stepping into the Austrian's shoes when he decides to step away from F1.

Speaking in an appearance on ORF TV's Sport am Sonntag podcast, Vettel explained: “There have been a few headlines recently. I still get along great with Helmut, and we're in contact regarding the topic.”

He added: “[Talks are] not yet that intensive or in-depth, it's perhaps something that could play a role. In what form remains to be seen.”

Quizzed about those comments ahead of this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, fellow four-time World Champion Verstappen gave his seal of approval to such a scenario – should Vettel ultimately decide to go down that route.

“I mean, it's more than normal that someone that has achieved so much with Red Bull, has been brought up by Red Bull, that… in a sense there's always a spot available, right?” Verstappen said.

“I think also Seb always kept a really good relationship with Helmut anyway, even when he left. I'm sure that there's always a space for Seb, in any kind of form.”

Since vacating a race seat, Vettel has maintained an F1 paddock presence in various ways, including sustainability initiatives, tributes to Ayrton Senna that he organised in Imola and Sao Paulo last year, and a recent karting-based Race4Women event in Saudi Arabia.

‘The confidence in FP2 felt much better' – Tsunoda

Williams pace ‘better than it looks' after Friday practice, insists Sainz

It was a momentous week for Kimi Antonelli following his debut F1 podium in Canada, with the Mercedes driver completing his school exams.

Kimi Antonelli has admitted that finishing his exams has come as a “big relief”, with the rookie completing his schooling in the days after scoring his first F1 podium at the Canadian Grand Prix.

Antonelli had been juggling his education with embarking on his debut season in Formula 1, having memorably combined the two by bringing his class from school to his first home race at Imola.

But now that has come to an end following the completion of his exams, with Antonelli saying of the achievement: “I'm super happy to have finished this journey, which was important to finish. Now I can just focus on racing, and it's a big relief as well.”

Having not been able to enjoy too many celebrations of his P3 result in Montreal given his impending examinations, the Mercedes driver admitted that balancing his school work with his racing career has proven difficult at times.

“I couldn't even celebrate Canada because I had to go and study straight away,” Antonelli conceded. “It's not easy of course to balance studies with motorsport, especially this year with F1 because I have a lot more commitments outside racing as well.

“So a lot less time but I'm super happy that I was able to finish this journey, and now I can just focus and enjoy racing.”

Despite this, Antonelli can still recall how it felt to stand on the podium at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, a moment that he believes marks a key “turning point” in his season.

“It took me a little while to realise what happened in Canada,” the 18-year-old reflected. “It was such a special moment. I remember going on the podium, I had goosebumps, especially also after hearing people chanting my name. I think was a really special moment.

“Also to see the whole team in the pit lane, my dad as well, I think is a memory that I will remember forever. It took me quite long because when something such as this happens, it's something so big that it takes a little bit for the brain to realise.

“Mercedes were so kind, they let me bring the trophy home and I put it in the living room and every day I was walking past seeing the trophy, it was special. That also made me realise what had happened.

“[It] was a really good result, big relief on my side and I think this has to be a turning point because obviously now I showed to myself that I can do it and now, because the feeling is so good, you just want more.”

Looking ahead to this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, Antonelli is curious to see how the pecking order shakes out.

“It's going to be interesting,” the teenager said. “First of all, we need to see the weather which is quite unpredictable. Just looking at today, it was crazy.

“I think Canada was a good boost of confidence, was a big relief as well, especially to release the stress, and I think this weekend is going to be different.

“Different track, different conditions, it's a track where usually Red Bull have been strong. For sure McLaren are going to be strong so I think it's going to be pretty tight, but I'm ready to give my best.”

With James Vowles extending his stay as Team Principal of Williams, Alex Albon believes that this is a positive sign for the squad.

Alex Albon has hailed James Vowles' new contract with Williams as a “great vote of confidence for all of us”, with the Thai driver praising the Team Principal for being a “good leader”.

It was confirmed in the days after the Canadian Grand Prix that Vowles – who first joined the squad from Mercedes at the start of 2023 – had agreed a new long-term deal, meaning that he will remain in charge as the squad continue their mission of returning to winning ways.

When asked ahead of this weekend's race in Austria about the importance of Vowles' new contract, Albon responded: “I think it's a great vote of confidence for all of us.

“I feel like James has clearly spearheaded the team in a good direction, the right direction, and for myself, the team, it's a great sign of things to come and shows trust and confidence from the board. It makes the future brighter for the team.”

Albon went on to praise Vowles' leadership skills as he reflected on how the Briton has most greatly impacted the team since his arrival.

“I would say the biggest impact is that he is direct, he's honest and he's very simply just a good leader,” Albon conceded. “He tells us the direction and we follow.”

Upon joining Williams in 2023, Vowles set his focus on transforming the team's fortunes – and things definitely look to have improved in recent times, with the 2025 campaign marking the outfit's strongest start to a season since 2016.

Currently sitting fifth in the Teams' Championship, the 55 points achieved collectively by Albon and Carlos Sainz so far is more than the number of points the squad scored across the previous three seasons combined.

Pushed on whether there might be the chance for a podium during this campaign, Albon said: “We have a better chance than previous years, if the time ever comes to get a podium.

“I don't think we can get a podium on pure pace, but it does feel like the podium chances often happen to the top midfield team of that weekend, and we're in that position quite often.

“There haven't been many crazy races this year where it's been wet-dry-wet-dry, I think maybe Australia and Miami. I wouldn't say I expect a podium this year but, if it happens, it happens.”

For now the focus is on the weekend ahead at the Red Bull Ring, a circuit that Albon is “optimistic” about in terms of whether it might suit the FW47.

“To be honest, Canada should have suited us too and it looked like it was, we just fell a bit short come Saturday and Sunday,” the 29-year-old conceded.

“The vibes are still strong. I think this weekend does suit our car,
Silverstone more so, but we're seeing now the other teams with their upgrades – they're definitely catching up.”

While Lando Norris has struggled for feel in the 2025 McLaren, the team may just have found the solution...

Have McLaren developed a solution to Lando Norris' car feel problems that he's reported since the start of the season? For the first time we can now see the visual difference between the standard McLaren front suspension and the ‘feedback enhanced' version prepared for Norris in Canada, as can be seen in the Giorgio Piola drawing below.

This was in response to Norris' complaints that he could not feel the front of the car in the same way he could with last year's machine.

Speaking back during the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, the Briton said: “Something's just not clicking with me and the car. I'm not able to do any of the laps like I was doing last season.

""Then, I knew every single corner, everything that was going to happen with the car – how it was going to happen. I felt on top of the car. This year, I could not have felt more opposite so far.”

Piastri has expressed no such reservations and, although he tried the new specification suspension in practice at Montreal, he decided to remain with the standard system.

McLaren have been working on this revision for almost three months, but at a casual glance there is no obvious difference between the two suspensions.

The drawings show the crucial clue. The upper wishbones of the Norris version mount to the wheel with slightly thicker cross-sections than that of Piastri.

This is not in itself a change which would enhance the feedback to the steering, but it does correlate with a change which would – that of increasing the suspension's king pin inclination.

What does this mean? The articulation of the wheel as it is steered is partly defined by how the wheel hub is angled from the vertical (as viewed from straight-on).

The difference between the straight line and the angle the hub is running is the king pin inclination.

The wheel will turn through a greater radius (called the scrub radius) the greater that angle is. This will give a greater difference in the weighting feedback through the steering as it is turned through different angles of lock.

If, as we suspect, Norris' new suspension features a greater king pin inclination to enhance the steering feedback, it would place greater loads at the top of the suspension mounting, providing an explanation for why the top wishbones are slightly sturdier looking.

As ever, time will tell if it can help Norris recover what he feels he has lost in 2025 compared to last year as he looks to chase down his championship-leading team mate.

Formula 1 and Official Partner Allwyn will celebrate community-focused initiatives around the world with the new F1 Allwyn Global Community Award.

Formula 1, together with leading multi-national lottery-led entertainment company and Official Partner Allwyn, will celebrate and spotlight community-focused initiatives around the world with the new F1 Allwyn Global Community Award.

The brand-new programme, created as part of the two organisations' multi-year partnership and as part of their shared commitment to driving positive change, will celebrate local initiatives that leave a positive impact on society.

The winners, who will receive a €100,000 donation along with a bespoke trophy and the chance to visit a Formula 1 Grand Prix, must address one or more of the following focus areas: empowerment and inclusion; education and opportunity; health and wellbeing, and sustainability and innovation.

Ahead of each selected Grand Prix, the local promoter will identify community-focused initiatives supported by the F1 ecosystem that have had a meaningful impact, and a panel of judges from Formula 1, Allwyn, and a representative from the local race community will select a winner.

This year, the first award will be presented at the Dutch Grand Prix, taking place between 29 – 31 August, with subsequent winners awarded at the United States, Mexico, and Las Vegas Grands Prix.

Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO of Formula 1, said: “It is a pillar of our sport to leave a positive legacy where we race and for many years we've worked with the promoters and regional organisations to do just that, from inviting children from local schools to the track to encourage them to consider a role in motorsport, through to funding education initiatives and welcoming local community outlets and charities to be part of the event.

""Every year, 24 incredible venues open their doors to host us, and we are met with fantastic passion and love at the track and throughout the entire city, so I am very proud to launch the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award as part of our mission. We will give the local initiatives that go the extra mile for making their communities and make the world a better place the recognition and global platform they deserve.”

Robert Chvátal, Group CEO of Allwyn, added: “Championing positive impact is at the heart of what we do at Allwyn. Our partnership with Formula 1 is the perfect chance to demonstrate our commitment to communities through the creation of this inspiring F1 Allwyn Global Community Award, supporting the very best community initiatives around the world and bringing them to a huge global audience.”

He played Deputy Cletus Hogg for five seasons on the CBS show, a big hit on Friday nights, before leaving for an ABC version of 'Fawlty Towers' that didn't last long.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Rick Hurst, who portrayed the good-hearted Deputy Cletus Hogg on the long-running CBS action comedy The Dukes of Hazzard, died Thursday. He was 79.


	Hurst's death was announced by the Cooter's Place museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. He had just canceled a scheduled July 3-7 appearance there.




	“To fans, he was more than a character — he was family,” reads a Dukes of Hazzard post on Instagram. “His gentle smile, impeccable comedic timing and kind-hearted spirit made every scene brighter.

	“Offscreen, Rick was known for his generosity, humility and love for connecting with fans at events across the country. Whether it was a reunion special or a meet-and-greet at Cooter's, he never stopped sharing his joy with the people who adored him.”

	











	Before his most famous role, Hurst played a prisoner named Cleaver alongside Tom Poston and Hal Williams on the 1975-76 ABC sitcom On the Rocks, which revolved around inmates at a minimum security facility.


	Hurst also guest-starred on lots of TV programs, from The Bob Newhart Show, Gunsmoke, Kojak, Happy Days and Little House on the Prairie to M*A*S*H, Baretta, Highway to Heaven, Evening Shade and The Wonder Years.


	Survivors include his son Ryan Hurst, an actor perhaps best known for his turn as Opie Winston on the FX drama Sons of Anarchy.


	Hurst first showed up as Cletus — the second cousin twice removed of corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) — in 1979 on the 11th episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, starring Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach and a 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed the General Lee. The series was a big hit for CBS on Friday nights.

	











	Cletus becomes temporary deputy when Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) is away during the second season, and he leaves his junkyard job to become permanent during season three, when Shroyer starred in his own spinoff series, Enos.


	After Enos returns to Hazzard County, Georgia, from his assignment in Los Angeles — the spinoff lasted just one season — he and Cletus share deputy duty and a patrol car through season five (1982-83).


	Hurst, who frequently ended up landing in a pond while pursuing those bedeviling Duke boys (Wopat and Schneider) in one of those great car chases, then returned for reunion telefilms in 1997 and 2000.


	Born in Houston on New Year's Day in 1946, Richard Douglas Hurst earned his bachelor's degree from Tulane University in 1968 and his master's in fine arts from Temple University in 1970. He received acting lessons from Cecil Pickett, a drama teacher at the University of Houston and the father of future St. Elsewhere actress Cindy Pickett.


	He made his onscreen debut on a 1971 episode of The Doris Day Show, then appeared the next year on Sanford and Son and The Partridge Family and in the movie The Unholy Rollers.


	He exited Dukes to play bumbling chef Earl Nash on Amanda's, an ill-advised 1983 ABC remake of fabled British hit sitcom Fawlty Towers that starred Bea Arthur as the owner of a seaside hotel (it was her first series after Maude). However, the show aired just 10 episodes before being canceled.


	Hurst's big-screen body of work also included W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), Tunnel Vision (1976), The Cat From Outer Space (1978), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), In the Line of Fire (1993) and Steel Magnolias (1989).

Before he came to public television in 1971, he was Lyndon Johnson's press secretary and the publisher of Newsday.



		By Duane Byrge, Mike Barnes 

	June 26, 2025 1:33pm	




	Bill Moyers, the onetime White House Press Secretary and newspaper publisher who spent four decades as a respected broadcast journalist and documentarian for PBS and CBS, died Thursday. He was 91. 


	Moyers died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York after a long illness, his son William told the Associated Press.




	Moyers hosted, wrote for and/or produced PBS programs like Bill Moyers' Journal, Moyers & Company, A World of Ideas, Frontline, Now With Bill Moyers, Creativity With Bill Moyers and A Walk Through the 20th Century in stretches from 1971 through 2010, winning two Peabody Awards, three Humanitas Prizes and four Primetime Emmys along the way.

	An eloquent speaker with a soft Texas twang, he was a skillful longform interviewer who confronted social and political issues with incisive, folksy exploration. He was not afraid to state his point of view and supported liberal causes and organizations, including Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting and Take Back America.


	“In an age of television shouters, Mr. Moyers is an anomaly,” David Carr wrote for The New York Times in 2004. “His delivery is measured and the rhetoric temperate. Yet he used the tools of the documentarian to wield a velvet sledgehammer, bludgeoning corporate polluters and government ne'er-do-wells with precision and grace. His tendentiousness in choice of targets has earned him the fealty of public television audiences and the enmity of conservative observers.”


	In 1976, Moyers exited PBS to become editor and chief correspondent for CBS Reports. He also did On the Road mini-documentaries as well as analysis and commentary for the CBS Evening News With Dan Rather starting in 1981, drawing a salary of $1 million a year.

	











	In a bitter split, Moyers exited CBS in 1986 — he said the line between entertainment and news at the network had “steadily blurred” — and formed his own company, Public Affairs Television, to distribute his programs. Transcribed versions were published as books, including Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, which remained on the Times‘ best-seller list for more than a year.


	Moyers was hailed by some as “the conscience of America,” a trusted public figure in the mold of Walter Cronkite. He was considered a possible Democratic Party presidential candidate but never took the bait.


	In 2006, he received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for “devoting his lifetime to the exploration of the major issues and ideas of our time and our country, giving television viewers an informed perspective on political and societal concerns.”


	On Thursday night, his death was acknowledged by NATAS chairman Terry O'Reilly at the 46th annual Documentary Awards in New York. Moyers, he said, “was a whole lot happier telling the truth [as a journalist] than he was trying to hide it [while working in politics].”


	The youngest of two sons, Billy Don Moyers was born on June 5, 1934, in Hugo, Oklahoma. His father, Henry, was a truck driver and his mother, Ruby, a housewife.


	Raised in Marshall, Texas, he began his journalism career as a cub reporter on the Marshall News Messenger and was the editor of the sports page while still a sophomore at Marshall High School.

	











	At North Texas State College, he spent the summer of 1954 interning for Lyndon B. Johnson in Washington, getting the job after writing an “audacious” letter to the Texas senator. “I said to him, ‘I can tell you something about young people in Texas if you can tell me something about politics,'” he recalled in a 2001 chat for the Television Academy Foundation website The Interviews.


	Moyers graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in journalism in 1956. As a student in Austin, he also worked at KTBC-TV, a station owned by Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson. He then studied in Scotland for a year before attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, landing a Master of Divinity degree in 1960. (He officiated the wedding of George Lucas and Mellody Hobson at Skywalker Ranch in 2013.)


	Moyers rejoined Lyndon Johnson, soon to be John F. Kennedy's pick for vice president, as his “Man Friday” during the 1960 presidential campaign. He helped create the Peace Corps during the JFK administration in March 1961, reporting to the president's brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as deputy director.


	When Johnson became president after Kennedy's assassination, Moyers stayed on as his adviser and special assistant. He was highly involved in Johnson's 1964 re-election campaign against Republican Barry Goldwater and approved the controversial “Daisy” TV commercial in which a girl counts the petals she plucks from a flower before another countdown leads to a nuclear explosion on the screen.

	











	“It never mentioned Goldwater, it wasn't a personal attack,” Moyers said in his TV Archive interview. “It was an assertion of concern over whose hand was on the nuclear trigger. It was a subliminal ad, though I didn't even know the meaning of that term then. [Goldwater] never forgave me for what he understood was my role in it, right up until the end of his life.”


	After Johnson's landslide triumph, Moyers served as White House Press Secretary from 1965-67 — a media darling, he was on the covers of Time and Newsweek during his first year on the job — before resigning to become publisher of Newsday in 1967.


	The Long Island newspaper hired columnist Pete Hamill and won two Pulitzer Prizes during his three-year tenure, which ended when Newsday was sold to the Times Mirror Co. (Moyers had put together a higher offer to buy the paper but was rebuffed.)


	He then traveled around the country for Harper's magazine for four months in a “swing of rediscovery,” from which he wrote 1971's Listening to America, which became a best-seller.


	From that, New York public TV station WNET hired him to host a weekly half-hour that would become Bill Moyers' Journal. The program included the first major interview with Jimmy Carter before he was known outside of Plains, Georgia, as well as an acclaimed “Essay on Watergate” in 1973.


	Moyers had a “five years and out” philosophy, considering that for people to “renew” themselves, they should move on every five years. That philosophy originated when he persuaded Congress to make that period of time the maximum for volunteer employment in the Peace Corps.

	











	He held that policy for public broadcasting, too. “It's very important for [it] to open itself constantly to new people, to renew it,” he said. “And that's not going to happen unless us old-timers move on.” 


	He also worked for NBC and MSNBC in the mid-1990s.


	Moyers married North Texas State classmate Judith Davidson in December 1954 — she went on to serve as president of Public Affairs Television — and they had three children, William, John and Alice.

The deal, which still has to pass regulatory approval, would make RTL the third-biggest streaming service in Germany, ahead of Disney+, with 11.5 million subscribers. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	In a major shakeup of the European television market, German broadcast giant RTL Group has signed a deal to acquire pay-TV group Sky Deutschland from Comcast.


	The deal includes a €150 million ($176 million) upfront payment plus a variable component of up to a maximum of €377 million ($442 million), with the actual sum determined by RTL‘s share price, if it ranges between €41 and €70. Comcast can trigger the variable payment at any time within five years. 




	The agreement, announced by RTL parent Bertelsmann on Friday, is still subject to regulatory approval, but if it passes muster, it could mark a seismic shift in the European TV and streaming landscape. By combining Sky's subscribers across Germany, Austria and Switzerland with RTL's own premium RTL+ service, the company can boast of a streaming service reaching 11.5 million paying subscribers, leapfrogging Disney to become the third-biggest provider of streaming services in Germany after Netflix and Amazon Prime.

	Bertelsmann and RTL CEO Thomas Rabe called the deal “transformational” in his company's strategy of creating “national media champions” to compete with global streaming behemoths.


	“Following this transaction, Germany will once again be our largest market,” said Rabe, “At the same time, this acquisition is a step on the path toward strengthening European media markets – an absolute necessity in the competition with global tech and streaming platforms.”

	











	The purchase gives RTL access to Sky's premium sports rights, including Bundesliga and Premier League soccer, and Formula 1 motor racing, as well as Sky's WOW streaming service.


	Sky Deutschland reported around €2 billion ($2.34 billion) in annual revenue last year, but the company has never made a profit. With the launch of HBO Max in Germany next year, Sky will also lose its position as the exclusive provider of HBO content in German-speaking territories. 


	Rabe has tried to bulk up national operations in France and the Netherlands, only to be blocked by competition authorities. In 2022, Bertelsmann dropped a planned merger between RTL's French network M6 and France's leading commercial broadcaster TF1, amid stiff regulatory opposition. Last week, TF1 instead teamed up with Netflix, signing a landmark carriage agreement deal to stream all of its TV channels on the platform.


	In 2023, antitrust watchdogs in the Netherlands rejected RTL's bid to buy the Dutch Talpa Network and merge it with RTL's television operations there. In a separate announcement on Friday, RTL confirmed that the national competition authority has approved its deal to sell its Dutch operation to Belgium's DPG Media. RTL expects the €1.1 billion ($1.3 billion) deal to close on July 1. 


	RTL is hoping there will be less regulatory opposition to the Sky deal, since the merged group would not be a dominant force in the streaming sector, and Sky is a minor player in the German advertising market.

In her new Apple TV+ series, the actor who broke out as a child star says she gained about 15 pounds to play a complex former Marine ""She's a bit of a self-saboteur.""


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


[This story contains spoilers from the first two episodes of Smoke, “Pilot” and “Your Happy Makes Me Sad.”]


Jurnee Smollett will never back away from a challenge; in fact, she thrives on it.




	The 38-year-old actress, who first gained recognition as a child star in the '90s with her roles in Eve's Bayou, Full House and On Our Own, is always looking for ways to grow with her characters. She doesn't want to ever be “pigeonholed as one type of thing,” she makes clear.


	“Whether it was a superhero in DC Comics or Letitia-fucking-Lewis in [Lovecraft Country], or a lawyer in The Burial, or a single mom fighting to find her daughter in Lou, I'm so fortunate that I get to step into all these different professions,” Smollett tells The Hollywood Reporter.

	Person of Interest
	


	
		
					It's Anthony Ramos' Time to Play the Villain		
			









	In her latest role, she's now taking what she says is an even more “complex” and “flawed” character. In the Apple TV+ series Smoke she plays Michelle, a troubled detective who is “struggling with these real inner demons,” she says. The show is inspired by true events and follows her character and Taron Egerton's Dave, an enigmatic arson investigator, as they pursue the trails of two serial arsonists.


	Below, Smollett teases the “twists and turns” ahead in Smoke season one, opens up about her preparations to play Michelle, the advice Forest Whitaker once gave her that she still uses today and reveals the moment she's most proud of in her career.

	











What initially drew you to Smoke?


	I'm a huge fan of Dennis Lehane [Smoke creator] and his writing, going back decades. He's one of the premier crime-thriller novelists and such an incredible architect of character. So when I read the script, I was truly blown away by his ability to craft such rich suspense and intensity, while also weaving in these interpersonal relationships that are rich and complex. This character of Michelle was so juicy (laughs) and so flawed. She's struggling with these real inner demons; her trauma from her childhood and her relationships with her mother and how it manifests. It was such an opportunity as an actor to stretch and do something unlike anything I've really done. I physically transformed, I put on like 15 pounds of muscle. She's a former Marine and has to have more of a stocky, tough persona than I naturally have. 


How did you prepare and get into the headspace to play an intense character like Michelle?


	I always go back to the tools that I use with my craft. I have an amazing team around me of coaches and folks where we really dive in and deconstruct what's there, in order to construct a character. I was fascinated by this theme that Dennis spoke about: “People say they want to be happy, yet they're consumed with the very thing that will destroy them.” With Michelle, fire is the motif for this force that she struggles with inside, in which she is drawn to the very thing that is going to be her downfall, like the relationship with her boss, who's also the police captain. She's a bit of a self-saboteur, and I think we can all relate to that. We can relate to that struggle where you go, “Wait, I know I'm supposed to take this route and yet I'm so enticed by going this way.”

	











How was it working alongside Taron Egerton on the series?


	It was so awesome! Taron is so insanely talented. I did not meet him until the table read, which was great because it was almost like we were meeting each other at the same time that our characters were; I didn't meet him, I met Dave, and he didn't meet me, he met Michelle. Everything from the accent and the persona that he created with Dave feels so unlike any characters he's ever played.


Is it challenging to have to meet someone and their character at the same time like that? Especially when working so closely together?


	It's all challenging. If you're not up for the challenge, get out of the ring. I think I thrive on challenge. I remember one of my mentors, Forest Whitaker, telling me a long time ago, “If you're taking on a project and you're not nervous, then run.” He said, “Lean into the challenge, lean into all of the emotions that you feel. It means you are being stretched to grow,” and truly that's all I want. I want to work with storytellers who create characters that force me to grow. I want to work with collaborators and actors like Taron, where when you're in the ring with each other everything feels fresh and exciting and no one's phoning it in.  


Since Smoke was loosely based on the true-crime podcast Firebug and real-life arson events, how did that help you prepare for the show?  












	It was a great source. I listened to it a few times and really dissected it. I also interviewed a few detectives, a few arson investigators and I have a friend who's a firefighter. Then I researched myself online, more so the things having to do with Michelle and this PTSD relationship she has to fire. 


At the end of episode two, it's revealed that Egerton's Dave is one of the serial arsonists. Following that episode's cliffhanger, can you tease what we can expect from the rest of the season?


	No one is safe in Dennis Lehane's hands (Laughs). No character is safe. Everyone is, in essence, wearing some form of a mask; who they are forward-facing is in contradiction to who they are internally, and that makes for very interesting characters. They all have these things they're lying to themselves about. Michelle's lying to herself and to other people about a number of things. I'm really excited for people to see the twists and turns, because it is really this gripping crime drama. Yet, at its heart, you've got these characters who are struggling to get up and get out of bed every day. By the end of the season, Michelle has gone through such absolute change, which was really thrilling for me as an actor to track that change and to work with Dennis and the storytellers and directors. She's completely different by the end and does things that will shock people. 

	











Having been a part of the entertainment industry from such a young age, how did that inform the actor you are today?  


	[From] my experience on sets, I know what every person's job is, and I love the collaborative process of filmmaking and storytelling. I want to serve the story in a way where it helps support everyone around me so we all can do our best. I've been very fortunate to work with some of our greatest actors of all time, and I've learned so much from each of them, things that I keep in my back pocket of tools. Whether it's Denzel Washington or Jamie Foxx or Angela Bassett or Robin Williams, I've learned by watching and studying them. And one thing they all have in common is they're generous with their craft. They will act harder when the camera is not on them than they do when the camera is on them, because they want to make sure the scene is the best version of the scene for their partner. I've also worked with really not great folks who think they're great, and they're the ones who are competitive and self-absorbed and selfish scene partners. I swore that I would never be that way because it doesn't serve the story. The story suffers. So my biggest takeaway is really that the joy should be used for a bigger purpose. The thrill is losing yourself in the character, but the character has to serve the story. 


Having starred in The Order last year, which centers on bank robberies and car heists, and now Smoke, which centers on arsons, are you drawn to the true-crime genre, or is it just a coincidence? 












	I think it's a coincidence, but I also feel incredibly privileged if I look back over the past few projects I've done. Whether it was a superhero in DC Comics or it was Letitia-fucking-Lewis in [Lovecraft Country] or a lawyer in The Burial or a single mom fighting to find her daughter in Lou or an FBI agent with The Order, and now a detective, it's thrilling because I always said I didn't want to be pigeonholed as one type of thing and I feel really fortunate to be able to tap into all these different pathways. I'm so fortunate that I get to step into all these different professions. 


Do you have a dream genre, role or project you would like to do in the future?  


	Musical!


When you have a day off from set, what does your perfect free day look like?


	I'm a mom to an 8-year-old little boy, so it would definitely involve some sort of physical activity with him: basketball, baseball, cooking together, swimming. Somewhere around water and nature with the people I love, or taking a warm bath and listening to awesome music. The other thing would be playing piano and chocolate. What we do can sometimes be surrounded by a lot of chaos, and so a lot of the work that I do in my quiet time to keep me grounded is very calm and non-chaotic, and some people might say boring, but man, I love boring. I love mundane. I love rituals and stability. 


Is there a moment throughout your career so far that you're most proud of? 












	I'm very grateful that people still come up to me and they reference projects that moved them. A woman came up to me not too long ago and told me that she was inspired to join the debate team because of Great Debaters, and then it made her become a lawyer and she now is this really great lawyer. I think art matters and is essential. I so often think about James Baldwin's talk about the integrity of an artist. I'm paraphrasing, but he talks about it being a force you didn't ask for, and yet it's a destiny you must accept and if you don't lie, if you don't cheat, it's not only your glory but it's almost our only hope, because only artists have and only artists can, since humans have been created, been able to come to earth and tell us all what it's like to survive it. So I think I'm most proud that I haven't sold my integrity, that my resume is not 50 pages long. I'm in a position of privilege where I can choose things that connect with me and I'm able to work with storytellers and collaborators that challenge me, thrill me and make me excited to get up every day and come to work. 


If you had to describe what makes Jurnee Smollett, Jurnee Smollett, what would you say? 


	My smile, my inner joy. You may not know by all the dark roles I pick. (Laughs). But I work really hard, and I can't take all the credit because I do believe in a higher power. But I work really hard to protect my joy and I think that's a radical act.

The first glimpse of White as Springsteen came in the 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' trailer that dropped on June 18. 


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Jeremy Allen White has been recognized for playing protagonist Carmy for four seasons now on FX's Emmy-winning series The Bear. But when he debuted his transformation into Bruce Springsteen for the upcoming biopic on the iconic artist, White broke the internet. And then it damn near broke his cellphone.


	The Deliver Me From Nowhere trailer that dropped on June 18 marked White's debut as Springsteen. White does his own singing in the 20th Century Studios biopic from writer-director Scott Cooper, which focuses on the making of Springsteen's 1982 Nebraska, one of the most acclaimed albums of all time.

	In the trailer (below), White rocks out as the Boss and says of the deeply personal album, “Don't need to be perfect. I want it to feel like I'm in the room by myself.” Deliver Me From Nowhere hits theaters Oct. 24. 


	“Getting that out, it was so much pressure,” the actor told Jimmy Fallon on Thursday's Tonight Show. “You're playing a real person — nevermind Bruce Springsteen — and I was really touched [when] the trailer came out. I had more texts than when I blacked out and won that Golden Globe [for The Bear],” he told Fallon.


	“I didn't realize trailers were that big of a thing,” he added.


The Bear, meanwhile, has won 21 Emmys and five Globes, and set a new record with the 2024 Emmys for the most nominations in a single year for a comedy. The show's category classification, however, has become a source of contention within the industry, with many critics arguing that the series should not be considered a comedy.

	











	The series from creator Christopher Storer released its fourth season on Wednesday without much promotion ahead of the buzzy show's release date, and with limited screeners for the press. During his visit to Fallon, the pair talked briefly about the show's return and, of course, did not talk any spoilers.


	“It is rare to not have producers and major castmembers made available to the press ahead of a new season — and exceedingly rare during awards campaign season,” explained The Hollywood Reporter‘s TV Editor Tony Maglio in a recent column. “FX won the most Emmys of any network in 2024, so it's not exactly amateur hour for the brand; they known what they're doing and they clearly do it well.”


THR‘s TV critic Angie Han, meanwhile, said of the new season in her review that “the fourth season ends on a note that could represent the end of everything, or a pivot toward a less Carmy-centric direction, or just a brief pause before business resumes as usual.”

In the aftermath of a violent rebellion, the contestants press onward through high-stakes competitions as outside forces continue searching for the operation's mysterious location.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	There are some series that work so well as one-and-dones that it's hard to imagine what could possibly be gained creatively from pressing onward with a second season. Sometimes, those seemingly unnecessary renewals nevertheless yield pleasant surprises: Barry got only darker and weirder as it went on, White Lotus successfully expanded itself into a globe-trotting anthology, and so on.


	Other times, however, that initial skepticism proves justified. The second round of Netflix's South Korean sleeper hit Squid Game was a thudding step down from the first, rehashing most of the same themes and story beats at a slower pace with fewer insights. But it also delivered only half a season's worth of plot, planting bombs to be detonated later and then cutting off just as things got truly intense. A reasonable person might have hoped a third season could provide enough payoff to make at least some of those stumbles worthwhile.

The Bottom Line

	
	Exhausted and exhausting.
	



Airdate: Friday, June 27 (Netflix)Cast: Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-joon, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Kang Ae-shim, Yang Dong-geun, Jo Yu-ri, Im Si-wan, Roh Jae-won, Jeon Seok-hoCreator: Hwang Dong-hyuk			
			







	Alas. It brings me no pleasure to report that the third and thankfully last of Squid Game seasons only confirms that we, like Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), should've left that cursed island behind for good after his first victory.


	Season three picks up in the immediate aftermath of season two, as the last few rebels from Gi-hun's violent uprising are put down and their bodies cleaned up. Gi-hun himself is not among the dead, though that fact gives him no relief. The man who returns to the dorms is one so flattened by grief and guilt that he snaps to life only to scream at the guards to just kill him already.

	











	They don't, of course. Nor are the surviving contestants moved to reconsider his earlier pleas to choose to quit. So the game, and Squid Game, proceed as usual, hurtling contestants through deadly high-stakes versions of hide-and-seek, jump rope and something the organizers term “Sky Squid Game,” which is essentially a shoving match atop dizzyingly high columns.


	But the thrill is gone, even if the VIPs — yes, they are back, and their bizarrely stilted line readings along with them — try to convince us otherwise. The voting is “more exciting than the actual games!” one declares, as if responding to viewer complaints that the voting took up too much time in season two. “This just keeps getting more and more interesting!” another announces late in this season, like we might start to believe them if they just say it loudly enough.


	It doesn't work. While creator Hwang Dong-hyuk still has a few more nasty tricks up his sleeve ­— including one final twist of the knife so cruel I gasped when I realized what was happening — its latest run is too short on surprise and emotion and too long on misery and, well, length.


	Its main thematic target is once again the unjustness of our modern capitalist system, this time with a specific and sometimes devastatingly shrewd eye toward how the pretense of democracy can paper over unspeakable cruelty. “In accordance with your free and democratic vote, the next game will resume tomorrow,” the participants are informed after each vote to keep playing, as if there could be anything “free” about such a choice being made in a system rigged by distant elites and enforced by faceless thugs. In one of the season's most darkly hilarious moments, a player apologetically informs another that the others have voted to sacrifice him. “Please forgive me, but we're going to need you to die,” he pleads, invoking majority rule in a futile attempt to erase his own complicity and the man's desire to live.

	











	But season three is an awfully long way to go for those occasional bits of wisdom, and a largely unpleasant one besides. Squid Game has never been a “nice” show by any standard. Early on, however, its grimness was tempered by a deep empathy for the people trapped in this maze, and the occasional flickers of hope that compassion and connection might arise even under the harshest of climates; part of what made that initial outing so fascinatingly queasy was the tension between how bad we felt for the characters' suffering and how entertaining it was to watch.


	Now, it's gloom and doom all the way down. The show is still great at coming up with new and creative ways to torture its characters (one twist involving a baby is as viscerally upsetting as it seems logistically implausible), but less so at digging into their humanity. And without the latter, the former starts to feel like misery for misery's sake.


	If the new players introduced in season two felt disappointingly thin, season three makes no attempt to flesh them out any further. It's a miscalculation that limits our investment not just in clearly odious figures like sadistic Nam-gyu (Roh Jae-won) or greedy Jeong-dae (Song Young-chang), but also in sympathetic souls like trans soldier Hyun-ju (Park Sung-hoon) and expectant mother Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri). Aside from Gi-hun, now a strong silent type with no remaining trace of his old gregariousness, the one thing all of them have in common is that they seem more like pieces being pushed around a chess board than complicated human beings with agency and interiority.

	











	In lieu of character and relationship work, Squid Game season three offers heaps and heaps of plot. But while there are a few bright spots — chief among them the bits of levity offered by slightly goofy, occasionally clever and generally lovable loan shark Woo-seok (Jeon Seok-ho) — the pace is lumbering. Painstaking efforts by guard No-eul (Park Gyu-young) to save a player she knows from the outside, the interminable quest by ex-cop Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) to find the island, and the frequent cuts back to the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) in his fancy chair and the VIPs in their luxury suites only drag the proceedings in the arena out further, while adding little in the way of new information, emotional impact or thematic depth.


	By the time Squid Game finally crawls over the finish line, there's no sense of the triumph you might get from completing a really good story — only of relief that this entire grueling experience is finally over. The series has one last jolt to offer on its way out, one that could just be a fun little bow to tie the whole thing together or the start of yet another new spinoff chapter. For its sake and our own, let's hope it's the former. The kindest thing to offer this universe now might be a mercy killing.

The K-pop quartet's latest single and music video arrived on June 27.

The ladies of aespa are getting busy! The quartet dropped its latest single, “Dirty Work,” and its accompanying music video via SM Entertainment/Virgin Records on Friday (June 27).

The synth-poppy rock-infused dance track didn't arrive alone, though. It came packaged in a four-song release that includes the original version of “Dirty Work,” as well as a remix featuring rapper Flo Milli, a Korean-language version, as well as an instrumental take. In addition, KARINA, WINTER, GISELLE and NINGNING did an album shoot for the release, and Billboard has the exclusive look at the five photos, with the group shot above, and the remaining four snaps featuring each member below.

For the music video, the quartet — who each portray strong characters who are going against the grain and taking on the “dirty work” — recruited 225 extras to perform in the choreo-heavy visual. It was filmed at Hyundai Steel's steel mill located in in Dangjin, South Korea, and includes shots of heavy machinery to add to the industrial vibe. The feel of the video was hinted at in a teaser clip that dropped earlier in the month on June 4. Though it didn't hint at what the song would sound like, the clip showed a pile of metal — including gears and chains — being melted down, with the molten substance dripping down to slowly form the title of the song.

The release arrives after aespa accepted the Group of the Year honor from actress-singer Suki Waterhouse at the 2025 Billboard Women in Music event in March. “We want to cheer on all women who are chasing their dreams, and we hope everyone gets the chance to reach their full potential,” GISELLE said during the K-pop group's acceptance speech. “Music really does connect all of us, and we're so grateful to be a part of this journey.” Just the year before, aespa became the first K-pop girl group to have six projects reach the Billboard 200 top 50.

Aespa closed out the Women in Music event with a performance of the English version of “Whiplash.”

Plus: Brandon Lake, Metallica, King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard, Calum Hood, SZA & iTZY make news in the top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



ATEEZ achieve its fifth No. 1 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart (dated June 28) as the act's latest release, GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 debuts atop the list. All fif of the group's leaders have been consecutive, starting with 2023's THE WORLD EP.2 : OUTLAW.


GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 sold 101,500 copies in the United States in the week ending June 19, according to Luminate. In total, ATEEZ has collected eight top 10s on the Top Album Sales chart.


	Also in the top 10 of the latest Top Album Sales chart, the latest efforts from Brandon Lake, King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard, Calum Hood and iTZY all debut in the region. Meanwhile, Metallica's former No. 1 Load returns after an expanded reissue and SZA's SOS reenters after new CD and vinyl editions for the deluxe LANA edition of the album dropped.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units.

	











	ENHYPEN's DESIRE : UNLEASH falls to No. 2 on Top Album Sales (27,000; down 71%) after debuting at No. 1 a week ago. Brandon Lake notches his first top 10 and biggest sales week ever as King of Hearts bows at No. 3 (20,000).


	Metallica's Load, first released in 1996, reenters the chart at No. 4 with 12,000 sold (up 6,925%) after its deluxe reissue in multiple formats with bonus material. (All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting purposes.) Load debuted at No. 1 on the June 22, 1996-dated chart and spent four consecutive weeks atop the list that year.


	King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard notch its highest charting album ever on Top Album Sales, and fifth top 10, as Phantom Island debuts at No. 5 with nearly 11,000 copies sold. The band had previously gone as high as No. 7, twice, with 2019's Infest the Rats' Nest and 2024's Flight B741.

After four years away and a tumultuous period of self-discovery, the pop star has released the bravest album of her career.

	When a pop artist follows a specific release pattern over the course of their career, it's easy to assume that a new album and corresponding promotional cycle are all part of a pre-ordained plan, meant to deliver fresh art for more commerce at regular intervals. That's why, when 2025 began, a new Lorde album and tour felt like safe bets for the calendar year — considering that, since she was a teen prodigy from New Zealand, she had released a full-length every four years, followed by an extended live run and then a period relatively out of the spotlight, until she returned four years later. Her last album, Solar Power, came out in 2021. We just knew that this particular pop comet was due to re-enter our orbit soon enough.


	But artists do not create like clockwork, and behind the scenes, Lorde, now 28, was wondering not whether she would release a new album on schedule, but if she would release one at all. “In 2023 I thought for sure I didn't have any more music in me and all this was over,” she wrote on Instagram two days before the release of her fourth album, Virgin. 


	The promotional campaign for this album has involved tales of a bitter breakup and body dysmorphia, creeping feelings of stage fright and questions about her gender identity. Instead of retreating from the intimate pressure points and personal changes that have defined her mid-twenties, she poured them into a new album, and is now hoisting them up for the world to see. One listen to Lorde's Virgin confirms that it is by far the bravest album of her career.


	Yet repeated plays showcase the expertly crafted nuances of the project — which Lorde largely created with producer Jim-E Stack, and which was deeply informed by the concrete rhythms of New York City. Gone are the sun-kissed arrangements of Solar Power, replaced by raw, brawny beats; Virgin is dominated by drums, and sometimes the songs bend in service of their percussion more than Lorde's voice. 


	Whether she's singing about pain, enlightenment or their symbiotic relationship, however, Lorde remains an authoritative pop singer-songwriter, brimming with piercing lines and always delivering them with expressive care. The style and subjects may shift, but the fundamental, self-possessed talent does not.


Virgin is a knowingly messy album, full of left-turn song structures, untamed physicality and giant rhetorical questions placed in small, hushed sequences. The path between albums three and four was not an easy one for Lorde, but that journey resulted in an artistic shake-up that's downright triumphant. Whether her next project is four years, four months or forty years away, Lorde remains a pop artist worth investing in, now and long-term.


	Below, see Billboard's preliminary ranking of the 11 songs from Lorde's Virgin.


If the explicit sample of Jamaican veteran Dexta Daps' 2014 single “Morning Love” didn't make it clear, “Current Affairs” is an evocative sex rumination, full of spit, moans, underwear and beds on fire — but just as immediate is Lorde's wounded delivery, with several syllables elongated as she tries to navigate physical and emotional entanglements. “Current Affairs” works as a different shade of Lorde's pop songwriting; simply put, she's never delivered a chorus quite like this one.


A little over a year after The Tortured Poets Department, Lorde riffs on the idea of healing from a breakup at the gym, although she's far from down bad: “Yesterday,” she asserts, “I lifted your body weight.” “If She Could See Me Now” tackles disassociation within a toxic relationship, moving on from memories by replaying them over and over until the pain has been sucked out; the synthesizers mirror the healing, opening as a dissonant thud before smoothing out into an airy chord progression.


The ballads on Lorde's previous album somehow haven't been as quiet, or as loud, as “Man of the Year”: the song's opening pairs her voice with a plucked bass string and nothing else, allowing the pop star to glide through melismas and wax poetic about embracing gender fluidity, but then things ramp up to a buzzing, ecstatic cacophony in the final 45 seconds before the song collapses. With “Man of the Year,” Lorde has complemented the frank subject matter with an arrangement that's just as daring — this will be the one that bowls people over when performed live. 


Lorde began her first album by singing, “Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane”; a dozen years have passed, and she now calls New York City home, half a world away from the country where she grew up. Yet as Lorde sings to her mother over the blown-out drums and stray production effects of “Favourite Daughter,” “Everywhere I run, I'm always runnin' to ya”: she's still chasing her parent's approval all this time later, and giving her audience a more in-depth portrait of her upbringing and familial bonds.


Lorde closes out Virgin with its most vulnerable moment: she gets close to the microphone as the production falls away, and repeats, “Am I ever gonna love again?” The question follows a caustic examination of a partner who failed her, and the realization that her identity doesn't belong to another person — and yet, after all the fluttering sound effects stop circling her voice, she's still left with that six-word question. “David” works well as a closer, stripping away all artifice to show that, even in a moment of intense self-discovery, there are no easy answers for Lorde.


Lorde has talked about the desire for Virgin to convey a greater sense of physicality, and “Hammer” opens the album with an urgent, sinewy buzz, before Lorde eventually lets the propulsion of the production serve as the song's hook. In between, she expresses the freedom of feeling human with succinct clarity: “I'm ready to feel like I don't have the answers / There's peace in the madness over our heads,” she sings.


Immediately following a pair of songs about sex complexities on the Virgin track list, Lorde turns to face herself on “GRWM,” recalls of one the most joyful moments of her childhood, and wonders when she will finally feel like a grown woman. Beginning with soft keys and lilting melodies that would have sounded at home on Melodrama, “GRWM” comes into its own by its first chorus, where the warmth of Lorde's voice is juxtaposed with crushed, harshed-buzz percussion and swirling, technicolor synthesizers. 


None of Lorde's lead singles play it remotely safe — even “Royals,” the most traditional of the four, upended expectations for how hollowed-out a smash hit could sound — but “What Was That” is particularly improbable as an anthem, considering that its primary hook is a squiggly post-chorus instrumental, its beat keeps changing shape, and the first word in the chorus is “MDMA.” Within the context of Virgin, though, “What Was That” hits even harder than as a standalone single, with Lorde's post-breakup liberation setting the table for the even more revealing courses to come.


In under two minutes, Lorde presents a vivid, emotionally fraught scene of sexual ecstasy and the post-coitus uncertainty involving a pregnancy test; timelines and feelings overlap, the generations of women before Lorde exist within her blood during a pivotal moment, her voice is heavily process and she repeats, “I'm free, I'm free,” before knowing exactly what she might be. Sparse and startling, “Clearblue” is placed as a lynchpin moment on the thematic journey of Virgin — once you hear it, it's hard to imagine this project without it.


Throughout Virgin, Lorde leans toward choruses that are either comprised of very few words or none at all, allowing simple messages and their corresponding arrangements to speak for themselves. “Shapeshifter,” a searingly effective admission of using sex as a means of acceptance, is an exception — Lorde uses the hook to list the several versions of herself that have existed in relation to romantic partners — but within the verbose recollections, two phrases are repeated, “I'm not affected” and “I just wanna fall,” that slice to the heart of the song. If “Shapeshifter” lacks flash compared to other moments across Virgin, the song makes up for with maturity and world-building.


If you're half-paying attention, “Broken Glass” might sound like the most traditional pop song on Virgin, with its thumping beat, elastic synths and muted verses leading into an upper-register eruption on the chorus. Yet every inch of the song is densely packed with personal devastation, as Lorde recounts the sadness, self-loathing, addictive qualities and hopelessness associated with counting calories and obsessing over appearance. “Broken Glass” may be one of the best songs about eating disorders and body dysmorphia ever recorded, but it's also an A-plus anthem that's worthy of Lorde's upper-tier arsenal. If the entirety of Virgin represents a hard-fought reclamation, “Broken Glass” is its crowning achievement.

The New Zealand-born pop singer's first album in four years is available now.

	Patience is a virtue, a fact that fans of New Zealand-born pop phenomenon Lorde have learned time and time again throughout her career. But luckily, patience is no longer required when it comes to the singer's newest full-length project. 


	On Friday (June 27), Lorde unveiled her much-anticipated fourth studio album, Virgin. Released via Universal Music, the new album features 11 new songs, including its three previously released singles “What Was That,” “Man of the Year” and “Hammer.”

	











	In a statement released alongside the album's announcement back in April, Lorde compared Virgin to the color “clear” — and, more specifically, all the things that are clear. “LIKE BATHWATER, WINDOWS, ICE, SPIT. FULL TRANSPARENCY. THE LANGUAGE IS PLAIN AND UNSENTIMENTAL,” she explained of the record. “I WAS TRYING TO SEE MYSELF, ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A DOCUMENT THAT REFLECTED MY FEMININITY: RAW, PRIMAL, INNOCENT, ELEGANT, OPENHEARTED, SPIRITUAL, MASC.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	While the singer touted the importance of having some of the same sounds throughout the project, one thing that remains very different about Virgin is the producers the singer teamed up with; the LP boasts a series of new collaborators for the singer, including Jim-E Stack, Dan Nigro and Dev Hynes, while her Melodrama and Solar Power producer Jack Antonoff doesn't make an appearance. While Lorde called Antonoff a “positive, supportive collaborator,” she added that “I just have to trust when my intuition says to keep moving.” 


	In the lead-up to the new project, Lorde also spoke extensively about how Virgin was inspired by her recent examination of gender. The singer said that a conversation with fellow pop star Chappell Roan prompted her to think more critically about her own gender identity. “I was like, ‘I'm a woman except for the days when I'm a man,'” she said. “I know that's not a very satisfying answer, but there's a part of me that is really resistant to boxing it up.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Apple Original Films' F1 via Warner Bros. sped to $10M in total previews from this week while Universal/Blumhouse/Atomic Monster's M3GAN 2.0 drew $1.5M.


	The Joseph Kosinski-directed, Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Formula One movie starring Brad Pitt, arguably the first-of-its-kind tentpole for Apple Original Films on the big screen, bested the preview grosses of such expensive Apple movies as Ridley Scott's Napoleon ($3M), Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon ($2.6M), Matthew Vaughn's Argylle ($1.7M) and Greg Berlanti's Fly Me to the Moon ($875K). F1 also smokes the previews of another car-racing movie, the multi-Oscar-winning, solid-grossing Ford v Ferrari, which is actually a high point for the struggling motor sports genre at the box office — the best that there has been in recent times ($2.1M previews, $31.4M opening).

	











	Broken out, F1 did $7M last night from showtimes that began at 3PM and another $3M from earlier week Imax and PLF previews. Based on early results, and the way the engines have been firing for this film, a $50M+ opening appears likely. Warner Bros. chipped in 50% of the global P&A. Both Apple and Warners recoup the P&A together before the Burbank, CA lot gets a distribution fee around 8%. Production costs per the filmmaker in interviews is $200M (though I constantly get phone calls with the line “But, ya know, it cost $300M…). At the end of the day, get a grip people, F1 stands to open globally to $115M+. The Pitt movie is in great shape with Rotten Tomatoes Audience score of 97% and 84% certified fresh reviews. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







M3GAN 2.0‘s previews are less than the original movie which did $2.75M and went on to a surprise $11.7M and $30.4M. M3GAN 2.0 will be lucky to clear $20M, last night's previews from 2PM showtimes at 2,700 theaters around the level of Blumhouse's Night Swim which did $1.45M and went on to post a $11.7M opening. No audience score yet. Critics loved the first movie at 93% certified fresh, but they've had enough with the robot gimmick at 59% Rotten. No audience score yet on the sequel from the franchise architect Gerard Johnstone. At the end of the day, M3GAN 2.0 is counterprogramming in the summer. The movie cost $25M before P&A versus $12M on the first. 


	In other news, Lilo & Stitch is crossing $400M this weekend, the second movie to do so this year after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. 


	The rest of the week went down as follows:


	1.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) Thu $4M (-15% from Wednesday), Wk $57.1M (-54%), Total $180.6M/Wk 2 


	2.) 28 Years Later (Sony) Thu $1.9M (-15%), Week $40.6M/Wk 1  


	3.) Elio (Dis) 3,750 theaters Thu $2.2M (-7%), Wk $31.4M, Wk 1


	4.) Lilo & Stitch (Dis) 3,375 theaters, Thu $1.5M (+1%), Wk $16M (-39%), Total $393.1M, Wk 5 


	5.) Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (Par) 2,603 theaters, Thu $722K (-14%), Wk $10M (-37%), Total $181.8M/Wk 5

Those are terrible numbers for Megan 2.

Uh no, its ok, a brave sequel for sure but misguided. The first film is about as perfect as horror movies get, and the 3rd film is a solid 2nd best….the others aren't great if we're being honest so 2 gets the honour of 3rd best on default imo :D

For there to be a struggling motor sport genre there would have to be one to begin with. A film every few years does not a genre make. A sub genre maybe.

M3GAN fans don't want a goofy Terminator movie and M3GAN 2.0 will be remembered as this franchise's Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. 

M3GAN 3.0 will be about a killer doll again, and the events of M3GAN 2.0 will be conveniently forgotten.

Nightmare on Elm Street 2 is the best and most audacious of the entire series

I watched F1 yesterday with my family last night in IMax. It isn't a movie I would ever choose to watch, but I enjoyed it. Great cast and action packed. Well made movie. Highly recommend. First time I have ever noticed a male packed audience. Cool movie.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED, with Fox News response: California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a $787 million lawsuit against Fox News on Friday, seeking $787 million in damages and citing, among other things, host Jesse Watters' claim that he lied about a phone call the governor made with Donald Trump.


	“No more lies,” Newsom wrote on X, announcing the lawsuit.


	The damages figure is, at the very least, symbolic. That is about the same amount that the network settled Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit two years ago. The election systems company had sued for defamation over the network's amplification of false claims it rigged 2020 election results.

	











Read Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against Fox News.


			Watch on Deadline		







	In the lawsuit, Newsom's legal team wrote that the litigation “concerns Fox's willingness to protect President Trump from his own false statements by smearing his political opponent Governor Newsom in a dispute over when the two last spoke during a period of national strife.”


RELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President


	The lawsuit concerns a call that Newsom had with Trump late on June 6, the day before the president federalized the National Guard to respond to protests following ICE  raids in the Los Angeles region. Newsom opposed that move, and said that the president didn't raise the issue of the demonstrations or the National Guard in their phone call. 


	Days later, on June 10, Trump claimed to reporters that he had spoken to Newsom “a day ago” about the demonstrations in Los Angeles, the lawsuit noted. But Newsom quickly challenged that claim, writing in a post on X, “There was no call. Not even a voicemail. Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn't even know who he's talking to.”

	











	Per the lawsuit, Trump then reached out to Fox News anchor John Roberts with a screenshot of his call log, showing a 16-minute call on June 6/7. Roberts then wrote on X, “President Trump just contacted me from Air Force 1 to say this: ‘First call was not picked up. Second call, Gavin Picked up, we spoke for 16 minutes. I told him to, essentially, ‘get his ass in gear,' and stop the Riots, which were out of control. More than anything else, this shows what a liar he is — said I never called. Here is the evidence.”


RELATED: Fox News Continued To See Audience Growth In May While MSNBC And CNN Posted Double-Digit Declines Vs. 2024


	Newsom's legal team wrote that Roberts' post “did not provide the critical fact that on June 10, President Trump had stated that he had spoken to Governor Newsom ‘a day ago.' Nor did Mr. Roberts note that on June 6 — or June 7 at 1:23 am — is not ‘a day ago' when one is speaking on June 10.” Roberts then went on air and “intentionally altered how he presented President Trump's comment, stating that President Trump had said that he had called Governor Newsom ‘yesterday or the other day,'” Newsom's lawsuit stated.


	“Mr. Roberts chose to present a factually incorrect picture to Fox viewers to obscure President Trump's false statement of fact,” Newsom's legal team argued.


	On June 10, Watters played a clip of Trump's statement about the call, but removed the president saying that the call occurred “a day ago,” per the lawsuit.

	Watters told viewers,  “Newsom responded, and he said there wasn't a phone call. He said Trump never called him. Not even a voicemail, he said. But John Roberts got Trump's call logs, and it shows Trump called him late Friday night and they talked for 16 minutes. Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that?”


	As Watters spoke, the Fox News chyron read, “Gavin Lied About Trump's Call.” 


	“Recognizing that President Trump was not correct, yet wanting to curry favor with the President, Fox News willfully distorted the facts,” the lawsuit claimed. “Instead of accurately presenting President Trump's words—that he had spoken to Governor Newsom ‘a day ago' —Mr. Roberts told viewers that President Trump had said that he spoke to Governor Newsom ‘yesterday or the other day.' On his nightly program, Mr. Watters also purposefully presented a false picture of President Trump's statement.” 


RELATED: Fox And Smartmatic Seek Summary Judgments In Latest Filings In Defamation Case


	The lawsuit was filed in Delaware Superior Court, but was accompanied by a legal demand letter from Newsom's lawyers to Fox News' general counsel. They wrote that the lawsuit would be withdrawn if the network retracts the claim and issues an apology from Watters and the network.


	A Fox News said in response to the lawsuit, “Gov. Newsom's transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him. We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.”


	Newsom's legal team noted that the report has been “amplified by far-right activists on social media,” and claimed that the network “advanced this lie about Governor Newsom out of a desire to harm him politically.”


	“The issue is about more than just President Trump misremembering a day or two about routine phone calls,” according to the lawsuit. “The period of June 6 to June 10, 2025 in California was unprecedented—with the President of the United States illegally commandeering the California National Guard and deploying uniformed military onto the streets of Los Angeles over the objections of the state's governor. Every hour, every Truth Social post, and every presidential utterance mattered. History was happening in real time. It is the exact reason why reporters asked President Trump when he had last spoken to Governor Newsom. In response, he lied. And when his own ‘receipts' showed that, Fox, true to form, carried his water and sought to cover up his lies by defaming Governor Newsom.”

	











	The lawsuit claimed defamation per se, and California's unfair competition law, typically used in false advertising claims. The latter claim has similarities to Trump's lawsuit against CBS over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, claiming that they edited the interview to make her answers sound better just weeks before the election.


	While a number of legal experts have called Trump's lawsuit meritless, given First Amendment protections for newsgathering, Newsom's lawsuit appeared to be a way of using Fox News commentator's words against them.


	The lawsuit stated, “As Mr. Watters has himself said, when a news organization falsely presents an elected official's words to make them appear in a better light, it constitutes ‘an extraordinary breach of journalistic ethics…Someone has to be fired.”


	The bar for Newsom's defamation claim is high: As a public figure, he must prove that the network didn't just falsely report on the call, but did so with malice toward him.

Who is paying Newsom's attorneys, is it him personally or the State of California, if it's the state, it's another reason to RECALL him!!

You would think Gavin Newsome would be tired of losing and I would not be surprised a counter suit will be filed by Trump and/or Fox for falsely staying he never got the call.

The S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. Thank you President Trump!

LOL, he created a mess and tanked the market. You don't get to claim victory because we're back to where we started.

Trump didn't tank the economy. That was Biden. Things are the best they've been in four years.

Good!  Sue FAUX NEWS out of existence!  Nothing will change in this country until something is done with this flagrant propaganda network peddling lies.

That's CNN and MSNBC. They're killing themselves just fine.

I can also delete calls froim my ohone and say no one called me.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	After showing his penchant for non-stop violent action and general mayhem in his first two R-rated films, 2015's 96-minute Hardcore Henry and 2021's Bob Odenkirk-starring 92-minute Nobody (getting a sequel later this year), director Ilya Naishuller proves those feature film debuts were no accident. His third flick, Heads of State, which despite the attractive pairing of John Cena and Idris Elba, is simply more of the same, but tamed down enough to somehow earn a PG-13 with a bloated running time of 113 mind- numbing minutes. This one is skipping theatrical and headed straight to streaming on Amazon Prime where it likely will find an eager global audience of couch dwellers starving for a movie full of explosions, chases, and stuntmen being paid overtime. Knock yourselves out.

	The premise is rather credibility-stretching right from the start with Cena playing a recently-elected U.S. President Will Derringer with a sunny outlook and a past only as an A-list movie star known for his action films like franchise Water Cobra. Elba is the somewhat beleaguered British Prime Minister Sam Clarke, who is a serious leader underwater in the polls but still recently re-elected over a candidate supported by Derringer. As we meet them ahead of a NATO gathering in Trieste Italy it is clear they are at odds in seemingly every way, but to put a good face on international relations they agree it would be a smart idea to perhaps arrive together via a short flight in Derringer's Air Force One jet.

	However bad guys are out to get both and enact a covert plot to dissove NATO and all the good it does for the world. Thus, the plane is basically hijacked by a guy posing as a waiter, killing security, and trying to do the same to these two leaders who fight back harder than Harrison Ford ever did, but in the process, the plane starts to come apart and both Clarke and Derringer parachute out just before the whole thing explodes. Back home they are thought to be dead and Vice President Elizabeth Kirk takes the oath of office.

	











	Not so fast, because in comical fashion, Derringer is stuck hanging from a tree, and Clarke has to climb it to help him out. Now the two must somehow learn to get along as they attempt to find their way out of this mess, and soon to help them comes MI6 agent Noel Bissett (Priyanka Chopra Jonas). who as it turns out. also had a thing with Clarke when both were coming up in the forces. What they must do is get to a disguised CIA safe house called the Golden Mountain Mining Company which they manage to do after failing to hot wire a car on a farm and landing in a vehicle accompanied by a bunch of sheep. At the safe house they meet the eager and lone agent on duty, Marty Comer (Jack Quaid) who is thrilled to be able to protect these powerful men with his boatload of imposing weaponry and useful gadgets to fend off those bad guys hot on their trail, the main one being the most wanted Viktor Gradov (Paddy Considine) who is determined to get them before they get him and his henchman Arthur Hammond (Stephen Root).


	In a journey that traverses many countries all over Europe from England to France to Italy to Serbia (doubling for Belarus), it is a wild ride all the way as they try to get back to civilization and their day jobs, to a never-ending climax, as the unpenetrable Presidential automobile known as The Beast is the target of a chase throughout the winding roads of Italy where NATO is about to come apart.


	The movie does have a promising action-packed beginning set in Bunol, Spain during the annual Tomatino Festival where it appears the entire town is having the time of their lives. Literally covered in 20 tons of tomatoes, it is a sea of red in which the citizenry slimes around, and where we first meet Noel who is on to the scent of Gradov when she gets sidelined by the rotten tomatoes (a perfect metaphor for this jacked streaming attraction's likely critical future).


	Cena and Elba both met when they co-starred in Suicide Squad and hit it off so well they wanted to work together again, looking for just the right script to show off their chemistry. Unfortunately they got Heads of State instead, a wit-starved script by Josh Applebaum & Andre Nemec and Harrison Query (who came up with the concept of a mismatched odd couple of world leaders). In between the predictable and cutesy dialogue with Cena and Elba trading barbs, we find both such able actors with a flair for comedy and action tasked with trying to make any of this believable or remotely recognizably human. As the Presidents, Elba reverting back to his military training and Cena demonstrating his stuntman did all the work in his films before he became President, are thrust into one dangerous situation after another with loud and ludicrous shoot-outs at every turn. And we are meant to believe no one knows where they are?


	Naishuller never slows the relentless pace and clearly is trying to recall the buddy films of the 80's or 90's like 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, and most notably the king of the genre, Midnight Run, but those all made time for character development. Heads of State is solely interested in burning the whole thing down, doing its stars no service, and letting the explosions and gunplay take center stage in a movie where action-to-the-max is our filmmaker's mantra.


	Producers are Peter Safran and John Rickard.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Amazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment have inked a multi-year deal for Sony to distribute the former's upcoming titles After the Hunt, Mercy, Crime 101, and Project Hail Mary abroad. 


	Yes, Amazon MGM is continuing to build its own international theatrical distribution infrastructure. The new deal will fill the gap as Amazon MGM Studios' international deal with Warner Bros ends, and the shopping site-streamer-theatrical distributor looks for a chief executive to lead its new foreign distribution arm.  


	Following those theatrical releases, Amazon MGM will directly distribute its slate in territories overseas where it launches owned and operated offices, with Sony supporting the studio in other international markets.

	Luca Guadagnino's thriller After the Hunt, will world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, followed by a release in select theaters on Oct. 10 and expand on Oct. 17. The pic, written by Nora Garrett, stars Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Chloë Sevigny, in a story about a college professor (Roberts) who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star student (Edebiri) levels an accusation against one of her colleagues (Garfield), and a dark secret from her own past threatens to come into the light.




			Watch on Deadline		







Mercy, which will open in theaters on Jan. 23, comes from filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov and stars Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson, Annabelle Wallis, Kali Reis, Chris Sullivan, Kylie Rogers, Jeff Pierre, Rafi Gavron, Jamie McBride, and Kenneth Choi. Marco van Belle wrote the screenplay, which is set in the near future when capital crime has increased and follows a detective (Pratt) who is accused of a violent crime and forced to prove his innocence. Charles Roven, Robert Amidon, Timur Bekmambetov, and Majd Nassif produced the film. 


Crime 101, which will be released in theaters on Feb. 13, is directed by Bart Layton and stars Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Nolte, and Halle Berry. Based on Crime 101: A Novella by Don Winslow, Layton's screenplay finds three lives colliding in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, a master jewel thief eyes the score of a lifetime—his final job, if he plays it right. An insurance broker, disillusioned and desperate, is looking for a way out before the system grinds her down. And a relentless detective, haunted by unfinished business, is closing in. As their fates converge in the lead-up to a multimillion-dollar heist, the line between hunter and hunted blurs. One wrong move, and it won't just be diamonds on the line—it'll be their lives.

	











Project Hail Mary, will hit theaters on March 20. The movie is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and stars Ryan Gosling and Sandra Hüller. Based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name, Drew Goddard's screenplay follows science teacher Ryland Grace (Gosling) who wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone. Producers are Amy Pascal, Gosling, Lord, Miller, Rachel O'Connor, Aditya Sood and Andy Weir. 


	Yesterday it was announced that Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Gerry Cardinale's Artists Equity, which has released movies through Amazon MGM Studios, has also signed a theatrical film agreement with Sony Pictures. 


	Amazon MGM Studios presented at CinemaCon for the first time on the big stage in Caesars Palace Colosseo this past April. Some of the studio's other upcoming theatrical releases include Sarah's Oil (11-7-25), Verity (5-15-26), Masters of the Universe (6-5-26), How to Rob a Bank (9-4-26), Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie (11-13-26), The Thomas Crown Affair (3-5-27), and two untitled The Chosen feature films (3-12-27 and 3-31-28).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","New Golden Bachelor told producers he'd ""cut"" any women his own age","https://www.avclub.com/golden-bachelor-mel-owens-cut-women-over-60","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 03:26:00 GMT","

Back in April, ABC revealed that it was returning to the Golden Bachelor well, announcing a second season of its seniors-focused dating series—a huge hit for the network when it arrived back in the fall of 2023. (And then about half as much of a hit when it came back the following year as The Golden Bachelorette, although that still means the series posted numbers on par with the flagship Bachelor series.) For its second outing, The Golden Bachelor revealed it would be skewing a little younger than 72-year-old Gerry Turner, selecting 66-year-old former NFL linebacker Mel Owens for its title role. And then younger still for its contestants—at least, if Owens had his wishes, according to a podcast interview he gave earlier this month.

This is according to Deadline, one of several outlets that picked up today on an interview Owens gave back at the start of June to the MGoBlue Podcasts With Jon Jansen, in which the retired player and lawyer talked about the long and arduous process of being selected for the show. After having finally gotten the gig, producers on the series asked Owens—who, we'd like to reiterate, is 66 years old—what his “preferences” for candidates would be, and he made it clear he was looking to TV-date women between 45 and 60. (“Just being honest.”) Owens said he later doubled down on this stance in conversations with the show's executive producers, despite reassurances that all the women selected for him would be “hot.” “I”—the “I” in question being Mel Owens, a man 66 years of age—”said, ‘If they're 60 or over, I'm cutting them.'”

Owens, 66, said producers did push back against this take, reminding him, “This is not The Silver Bachelor, it's The Golden Bachelor.” (They also apparently weren't wild about him using football terminology like “cut” to describe sending his fellow sexagenarians home.) Talking in the interview, Owens went on to describe his ideal woman, saying she's a “lifetime learner” (aw!) and then about five different ways of saying she should be good-looking and in shape. (The phrase “stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs” is deployed.) So, yeah: Mel Owens, our new Golden Bachelor, saying the quiet part extremely loud. (We shouldn't judge; the man is, after all, 66.)

As two-thirds of the creators and showrunning team on HBO Max's Hacks, Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello (alongside partner Jen Statsky) have brought in a lot of positive attention for their home streamer over the years, much of it in the form of awards show hardware. (Seven trophies from the Emmys alone, plus a Peabody, multiple Golden Globes, and whole armloads of other assorted statuary.) So it's not wholly surprising to hear that the streamer would like to stay in business with the duo, with Deadline reporting today that the pair have signed a new overall deal with the streamer, as well as Warner Bros. Television. Similar to the old one, the deal will keep the pair making TV for Max (in the process of rebranding itself to a less loathed named) for the next few years.

News of the re-upped deal comes not long after Statsky, Aniello, and Downs (who also co-stars on the series) confirmed that they intend to bring the Jean Smart/Hannah Einbinder show to a close some time in the fairly near future. (They won't commit to saying the series' next season, its fifth, will be its last, but have said they have an endpoint they're now driving toward pretty firmly in mind.) Downs and Aniello (who are married) are also already working with Statsky, who's also under a deal with WBTV, on a new series starring Kaley Cuoco, titled Kansas City Star. (That one's waiting to get a greenlight from HBO.)

Besides the whole “being married” thing, Downs and Aniello have been working together professionally for more than a decade at this point, having both served as writers and executive producers on Broad City from the show's old web series days forward. The duo signed their first deal with Warner Bros. back in 2021, right as Hacks was premiering, and quickly grabbing both critical and audience attention. The series has been a success for Max even beyond filling up a whole bunch of people's mantles with shiny gewgaws: Deadline notes that the show's recently-ended fourth season grew in viewership throughout its run, culminating in a series high for its finale.

[Editor's note: The recap of episode two publishes June 28.]   

Who do you hurt when you can't hurt the person—the system, the world—that's hurt you? Who do you kill when your enemy is, by its very nature, untouchable? 

That is the question on the table as we return to Squid Game for this not especially premiere-y season-three premiere. We're picking up in the immediate aftermath of last December's “Friend Or Foe”—which, fittingly, didn't feel all that much like a true season finale, either. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has been upfront about the fact that the Netflix show's second and third seasons were initially conceived as a single unit, and that's abundantly clear as we watch the fallout of the failed attack on the Games' command center. Nothing has been meaningfully resolved: Jung-bae is still dead, the X team has now been decimated, and the only survivor who made it out of the worst parts of the fighting desperately wishes he hadn't—as the Front Man's goons drop a literally gift-wrapped Gi-hun right back down the well he spent all of Squid Game 2 climbing out of.

If there is a sharp demarcating line between these seasons, then, it's happening almost entirely in Gi-hun's head. Because our guy is, not to put too fine a point on it, broken. The revolutionary vanguard he spent the blood of innocents to muster has been smashed by betrayal from within, and overwhelming force from without, and it's left him utterly hollowed out by guilt and despair. The only thing that seems to give him any kind of focus at this point is the concept of someone near at hand to blame—specifically Dae-ho, who (the show helpfully reminds us) went back to collect ammunition for the fighters at the height of the battle, but instead abandoned them to their deaths in a fit of cowardice. From our outside, more objective view, it's easy to say that all Dae-ho could have done, had he been braver, was get himself killed along with his comrades, one more body dumped in a box and maybe chopped up for organs. (It also would have had the knock-on effect of eliminating Hyun-ju, since she only survived because she retreated to check up on his flaky ass, although Dae-ho can't really claim credit for that one.) But an outside, more objective viewpoint does not seem to currently be welcome in Gi-hun's mind. He can't kill the Front Man. The Games don't seem willing to let him kill himself. Dae-ho, maybe, will have to do.

Our other characters, meanwhile, are largely where we left them: Murderbro Nam-gyu continues to brand himself as Thanos 2.0, bullying timid Min-su over his unwillingness to protect the now dead Se-mi during the previous night's attacks. Hyun-ju is still heroic as all get out and teamed up with tough-as-nails older lady Jang Geum-ja and her more pudding-y son Park Yong-sik. Pregnant Jun-hee (now apparently on the verge of labor) tries to figure out how far she can trust her ex Myung-gi. And the O team as a whole is diving ever-deeper into its embrace of performative cruelty, sweeping the next election to keep the games going and sarcastically thanking Gi-hun for making their electoral win possible by getting so many of his supporters killed. Of course, some of them might be about to get a sharp reminder that alleged meritocracies can get very nasty very quickly when the definition of “merit” arbitrarily shifts.

Into all this extant tension, the organizers introduce our next contest: an inventively nasty take on hide and seek. The rules are fairly simple, with players sorted into (new) red and blue teams, breaking up previous alliances (much to the dismay of O team leader Im Jeong-dae, who finds himself about to become a rabbit amongst his personal flock of wolves). The blues are the hiders, equipped with keys that will open doors inside a sprawling labyrinth. Find the exit, or simply survive the game's 30-minute run time, and they move on to the next round. The reds, meanwhile, are the seekers, armed with knives. In some ways, their task is the more straightforward one: Kill a single hiding blue, and they've secured their own survival. 

There comes a time, in both of the Games we've seen, when contestants' complicity in the deaths around them get ramped up. The first season diffused that responsibility across groups first, dropping teams of players into the lethal game of tug-of-war before the direct and deadly competition of the marbles game. (This seems to get a deliberate visual callback here, with arena walls that similarly evoke childhood city streets.) In these second games, meanwhile, we're still fresh off of the bloodbath that was Mingle, where players were forced to kill passively, denying life-saving space to others. Now, though, the knives are literally out: Players on red have to kill now, or they'll die. No more illusions, no more niceties. As always with the Games, the cruelest aspect here comes down to choice. After both sides complain, at different points, that the game is rigged against them, the organizers—who love “fairness” in all things, of course— offer a compromise: Players may, with the consent of both parties, switch their team. 

What follows is the meaty psychological material that makes Squid Game a much better show than the base stuff a million memes constantly strive to boil it down into. We watch various players try to navigate their own mental barriers, and those of the people around them, deciding who's willing to kill for what. Myung-gi just barely manages to convince Jun-hee to let him protect her, trading her red shirt (and knife) for his blue. Yong-sik convinces Geum-ja to let him make the sacrifice of becoming the killer among them. Dae-ho and Jeong-dae utterly fail to get anyone to switch with them. And Gi-hun? Gi-hun takes his red ball (and knife) and barely blinks. He's already been confronted with the strung-up bodies of all the people he got killed with his attack on the forces of the great and powerful. What's one more murder after that?

Divorced of its role as a season premiere, this is a prime slice of Squid Games good stuff: Powerful emotions, complicated gamesmanship, great performances from all involved. (Even the boat crew, still floating around in search of the island the Games are on, gets a chance to do something dramatic, as Jun-ho and Choi have a falling out over whether to trust the secretly traitorous Captain Park.) The cast of the second games is well-enough developed at this point that even basically zombifying Gi-hun doesn't really hurt the episode—he'll either go off the deep end and embrace killing, or heroically bounce back, of course, but I'm just as invested in the other stories being told. (One of Squid Games 2/3‘s big selling points over the first outing, I'd argue, is that it's built up a wider cast of characters into people worth caring about.) This isn't a great introduction back into the show's world—thank god it's only been six months, or I'd be totally out to see—but on the binge it won't really have to be. What it does have is a return to the tensions that make this show so wonderfully uncomfortable, a looming game designed specifically to exacerbate them—and a proven, and unflinching, willingness to twist the knife.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Duster expertly weaves everything together in its penultimate episode","https://www.avclub.com/duster-recap-season-1-episode-7","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

It's easy to complain about how short TV seasons have become these days, but this debut season of Duster proves that if you use your time wisely, you can pack a whole lot into just eight episodes. This penultimate hour touches on just about every ongoing storyline and features pretty much every named ensemble member (plus Howard Hughes!). And yet none of it feels rushed or hard to follow because the show has built out its world so slowly and methodically across its various weekly romps. When I took this assignment, I thought I'd just be writing about fun episodic 1970s adventures. Instead, creators J.J. Abrams and LaToya Morgan have served up a real masterclass on how to structure a complex season of TV.  

Case in point: It turns out the clue to the mysterious million-dollar purchase Saxton made last week has been hiding in plain sight this whole time. In fact, I even started my “This week in ‘It's the 1970s!'” runner after the premiere featured Jim flipping past a news report about Watergate on the radio. And I'm pretty sure nearly every episode since has featured some sort of reference to the break-in, which would've happened less than a month ago in the show's timeline. Only it turns out that wasn't just random world-building—it's been a tease of what's to come. Saxton's purchase is (seemingly) the famed “smoking gun” tape that will eventually cause Richard Nixon to resign the presidency in 1974. 

That reveal offers a different kind of thrill than the action sequences that have become Duster's bread and butter. Though Nina gets a few hotshot moments this week, this hour is lighter on spectacle than most of the season has been so far. But that's because it's delivering a different kind of high-octane storytelling. The excitement here comes from watching all of the season's various through-lines suddenly fall into place like dominoes. And, for me at least, that's as exhilarating as any car chase. 

The other upside of the lack of action is that there's more room for character work. And this episode proves how much just a few minutes of screen time can make a big impact on fleshing out these folks. After it felt like Nina kind of lucked into Royce's protection last week, here we see her actively (but tastefully) nurturing his crush to get all the intel she can on the Russian deal and where Snowbird's million dollars came from after Jim lost Howard Hughes' Aeromobile. 

I also love that this episode takes the time to give Nina and Genesis a meaningful moment together. Like the brief scene where cleaning lady Kelly warns Nina that Agent Chad Grant has been snooping through her desk, it's a welcome look at the solidarity Black women can find with each other in predominantly male environments. While you could imagine a different version of this show putting Genesis and Nina in immediate conflict with one another, Duster makes the far more interesting choice to have the two women bond over a desire to step out of their fathers' shadows.  

In fact, this is an overall strong episode for Duster's supporting female cast. Charlotte, of all people, gets to prove she's an absolute badass as she casually helps sell Wade's cover story about how he knows a Russian translator. (Nina Saint James helped him buy a fur coat for his Doctor Zhivago role play, of course!) Meanwhile, Izzy refuses to accept Bob Temple's bribes. He assumes she'll end the protest the second she gets some personal gains. But even after learning that Saxton himself might be coming after her, Izzy sticks with her solidarity with her fellow female truckers. Whatever is going on with her medical mystery, it's clearly causing her to take bigger risks in her life. 

Then there's Luna, who gets her most extended screen time yet as she stows away in Jim's car to join his road trip to Las Vegas with Saxton. She really emerges as the perfect midpoint of her parents here. The fact that she sets fire to her bully's comics, crashes the Vegas trip, and loves the Steve McQueen classic Bullitt are pure Jim. But the way she refuses to stop advocating for the female drivers, even as Saxton tries to change her mind, is all Izzy. Duster leans into its more wholesome side as Luna gets Saxton to change his mind about the protest. And the fact that the solution comes back to those Bob Temple blackmail photos from the premiere is another great example of Duster weaving all its story threads together as the season draws to a close.  

Now, I do have to quibble with the idea that Saxton didn't know about Jim's connection with Izzy and Luna. Given how deeply the Ellis family are enmeshed with him, both personally and professionally, that seems highly unlikely—especially when the series opened with Jim taking Luna on a job with him. Similarly, I have some pretty big questions about how Nina is planning to just casually return to FBI life in the same city where the Saxtons live. She literally ran into Saxton at a diner on, like, her second day on the job. What's to stop that from happening again? 

But I'm (mostly) willing to hand-wave those concerns away based on the strength of the rest of the episode. With Jim and Saxton on their way to Vegas, Nina gets to reteam with Awan again this week, and I couldn't be more thrilled. There were about two seconds where I briefly wondered if he was going to be revealed as a bad guy, which really would've thrown me for a loop. Thankfully, his nerdy love of “fox hunting” HAM radio transmitter signals seems entirely pure. 

As with a lot of Nina and Awan's missions, this one doesn't really get them that much more intel than they already had, as Saxton's money middle man/Agent Breen's drugger Cyrus Baker winds up blowing himself up with a grenade after warning Nina that Xavier knows about her. But it does ensure we get at least some action moments this week. In fact, Nina's ability to outdrive Agent Chad (who's tracking her on Cowboy's orders) is one of my favorite car chase sequences of the whole season. No wonder she and Jim are such kindred spirits. 

Still, this episode's real meat is in Vegas, where Saxton, Jim, and Luna follow the proper handwashing “protocol” to meet with Howard Hughes (Tom Nelis), who at this point is a 67-year-old recluse living in the penthouse of the Desert Inn hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, which he moved into in 1966 and then bought in 1967 so he didn't have to leave. In fact, this episode pulls in a lot of details from Hughes' actual life, including not only his obsession with cleanliness but also his refusal to cut his hair and his love of Baskin-Robbins' discontinued banana-nut ice cream. The story about the CIA using him to recover the Soviet submarine K-129 is true. And—as I just discovered while writing this recap—he really did have a strange connection to the Watergate scandal too. 

During Nixon's first term, Hughes reportedly gave bribes to the president for favorable treatment for his airlines and casinos. And some people have theorized that the reason the Watergate break-in happened is because Nixon was paranoid that the Democrats knew about those bribes and were planning to use them against him in his 1972 re-election campaign. (DNC chairman Larry O'Brien also had some ties to Hughes.) Now Duster imagines that Hughes had an even bigger behind-the-scenes role in the scandal than anyone knew. 

As with the Elvis stuff in “Suspicious Minds,” that feels like just the right level of kooky real-life history to weave into Duster's heightened world. I hadn't been thinking of Duster as a particularly political show. But, of course, we know that in real life it was FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt who eventually helped break the Watergate story wide open as informant Deep Throat. (His first meeting with Bob Woodward took place in October 1972.) Given this show's major FBI through-line, maybe the connection should've been obvious. 

Whatever the case, this episode ends with a few different cliffhangers for next week's finale. Hughes tells Jim it was actually the CIA who had Joey killed, something Jim is unsure whether or not to believe. And working on a tip from a newly recovered Sergeant Groomes, Billy pieces together the fact that Nina really is a fed. Ironically, however, his decision to kidnap her saves her from being shot by Agent Chad, who was sent to off her on Cowboy's orders.

Indeed, Cowboy is a big question mark for next week's finale. We know from “Ravishing Light And Glory” that he's part of the group that stole the “smoking gun” tape from the Oval Office in the first place. We now learn that they sold it to the Russians, who decided to pit it on the black market for a profit. Saxton and Hughes bought it as part of a yet-to-be-revealed scheme. Only now it's in the hands of Greek Sal's men, who steal it from Hughes' lackeys. And the as-yet-unseen Xavier may or may not be playing both sides of this thing in a sort of Senator Palpatine-esque way. That's a lot to unravel in just one episode. But after a strong first season, I have faith that Duster can stick the landing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Read This: Tyler Perry assault lawsuit reopens conversation on labor practices","https://www.avclub.com/tyler-perry-labor-practices-read-this","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 16:18:05 GMT","

Tyler Perry was recently accused of sexual misconduct by an actor on one of his films. But as a new piece from The Hollywood Reporter points out, some of Derek Dixon's claims—like the fact that he didn't report the accusation because Perry's studio supposedly doesn't have an HR department—echo criticisms of Perry that have been floating around for a while. THR explores the workplace Perry has cultivated, from multiple copyright infringement claims to repeated clashes with unions (for instance, he's still on Equity's Do Not Work list after casting only non-union actors in his 2018 stage play Madea On The Run). 

That Perry likes to shoot his projects quick and cheap (and potentially cuts corners to do so) is no great secret. His latest release, the Taraji P. Henson vehicle Straw, was reportedly shot in just four days (A Fall From Grace was shot in five). A “seasoned crew member” who has worked on TPS productions told the outlet, “On a feature with Tyler you'd shoot eight pages a day—four times what you'd normally shoot. Then on a [TV] show, it would be 25 pages.” Another insider described the pace as “insane,” recalling shooting days THR calls “long and punishing even by industry standards.” Entertainment labor scholar Kate Fortmueller (a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, where Tyler Perry Studios is based) said that Perry's productions are known locally as “a closed universe. It's not likely going to be an entrée to working on a Marvel show. You don't bounce from there to Stranger Things—or the reverse. Those are different worlds.”

The universe is only likely to get smaller, as Perry has stated an interest in technology like generative AI that would help him eliminate even more production costs. He's already begun using AI to save him “hours” of time in the makeup chair (and presumably, paying a makeup artist), and even paused an $800 million expansion of his studio in the hopes that AI tools will make the need for those practical spaces irrelevant. Tyler Perry is beloved by actors like Henson for recognizing their worth financially, counter to their treatment from the wider (overwhelmingly white) Hollywood ecosystem. Yet he's seemingly able to accomplish this by eschewing collaborations with other writers and running production below typical industry standards. Whether his powerful supporters stand by him amid the sexual harassment suit (the allegations in which Perry has denied) remains to be seen. You can read THR‘s full report here.

Sami Sheen is the oldest daughter of Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen (she was born on March 9, 2004), and she recently opened up about her health and why she feels her breast implants are impacting it. She got her implants in 2023, and for almost two years, she has been struggling with the “weirdest symptoms.”

A post shared by ✩ sami sheen ✩ (@samisheen)

Sami is active on social media and has over 200,000 fans on Instagram. She used the Instagram Story option to share an update with fans on June 23. “I've been experiencing health issues for nearly 2 years now with the weirdest symptoms and finally discovered that I have breast implant illness,” she wrote, People reports.

Sami also asked her fans for suggestions on surgeons based in Los Angeles who could offer her advice on how to remove the implants. “Idk how I haven't figured this out sooner but i'm so glad to finally have an answer. I'm hoping to get them removed ASAP so I can start feeling better. Pls lmk if you know of any good explant surgeons near LA.”

Although Sami has decided to remove her implants to benefit her health, she also expressed hesitation, noting that the change in her appearance could have a toll on her physical and mental health. “It's definitely going to be hard going back to this size, not only physically but mentally,” she wrote. “I don't want to at all but I know i'll feel so much better once they are out, so I guess it's worth it.”

A post shared by ✩ sami sheen ✩ (@samisheen)

In an interview with Us Weekly on June 25, Sami discussed the symptoms she had been experiencing in more detail. “I was just having the worst stomach issues, and that's when I started getting different allergies to different things like certain foods or drinks,” she told Us Weekly. “I was like, ‘What is going on?' Then, over the years, I've just gotten so exhausted every day.”

But why does she feel her implants are responsible for her health problems? Sami told the outlet that she believes this is because her body is rejecting the implants. “It just kind of got to a point where I was like, ‘OK, I'm so tired of feeling like this. I want an answer,” Sheen shared. “It literally just hit me where I was like, ‘OK, it's my implants.'”

Swifties are a loyal and passionate bunch, and Mario Lopez may be among them!

Lopez got his fans' attention on Thursday, June 26, when he posted a throwback photo of himself and Taylor Swift on Instagram. The image appears to be from when the “Shake It Off” singer appeared on “The X Factor” in 2012, and Lopez's expression and the accompanying caption suggest that he is a big fan of Swift.

A post shared by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez)

The photo on Instagram shows Lopez smiling while looking at Swift, but it was his caption that had fans reacting. “I was looking at ⁦@TaylorSwift like I look at tacos… Luckily she's always a sweetheart & good sport 🙂 #TBT #TaylorSwift,” he wrote. Fans have reacted to the post, highlighting the host's humor.

“Mario what is this caption?” a fan questioned. “Way too funny,” another person wrote. Other reactions include, “I think you wanted to borrow her hat,” “Truly absolute legends,” and “Let me call Kelce real quick.” The last comment is about Swift's boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce.

A post shared by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez)

Fans of Lopez and Swift will know this is not the first time he has posted a photo of her on social media. On July 28, 2022, he posted another throwback photo of himself and Swift. It appears to have been taken at the same time as the image in his latest post, and they are both onstage, wearing the same outfits. This time, Lopez is speaking into a microphone and Swift is looking at him. “Whatever I was sayin', she wasn't amused… #TBT #TaylorSwift,” he joked in the caption.

Lopez has made no secret of his admiration for Swift, and he has previously praised her personality and success. “Taylor is incredibly smart, talented, and a sweetheart of a person. I've gotten to interview her a bunch of times. She's like our Princess Diana out here in America,” he told Women's Wear Daily in 2023.

Lopez has also commented on Swift and her relationship with Harry Styles. The former couple were first linked in March 2012 and broke up in January 2013. In 2012, Lopez said on his radio show “104.3 MyFM” that he had seen Swift and Styles together at her “The X Factor” rehearsal, USA Today reports.

“Taylor Swift was the special guest performer, and a little inside scoop for you: During rehearsals, Harry from One Direction came and slapped me on the back and said, ‘Hey, Mario, how ya doing?'” Lopez recalled. “And I said, ‘What are you doing here?' And he sort of [pointed] toward Taylor.” Lopez then confirmed that they left the rehearsal “hand in hand.”

David Hasselhoff was married to Pamela Bach-Hasselhoff from 1989 until 2006. During their relationship, the pair had two daughters, Hayley and Taylor Ann. In a powerful and emotional essay, Hayley has opened up about her grief following her mother's death.

A post shared by Project Healthy Minds (@projecthealthyminds)

Pamela died by suicide in March. She was found dead at her Los Angeles home on March 5, People reports. She was 62. Now, just three months later, in a poignant essay for Project Healthy Minds, Hayley examined her feelings surrounding her mother's death. Her story will also create awareness for mental health.

“I know my story is one of many. And with that in mind, we wanted to create a support guide to help the loved ones of the lost find comfort in knowing where to turn for support,” Hayley shared. “We are here to take your hand, to walk alongside you, and to help you understand that you are NOT alone in this.”

Hayley listed ten things she wanted to share, the first being “It's OK to be dot-less.” She explained that after an unexpected loss, like what her family experienced with the death of her mother, people try to “connect a dot.” This is something she believes you do not need to do. “We need to go straight to a place of love, acceptance, truth, light — you go straight there because in any other passing you would go straight there,” she wrote.‍She continued, “We never tried to connect the dots and encouraged others to do the same. We went straight to a place of loving our mother in all forms and celebrating the legacy she led with. Let's change your mindset for a second. Be there for them right now. Today's the first day you can be there for them, that means protecting their legacy. That means not giving them any resentment. That means not putting any sort of feeling or emotion onto how [long] they chose their time to be.”

Also on the list is “Guilt and shame are normal — but they don't have to be your reality,” “Vocabulary and word choice have never been more important,” and “The initial period of grief might feel different than an expected death.”

Point number five, titled “Vulnerability and nostalgia can provide a beautiful source of comfort,” was a way for Hayley to share the importance of being able to speak about grief and loss openly. “I feel like when you speak on your lost one, it actually feels more comforting because you feel like you're celebrating them still and they're still present and they're still around,” she shared.

Hayley highlighted other lessons, including “Know that certain details of how your loved one passed are public,” “Try your best to keep a routine,” “Grief looks different on everyone,” and “The love you hold for them is infinite — even in their absence.” However, she also emphasized the importance of seeking small wins in everyday life and focusing on them.

In the point titled, “Find your daily win,” Hayley wrote, “The win can be the smallest thing. Just find your win … There was the instant need to be present in every moment and to never take a moment for granted.” She continued, “No win is ever too small. And it was something that kept us really on the straight and focused the first couple of weeks because we were in such a place of confusion and shock.”

Not all celebrity homes are sprawling mega-mansions – sometimes the most impressive properties are the ones that prove less can be more.

Brad Pitt‘s Los Feliz residence, known as “The Steel House,” recently made headlines when burglars targeted the $5.5 million property Wednesday evening. The break-in occurred at 10:30 p.m. when three suspects scaled a fence and broke through a front window. The beautiful home they chose to target is far more than just another celebrity abode.

The distinctive midcentury modern residence that Pitt purchased in April 2023 from oil heiress Aileen Getty represents a major downsizing from his previous estate, trading a sprawling compound for a more compact architectural showcase.

A post shared by Top Closings (@topclosings)

Built in 1960 by well-known architect Neil M. Johnson, “The Steel House” earned its nickname from the striking steel-and-glass exterior that defines its look. The property showcases the famous Case Study program, which influenced mid-century modern design across Southern California, according to The Real Deal.

The L-shaped estate boasts just over 2,000 square feet of living space, featuring three bedrooms and two bathrooms. However, its smaller size doesn't mean it lacks impressive design features. Terrazzo floors, extended eaves, and wooden-beam ceilings showcase the mid-century style throughout the home, while walls of glass in each room provide panoramic views of Los Angeles below.

The home spans 2,092 square feet on a .29-acre lot with three bedrooms and 1.75 bathrooms, according to Robb Report. The L-shaped design wraps around the backyard pool and patio, with glass walls throughout allowing views of these outdoor features from inside the house.

The property underwent a complete makeover by designer Mark Haddawy, who was hired by the previous owner, James Valentine of Maroon 5, after he purchased it in 2007. The renovation yielded a bright, airy space with extensive glass walls and a soft blue color scheme in the kitchen and master bathroom.

Custom details throughout the home include cabinets painted in light blue tones and eye-catching cobalt blue carpeting in all three bedrooms. A vintage white mid-century modern open fireplace serves as the main feature in the living area, while sliding doors seamlessly connect indoor and outdoor spaces.

The Steel House's outdoor areas rival those of many larger estates in terms of quality and functionality. The property wraps around a large swimming pool surrounded by lush tropical plants, creating a private retreat that's visible from most interior rooms due to the home's glass-heavy design.

Current features include solar panels, a built-in sauna, and a redwood hot tub that appears crafted from an old barrel, according to Realtor. The backyard garden offers a peaceful setting, complete with a pool, patio, and a cold plunge tub.

A post shared by Worldwide Listings 🌏 (@worldwidelistings)

Pitt's purchase of The Steel House was part of an interesting real estate swap with Getty, who, at the same time, bought his previous Los Feliz compound for $33 million. The exchange allowed the actor to stay in the neighborhood where he lived for decades while significantly reducing his Los Angeles property size.

His former property was a sprawling two-acre estate with much more space and amenities, including an ice skating rink, skate park, ballroom, home cinema, and multiple swimming pools. The historic compound, originally built by an oil baron in 1910, had served as the family home where Pitt lived with his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie, and their six children.

The timing worked out well financially, as the deal closed just four days before Los Angeles implemented its new mansion tax, saving Pitt more than $1.8 million in additional fees, The Real Deal reported.

A terrace offers great views through the tropical landscaping to the city lights below, while the property's position on a hill in the popular Los Feliz neighborhood gives both privacy and views. The outdoor spaces show how mid-century design principles can create seamless indoor-outdoor living even on a relatively small lot.

While The Steel House serves as one of Pitt's Los Angeles homes, his main residence is now a $40 million castle-like mansion in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The contrast between the glass-and-steel modern style of his Los Feliz property and the stone castle-like appearance of his Carmel home showcases Pitt's love for diverse architectural styles.

Selena Gomez just turned heads with a bold new hairstyle that instantly grabbed the internet's attention. The “Only Murders in the Building” actress posted a selfie on Instagram on June 23, unveiling a shaggy, retro-inspired cut complete with tousled layers and uneven fringe. In the caption, Gomez joked, “I would, but I'd regret it, then get it redone so I simply won't #bangs,” playfully hinting at the look being temporary.

The dramatic style, created by celebrity hairstylist Orlando Pita, is actually a wig—but that didn't stop fans from loving it. One fan commented “Looking Flawless”. Makeup artist Hung Vanngo also shared the transformation on social media, showcasing the '70s aesthetic that instantly gave Gomez a more edgy, carefree vibe. The layered cut and curtain bangs sparked speculation about a potential role in a rumored Linda Ronstadt biopic, though nothing has been confirmed.Known for her signature sleek bob in recent months, Gomez's switch to a messy, voluminous shag marked a noticeable departure from her polished “clean-girl” look. According to WWD, the look was confirmed to be a wig, allowing Gomez to experiment with style while keeping her real hair intact.

i plucked my eyebrows 

The beauty connoisseur that Selena Gomez is, it's no surprise she enjoys experimenting with not only her own look, but also her fiancé's. In March, Benny Blanco revealed his own subtle glow-up, thanks to some help from Gomez.

In a TikTok posted on March 22, the music producer showed off a professional brow grooming session, with Gomez watching closely. “Do it light, because I love him,” she told the technician during the video. Blanco admitted he “couldn't tell the difference” post-tweezing, but the internet did. Fans applauded the transformation, with many encouraging him to take it further with a haircut.

Blanco, known for his candid humor, once joked in a podcast interview that he believed his appearance was “so grotesque” that it somehow flipped into being “hot.” The TikTok glow-up seems to be another fun chapter in their relationship—one where Gomez's beauty expertise keeps shining.

As Selena Gomez continues to experiment with looks, her beauty brand Rare Beauty remains at the forefront of authentic, inclusive beauty. Launched in 2020, Rare Beauty has become a standout in the crowded celebrity beauty space—championed for its mental health mission, diverse product range, and community-first strategy. According to reports, the company donates 1% of all sales to the Rare Impact Fund, which has raised over $20 million for youth mental health support.

Rare Beauty's viral blush line helped spark the 2022 blush boom, and it now accounts for over 26% of all blush sales at Sephora, reportedly. With consistent hits across complexion, brow, lip, and body care, the brand surpassed $540 million in annual net sales by 2024 and reached a $2.7 billion valuation.

Gomez continues to experiment with her style while Rare Beauty expands its presence in the beauty industry.

Things have never been the same for Jamal Roberts since winning “American Idol” Season 23. The Meridian native has been busy performing on some of the biggest stages in the music industry and keeping up with a packed schedule.

He's been hard at work in the studio recording new music and is gearing up for his first-ever U.S. tour, a major milestone in his career.

Amid the whirlwind of success and his responsibilities as a father off-camera, Roberts is opening up about his mental health, offering a candid glimpse into the challenges behind the spotlight.

On Wednesday, June 25, Roberts took to his Instagram Stories to check in with fans. The “American Idol” champ got real about how he's been feeling mentally, hinting at the weight of navigating success and the pressure that comes with it.

Check in: How are you feeling mentally? I'll start it off. Sometimes it gets overwhelming. No judgment, just love.

Roberts even added the hashtag “#nojudgementjustlove,” seemingly encouraging his followers to open up too.

Those who follow Roberts' journey know he has been very busy since his “American Idol” victory. The “Heal” singer previously performed at the 2025 BET Awards, performing in a special tribute to Kirk Franklin, who was honored with the Ultimate Icon Award.

Roberts also landed his first-ever U.S. tour, joining R&B legends Monica and Brandy on the “Boy Is Mine” tour, according to Variety. The 24-city arena tour is set to run from October 16 through December 7, 2025.

With such a hectic schedule, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, but luckily, Roberts has the support of his family and fans to lean on.

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

Roberts' admission about feeling overwhelmed sparked a wave of reactions online, with many fans expressing support.

One concerned fan commented, “I wonder about you daily. I think about all the transitions you must be going through with your career while staying focused on your children. I'll pray for you!”

Another wrote, “Take deep breaths. Don't try to please everyone and take care of yourself first so that you can be at your best for others. Auntie is a therapist so she understands life can get overwhelming but you have to do what's best for you no matter if feelings get hurt.”

A fan also noted, “I'll agree, when life shifts, it can be overwhelming but knowing that GOD is on your side makes up all the difference. Keep trusting, leaning and depending on HIM.”

Roberts also used the moment to connect with his supporters, offering words of encouragement to anyone going through a similar experience.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","'Heads of State' Review: John Cena & Idris Elba Take Political Action","https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/heads-of-state-review-john-cena-idris-elba-prime-video-1235135586/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Torn between action and comedy, irony and sentiment, and rah-rah jingoism and genuine self-reflection, “Heads of State” is a surprisingly entertaining romp. From a distance, the star-studded Prime Video romp feels like a fake movie-within-a-movie — which is ironic, given how many of these it features in it running time — but the stylings of “Hardcore Henry” and “Nobody” director Ilya Naishuller help rescue it from the algorithmic abyss of films like “Red Notice,” which feel more like star-driven pyramid schemes than works of popcorn cinema.

 










Written by Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec, and Harrison Query (from a story by the latter), it follows the rocky special relationship between charismatic Hollywood action star-turned U.S. President Will Derringer (John Cena) and embittered U.K. Prime Minister Sam Clarke (Idris Elba) amid a plot to kill them aboard Air Force One and destabilize NATO in the aftermath. Oh, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas is there too, somewhat, as MI6 agent Noel Bisset, who disappears for much of the running time, but re-emerges in spectacular fashion.

It would be tough for a film so entrenched in politics to avoid political entanglements in service of mindless action. However, it's hard not to wonder if it should have at least tried to take that route, given how frequently it trips over itself while attempting vague, sermonizing points about international cooperation. At the core of “Heads of State,” whose POTUS is a literal movie star, lies the idea that turn-your-brain-off entertainment is a more desirable solution to daily woes than paying attention to diplomacy, despite the PM's best efforts. Elba's gruff, straight-to-the-point former soldier is presented as the more realistic alternative to Cena's inexperienced, nice-guy celebrity politician — the Trumpian quality of his ascent notwithstanding. But at the end of the day, in Naishuller's cinematic reality, gun fights and explosions are mightier than the pen, and stunts supersede the screenplay.

It plays, at times, like two very different movies in direct conflict. The opening prologue, which sees Bisset fumble a joint CIA-MI6 mission to capture Russian arms dealer Viktor Gradov (Paddy Considine) before he can steal a spy satellite, swerves between banal, barely-functional character comedy, and fluid action with sparks of mischief. This sets the stage for what's to come, since anytime “The Suicide Squad” co-stars Elba and Cena share the screen, the movie strains to find its comedic rhythms, until it shifts back into its video game-inspired action mode.

 










Cena, despite his attempts at wackadoo eccentricity, seldom has enough energy to create meaningful contrast with Elba's straight man (in fact, Elba is often the funnier and sharper of the two), and most dialogue scenes end up flat and repetitive. However, the moment any action whatsoever unfolds, “Heads of State” explodes in raucous fashion. It has an inverse-Marvel problem, wherein more straightforward scenes feel pre-designed by committee, but the fireworks come courtesy of someone with a genuine cinematic eye, resulting in inventive, Rube Goldberg-ian action sequences that recall the slick setups and payoffs of films by Jackie Chan (only these are set during speeding highway pursuits and along deadly staircases).

In fact, these set pieces are where the movie's comedy finally blooms. Chopra Jonas (and her stunt double, upon whose face hers has been jankily grafted) imbue Bisset with a hardened physical presence, as she lunges at henchmen with furious punches and kicks. Derringer, who's only used to prop guns, becomes an amusing walking metaphor for impotence disguised by nationalistic fervor. And Clarke, although hilariously rusty at first given his time away from battle, eventually settles into the role of a comedic Punisher of sorts.

Apart from Gradov — who's given the movie's only real hint of pathos — the actual character dynamics are flimsy. Bisset and Clarke have disposable personal history that takes up far too much breathing room, and several supporting players are too underdeveloped to fulfil their intended plot functions of either personal sacrifice or red herring. However, when it comes time for action spectacle, “Heads of State” is gleefully deranged (thanks in large part to Ben Davis's cartoonishly zippy wide-angle photography). Take, for instance, Jack Quaid, who has only a single scene as Hawaiian shirt-wearing CIA station chief Marty Comer, but who makes a monumental impact by speedrunning through a safehouse shootout while surveilling Gradov's rogue forces with the help of an enormous CRT monitor cradled in his arms.

 










Of course, as with any Hollywood film of its ilk, “Heads of State” has a bizarre and blinkered view of the world, through a distinctly American lens. There are unsavory things that Western nations do which draw the ire of their enemies in the film — some of these have unfortunate relevance in light of recent events — but these ugly truths are often brushed aside as soon as they're brought up, in favor of the equally ugly (but no less truthful) notion that kick-ass Hollywood action is more alluring to the average person than a statement on geopolitics. At a time when the United States is flexing its might both at home and abroad, “Heads of State” is met with the Herculean challenge of distracting audiences, while constantly gesturing towards the very same material realities that might need escaping to begin with.

In 2025, not everyone is going to be able to switch off the part of their brain or conscience that keeps them glued to the news, especially since the film is being sent straight to streaming, where viewers are more likely to watch it while scrolling the web. And while this poses the question of who the movie is actually for — you might think it's a conservative, isolationist, “America First” fantasy, but it goes to great lengths to refute this— the mixed messaging of its idealistic, kumbaya dialogue and its vicious, ultra-patriotic action imagery is part of its sardonic charm. When it works, “Heads of State” is a hoot.

 










“Heads of State” will be available to stream on Prime Video starting Wednesday, July 2.

Audiences will likely be surprised by two things when they see Joseph Kosinski‘s “F1.” One, that a huge percentage of the film's drama and actual running time, especially compared to the standard Hollywood sports movie, takes place on the race track. Two, that the racing footage is incredibly realistic.

As has been widely reported and publicized, the Apple-backed film produced by legendary driver Lewis Hamilton (for non-racing fans, this is the equivalent of LeBron James producing a basketball movie featuring actual NBA players and teams), did strike a partnership with Formula One to shoot during its biggest races, including some time with the film's stars, Brad Pitt and Damson Idris (who spent months of preproduction learning how to drive a 200 mph race car), behind the wheel.

And while all that is true, and a key aspect of how the film was made, it does not quite explain how our heroes' fictional APXGP, or Apex, race team was integrated into the 2023 and 2024 Formula One seasons. 

 










What follows? A breakdown of what you need to know about how “F1” was actually made.

And if you want to listen to director Joseph Kosinski discuss the making of “F1,” the full conversation is below, or subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever podcasts are found.

Once the “F1” creative team, led by Kosinski, Pitt, Hamiliton, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer convinced the racing league they were trying to realistically capture the speed and behind-the-scenes work of Formula One, the sports league approached the film as a true partnership, opening the doors to a multi-faceted collaboration to create a film they believed would promote the sport.

Tim Bampton, who worked for three decades in professional sports, was hired as an executive producer to oversee and lead the integration of the film and racing. The access was truly unprecedented, with the enormous Apex team traveling from city to city, building their garage, and getting ready for the next week's race alongside the other racing teams. 

This allowed “F1” to stage its movie against the electric atmosphere of the world's fastest cars roaring past crowds of 300,000-plus on legendary courses that uniquely weave through iconic locales like Las Vegas and Budapest. It's production value that even a $200-plus million film like “F1” can't afford, and that visual effects can't replicate.

 










“F1” features nine actual races, and racing fans will recognize memorable moments, like Checho's turn one collision in Mexico, or Ocon and Gasly colliding on the first corner in Hungary, that were integrated into the film. Kosinski promised drivers his fictional film would preserve each (with one notable exception) of the real races' leaderboards, which wasn't a sacrifice for a story about an underdog team at the bottom of the standings, fighting for its very survival.

The original plan was to shoot the entire movie during the 2023 race season, but the actors' strike hit right as production had started. The SAG work stoppage meant Kosinski's team would shoot 38 days of racing during the 2023 season, then return for the 2024 season to shoot with the actors. While at the time, the strike was a devastating blow to the already expensive production, Kosinski told IndieWire the film benefited from the split season approach, allowing them to edit in between seasons and return to the famous tracks in 2024, knowing how, where, and what exactly was needed to finish the film.

Bampton established one guiding rule for the production: It could never interfere with the integrity of the sporting competition. This meant the “F1” team needed to be to take advantage of every five to 15-minute pause in the action. Actors and crew needed to be prepared to quickly do a shot in one take.

 










“It's like doing a live show. Brad and Damson would be in the cars, tires warm, engines warm, at the gates ready to come out. As soon as the practice or qualifying session ended, they'd pull out onto the track and shoot their sequences,” said Kosinski. The director also pointed to an important dramatic scene that takes place at the grid (where race cars are positioned before the race begins) right before the start of a race, that they had one eight-minute window to shoot. “It meant rehearsing with the camera crew with a stopwatch for weeks beforehand, knowing where everyone needed to stand, so that the actors step right into our coverage. It was a completely different style of filmmaking.”

One of the keys to the success of Kosinski's “Top Gun: Maverick” was putting the audience in the actual cockpit to experience the speed and force of an FA-18 plane. The goal for “F1” was similar, but a key difference being a plane flying Mach 1.6 is unphased by the weight of 50 pounds of camera equipment (the trick there was how to securely attach it), but that is not the case for the formula race cars in which every add pound and adjustment to its aerodynamics really matters.

Kosinski would need a multi-camera system that could get multiple angles, and that was extremely small and lightweight, and he could move (pan and tilt to reframe compositions). To achieve this, cinematographer Claudio Miranda collaborated with Sony to create a new piece of camera technology now known as “Carmen,” which, according to Kosinski, is essentially a “sensor on a stick.”

 










Fifteen Sony Carmen camera sticks were placed in different positions around the Apex cars to capture Pitt and Idris driving. The camera bodies, batteries, and RF equipment (to send out the radio signal with video village) were then built into the floor of the car itself.

One camera angle racecar fans will be familiar with from television is the onboard camera pods, which are placed behind the driver's helmet, facing out the windshield. The 720P quality broadcast footage, which has a slightly hidden camera-like feel on TV, is not of a quality “F1” could use on the big screen, but the filmmaking team worked with Apple to use the iPhone camera sensor, chip, and iOS software to build a camera that was similar in size to the onboard camera pod. 

And then — and this is huge — Formula One actually let the filmmakers put the new Apple camera inside two to three of the real race cars (not just the fictional Apex cars) during the races.

Kosinski could count on having between 30 to 35 camera angles of the race itself. Approximately 16 of those came from the production's cinema cameras, but utilizing TV broadcast cameras presented challenges. Like many sports, they Formula One races are shoot at a high frame rate with fast shutter speed to avoid motion blur (which is twice as important for Formula One, which needs to keep all the various sponsors' logos visible).  There is hyper reality and clarity to the image that is not particularly cinematic, to say nothing of how it gets compressed so it can be beamed in real-time across the globe.

 










“I got them to change their shutter angle for me, and we were able to intercept the 4K feed before it was broadcast, or sent over air and compressed,” explained Kosinski. “We were able to put raw recorders on those cameras, and do up to 20 of their track cameras in an uncompressed format, which we did at every race.”

To integrate the Apex team's two cars into the actual races, the “F1” VFX team would “re-skin” (a technique developed for “Top Gun: Maverick”) one of the real race cars into one of the black and gold Apex cars.

After each race, the editorial team would comb through and log every event of the race, so that when editor Stephen Mirrione needed, for example, a shot of a car passing another car on the right side, he would be able quickly access the various options from that particular race (Kosinski said that Lewis Hamilton was far too eagle-eyed and knowledgable of each track to let the filmmakers get away with cheating by repurposing footage from different races).

“We would cut the real footage from the real race [into the movie] and we would put these little ‘bugs,' these little tiny logos, on the car that we were going to turn into an Apex car,” said Kosinski. “And that's how I watched the movie for a year-and-a-half, with all these little floating logos everywhere, which to anyone else would be completely indecipherable, but once I had committed to those shots, visual effects would re-skin.”

 










Each of the movie's races has a narrative arc, which often hinges on the viewer understanding the nuances and strategy of car racing. While the goal was to make a film racing fans could appreciate, it was equally important for the summer blockbuster not to lose the casual movie-goer. 

Therefore, “F1” was constantly faced with exposition problems — taking time to explain things to an audience can bring a story to a halt and remove the viewer from the immersive experience. To solve the exposition problem, the filmmakers recruited Sky Sports announcers David Croft and Martin Brundle to play themselves.

“I noticed [Croft and Brundle] do this amazing thing where they mention the fundamentals, so that if someone is tuning in for the first time, you're getting those tidbits you need to know,” said Kosinski. “But for the diehard fans, they're the voice of the sport, so it feels authentic.”

The announcer were brought in during post-production and recorded 19 hours of voiceover for the filmmakers to then play with in the editing room.

Using real F1 cars for the Pitt and Idris' Apex team was impossible. “A Formula One car requires about 30 people to start it, and costs about $250,000 a day to run it,” said Kosinski. “A Formula Two car can be started by two people and costs about $30,000 a day to run, and you're getting 90 percent of the performance [of an F1 car].”

 










As Kosinski explained, 90 percent of the performance was plenty — pointing out stars Pitt and Idris had no business operating in that upper 10 percent of performance. So the production purchased six F2 cars and shipped them to the Mercedes F1 factory so its engineers and technicians could modify them to look like F1 cars and equip them for filmmaking purposes.

Since the release of Pure Heroine over a decade ago, Lorde has established a steady rhythm for herself: one album, once every four years. Yet each time we grow impatient, watching a pot we know isn't ready to boil, because a new Lorde album isn't just a collection of new music from a beloved artist—it's the last four years of her life in miniature, a game of Where in the World is Ella Yelich-O'Connor? No matter the cut and contour of the songs, the answer is always fascinating.

At just 35 minutes, Virgin is the shortest Lorde album and the most dense with her. It is—as all its predecessors have been—a record about growing up, fitfully, while dragging the cocoon of youth behind you. It's also frequently, ravenously horny. Working with Jim-E Stack, who co-wrote last year's world-stopping “Girl, So Confusing” remix, Lorde casts her scope onto the kind of thorny subject matter rarely discussed outside of a therapist's office: generational trauma, pregnancy tests, dysmorphia, dysphoria, sexual dominance and submission. As Virgin traverses fairytales, New York City, the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape, and a sample of Dexta Daps' dancehall hit “Morning Love,” an artist long touted as wise beyond her years comes to terms with how much she still doesn't know. Here are five takeaways from the album.

Earlier this week, Lorde was a guest on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, where she discussed how MDMA therapy helped her overcome “the most horrific stage fright.” She'd previously defined each of her studio albums by a particular drug—alcohol for Pure Heroine, molly for Melodrama, and weed for Solar Power—but Virgin, while it's far from a “getting sober” record, presents a shifting relationship to mood-altering substances. The drunken car-crash fantasies of “Homemade Dynamite” have given way to breezy, post-ego death bike rides on “Man of the Year,” and Lorde's busy accounting for all the other compulsions that can come to run our lives: sex, the internet, our relationships to our bodies, our relationships to our mothers. Then again, the “best cigarette of my life” line in “What Was That” begs the question: Is Virgin actually her nicotine album?

If you weren't already aware, Lorde lives in New York City now, and the transplant has made her adopted home a central fixture of the Virgin rollout. She debuted lead single “What Was That” at an impromptu concert in Washington Square Park, and peppers her lyrics with further placemarks throughout the album. Washington Square gets another shoutout (“The mist from the fountain is kissing my neck”) on “Hammer,” as does Magic Jewelry on Canal Street, where Lorde allegedly goes to get her ears pierced and aura photographed. “In the city, I hear the voices of the ancients, they're calling for us,” she sings on “If She Could See Me Now,” “Hear their horses running up Prince Street.” The “Man of the Year” music video even takes place in a recreation of Walter De Maria's New York Earth Room, which has occupied the same SoHo loft since 1977.

“When I'm in the blue light, down at Baby's All Right/I face reality,” Lorde sings on “What Was That,” repping the NYC venue whose founder, Billy Jones, died earlier this month. Some of the defining images of the Virgin album cycle have been of Lorde dancing on elevated platforms surrounded by adoring throngs, but aside from “Hammer”'s four-on-the-floor euphoria, the songs here rarely sound comfortable on the dancefloor. Instead, executive co-producer Jim-E-Stack repurposes club textures within conventional pop tempos and structures; “Shapeshifter” morphs from a dusty two-step to breakbeats in its final thirty seconds; “Favourite Daughter”'s glitchy shuffle would've done gangbusters in 2014, sandwiched between “The Wire” and “Run Away With Me”; and the metallic 808s on “Broken Glass” are offset by a rubbery, vaguely Swiftian synth line. Only “If She Could See Me Now” and the first two-thirds of “Man of the Year” offer glimpses at what a more acoustically-driven Virgin could've been.

The most immediately striking song on Virgin also happens to be the one that sounds the least like Lorde. “Clearblue” is the spitting image of Bon Iver's a cappella vocoder ballads (“Woods,” “715 - CRΣΣKS”), down to the way Lorde enunciates “Free, I'm free.” She comes by it honestly; Jim-E Stack produced the latest Bon Iver album, this year's SABLE, fABLE, and Justin Vernon (who also plays bass and electric guitar on “David”) is one of the most influential musicians of the last two decades, bar none. The word “Clearblue” even scans like one of his signature nonsense portmanteaus, despite being a brand of drugstore pregnancy test. A less prominent Vernon homage can also be found on closing track “David,” where a piece of looping feedback—similar to those BJ Burton mustered up on 22, A Million or in his work with latter-day Low—distorts Lorde's voice into a ghost in the machine.

Miami's cityscape can feel like a living organism. Take Brickell City Centre, a four-city-block condo-office-mall complex that literally breathes. It was designed to create a natural breeze in the Florida heat, so that the monstrous development would have to rely less on air conditioning. BCC is vaguely hideous on the outside, but inside its lines are clean, wavy, and oceanic, certainly gorgeous enough for a Sunglasses Hut. Brickell City Centre embodies the work of Arquitectonica, a local architecture firm that, since the 1970s, has remade Miami's image with glass facades and curvy shapes. Their greatest buildings feel natural but also garishly artificial, and lend the city a hyperreal feeling—a sense of luxury and awe that defies the reality that the climate crisis could upend life in the city at any moment.

Producer Nick León comes from Broward County, just north of Miami proper. Like Arquitectonica's buildings, León's music is pure Miami—the album's press materials refer to it as Arquitectronica—reflecting the city's mugginess but also its lively sounds, as well as an ominous menace around its prettiest resorts and waterfronts. León worked on A Tropical Entropy for three years and named it after a phrase in Joan Didion's 1987 book Miami, which positioned the region as a sort of upside-down America thanks to its tropical heat and restive, crime-ridden political landscape. León approaches his South Florida warily but lovingly. He borrows rhythmic strains from its streets in the service of insular electronic music that gives us a glance at León's own Miami: fun, but freakily unnerving if you really start looking around. There are moments of optimism and freedom, but A Tropical Entropy is the rare dance album that explores the seedier side of this milieu, rather than just the escape it can offer.

That's probably because he's stuck deep in it. Since the pandemic, León has become one of dance music's most beloved producers, riding a wave of hype around Latin-influenced subgenres with dancefloor hits like 2022's “Xtasis.” His music pairs excellent sound design and mainstream-ready melodies with rhythmic know-how that touches on perreo, tribal guarachero, and raptor house, among others. But it's the dreamy dembow song “Bikini,” with Erika de Casier, a released as a single last summer, that lays his intentions bare, following production credits with Rosalía, Empress Of, and Oklou: The dude wants to make pop music.

That desire bubbles to the surface on A Tropical Entropy, an album that sounds uncomfortable with León's own dance music history, jumping from genre to genre as if he couldn't bear to sit still for more than a minute. Each track is short and turbulent, adding up to a brief 33-minute runtime that feels almost unceremonious for a debut album from a buzzy artist. Rippling drum patterns appear suddenly like inclement weather before turning a song inside out and leaving just as quickly. Even the poppier moments are indecisive and ephemeral. But listen closely and it feels lived in, inhabited by his close friends and made with a level of detail (and neurosis) more aligned with the bedroom than the club. It's a more personal spin of the styles he's most closely associated with, turning the swing of dancehall and dembow into paranoid, palpitating heartbeats.

In a 2024 interview, León discussed being tired of touring and nightclubs and explained that he was “anti-drums” when he began working on A Tropical Entropy. Though they're not the main attraction, the drums come in hot, landing suddenly with needlepoint precision and a low-end heft that crashes like waves against manmade seawalls. On “R.I.P. Current,” the track hits high-gear when the dembow rhythm goes double-time. Melodic elements blur like billboards flying by on a freeway, a moment of fleeting escape before we're drawn back into León's more insular headspace. Sometimes things go too fast, like on “Millennium Freak,” whose stuttering speed dembow drums and muttered vocals create the chaos of coming up too fast with no end in sight, the moment you realize that perhaps what you took wasn't what you thought it was. The moods continue to swing with “Hexxxus,” a club-ready, dancehall-ish track that starts out irritable and twitchy, yet ends up somewhere close to sexy.

When he's not DJing or producing pop singers, León calls himself a sound artist—which includes his work for an installation centered around a coral reef off the coast of Miami—and A Tropical Entropy includes some of his richest and most evocative sounds. “Metromover” is underwater techno, with synth notes and vocal snippets landing at random like light filtering through the surface of the ocean. The album's catchiest song, “Crush,” is only 91 seconds long and made from a series of seemingly disconnected arpeggios that form a romantic whole gone before you know it, as if León is catching wisps of smoke and manipulating them until they fade away completely.

These impermanent sounds, the way they appear to pass through glass and water, mimic the urban landscape of Miami, right down to its famously decadent nightlife. The flickering emotional interference is the product of too many nights out, when you've rewired your brain a little too eagerly—and incorrectly. It's the weird peaceful-agitated-buzzing-sad feeling you get after leaving Downtown Miami bar The Corner at 7 a.m. for a pointless post-club drink you definitely didn't need (“Product of Attraction,” which feels like a UK garage love song and lament tied into one excruciating knot, could've been made after a bender like that).

Miami is a place of contradictions that can feel precarious just by existing: too hot, constantly under threat from hurricanes, in danger of falling into the ocean. Equally precarious and unsuited for our times is the life of the DJ—or anyone who has professional aspirations around the dance music industry. This is a scene that can kill you as much as it nourishes you, pulling you into the undertow while giving you fleeting glimpses of success, fun, and glory, putting people on a pedestal for the mere act of playing music to drink and do drugs to.

A Tropical Entropy is a self-deprecating title for a landmark moment in León's career. Sure, there's progress here, but there's also doubling back, starting over, giving into anxiety, sometimes all in the same track. The unsteady rhythms and unsure song structures reveal the malaise in returning not only to Miami but to dance music itself, which makes A Tropical Entropy feel alive and imperfect, just like the city it was born in. Pride mingles with restlessness and unease, while the sepia wash of depression bleeds in at the corners. It all comes to a head as the jittery “Broward Boyy” transitions into “Bikini,” León's 2024 hit that returns to close out the album. This oceanside torch song was always melancholy, but now there's something else in it. Depending on your reading, “Meet me at the beach” could either be a romance reduced to routine or a Springsteenian call to escape. Maybe it's both at once, the sound of someone locked in a cycle they can't get out of.

Some years ago, my boyfriend invented what I believe to be the greatest dinner party game of all time. Ideally meant for drunken shouting across a large table, “Real Freak/Fake Freak” distinguishes between true weirdos and well-adjusted people who wear their eccentricities like a bag of chips on their heads. You begin with universal claims (Brian Wilson, RIP, was a Real Freak; Frank Zappa was a Fake Freak) and progress until everyone feels emboldened to try to outdo one another. These fights can range from the historical (Yoko Ono: RF/The Beatles: FF), to the controversial (Courtney Love: RF/Kurt Cobain: FF), to the ones that would get you murdered by Brazilian teenagers online (Redacted/Redigido), going on until you've exhausted your vocal cords from screaming with or at each other. There is nothing inherently good or bad about being a freak, but the game does speak to how an audience squares life and art, and how convincing a musician can be at phrasing their humanity through their strangeness.

Given her goofy stage persona and children's-party-on-acid aesthetic, Angel Abaya readily invites this question. She started off playing things relatively straight, performing with bands in Idaho, working for local arts organizations, and releasing an album of dusky folk rock under her government name. But after moving to Los Angeles and linking up with Sean Guerin of De Lux, she underwent a major makeover. As Gelli Haha, the singer stakes a claim to the club's weird corners, marrying disco and house-pop to a strain of surreal humor that hews closer to PeeWee's Playhouse than to polyester genre imitation. On Switcheroo, Gelli Haha's new album, she raises a big top large enough to contain stoned revelation, gross-out humor, and a stockpile of bizarro sound effects. With its riotously fun production and full-barreled commitment to silliness, Switcheroo does more than earn its freak card: It firmly establishes Abaya as a brilliant young talent to watch.

Contrary to her stage name, Abaya is less interested in being funny (haha) than she is in using disco's pull and release to dance this mess around. Her songs are panoramic in an off-kilter way, tracing odd circles around fraught feelings without ever leaving the dancefloor. Opener “Funny Music” considers the psychological push and pull of being a clown in the form of a dialectic—more enjoyable than it sounds! Over a surging Moroder beat, the artist alternates between a heartfelt yearning to be laughed at and soft-spoken disavowals that she's only joking. As the song builds to a climax, she puts her foot down firmly on the side of sincerity by making a massive, aching arch out of the plea: “I'm funnyyyyyy!” The desperation is unmistakable, but so too is the message: She may be weird as hell, but from here on out, defensiveness will have no place in Gelli Haha's universe.

As the party kicks off, mixed emotions bubble to the fore. On the springy synth-pop of “Bounce House,” Abaya cycles through nursery rhymes so breezily that you almost miss that she's left a failing relationship behind in the process. “Tiramisu” is pure pleasure until the singer begins emphasizing the title's last two syllables: “miss you.” As its overblown house beat continues pounding, Abaya's voice becomes ragged and out of step—until, like a child who's spun around after eating too much cake, she finally screams her exasperation out loud. “Pluto is not a planet it's a restaurant” is the record's ecstatic peak, but as the beat surges, her heart sinks, singing “I'm afraid” as the beat lifts off into the heavens. Rather than channel disco's full-bodied catharsis, Abaya chases a stream of consciousness through boredom, non-sequiturs, and woozy altered states.

The ultimate example of this approach comes halfway through the album. You'd be forgiven for assuming that the titular “Piss Artist” is either Andres Serrano or Andy Warhol, but surprise! It's the singer herself! Turning an account of the time she peed in a jar at a house party into a druggy epic, the artist's intoxicated rambling is set to a minimal beat bookended by a sassy, strutting chorus. Few things in this world are more tedious than listening to a stoned person spill their guts, but the song is a blast: the product of Abaya's excellent comic timing and cheeky production touches that underline and heighten her queasy grip on reality. When she mixes up nouns in one line (“the floor is on the bed”) her laughter suddenly doubles back and multiplies, chuckling maniacally to herself as the walls seem to melt around her.

Gleeful absurdity abounds. Several songs substitute formal songwriting for extended word games, but Abaya and Guerin compensate with music that's twice as articulate. “Spit” is a staggering study in sibilance, the artist intoning half the dictionary entries for the letter “S” over a swarm of buzzing synthesizers. If Sesame Street ever wants an electro-clash trip through the alphabet, Abaya provides an excellent audition tape. The mid-tempo boogie “Normalize” nods at Nigerian pop, while prattling off symptoms and syndromes that run from diphtheria (get well soon!) to homophobia (or maybe don't!). The slow building euphoria of “Dynamite” is built around the phrase “I've been waiting for that” as the duo create a sonic collage of possible things she might be waiting for: canned dialogue, gentle marimba pings, found-audio chaos that sounds like a bear attack.

In the last few years, silliness has been both a boon and a crutch for pop musicians of all stripes, who carefully cultivate camp or use inside jokes to batter listeners' brains. So it feels increasingly urgent to suss out who is flaunting their quirks for viral attention and who is striving to carve out a distinct lane for themselves and a new set of possibilities for their listeners. Even if you initially assumed Abaya came by her weirdness in a contrived way, listening to Gelli Haha dispels any doubt about where she lands on the freak spectrum. Her eccentricities bear themselves beautifully out in her music, and in her fine attention to detail, Angel Abaya shows you just how human that strangeness can be.

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

On the opening track of STARS, Joey Meland offers something of a mission statement for their project Cocojoey: “Too many more directions to go and I just don't know how to pick a path.” They sing these lines gently at first, over a placid keyboard fantasia, but over the course of the track's three-minute runtime, the delicate melodies build into black metal screams. The synths contort into acid-damaged drum'n'bass, then tilt-a-whirl prog-rock and feverish showtunes that feel like they're ripped from All That Jazz's deranged death dreams. It's unrelentingly paced and overstuffed with ideas; with each successive track, it feels like Meland is trying to push the gas pedal even further through the floor.

Meland has always approached music with this twitchy restlessness. They learned to play the piano at age four, then darted deliriously between genres, recording classical compositions, black metal, and noise before graduating from high school. They earned a degree in composition and spent a decade playing in bands around Chicago, shifting between jazz, folk music, and funk—trying a bit of everything without committing to anything in particular. Then, during COVID lockdown, they took a pause from their busy schedule and experienced what they describe as a “spiritual transformation.” It led to a new clarity of purpose and the birth of Cocojoey—an exuberant, genre-smashing solo project that looks back at the disparate threads of their past and asks: What if instead of spreading themselves thin across all these projects, they did it all at the same time?

On their previous full-length, Cocojoey's World, Meland emerged with an oozy, embryonic version of the sound: gnarled riffs clawing their way out of video game synths like chestbursters on the Nostromo. For all its scattershot psychedelia, STARS—Cocojoey's first album for the similarly genre-obliterating label Hausu Mountain—feels more practiced and purposeful. The frayed fibers of Meland's interests are never more delicately woven together than on “COCOJOEY'S LACK OF REGRETS,” on which they dart between queasy sound design, fusion-y piano runs, dead-eyed rapping, and guttural death metal affectations. The track also features some twisted guitar work from recurring collaborator Fire-Toolz, whose presence may help overwhelmed listeners understand just what kind of jittery, otherworldly sounds Meland is employing. Like Fire-Toolz's vibrantly overstimulating records, STARS toys with both devastating heaviness and cerebral prog nerdiness in a way that feels both considered and playful. Both collaborators build the component parts of their tracks like intricate Lego sculptures, then smash them together and giggle at the wreckage.

Lighthearted as the approach may feel, Meland also uses the tracks to tackle some weighty concerns. “TIME TO GO!” is burdened by intrusive thoughts, self-obsession, and the fight to make meaning in life through making art. Between the dizzying riffs, “COCOJOEY'S LACK OF REGRETS” offers meditations on life with chronic illness, calling out a health insurance company by name. “ANOTHER LIFE” uses kaleidoscopic synth programming to counterbalance a clear-eyed meditation about depression and rotting in bed. It's heavy stuff when you read the lyric sheet, but that gravity is almost entirely obscured by the unrestrained joy with which Meland approaches these hyperactive compositions. In this way, STARS posits one path to make your way through life's challenges: Stay busy enough and you'll barely notice the darkness.

	Soldiers in the Israeli military have told the Israeli news outlet Haaretz that aid distribution centers in Gaza have become “a killing field,” with military leadership ordering soldiers to fire on unarmed Palestinians. 


	Massacres at aid distribution sites have become a common occurrence in recent weeks as the Israeli military ever so slightly loosened its blockade against humanitarian aid into Gaza, and tasked itself with  aid management under the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, estimates that 549 have been killed and several thousands injured near aid sites since late May, when the foundation first began operations. The United Nations estimated that least 410 had been killed at aid sites over a similar time frame. 


	Soldiers and officers in the Israeli Defense Forces who spoke to Haaretz paint a bleak picture of the scene, indicating the killings are the result of IDF policies targeting civilians in violation of international law. 

	











	“Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,” one soldier said. “They're treated like a hostile force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.” 


	The same soldier called the scene “a killing field,” adding that he was “not aware of a single instance of return fire. There's no enemy, no weapons.” 

	











	Another enlisted officer acting as security for a GHF aid center said that “it's neither ethically nor morally acceptable for people to have to reach, or fail to reach, a [humanitarian zone] under tank fire, snipers and mortar shells.”


	Under Israel's blockade against humanitarian aid, Palestinians in Gaza have been living in rubble under near famine conditions. Despite the creation of the GHF, the United Nations issued a report earlier this month indicating that its operations were insufficient, and it was imperative for an “unlimited and unfettered supply of aid to enter” Gaza.

	According to IDF sources who spoke to Haaretz, the Israeli military is theoretically not supposed to be in direct contact with Palestinians at aid points. But as the over 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza become increasingly desperate for life-sustaining resources, their efforts to secure what limited amounts of food they can are being met with gunfire. 


	“A combat brigade doesn't have the tools to handle a civilian population in a war zone,” an Israeli officer said. “Firing mortars to keep hungry people away is neither professional nor humane. I know there are Hamas operatives among them, but there are also people who simply want to receive aid. As a country, we have a responsibility to ensure that happens safely.” 


	One officer, serving in the division of the notorious IDF Brigadier General Yehuda Vach, said that it was Vach who instituted the policy of using live munitions to disperse crowds. “This is Vach's policy,” they said, “but many of the commanders and soldiers accepted it without question. [The Palestinians] are not supposed to be there, so the idea is to make sure they clear out, even if they're just there for food.”


	Another soldier, a tank operator, told the publication that while technically tank fire was supposed to be used as a warning, “firing shells has just become standard practice. Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths, and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there's never a good answer. Sometimes, merely asking the question annoys the commanders.”

	Earlier this week, as President Donald Trump attempted to enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, reports emerged that dozens of Palestinians — as many as 50 — as well as three aid workers, were killed by IDF gunfire while awaiting aid in Southern Gaza. Similar massacres are taking place on a near daily basis.


	“They talk about using artillery on a junction full of civilians as if it's normal,” one military source told Haaretz of a meeting they attended with leaders of the IDF's Southern Command. “An entire conversation about whether it's right or wrong to use artillery, without even asking why that weapon was needed in the first place. What concerns everyone is whether it'll hurt our legitimacy to keep operating in Gaza. The moral aspect is practically nonexistent. No one stops to ask why dozens of civilians looking for food are being killed every day.”

	











	Markers of the callousness in the IDF's operations within Gaza continue to elicit shock after more than a year of brutality. One source who spoke to Haaretz indicated that the militarized aid operation in his region of Gaza has a name: Operation Salted Fish.

	“Salted Fish” is a reference to an Israeli children's game similar to red light, green light. 


	“You know it's not right. You feel it's not right — that the commanders here are taking the law into their own hands,” one soldier said. “But Gaza is a parallel universe. You move on quickly. The truth is, most people don't even stop to think about it.”

Brad Pitt‘s home in Los Angeles has reportedly been broken into and police are investigating the alleged incident, law enforcement sources told NBC News on Thursday.


	The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirmed a break-in on Wednesday night at a residence located on the 2300 block of North Edgemont Street in the Los Feliz neighborhood, reported the Associated Press. The outlet stated that Pitt reportedly purchased the home for $5.5 million in April 2023, per Traded, a commercial real estate website.


	NBC News said that an LAPD spokesperson confirmed that the alleged burglary occurred at 10:30 p.m. Police told People that the suspects “broke into the residence via the front window, ransacked the location, then fled the location with miscellaneous property.”


	Police did not identify who owned or lived in the home, there is currently no information on what was stolen, and the suspects have yet to be identified.

	The alleged burglary occurred months after Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's Los Angeles home was broken into on Valentine's Day. 


	Pitt was reportedly not at home at the time of the alleged break-in. He has been out of the country promoting F1, his new film directed by Joseph Kosinski. In a Rolling Stone review of the film, writer David Fear wrote, “The way that Pitt injects his presence, his physicality, his charm, his well-honed screen persona, his particular mix of discipline and DGAF effortlessness, and his backhanded way of making outdated, Golden Age Hollywood roguishness feel completely somehow timeless is what makes this a winner.”

	Democratic Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's mayoral primary victory in New York City has prompted an elite panic, the likes of which we've rarely seen: Billionaires are desperately seeking a general-election candidate to stop him, former Barack Obama aides are publicly melting down, corporate moguls are threatening a capital strike, and CNBC has become a television forum for nervous breakdowns. Meanwhile, Democratic elites who've spent a decade punching left are suddenly trying to align themselves with and take credit for Mamdani's brand (though not necessarily his agenda).


	On the surface, this freak-out can seem as if it's about policy. Mamdani's proposals for free buses, universal free child care, faster small-business licensing, higher taxes on the rich, some publicly owned grocery stores, a higher minimum wage, and rent freezes are indeed shocking to oligarchs conditioned to getting everything they want. When you're so accustomed to privilege, the most minimally humane policies for others can seem like oppression — and Mamdani's agenda probably feels that way to New York's billionaires, CEOs, and neoliberals.

	And yet, the intensity of the nervous breakdown over his win suggests this is about way more than one mayoral candidate's important-but-hardly-radical agenda for a single metropolis. This is about power — specifically, the power of money and establishment authority to control outcomes. 

	











	Mamdani won despite being vastly outspent and despite being targeted for defeat by both the Democratic machine and the elite liberal media megaphone. His victory is a “system defining” moment, not because a charismatic underdog was victorious in one race, but because it was the first time the oligarchy was unable to buy the political results it wanted in such a high-profile contest.

	And that suggests a national political earthquake may be on the horizon.


	As The Lever's award-winning audio series showed, over the last half century, a master plan was executed to deregulate the campaign finance system, legalize corruption, and empower oligarchs to buy elections and subvert democracy. The scheme worked flawlessly. Nearly every major election for every major office became a contest between candidates who had some significant chunk of oligarch support and would represent moneyed interests in office. Those who didn't have some of that support simply could not compete — they were spent into the ground and destroyed at the polls. 


	This master plan ended up constructing the entire architecture of plutocracy we live under today: deregulated finance, lax antitrust enforcement, an out-of-control military-industrial complex, a winner-take-all economy, unprecedented inequality, and elections transformed into auctions. And as mass misery predictably ensued, the master planners beat back periodic revolts over the last two decades. 


	In 2006, anti-war candidate Ned Lamont actually defeated Sen. Joe Lieberman in Connecticut's Democratic primary, but ultimately, Lieberman and the oligarchy prevailed in the general election.


	In 2008, Obama cast himself as a populist challenge to the status quo — but underneath the Hope poster was tons of Wall Street cash, which guaranteed that when he won, he would prioritize his donors over the rest of us.


	In 2016 and 2020, Bernie Sanders almost wrested the presidential nomination away from the Democratic establishment — but after the kind of elite panic we're seeing today, power and money won the day.

	In 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found a glitch in the master plan with her upset primary victory over an incumbent Democrat — but in that anomaly, the oligarchy was caught off guard. Money and power quickly fixed the glitch, made sure never to be surprised again. The Democratic machine focused on crushing AOC-style primary challenges for congressional seats — and replacing other progressive lawmakers with corporate-friendly liberals.

	











	Then came 2025 and Mamdani — a Sanders-style candidate who is openly hostile to oligarchy, who is telegenic like Obama, but who did not engage in the Obama-esque bait-and-switch of taking billionaires' cash while winking and nodding at their political agenda. 


	Mamdani did not ask permission from the establishment or a network of big donors to run for the highest office in the global capital of finance — and he did not benefit from AOC's element of surprise. The establishment lined up behind Andrew Cuomo, a two-term governor with a famous surname and a massive political network. Despite previously calling on him to resign, the Democratic machine armed Cuomo with lethal weapons of political destruction: $30 million worth of ads, a constant stream of anti-Mamdani agitprop from elite media brands, and a Hitler-invoking campaign depicting Mamdani as an antisemite. 


	Casting the upstart as a crazed radical and spending him into oblivion has been plutocrats' standard and devastatingly effective strategy, one that has been successfully deployed against candidates like Mamdani for 50 years. But for the first time in anyone's memory, the gambit failed. When the votes were counted, Mamdani's campaign for “a city we can afford” had triumphed over all the money and power that had previously guaranteed political outcomes. 


	He was able to achieve a once-impossible win thanks to four big factors: 1) grassroots organizing work had been done in New York for the last decade 2) the city had a pro-democracy weapon against the master plan: a public campaign financing system that gave Mamdani some necessary resources 3) other anti-oligarchy candidates used the city's ranked choice voting system to stand in solidarity with him and 4) his populist anti-oligarchy message resonated in a city where one in four residents are at or below the poverty line. 


	More than any dispute over a particular policy, this is why the elites are throwing such a spectacular temper tantrum right now. They know they lost their power to control the outcome in a major election — and could now lose it in other elections across the country. 


	This is also why Obama-era Democratic elites are trying to horn in on the victory. Attention is their currency and business model, and so they are trying to align themselves with Mamdani's brand while attempting to avoid attributing his win to his specific policy agenda that galvanized so many young voters.

	











	Whether it's the Pod Save guys, the abundance dudes, Democratic politicians, or the legions of blue-no-matter-who sycophants who were only recently waging a war on the left, they aim to aestheticize and depoliticize Mamdani's victory, ignoring his declaration that his goal is to “win with a mandate to deliver” on his promises. Instead, establishment Democrats' focus is on the candidate's style, charisma, and media savvy, implying that voters are too dumb to pay attention to specific policies, they just respond to vibes. 


	“Put whatever views you may have about Mamdani's politics aside,” tweeted Pod Save America's Jon Favreau as he touted Mamdani's short-form video a day before the election, when it was becoming clear the underdog had a shot to win. The insinuation was clear: the candidate's political agenda can and should be set “aside” from the story of his success.


	As CNN put it, professional Democrats want “to embrace Zohran Mamdani's energy, if not always his ideas.”


	Why the entreaties but also the equivocation? Perhaps it's all about trying to belatedly assert some modicum of control before Mamdani takes office. 


	Having failed to predetermine the primary outcome, the Democratic establishment and its allied media are frantically trying to stay ahead of the situation. Their machine is using the soft power of punditry and podcasting not just to grab some of the reflected glory, monetize clicks, and preserve their role as arbiters of the liberal discourse. They also want to influence policy outcomes. Mamdani receives their offer of fame, celebrity, and “rising star” status — with the inference that if he pushes his agenda too aggressively or too impolitely, those benefits could quickly vanish. 


	This cadre's Jedi mind trick relies on collective amnesia. It only works if everyone forgets that the Democratic establishment turned hope and change into more of the same, bailed out banks that were foreclosing on millions, empowered Wall Street giants, fortified health insurers, and created the larger affordability crisis that enriched their sponsors. 


	Their sleight-of-hand requires us to forget that this same Democratic gang then spent a decade attempting to blacklist progressives, tar-and-feather the left with the “Bernie Bro” epithet, suppress nascent anti-oligarch movements within their midst, and purge the party of populists to try to prevent any candidate like Mandani from ever emerging. 

	











	Ironically, liberal tone police are now insisting that the progressive movement — which Democratic elites gave absolutely no quarter to — must warmly embrace these same unapologetic bullies with open arms, rather than with circumspection. 


	“Just say welcome,” MSNBC's Anand Giridharadas tweeted at me when I committed the high crime of gently mocking the Pod-Johnny-come-latelys who had made their fame and fortune inside an Obama machine that long promoted the opposite of Mamdani's brand of politics. “Politics is not record collecting. It's good when people find out about your favorite band.”


	The metaphor is an important tell: To the liberal political class, movement politics is less a battle involving real-life stakes than a mere entertaining hobby to enjoy — and in their telling, the hobbyists must instantly befriend those who have remorselessly enriched themselves off being part of the problem. 


	To continue wielding influence and determining outcomes in this new political environment, these Democratic political and media gatekeepers need everyone to see them as honest actors. They need us to forget that many of them were the creators and enablers of the neoliberalism and Dickensian conditions that Mamdani and his coalition have promised to challenge. 


	For his part, Mamdani is shrewdly welcoming all comers. As a politician, his role is to bring as many potential allies — including previous skeptics and naysayers — into his campaign. It is encouraging to see him reaching out to anyone who will give him a microphone to promote his message, which — as his election-night speech showed — he has laudably refused to moderate. 


	But others have different roles to play — for one, holding accountable the obstacles to progress and reminding everyone who the reliable allies are and who are not. 


	Because when the election-night excitement wears off and the fights over real policy change begin, that's when things will get tough.

	When the oligarchy tries to turn Mamdani into a cautionary tale and establishment Democrats try to undermine him — at that point, the starfuckers and fair-weather friends could quickly bail or backstab. 


	They will not be Mamdani's savior. When shit hits the fan, his political bulwark will be the movement that has been trying to change the Democratic Party for years and that ultimately won him the race — a multiracial coalition of those rightly fed up with the status quo.

	Steven Keene, a New York singer-songwriter, challenges fans of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to identify as many of the creative giants' lyrics as they can in his rollicking new song “Thesaurus.”


	Just shy of four minutes, there's nonetheless a lot to digest in Keene's word-packed song, which he sells with his own Dylan-like delivery. Some references are easily identifiable to casual fans — he calls out “First We Take Manhattan” and “Highway 61” in the first 30 seconds — but others, like “He not busy being born is busy dying,” from Dylan's “It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),” require listeners to have more than a working knowledge of the songwriters.


	The chorus, however, is all Keene's and it provides a clever payoff: “They said how'd you write that song, we really love the chorus/I said I stole Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen's thesaurus.”


	Keene says he originally wrote 97 verses for “Thesaurus.” “Dylan and Cohen are master poets and master songwriters. True visionaries. They see the world through a different lens, observe the details others might miss, and have an unparalleled ability to write and tell stories that stir something deep within us,” he says. “Their words don't just tell a story, they evoke emotion in a way that's entirely their own. This song is my homage to them; a small wink, a quiet smile, and a heartfelt nod to their brilliant mastery and the profound impact they've had on me and so many others.”

	“Thesaurus” is set to appear on Keene's upcoming album Notice Me, due Aug. 1 on Noble Steed Music. And it isn't the first time he's taken on the weighty task of paying homage to songwriting legends. Last April, Keene released “This World Is Your World,” a reimagining of Woody Guthrie's “This Land Is Your Land.”

	











	Dylan himself is currently on tour with Willie Nelson on the Outlaw Music Festival tour. On Wednesday, during the tour's stop in Franklin, Tennessee, he performed “The Times They Are a-Changin'” for the first time in 15 years.

	There was a period in the late Nineties and early aughts when every blockbuster movie was seemingly accompanied by an equally-popular soundtrack, with the songs and A-list artists almost as inescapable as the action on screen. From Titanic and Twilight to The Fast & The Furious, the songs released from the hit movies often ended up becoming hits themselves, propelling both the artists and the films to even bigger heights.


	The same feeling runs through the star-studded soundtrack to the new F1 movie, which features 17 high-octane tracks that mirror the adrenaline of the fast-paced Brad Pitt racing drama. Released on Atlantic Records, the same label behind recent soundtracks for Barbie and Twisters, F1 The Album features full throttle turns from artists like Ed Sheeran, Tate McRae, Chris Stapleton and RAYE, who all deliver new tracks with refreshing urgency and relevance, resulting in an album that charges all the way to the finish line. 


	Album opener “Lose My Mind” pairs Don Toliver with Doja Cat for a slinky, synth-driven anthem that sets the stage for a thrilling ride to come. The 16 tracks that follow ran the gamut from rap to rock, Afrobeats to house, yet maintain surprising cohesion as a full album from start to finish.




	Standouts include the scrappy “Underdog” from Roddy Ricch, which starts out with gentle guitar plucking and haunting howls before the rapper takes over with his trademark trap-style cadence. The song is at once a defiant show of strength and rallying cry: “They thought I was cancelled, I piped up and flipped the channel,” Ricch raps. “Ain't got no time to be playin' it safe.”




	RAYE adds her soulful groove to the retro-tinged “Grandma Calls the Boys Bad News,” a cut that's sunny as sweet tea on a summer's day. And Tate McRae's stellar year continues with the frisky and frenetic “Just Keep Watching,” already a hit on the charts and in clubs alike.


	The F1 soundtrack also features dueling rock tracks from Chris Stapleton and Ed Sheeran, the latter of whom amps up the muscle after a string of mid-tempo hits, and suddenly sounds the most invested he's been on a song in years. “Out of the city, now we'rе switchin' four lanes/Got our eyes on a fresh start,” he roars on the rollicking blues-rocker “Drive.”

Formula 1 is truly a global sport, with races across five continents these days, and F1 The Album is similarly an international affair, with star turns from Burna Boy, whose “Don't Let Me Down” is an instant earworm; British house producer PAWSA, who drops the adrenaline pumping “Double C;” and South Korean DJ Peggy Gou, whose aptly-titled “D.A.N.C.E.,” is destined to be blasting at the race track and from the speakers in Ibiza all summer long.


	Three acclaimed Nigerian artists are given the closing slots on the soundtrack, with Mr Eazi leaning into a tropical vibe for the breezy “Attention,” and rapper Darkoo bringing Afrobeats to the party with “Give Me Love.” UK-based Obongjayar closes with the funky “Gasoline,” which finds the Nigerian singer doing his best Pharrell impression while boasting that “My diamond's dancing like a ballerina / World spinning for me, I'm a winner.”


	Of course, just like any F1 race, there are a few bumps along the road. Dom Dolla had the crowd whipped into a frenzy when he took over the “LIV on the Grid” stage at the Las Vegas Grand Prix last fall, but his team-up with Nathan Nicholson here feels phoned in and gets lapped by other artists on the album. Similarly, Tiesto and Sexxy Red's “OMG!” fails to ignite much of a spark.


Rosé‘s “Messy,” meantime, is the only ballad on the album and continues the Blackpink star's breakout solo year. Her pleading voice and confessional lyrics — “You and I are as tangled as these sheets,” she declares in the opening line —  add emotional heft to the album, but the slow pop-rocker feels out of place on a tracklist of party-ready cuts (That being said, Rosé's song does soundtrack a particularly poignant moment in the actual film).

	And while Puerto Rican star Myke Towers leans into his rap roots with “Baja California” (which samples Nineties hip-hop duo Black Sheep), he's the only Latin artist on the album, a surprising miss considering Formula 1 now features two Latino drivers and more than 150 million fans in Latin America alone. With the Mexican and Brazilian Grand Prix still to come in the fall, the soundtrack would've been an ideal opportunity to hype up the races with a few more Spanish-language tracks.




	Still, there's no denying F1's appeal, and the new film is only going to propel the sport's popularity forward. Similarly, F1 The Album is sure to please both movie fans and music fans alike, with its lineup of artists injecting the soundtrack with enough horsepower — and star power — to make it a thrilling listen from lights out to the checkered flag. Electrifying and uplifting, F1 The Album brings back the era of the blockbuster soundtrack, while making its case for the soundtrack of summer too.

Pennsylvania is no stranger to encounters with strange encounters of the third kind, like the Kecksburg UFO Incident. (Marcus Schneck photo)

There's a big holiday coming next week that a number of people are prepping for.

July 2nd, a.k.a., National UFO Day. 

In honor of the holiday, Cascino.ca released a report on which states give someone the highest odds of spotting these unidentified flying objects. Pennsylvania was able to sit amongst the top 10 in the final report in the seventh overall spot. 

According to the report — which sifted through the 149,000 sighting entires on the National UFO Report Center (NUFORC) and calculated each state's odds from there — there's a one in 1,456 per person shot in spotting strange aircraft in the Keystone State's skies.

Indeed, Pennsylvania is no stranger to UFO-related incidents: The state might have been ground zero for a joint UFO-Bigfoot invasion back in the 1970s, and let's not forget about Kecksburg. 

Alas, it was California that laid claim to the highest odds of spotting a UFO in the U.S.: Sightings here are one to 1,075 per person. In second place was Washington (one to 7,125 per person) and then in third, Florida (one to 1,144 per person). 

The study even went so far as to find the odds of an alien abduction as well: The odds of being beamed up like a poor cow in a field is one in 1,834. For the record, that's a 0.0545 percent chance, so for anyone who might be worried about experiencing alien experimentation — rest easy!

So, grab the Mulder to your Scully, and have a Happy National UFO day.

Nature's UFOs are even weirder and more mysterious than flying saucers.

New Jersey is the new Roswell – or so it might seem after a swarm of bright lights, glowing orange-red orbs and unidentified flying objects filled the skies throughout December 2024.

As expected, these strange orbs gave rise to a flood of conspiracy theories involving UFOs and foreign interference. One US Republican congressman even claimed the lights were aircraft originating from an ""Iranian mothership,"" a theory swiftly dismissed by the Pentagon.

Although the exact source of the objects remains unconfirmed, US officials suggest that the majority of sightings were most likely caused by – you guessed it – civilian-operated drones.

The New Jersey drone saga is yet another example of how many so-called UFOs have perfectly logical explanations. But not all phenomena are so easily dismissed. For decades, scientists have been baffled by a different kind of mysterious light: ball lightning.

While it's easy to roll your eyes at such stories, there have been eyewitness accounts of weird floating balls of light for centuries – the earliest thought to be in 1195. It's only thanks to the sheer volume of accounts – and photographic evidence – that scientists have felt the need to investigate these mysterious sightings further.

Many of the reports are from credible sources.

For instance, in 1927, renowned quantum theory physicist Walther Gerlach claimed to have witnessed a “bright, luminous yellowish-white ball” emerge from a bolt of lightning.

Being a scientist, he used his own hastily acquired observations to work out that the ball of light had travelled 1,225m per second (a little over 4,000ft per second) – over three times the speed of sound.

Then there's Dr Roger Jennison, a radio astronomer at the UK's Jodrell Bank Observatory.

In 1963, he was travelling on an overnight flight from New York to Washington during a thunderstorm, when a loud, bright electrical discharge suddenly enveloped the plane. Passengers then observed something extraordinary, which Jennison later outlined in a letter to the prestigious journal Nature.

In the letter, he wrote: “Some seconds after this a glowing sphere a little more than 20cm [almost 8in] in diameter emerged from the pilot's cabin and passed down the aisle of the aircraft approximately 50cm [19in] from me, maintaining the same height and course for the whole distance over which it could be observed.”

Descriptions around the world vary in detail, but often involve a thunderstorm and a ball of light, usually no larger than a football, in a variety of colours.

These luminous globes float through the air for a short period of time, some slowly, others extremely fast. There are reports of them disappearing, exploding or passing through walls or windows. Some leave behind an odour of sulphur.

Yet despite over 800 years of sightings, due to its elusive nature, scientists still don't understand ball lightning. But there are clues that plasma might be the missing ingredient.

Often called the fourth state of matter (the other three being solid, liquid and gas), plasma can be produced relatively easily.

“If you add high temperatures to a gas, you get a plasma – a charged, ionised gas – which can be influenced by electric and magnetic fields,” says Prof Ursel Fantz from the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics near Munich. “This is very important as you can't do that to the other states.”

“More than 95 per cent of the Universe is plasma,” she adds. “All the stars, interstellar space, interplanetary space, aurora and standard lightning. Plasma is also used in medicine and chemical energy storage.""

Plasma too, according to some of Fantz's experiments, could potentially be the source of the floating orbs.

Using just a small beaker of salt water, a couple of electrodes and a high voltage (akin to a bolt of lightning – approx 300 million volts), scientists at Fantz's institute created a 10–20cm [approx 4–8in] diameter plasma cloud – lasting just 0.3 seconds – resembling a glowing orb.

“There are some similarities with ball lightning, but we can't say it is [ball lightning],” said Fantz, “as it exists for less than the time of a twinkle in your eye.”

In 2020, the experiment was recreated with more water and filmed. The resulting video showed ball lightning-style plasmoids rising from the water's surface in slow motion.

Despite not hovering, as previous sightings have claimed, could these plasmas explain ball lightning orbs? Fantz isn't sure. “All we have are people's reports, and pictures are really rare,” she says.

Although floating balls of light like those that could pass through Jennison's aircraft haven't yet been recreated in the lab, scientists continue to speculate on how they might form without relying on plasmas.

For instance, in 2014, there were reports of ball lightning being caught on video by scientists at Northwestern Normal University in Lanzhou, China.

They were studying lightning during a thunderstorm in Qinghai and observed a ball of light form and travel about 20m (65ft) in 1.5 seconds. A spectrograph also identified the ball's main components to be iron, silicon and calcium.

This unexpected observation chimed with one theory hypothesised by researchers in New Zealand, in 2000, which proposed that the glowing ball resulted from a lightning strike on the ground that vaporised grains of minerals (since all of those elements can be found in soil).

“There are lots of theories as to what they are, from mini black holes to antimatter,” says physicist Dr Stephen Hughes, an honorary senior lecturer at the University of Queensland, Australia.

He examined the evidence for green fireballs and ball lightning in a Proceedings of the Royal Society paper published in 2010, which detailed multiple eyewitness sightings over Brisbane and the Gold Coast a few years earlier.

“Ball lightning is definitely some kind of electrical phenomenon,” says Hughes. “People report hissing [and] sizzling sounds, which we associate with electricity. But its mechanism isn't fully understood.”

The mystery is understandable since many eyewitness accounts are contradictory or simply baffling, Hughes adds.

For example, in 1974, during a thunderstorm, Philip Bagnall, the network director of the British Meteor Society, awoke to find an orange ball of light at the foot of his bed. When he reached out, he could feel heat radiating from about 10cm (4in) away.

While some reports describe shocks or partial paralysis upon contact with ball lightning, Bagnall experienced nothing after clapping his hands on it. The sphere then passed through his bedroom ceiling “like a Hollywood ghost.”

“Ball lightning has travelled down an aircraft [according to Jennison] and not caused any burning, although it could still be hot,” says Hughes. “Similar to how you can put your hand in an oven when it's 230°C (446°F) and your hand doesn't get burned as long as you don't touch the metal.”

While details differ, there's something many ball lightning accounts have in common: the phenomenon is seen in and around aircraft.

For instance, in November 1944, during World War II, members of the US 415th Night Fighter Squadron reported seeing “8–10 bright orange lights off the left wing… flying through the air at high speed” north of Strasbourg.

At the time, there was a popular American comic strip called Smokey Stover about fire-fighters where the character Smokey was often referred to as a foolish ‘foo' (fire) fighter. This led to the lights being called “foo fighters” by one of the crew.

This name for UFOs caught on and was used by Japanese, German and Allied pilots too when they filed similar reports of strange lights in the sky.

These ‘foo fighter' lights could be red, orange or green, appear solo or in groups, and sometimes in formation. They accompanied aircraft flying at several hundred miles an hour, didn't show up on radar and could outmanoeuvre any plane that tried to follow them – similar descriptions to many UFO sightings today.

“Some of the UFO reports talk about objects accelerating extremely fast, at impossible rates of acceleration. Fighter aircraft can't stop and change direction that fast, but electrical phenomena can,” says Hughes.

“Electrons are very light and the electromagnetic force is so strong you get this insane acceleration. In just over 1cm (less than 0.5in), electrons can accelerate to half the speed of light.”

In 2024, scientists at the University of California, the University of Arizona and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, published their theory on the origin of ‘foo fighters': plasmas in the thermosphere.

This is a region from about 90–600km (approx 56–370 miles) above Earth's surface, where temperatures at the higher altitudes can reach 2,000°C (3,632°F) or more.

Although the story made national news in one UK paper, the theory was published in the Journal of Modern Physics, a publication that charges authors to publish their work. The theory asserts that the plasma in this region of the atmosphere could be a form of “pre-life”, one that's “completely different from life as we know it.”

While the paper is speculative, it raises the question of whether these sightings of strange glowing balls might be interpreted as potential evidence of aliens.

Fantz, however, is far from convinced. ""Plasma is atoms, ions, electrons and photons,"" she says. ""And that's it.""

Be it plasmas, lightning vaporising minerals on the ground, or extraterrestrials, all current theories about the glowing balls of light remain exactly that – theories.

You might, like others, also think that the many accounts of these balls, from the foo fighters to Jennison's plane aisle, can be explained through psychological means.

But evidence from scientists, such as Fantz's floating plasma ball experiment, leaves little doubt there remains a lot to uncover about many phenomena on this planet. This is why government agencies are changing their approach and are now more prepared to keep an open mind.

“Just because we observe something we don't understand and even surprises us, doesn't mean that we're crazy or wrong,” says ETH Zurich's Prof Thomas Zurbuchen, the former associate administrator of NASA's science directorate, who commissioned an independent study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in 2022.

“I believe in the power of science and the power of data,” he adds. “I'm not telling people what to believe and not believe. I think to some people [the report] demystified what was happening.”

The study, which features the likes of former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and an array of prominent academics, included numerous images of known natural phenomena that are of ten mistaken for UFOs: such as the aurora borealis (northern lights), the Perseid meteor shower and red sprites – an eerie form of crimson lightning that resembles a glowing squid and shoots up, instead of down, into the atmosphere.

The final report stated: “It's increasingly clear that the majority of UAP observations can be attributed to known phenomena or occurrences.” It found no evidence that UAPs were extraterrestrial, but it didn't rule out the possibility.

It therefore surprised many people when, in November 2024, two US subcommittees held a hearing in Washington DC titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.”

The aim was to discuss the Department of Defense and the wider intelligence community's lack of transparency regarding UAPs, and to increase disclosure.

The testimonies attracted a global audience who heard pilots testify that they saw unidentified objects, such as balls of light, on an almost “daily basis”. One former military intelligence officer even stated: “We're not alone in the cosmos.”

The conclusion, however, was that there was no evidence for extraterrestrial life, but that such sightings should be studied further.

“So often, puzzling and disturbing observations indicate new discoveries. For example, we now know that a specific set of observations were indications of a new type of cloud we hadn't known previously,” said Zurbuchen of the NASA report.

“Similarly, weather-related phenomena, such as temperature inversions or electrical phenomena in the atmosphere can lead to surprising observations that may, at first glance, look like UAPs, but are atmospheric science in action.”

This brings us back to ball lightning.

Unfortunately, we're no closer to understanding how it forms, and whether it is or isn't a plasma. Some have even referred to its elusive qualities as “tracking the Sasquatch of meteorology.”

Like Sasquatch, it can be faked too. A 2020 video of ‘ball lightning' travelling above railway tracks went viral on Twitter (now X) and is still doing the rounds today, even though its Russian creator admitted he was testing visual effects.

Science, meanwhile, continues to unravel the cause of the glowing orbs and use the properties of plasma. In fact, a number of classified US research projects are now pivoting to research plasma.

While some have speculated that this is new evidence relating to UFOs, others have pointed to how plasmas could be used for military applications.

Whether these new studies eventually reveal the mysteries of plasmas, or if other scientists unlock hidden truths about the behaviour of lightning on Earth, the truth remains out there… for now.

Pennsylvania is no stranger to encounters with strange encounters of the third kind, like the Kecksburg UFO Incident. (Marcus Schneck photo)

There's a big holiday coming next week that a number of people are prepping for.

July 2nd, a.k.a., National UFO Day. 

In honor of the holiday, Cascino.ca released a report on which states give someone the highest odds of spotting these unidentified flying objects. Pennsylvania was able to sit amongst the top 10 in the final report in the seventh overall spot. 

According to the report — which sifted through the 149,000 sighting entires on the National UFO Report Center (NUFORC) and calculated each state's odds from there — there's a one in 1,456 per person shot in spotting strange aircraft in the Keystone State's skies.

Indeed, Pennsylvania is no stranger to UFO-related incidents: The state might have been ground zero for a joint UFO-Bigfoot invasion back in the 1970s, and let's not forget about Kecksburg. 

Alas, it was California that laid claim to the highest odds of spotting a UFO in the U.S.: Sightings here are one to 1,075 per person. In second place was Washington (one to 7,125 per person) and then in third, Florida (one to 1,144 per person). 

The study even went so far as to find the odds of an alien abduction as well: The odds of being beamed up like a poor cow in a field is one in 1,834. For the record, that's a 0.0545 percent chance, so for anyone who might be worried about experiencing alien experimentation — rest easy!

So, grab the Mulder to your Scully, and have a Happy National UFO day.

There was a notable shift in Steven Spielberg's filmography after his unprecedented success in 1993, in which he both won the Academy Award for Best Picture with Schindler's List and created the highest-grossing film of all-time with Jurassic Park. Schindler's List seemed to indicate a new direction in Spielberg's career, in which he would emphasize important stories of world history, including Amistad and Saving Private Ryan.

Jurassic Park presented a different conundrum. While Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial had been cited as the definitive “popcorn movies” of the previous decades, Spielberg had somehow given the next generation an adventure epic that pushed the boundaries of computer generated imagery to their fullest potential. Topping his own success would prove to be challenging, as The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a disappointment that suggested Spielberg no longer had interest in four-quadrant entertainment. Spielberg's talents seemed better reserved for more “intellectual” fare; Catch Me If You Can was a deep character study about lonely people, and even a sci-fi thriller like Minority Report dealt with serious themes of restorative justice and predestination.

Word that Steven Spielberg would be adapting H.G. Wells' iconic science fiction classic The War of the Worlds may have been exhilarating to an audience walking out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but to an audience that had experienced the meditative cynicism of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, the move felt regressive. Spielberg had nothing left to prove by making a blockbuster intended for a mass audience, particularly when it came to stories about extraterrestrial visitors. Ironically, War of the Worlds would ultimately prove to be one of Spielberg's most profound films about humanity; within the ashes of catastrophe, mankind is revealed to be selfish, unorganized, and incompetent as it faces an existential threat.



Although Minority Report's analysis of surveillance technology was eerie within the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the film was well into production by the time that the attack on American soil had commenced. The ramifications of September 11, 2001 were felt by all of Hollywood within the immediate aftermath, but Spielberg directly examined the consequences of the “war on terror” within his two 2005 films. If the thesis reiterated by the administration of President Bush suggested that collective grief would offer a means of uniting people across party lines, both War of the Worlds and Munich offered a gutting dose of reality.

In Munich, the violence is generational; although the “Black September” tragedy is the inciting incident, it only stoked the tension between Israelis and Palestinians that had been brewing for several lifetimes. However, War of the Worlds captured the stark terror of 9/11 as a singular incident, in which a threat appeared out of nowhere to bring civilization to its knees. As urban centers are decimated and fear takes hold of society, there is little time to be anything but reactive. Those that survived the first wave of the attack are left to wonder if this is the new reality, and whether the world will ever know peace once more.



A talking point perpetrated within the months after 9/11 is whether an attack so destructive was inevitable; America had been a superpower that has inflicted catastrophic damage upon other nations, and its citizens have never felt trepidation about an attack of the same magnitude on their own soil. Spielberg suggests a similar anxiety within the opening moments of War of the Worlds, in which Morgan Freeman's narrator describes the dominion of Earth that has caused extraterrestrials to desire its control. Although War of the Worlds does incorporate aspects of anti-capitalism that have become integral to Spielberg's 21st century canon, the film does not place blame on humanity for its indulgence. Rather, it suggests that in their sustained supremacy, mankind has taken for granted everything they should have cherished.

Spielberg's complex childhood, which he would go on to unpack in his semi-autobiographical film The Fabelmans, spawned recurring themes of broken families, divorced parents, and lost boys within nearly all of his work. Where films like Empire of the Sun or E.T. examined the complexities of adolescence, War of the Worlds sought to empathize with a divorced, bitter father who is forced to step up in his responsibilities. Unlike a character like Robin Williams' Peter Pan in Hook or Sean Connery's Henry Jones Sr. in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ray Ferrier isn't a misunderstood, whimsical hero who rediscovers a childlike sense of wonder. Rather, he's a failed parent whose optimism was eroded before the events of the film even began.

While Tom Cruise's casting in Minority Report provided him with one of his best roles, it wasn't necessarily a performance that challenged the audience's perception of his star persona; his role as a wrongfully accused Precrime officer had the same sense of authority and bravery that made him so perfect for the Mission: Impossible franchise. War of the Worlds, on the other hand, asked Cruise to be pathetic, needy, and at times aggravatingly ignorant; although his complaints about disappointing work hours and an ungrateful ex-wife are relatable, it's odd to see such banal rhetoric coming from someone as world-renowned as Cruise.



Cruise had certainly played dark, complicated characters before, but never someone as unexceptional as Ray; there's a hint of romantic tragedy within Eyes Wide Shut's Bill Harford or Magnolia's Frank T.J. Mackey, but Ray's entire life has little significance within the devastation of Earth at the hands of Martian invaders. Bill is a Hitchockian hero in the sense that he is “an ordinary man caught within extraordinary circumstances,” and Cruise serves as an appropriate audience avatar as he experiences the chaos that emerges. The ability to turn someone as larger-than-life as Cruise into an “everyman” underscored the overwhelming stakes and scale of the terrifying extraterrestrial invasion in War of the Worlds.

Spielberg's portrayal of domesticity is rich with irony, as Ray is tasked with taking care of his children, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), as a result of a devastating thunderstorm that separates him from his ex-wife, Mary Ann (Miranda Otto). Although there is mounting suspense as Spielberg slowly builds to the reveal of the tripod alien attackers, the uncomfortable exchanges with the Ferrier family contain a different type of tension. A prolonged, aggressive game of catch between Ray and Robbie is the perfect summation of their fruitless relationship; later, the scream Rachel makes as they drive along the East Coast could only be given by a child who does not believe that they have a competent guardian.



More terrifying than the presence of the aliens themselves is the futility of finding a protected area of shelter. The Ferriers haphazardly travel from New York to New Jersey, then back to Boston, fleeing as each supposed safe haven is decimated. An initial moment of violence when the tripods vaporize a group of civilians perfectly captures the removed sense of horror one might have felt watching the Twin Towers collapse on television, but it's the death of Ray's friend Manny (Lenny Venito) that indicates that the danger is not theoretical. In an inverse of what most disaster films would do, Spielberg reveals the context of the threat before delivering a more intimate tragedy that psychologically traumatizes the protagonists.

Spielberg learned from Jaws that it's more terrifying to keep his villain in the shadows, and War of the Worlds is clever in the slow reveal of the alien designs. It's often more chilling to examine the aftermath of a conflict, as the devastated suburbia Ray and his children trek through bears a striking resemblance to war-torn China in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. It would have been unwise to mask the aliens for too long, but Spielberg complicates their revelation with a scarier component- the tripods have protective shields, which make a majority of humanity's defenses completely useless. It inspires yet another instance in which Ray must admit to his children that he doesn't have an actual solution, as the planet is not equipped to protect them from such advanced technology.

Although Chatwin's performance caught the most flack from critics during the initial release of War of the Worlds, Robbie's decision to join the counter-offensive may be the film's most radical parallel to the post-9/11 landscape. Those stepping up to serve as Earth's defense aren't altruistic, emboldened heroes, but angry young men like Robbie, who see violence as the only means of finding purpose. Robbie may still contain shards of innocence, but he chooses to take up arms with knowledge that the battle is futile. It's among Spielberg's most crushing observations about the collapse of the “nuclear family,” that many would rather choose to face their likely demise than be vulnerable in front of their loved ones.

It was bold of Spielberg to initially present Ray as a miserable, spiteful character, then steadily reveals him to be more virtuous than many of the other humans scavenging in the aftermath. As the survivors crawl over one another for any source of food or medical supplies, Ray and Rachel must place their faith in Tim Robbins' Harlan Ogilvy, an unstable ambulance driver who offers them temporary shelter. Although Harlan isn't malevolent, his inability to cope with the body horror of the aliens' harvest of human flesh results in a mental breakdown, in which a reluctant Ray must kill him. It's among the darkest moments in any Spielberg film, as it presents an impossible scenario in which Ray must commit an unthinkable act for the sake of his daughter's life; although it's suggested that Ray made the only rational choice within the circumstances, it doesn't make the visual of America's leading A-lister brutally executing a mentally ill man any less disturbing.



Although Ray's transformation into a more heroic protagonist struck some as a betrayal of the film's more grounded beginning, Spielberg deprived his version of War of the Worlds of the global context of its cinematic predecessor. The 1953 film by Byron Haskin details how Doctor Clayton Forrester (Gene Berry) found a means of wounding the alien invaders, which prompted him to bring his findings to a group of military scientists in Los Angeles. Though Ray does find a way of destroying the tripods from within, his strategy is only used by a relatively small group of soldiers and civilians in Boston. Ray's defining act of bravery is intertwined with his own survival, but does not have any lasting consequences that impact humanity as a whole. The smaller scale of the conflict helps keep Spielberg's film grounded, which in turns makes Ray's arc more authentic; it doesn't immediately suspend the viewers' disbelief when Cruise becomes an action star once more, as the audience has already seen the insecurities that plague him.

War of the Worlds' denouement has also become a subject of criticism since its release. The alien invaders are killed as a result of latent microbes that humanity has adapted to, but it was never intended to be an uplifting finale in the vein of Independence Day's rousing conclusion. It's rather disturbing that an invading race incapable of surviving on Earth would be able to supersede humanity's mightiest defenses before its inadaptability is revealed, as Spielberg suggests that the survival of either species is quite fragile. It's also an indication that mankind itself would turn on itself before the inevitable cure was found, as none of the inflammatory rhetoric ended up mattering.



The final moments of War of the Worlds struck another parallel with Munich, which rather infamously ended with Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) becoming so haunted that even intimate moments with his wife (Ayelet Zurer) are disrupted by dark visions. If Munich implied that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was destined to last forever, War of the Worlds showed the great lengths taken to restore a semblance of normality to Ray's family life. The reunion of Ray, Robbie, Rachel, and Mary Ann is a brief moment of catharsis, but there's no suggestion that it will result in a restoration of domestic bliss.

Although it may have been impossible during its initial rollout to distance War of the Worlds from its aggressive marketing campaign, the film's technical achievements have aged rather well, particularly when compared to other Spielberg ventures of the last two decades. The washed-out, cartoonish style of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The BFG resulted in a lack of tactility, but the mechanized design of the tripods gave War of the Worlds an evident parallel to legitimate tools of war. Janusz Kamiński has often been praised for his immersive cinematography, and the tracking shots in War of the Worlds are among the most kinetic of his collaborations with Spielberg; John Williams' score is also notably dour, as the rhythmic crescendos that animate each action sequence are interspersed with melancholy moments of grandiosity, which inspire comparisons to the monster movie themes of the 1950s.

Spielberg's first son, Max, was not born until June of 1984, and there's a notable difference within the ways in which he depicts children in the immediate aftermath; it is unlikely that Spielberg would have depicted the brutal death of a young boy in Jaws, the enslavement of children in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or the peril of kids in Poltergeist had he already been raising a family of his own. Although some have pointed to Spielberg's parenthood as the reason he often slipped into sentimental storytelling, War of the Worlds evokes the kind of horror that could have only been conceived by someone terrified about the world that they would leave behind for their children. The film was not merely a subversion of ‘50s B-movies or a commentary on American haughtiness, but a realization of Spielberg's own anxieties. Only a filmmaker of Spielberg's imagination would have been able to craft War of the Worlds into such a nightmare.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","This New Supernatural Horror Movie With 88% on Rotten Tomatoes Is Perfect for Fans of It Follows","https://www.cbr.com/it-feeds-perfect-for-fans-of-it-follows/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 01:35:00 GMT","

2025 has been an epic year for the horror genre, and with the year only halfway through, there's still plenty for fans to look forward to. It's worth noting that horror films have recently done more than preserve the genre's popularity; they've elevated it by leaning into strong storytelling rather than relying solely on cheap thrills. While recent hits like Bring Her Back and Longlegs have played a big part in this revival, it's the low-budget titles that remain the genre's unsung heroes.

Without flashy marketing campaigns or star power attached, these films often face a 50/50 shot at success—yet they're the ones most likely to achieve cult status. Ashley Greene's new supernatural horror, It Feeds, fits right into that tradition. It may not boast the visibility of a mainstream blockbuster, but it's exactly the kind of atmospheric gem that even casual horror fans can appreciate.

 Despite the title's uncanny resemblance to 2014's hit horror flick It Follows, It Feeds is a standalone movie that doesn't need to lean into pre-established lore heavily. It Feeds is directed by Chad Archibald, a prolific horror movie producer and director, who tends to bring unconventionality through eerie and intense stories. Ashley Greene's newest supernatural horror may not be a commercial success or the hot new thing in town, but it surely isn't a disappointment either.

The story begins with a psychiatrist named Cynthia, who offers services outside the traditional approaches. Her clairvoyant abilities allow Cynthia to physically travel into the patient's mind to pinpoint the exact location and reason behind their trauma and suffering. Of course, her services are exclusive, and because of her own past troubles, she offers them to extremely selective clientele.

Although the prospect might seem redundant and awfully close to what Elise did in Insidious, rest assured, her approach has a refreshing twist to it. Cynthia is supported by her 17-year-old daughter Jordan, who works as an assistant and screens patients before setting them up with her mother. Right off the bat, the movie leans into the riskier aspects of Cynthia's abilities, as in one scene, when she travels deep into a patient's subconscious, the manifestation of the patient's treacherous past actually injures Cynthia in the real world.

The 2020s have seen some excellent releases, and fans continue to hope for sequels to films like Don't Worry Darling and The Substance. 

Therefore, there's only so much she can do for every patient, and that's where the story begins. Needless to say, viewers may find the first fifteen and twenty minutes a little fast-paced and spoiler-ish. However, that's all the more reason to wait for the twist when a seemingly distraught 14-year-old girl comes knocking on Cynthia's door. Riley doesn't waste any time building the film's supernatural elements, as instead of slow-burning into the dread, she straightaway lays it all out.

It Feeds is neatly paced around a psychiatrist and her gift that brings the very evil to her doorstep, to which she lost someone close.

It's revealed that there's a grotesque, dark entity attached to Riley that even sends shivers down Cynthia's spine. However, before she could get to the bottom of it, Riley's short-tempered father took her away, but that didn't satisfy Jordan's curiosity, and she persistently annoyed her mother to help Riley. From there on, viewers can pretty much detect predictable patterns in terms of a fiercely independent teen and a reluctant mother whose differences usually end up inviting the very evil they ought to avoid into their lives. However, the moment the audience thinks the film is going down a slippery slope, it pulls up a noteworthy twist that saves it from being a recycled version of every other horror movie with a similar premise.

The undeniable appeal of low-budget horrors lies in their ability to be dependent on a strong narrative. With no subsequent star power or space to feature extravagant backdrops, it boils down to how strong the script and its execution are. Having said that, It Feeds is no Conjuring, but it's also not bad enough to be ignored.

The moment Jordan decides to meddle in Riley's business, the story turns from a one-dimensional supernatural tale into a thriller. In some ways, It Feeds doesn't alienate the premise by involving too many people or plot devices; rather, it keeps the story tight and focused on the main characters. Instead of retracting from progress every chance it gets, It Feeds puts everything on the table and continues at an appreciable pace, whether it's the discovery of Riley's dark secret or the escalation that Jordan's encounter was meant to bring.

Many horror films, though flawless, slip under the radar due to overshadowing by mainstream hits or limited marketing.

It turned out that the dark entity that Cynthia saw was somehow more physical, leaving its mark for everyone to see. As Riley's father explains, it only needs to feed, and as long as it's someone else, his daughter will be safe. In terms of originality, It Feeds may not take full marks and will remind fans of several big names with a similar concept, but the winning combo here is the execution and the pacing.

The audience wouldn't need to look too close or spend the entirety of the movie trying to figure out what's happening. Moreover, for once, a horror movie actually explains the entity that haunts the characters instead of leaving it to their imaginations. They don't have to waste time unraveling the overused semantics of a generic supernatural concept that's already been stretched too thin.

There's an evil force at hand, the characters are in trouble, and the heroine knows what to do - nothing more or less than that. The movie doesn't take up much of its length to get to the point, and surprisingly, everything takes place in a matter of only two days. There's no melodrama, internet surfing, or the drag of characters taking essentially the entire movie to even accept the fact that they are being haunted. In other words, It Feeds is a crisp and simple yet effective movie that delivers what it should: dread, anxiety, intensity, and scares.

 Both Ashley Greene and Shawn Ashmore get plenty of time to shine despite their standard ‘parental' roles. Surprisingly, the twist in the fold allows Ashmore to showcase his talents as he transitions from a suspicious and hot-headed single parent to an overprotective one whose questionable actions don't stem from malicious intent. The tragedy with his wife and daughter drove him to the other side, but his intent was always to nip the evil in the bud. He may have had to hide a few skeletons in the closet along the way, but he's set up in a way that the viewers can't help but sympathize with him.

Things quickly escalate when Jordan discovers that Riley's description of a dark entity haunting her wasn't metaphorical. Thankfully, It Feeds refrains from leaving the audience hanging and explains its premise and demonic elements neatly. As a cherry on top, Julian Richings' brief yet impressive cameo helps fill in the blanks without frustrating the audience too much.

These screen versions of classic Stephen King stories capture exactly what makes him the king of horror.

Richings played a doctor who treated Riley's mother, aka patient zero. He implies that Riley's mother must have picked it up during her long stretches overseas as a humanitarian nurse. He recounts his final moments with the patient, and Cynthia learns that the entity is transmitted through the last person who held the infected in their dying moments. Needless to say, besides these cleverly crafted moments and the subtle jump scares, one other interesting aspect of It Feeds is Cynthia's point of view within the other person's mind.

She travels into the mind's layers of consciousness by compartmentalizing every level that tells its own story. She appears within these isolated boxes of memories in very appealing get-ups, as if to depict her control within that realm. Ultimately, a good supernatural horror is a rarity within a saturated genre, especially if it hails from lesser-known roots. It Feeds may not be groundbreaking, but it sure can pack a punch when built on tight storytelling and committed performances.

It's safe to say that while the movie treads on familiar ground and embraces conventional horror elements, it still manages to inject a healthy dose of originality into the premise. Viewers might feel that they can practically narrate the whole scene in some instances, but those are just fleeting moments that surprisingly connect sequences quite smoothly. Even with all its flaws, It Feeds should be on a horror enthusiast's list as it's a welcoming deviation from recycled rituals and hollow Latin chants.

Updated 27 June 2025 at 17:10 IST

Maa Box Office Collection: Kajol's horror flick released today, June 27, in the theatres. The film helmed by Vishal Furia is based on a popular folklore of Kali and Raktabija. The film was expected to perform well at the box office, but seeing the collection pace, it is unlikely to cross the ₹10 crore mark on the opening day.

Accordingly to Sacnilk, the horror flick has collected ₹1.73 crore at the box office since morning. The film, which opened to mixed reviews, had an overall 14.16 per cent Hindi occupancy on Friday, with 8.23 per cent in the morning and 20.8 per cent in the afternoon. Seeing the pace, it is unlikely for the movie to earn in double digits, but the collection might witness a rise towards evening as it's Friday, and soon it'll enter the weekend.

Taking to X handles, movie buffs shared the review of Maa. A user commented, “Kajol's Maa combines myth and horror seamlessly! Her stellar performance elevates a predictable plot enhanced by impressive VFX. A must-watch for fans of horror within the Shaitaan universe. 3.5/5 #Maai #Kajol #BollywoodHorror.”

Another wrote, “#MaaReview Kajol shines in a mythological horror that balances emotion and eerie visuals. Though the first half drags, the emotional climax leaves an impact. A bold attempt with outstanding performances, especially Kajol's. Watch it for the mother's roar. #maareview #Kajol.”

A user called it a combination of Maddock Horror Universe and Triptii Dimri's Bulbbul.

Another called the first half slow, but praised the climax as it was impactful. ""Kajol stuns in a mythological horror that blends emotion with eerie visuals. The first half is slow, but the emotional climax hits hard. A unique attempt with strong performances, especially from Kajol. Watch it for the mother's roar.""

The film is part of the Shaitaan universe. The plot follows a mother, portrayed by Kajol, who sets out on a road trip with her daughter but soon encounters eerie supernatural forces tied to a cursed tree and a dark legend. The story draws inspiration from the mythological tale of Goddess Kali and the demon Raktabija. Apart from Kajol, the movie also stars Ronit Roy, Indraneil Sengupta, and Kherin Sharma.

This is unbelievable. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I don't know about you, but when I think about Mariska Hargitay, I immediately think about Law & Order: SVU. Since 1999, she has been playing Detective Olivia Benson, and now, 574 episodes later, the show is still going strong with its 27th season slated to premiere this fall on the 2025 TV schedule. Now, the actress has shared a “fun story” about a psychic predicting that she'd get famous for playing a character just like Benson, and my mind is blown.

While stars come and go from SVU, Hargitay has been there and stayed there since day one. However, before landing the gig, she never thought she'd be famous for a very serious legal procedural. That all changed, though, when her friend made her see a Long Island psychic. Telling the full story on Call Her Daddy, the actress said:

I'll tell you a fun story. So, I used to go to New York twice a year. I was 34, and I come to New York, and a friend of mine said, ‘Oh my gosh, Mariska, you have to go to this psychic on Long Island.' I didn't even know where Long Island was. So, I drive out to this guy's house on Long Island. He gives me a psychic reading. 

While she went along for the ride, Hargitay wasn't having it. She has famous parents – her mom is Jayne Mansfield – and she figured the psychic could easily look her up. However, when they started talking, the psychic said something that wound up being very true, he said:

He goes – I swear to god – he says ‘You see that face?' – I have this on recording – ‘You see that face right now?' I said, ‘Yeah?' He goes, ‘You're gonna be famous for that face, that face, that serious face.' 

In the video, which you can see below, Hargitay makes a serious expression, and that's the fact the psychic was referring to. Well, considering you know where this story is going, it's easy to draw the parallels between this prediction and her eventual role on SVU.

Never give up daddy gang! 👀

However, hindsight is 20/20, and in the moment, she didn't believe it.

The actress wanted to be in the world of comedy, and she lived in Los Angeles, with no plans of moving. However, this psychic was convinced she'd star in a drama based in New York, as she said:

And I said, ‘Uh, no. I'm funny and I'm pretty, deadly combination, I'm going to be a comedian,' I say. And he says – this is my favorite thing anyone has ever said to me – he goes, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you think. You're gonna be famous for that face.' And then he says to me, ‘You're moving to New York.' 

Well, that all proved to be true, obviously, but the real kicker is how fast it came true. After telling this wild tale, the woman behind Olivia Benson revealed that she auditioned for SVU alongside Christopher Meloni and booked the gig not that long after this run-in with the Long Island psychic:

Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News

I swear to God, six months later, I got SVU. I swear, this is true on my children, this happened. 

Peacock TV: from $7.99 a month/$79.99 a yearFor all the Law & Order your heart desires, go to Peacock. You can get access to the shows airing on NBC, the old favorites, and Peacock originals all in one place for as little as $7.99 per month. 

Well, that's absolutely bananas, and now, nearly 30 years later, we can look back on this and relish in how right this guy was. I wonder if he had correct predictions about the various actors who appeared on L&O who went on to have big careers? I bet he'd guess right if he did based on this.

Now, this psychic can say “I told you so,” and Hargitay will continue to play the beloved and very serious Detective Olivia Benson on SVU. Meanwhile, you can stream the Law & Order show alongside the other projects in the franchise with a Peacock subscription while we wait for the new season.

What Is a Free Psychic Reading?

A free psychic reading is a short, no-cost session where you receive guidance and insight from someone using intuitive abilities or spiritual tools. These readings aim to provide answers, direction, and emotional clarity. Many people turn to a free psychic reading to explore love, life decisions, timing, or confusing situations that feel unresolved.

A reader might use tarot cards, astrology, energy sensing, or other methods to interpret your circumstances. Some rely on impressions and intuition, while others may ask for your birth information to begin. Although the approach varies, the goal is the same: to help you better understand what is happening in your life and what steps may come next.

Why People Try Free Psychic Readings

Many people choose a free psychic reading online when they need answers but prefer not to pay before knowing whether the service feels right. These quick sessions often address emotional worries, relationship concerns, or important decisions. For some, it's a comforting way to feel seen and understood; for others, it helps make sense of recent events or transitions.

Often, first-time visitors will ask a free psychic question before committing to a longer session. This helps them see how the reader responds and if the insight feels relevant. Sometimes, just one free psychic question can shift the way someone views their situation.

What to Expect from a Free Session

Most platforms that offer free psychic readings provide a few complimentary minutes with a reader through chat or by phone. During that window, you can share a personal question or explain a concern. Some people prefer open-ended guidance, while others go straight to direct questions like, “Will I hear from this person again?” or “What is blocking me right now?”

A free psychic reading might include a free psychic love reading, a quick energy scan, or even an interpretation based on your birth details. In some cases, you may receive a free psychic reading by date of birth and time, which allows the reader to pick up on timing patterns, compatibility, or important life milestones.

Recognizing Real Psychics vs. Scams

As free psychic reading online services grow, it becomes easier to connect with genuine intuitive advisors. However, it also brings the risk of running into fake psychics who use scripted messages or high-pressure tactics. To get the most from a free psychic reading, it's important to spot a real connection and avoid misleading offers.

What Real Psychics Do in a Free Session

A genuine free psychic will focus directly on your question and build the session around your personal energy and details. Whether they use tarot, birth data, or energy reading, the session should feel specific and relevant. Real psychics will not force topics or dodge your question. If you request a free psychic love reading, they will stay focused on that subject and provide clear, compassionate insights.

Authentic readers might ask for your name or birth details, especially if they are providing a free psychic reading by date of birth and time. They will also check if you have a topic you wish to explore, showing their commitment to making the session meaningful.

Importantly, trustworthy psychics will never try to scare you or push you into buying more time. A free psychic reading should be about clarity, not fear.

Red Flags That Signal a Scam

Some clues can help you spot fake psychics. Watch for vague answers that could apply to anyone, repetitive or scripted messages, and strong pressure to pay for more time. If a psychic uses fear-based language — like “I sense a curse” or “Only I can fix this” — it's time to leave.

Another major warning sign is if a site asks for payment or credit card details before letting you ask a free psychic question. Legitimate platforms offering free psychic reading online chat no credit card will never demand billing details to begin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Wren Baker Opens Up About Darian DeVries' Departure, Conspiracy Theories","https://www.si.com/college/westvirginia/basketball/wren-baker-opens-up-about-darian-devries-departure-conspiracy-theories","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 10:20:25 GMT","

The moment Darian DeVries took the Indiana job, many around West Virginia began to speculate on his decision to leave WVU after just one year at the helm. 

Is this something he had in mind from the jump? Did he talk to Indiana during the Battle 4 Atlantis early in the year? What about the injury to his son, Tucker, that forced him to miss the majority of the season? Did he sit out to retain a year of eligibility?

Only a select few people know the answers to most or all of those questions, and WVU athletic director Wren Baker is one of them. While Baker has commented on DeVries' departure in the past, he never really dove deep into it, mainly because he was conducting a coaching search and eventually introducing DeVries' replacement, Ross Hodge. He's been a busy guy.

On Thursday, Baker appeared on the Big 12 Today podcast and was asked directly about DeVries' departure, and how the narrative was that it felt like he was out the door during the season.

“I think the first thing I would say is one, Coach DeVries did a really good job coaching the basketball team this year. Deserves credit for that. We should have been in the NCAA Tournament, still don't know how that didn't happen. But there were multiple other schools who had reached out to Darian because there were several jobs that were open before the season closed. I know factually that he declined to talk to those schools. The only one that I'm aware of that he entertained at all was Indiana.

""In situations like this, people will conjure up a lot of this happened and that happened. I probably have more knowledge of the facts because I was inside. Whether it was Tucker's injury or there's all kinds of crazy things that are out there. I believe that for whatever reason, he felt like Indiana was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it was one of the few he would probably leave for, and it just happened to open at the wrong time. I was disappointed. I think you look at the recent history, this job has performed as well or better than Indiana. 

""Felt like we were set up and building something special here, but ultimately, I think there's two things that you walk away from. One, there are certain things that are in your control, and certain things that aren't. It was not my decision to make. It was his, and I have to respect that. There's nothing I can do to change it. 

""I think the other thing that I would say is you can go down these rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, but what good does that do? I know what he articulated to me throughout the season. I know the facts of what I do know, and life is short. I got two young daughters. I've got lots of things going on. I'd rather probably not spend my time trying to speculate on conspiracy theories because the outcome of that, no matter what, would not be favorable anyway.”

Baker also mentioned that everything happens for a reason. 

""I think Coach Hodge was the right coach at the right time and has come in here and truly opened his heart to West Virginians and is quickly acclimating and getting to know people and becoming a part of the culture.""

Gabriel Shemirani blames his influencer mother's belief in conspiracy theories about medicine for his sister's death from cancer, after she rejected chemotherapy.

""She was being fed fake information,"" the 24-year-old British student told AFP, saying their mother ""was against her daughter seeking medical treatments that could have saved her"".

Gabriel's mother, Kate Shemirani, is one of a growing cohort of health influencers on social media accused of advocating and selling unproven treatments. 

She promotes alternative theories about Covid, vaccines and organ transplants, and has called chemotherapy ""the poison path"" and ""mustard gas"".

Gabriel's twin sister, Paloma fell ill in 2023 aged 22, shortly after graduating from university, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, a type of cancer which is in most cases ""very treatable"" according to the UK's National Health Service.

But Gabriel told AFP his sister opted not to start chemotherapy treatment advised by an oncologist, influenced by her mother's distrust of conventional medicine. ""85 percent of people with my sister's cancer... would have survived"" with chemotherapy, said Gabriel.

Paloma died one year later at 23 after opting for a controversial treatment called ""Gerson therapy"", involving vegetable juices and coffee enemas.

Kate often talks about surviving breast cancer by doing this, although she underwent surgery as well.According to Cancer Research UK, there is ""no scientific evidence"" for Gerson therapy as a cancer treatment.

Australian ""wellness"" influencer Jess Ainscough died from cancer in 2015 after trying the therapy.

Gabriel and his older brother Sebastian took legal action in Paloma's last months to get her medical care assessed, and asked social services and police to intervene. 

Kate did not respond to AFP's request for comment.

She released a statement on X saying Paloma was ""never coerced"" and presented a written statement signed by her daughter in April 2024. ""I have suffered no abuse from my mum,"" Paloma wrote, describing her cancer diagnosis as not definitive.

Paloma said she questioned medics about survival rates on her mother's advice, before discharging herself from the oncologist and moving in with Kate.

Paloma said she was ""delighted with her chosen treatment plan"". But she died in July 2024 after suffering a heart attack at home.

Kate blames her death on ""a chain of gross medical failings, breaches of consent law, falsified medical records, and reckless emergency drug use"".

The brothers are awaiting an inquest on July 28, and hope a police investigation will follow.

Many wellness influencers like Kate, who calls herself a ""natural nurse"", are accused of touting unproven treatments that are promoted by algorithms to ill people. 

A US study in 2023 found 70 percent of cancer patients questioned had seen cancer misinformation on social media.

Kate was struck off as a NHS nurse after her speeches at anti-vaccine rallies made her a public figure during the Covid lockdown. 

""My mum's a national conspiracy theorist who called for doctors and nurses to be hung,"" said Gabriel.

The student at London School of Economics says he grew up hearing conspiracy theories from his parents and once believed ""the royal family were all lizards"".

Paloma shared some of these beliefs, such as rejecting the Covid jab, her friends told the BBC, who first covered the story. 

Gabriel is estranged from his mother, who he said ""needs to feel important. And for her, conspiracy theories allow her to do that, to feel like this Messianic figure"".

Suspended from Twitter in 2022 over her Covid statements, Kate was reinstated on X in 2023 and has over 81,000 followers. She also has 28,000 followers on Facebook and 21,000 on Instagram.

Her website offers paid consultations and sells apricot seeds and vitamins.

While these figures ""aren't actually huge"", she is ""definitely a prominent figure,"" said Stephanie Alice Baker, a sociologist researching health and wellness misinformation at City St George's, University of London.

Gabriel is urging tighter social media controls on those making such unproven health claims. ""You shouldn't be able to make medical claims against (scientific) consensus, and there should be a third party body that social medias have to be accountable to with medical claims,"" he said.

Baker said she had seen a surge in content creators ""selling unregulated products like soursop tea, apricot kernels and horse and dog dewormer"". ""This is something I feel very concerned about, and I think needs to be seriously regulated, both from social media companies, but also in terms of government regulation.""

GOP Tax Bill:

President Donald Trump said that his self-imposed July 4 goal to pass his tax bill isn't an absolute deadline, remarks that give Republican negotiators additional breathing room as lawmakers remain at loggerheads over several issues in the massive economic package.

“It's important, it's not the end-all,” Trump told reporters on Friday about the Independence Day deadline. “It can go longer, but we'd like to get it done by that time if possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Follow:


            The Supreme Court punted on Friday in a major legal challenge to Louisiana's long-litigated congressional map, taking the unusual step of holding the case over for a second term.
    


            The decision means the sprawling district that added a second Black and Democratic lawmaker to the state's overwhelmingly Republican delegation will remain in place, at least for the time being. The court said it will hear another set of arguments about the questions raised in the case in the term that begins this fall.
    


            Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, dissented from the decision to hold the appeal over until next term.
    


            Louisiana filed the appeal, arguing that it was caught in an impossible position: At first, a federal court ruled that the state had likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority Black district out of six.
    


            When the state sought to comply with that decision by drawing a second majority Black district, a group of self-described “non-Black voters” sued, alleging the state violated the Constitution by relying too much on race to meet the first court's demands.
    


            “Congress requires this court to exercise jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to congressional redistricting, and we accordingly have an obligation to resolve such challenges promptly,” Thomas wrote in his dissent.
    


            Thomas wrote that he would have held that the provision of the Voting Rights Act at issue in the case is unconstitutional.

            The Voting Rights Act requires that states not dilute the power of minority voters during the once-a-decade redistricting process, such as by “packing” those voters into one district or “cracking” neighborhoods of color up into many districts to spread out their influence. The law was enacted in response to decades of post-Civil War efforts – particularly in the South – to limit the political power of African Americans.
    


            And yet the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause demands that a state not draw a map predominantly based on race. If it does, it must demonstrate that it had a compelling reason to do so and carried out the effort in the narrowest way possible.
    


            Because of that inherent tension between the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause, the Supreme Court has tended to give states some “breathing room” in drawing their maps. One of the central questions in the case, Louisiana v. Callais, was exactly how much room state lawmakers should have.
    


            The high court's conservative majority has grown increasingly skeptical of policies of any kind that, in the court's words, pick “winners and losers” based on race. In the most notable example, a six-justice majority ended affirmative action in college admissions in 2023 – a decision the Trump administration has used to justify attempts to curb diversity, equity and inclusion programs in both the government and private sector.

            The Supreme Court has also in recent years chipped away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, including with a 2013 decision that ended the practice of requiring states with a history of racist policies to preclear changes to their voting rights laws with the Justice Department.
    


            But in a surprise decision a decade later, the high court went in the other direction, bolstering a key provision of the law by ordering Alabama to redraw its map to allow for an additional Black-majority district. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, penned the opinion for a 5-4 majority, siding with the court's three liberals. Another conservative, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, agreed with the key parts of the decision.
    


            Part of what was at issue in the Louisiana case is whether race “predominated” the redistricting process. The plaintiffs said Louisiana lawmakers were entirely focused on race in the redrawing. State officials have said that, while they were responding to the first court's order about a second Black district, they also were focused mainly on politics – specifically a desire to draw the boundaries in a way that would retain incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    


            The Louisiana district the state drew slashes diagonally for some 250 miles from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of voters – up from about 24% under the old lines. During oral arguments in March, Roberts described it as a “snake that runs from one end of the state to the other.”
    


            Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat, won the seat in last year's election – adding a second Democrat to the state's delegation.
    


            The Biden administration submitted a brief to the Supreme Court that technically supported neither party but urged the justices to reverse a special three-judge district court that would throw out the current map. Days after taking office, the Trump administration submitted a letter declaring that it had “reconsidered the government's position” and that the earlier brief “no longer represents the position of the United States.”

VILNIUS, June 27. /TASS/. Estonia is ready to host military aircraft with the capability to carry nuclear warheads from their NATO allies, Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told the Postimees newspaper.

According to the top defense official, F-35 fighter jets, those equipped to carry tactical nuclear bombs, have been stationed in Estonia in the past and will soon guard the country's airspace again. ""Regardless of their country of origin, if some [of these planes] have the capability to carry dual-use nuclear weapons, this does not affect our position on accepting F-35 jets in any way. Of course, we are ready to accommodate our allies,"" he added.

On June 9, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced at a conference in the UK that alliance countries intend to order 700 F-35 jets from the US within the next four years.

President accuses Canada of ‘direct and blatant attack' over plans to tax US technology companies

Trump has accused Canada of a “direct and blatant attack” on the US after being informed that the country plans to tax US technology companies. Trump says the US will be “terminating all discussions on trade with Canada” as a result.

Trump wrote on Truth Social:

“We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country.

They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.”

As well as abruptly cutting off trade talks with Canada over its new tax that will impact US technology firms, Trump said that he would set a new tariff rate on Canadian goods within the next week.

“We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,” he wrote on Truth Social.

The move plunges US relations with its second-largest trading partner back into chaos after a period of relative calm – only last week Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said he had agreed with Trump that their two nations should try to wrap up a new economic and security deal within 30 days.

Canada is the US's second-largest trading partner after Mexico, buying $349.4bn of US goods last year and exporting $412.7bn to the US, according to US Census Bureau data.

In Trump's surprise announcement that he was terminating trade talks with Canada, he accused Ottawa of “copying the European Union” with an “egregious” digital services tax on US tech firms.

He wrote on Truth Social: “They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.”

We've yet to hear Canadian PM Mark Carney's reaction to Trump's outburst, which imperils a trading relationship that, according to the office of the US trade representative, totalled about $762bn last year.

The tax, which will take effect on 30 June and be applied retroactively from 2022, will impact both domestic and international companies, meaning American giants Amazon, Google, Meta, Airbnb and Uber will have to start payments from Monday.

Last week Ottawa refused to delay the tax in the face of mounting pressure and opposition from the Trump administration during trade negotiations.

At the press conference earlier, Donald Trump sharply criticized Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, dropped plans to lift sanctions on Iran and said he would consider bombing Iran again if Tehran is enriching uranium to worrisome levels.

Trump reacted sternly to Khamenei's first remarks after a 12-day conflict with Israel that ended when the US launched strikes last weekend against Iranian nuclear sites.

Khamenei said Iran “slapped America in the face” by launching a – largely symbolic and forewarned – attack against a major US base in Qatar following last weekend's US bombing raid. He also said Iran would never surrender.

Trump said he had spared Khamenei's life. US officials told Reuters on 15 June that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to kill the supreme leader. In a Truth Social post, he said:

His Country was decimated, his three evil Nuclear Sites were OBLITERATED, and I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life. I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH.

Trump also said that in recent days he had been working on the possible removal of sanctions on Iran to give it a chance for a speedy recovery. He told reporters today he has now abandoned that effort.

I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred, and disgust, and immediately dropped all work on sanction relief, and more.

Trump said he did not rule out attacking Iran again. When asked about the possibility of new bombing of Iranian nuclear sites if deemed necessary at some point, he replied:

Sure, without question, absolutely.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan spoke at the end of the morning session at the Faith & Freedom Conference in Washington DC to applause and a standing ovation as he called for the prosecution of anyone who impeded his immigration enforcement, including lawmakers.

Homan opened up by describing immigration enforcement as a moral duty – meant to stop the deaths, sexual assault and drug trafficking at the border. “In my 40 years I've seen a lot of terrible things,” he said. “Secure the border, save lives.”

In a wide ranging, off the cuff speech, Homan touted his deportation figures and the lack of crossings at the border while defending Ice raids against non-criminals. “They're in the country illegally so they're on the table too,” he said. He attributed some of those arrests to sanctuary cities, where he said the lack of ability to arrest undocumented people in jail led to the increase of collateral arrests when Ice searched for them on the streets.

Homan poked at protests, calling the Los Angeles protests misguided and misinformed and applauding Trump's decision to deploy the national guard. He also called the protestors in his lake house town “morons” – those protests were followed by Ice releasing a family.

Homan spent a good amount of his speech denouncing Biden's policies and calling for the prosecution of anyone, including lawmakers who attempted to intervene with Ice enforcement. He said Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of the Department of Homeland Security under Joe Biden, should “go to jail”.

You can hate Ice, you can hate me, I don't give a shit. You can not agree with our priorities, but you better not cross that line.

At the en,d Homan turned to his personal relationship with Trump, saying he respected the president as much as he does his own father.

Lawyers for Kilmar Ábrego García have asked the judge to keep him in jail over deportation concerns. Prosecutors have agreed with a request by Ábrego García's lawyers to delay his Tennessee jail release.

Ábrego García's lawyers asked a judge for the delay Friday because of “contradictory statements” by the Trump administration over whether he'll be deported upon release. A judge in Nashville has been preparing to release Ábrego García to await trial on human smuggling charges. The judge has been holding off over concerns immigration officials would try to deport him.

The justice department says it intends to try Ábrego García on the smuggling charges. A justice department attorney said earlier there were plans to deport him but didn't say when. The Maryland construction worker previously was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

US representative Nydia Velázquez from New York called the supreme court ruling that individual district court judges lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions “an attack on the very foundation of our nation”. She wrote on X:

“The Supreme Court just opened the door for Trump's assault on birthright citizenship. As Justice Sotomayor warned in her dissent, ‘No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.' This ruling is an attack on the very foundation of our nation.”

Representative Mark Takano of California expressed similar alarm. He wrote on X:

“Today's troubling ruling by the Supreme Court means that Trump's un-Constitutional executive order denying many Americans their birthright citizenship will go into effect for anyone without the means to file a lawsuit to protect themselves.”

Trump has accused Canada of a “direct and blatant attack” on the US after being informed that the country plans to tax US technology companies. Trump says the US will be “terminating all discussions on trade with Canada” as a result.

Environmental groups have filed a federal lawsuit to block the “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention center being built on an airstrip in the heart of the Florida Everglades.

The lawsuit, filed Friday on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades organization, seeks to halt the project until it undergoes a stringent environmental review as required by federal law. The lawsuit filed in Miami federal court says there is also supposed to be an opportunity for public comment.

Florida governor Ron DeSantis said Friday on Fox and Friends that the detention center is set to begin processing people who entered the US illegally as soon as next week.

The Trump administration is moving to terminate Temporary Protected Status for half a million Haitians, claiming that Haiti is a “safe” country to return to, despite the reality that large portions of the country have been overcome by gangs and civil governance has collapsed.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that conditions in Haiti have improved, and Haitians no longer meet the conditions for Temporary Protected Status, which grants deportation protections and work permits to people from countries experiencing turmoil.

“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.”

The supreme court, in a 6-3 ruling, appears to have delivered Trump a major victory by ruling that individual district court judges lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions, which Trump has complained have blocked federal government policies nationwide including his executive order purporting to end the right to automatic birthright citizenship.

Speaking from the bench, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the supreme court's majority decision “a travesty for the rule of law”, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered a scathing dissent.

Trump called the supreme court's decision “a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions interfering with the normal functions of the executive branch”.

Trump said his administration “can now promptly file to proceed” with policies that had been enjoined nationwide. One of these cases would be ending birthright citizenship, he says, “which now comes to the fore”.

In a press briefing US attorney general Pam Bondi was asked whether the administration is going to try to implement Trump's order banning birthright citizenship in states where there isn't a legal challenge. Bondi said the birthright citizenship question will “most likely” be decided by the supreme court in October but that Friday's ruling still “indirectly impacts every case in this country”, adding that the administration is “thrilled” about this.

Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo reportedly plans to run as an independent candidate in New York City's mayoral race, days after finding himself bested in the Democratic primary by progressive insurgent candidate Zohran Mamdani.

The Trump administration is planning to deport Kilmar Ábrego García for a second time, but reportedly does not plan to send him back to El Salvador, where he was wrongly deported in March.

Trump reiterated that Tehran wants to meet following US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities last weekend, but gave no further details.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Around 150 pro-Palestinian activists have broken into a storage facility and damaged military equipment intended for Ukraine, the Belgian news outlet 7sur7 reported on June 26.

The facility belongs to OIP Land Systems, a company that produces military equipment for Ukraine. The activists reportedly thought the equipment would be supplied to Israel.

The activists, who were wearing white overalls and masks, took part in the Stop Arming Israel campaign. The protests seek to pressure Belgian authorities to maintain the military embargo against Israel and impose sanctions on it.

The protesters, armed with hammers and grinders, first entered the company's offices, where they smashed computers, and then broke into the hangars, where they severely damaged some vehicles, Freddy Versluys, CEO of OIP Land Systems, said.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, the company has supplied the Ukrainian army with about 260 armored vehicles. The damage caused by the activists' actions is estimated at $1.1 million, according to 7sur7.

""A further delivery has now been delayed by at least a month. That's all these Hamas sympathizers will have achieved with their action,"" Versluys said.

The company was reportedly targeted by pro-Palestinian protesters because Elbit Systems, an Israeli defense company, owns it.

Protesters believe that Elbit supplies 85% of the drones and most of the ground military equipment used by the Israel Defense Forces, 7sur7 reported.

Yet, the OIP Land Systems CEO claimed that his company has not produced defense systems for Israel for over 20 years.

OIP Land Systems has provided defense products to Ukraine on several occasions, including Leopard 1 tanks, which are manufactured at the Tournai plant.

Ukrainian manufacturers will supply four million drones to the front line this year, while the Ukrainian army has already received up to 1.5 million drones as of the end of June, according to Umerov.

According to preliminary data, two Russian fighter jets were destroyed, and the other two were damaged. 

Unlike Ukraine-skeptic Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Slovakia has not previously attempted to block EU sanctions.

Governor Serhii Lysak said most of the injured were hospitalized. 





Active fighting is still taking place around the village of Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, home to one of Ukraine's largest lithium deposits, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces told the Kyiv Independent on June 27, denying reports Russia had occupied the village.

The activists reportedly thought the equipment would be supplied to Israel.

Sharay Hayes is six feet two, rippling with muscles and nicknamed “The Punisher”.

In 2015, working as an exotic dancer at the top of his game, he was described by the New York Post as giving Channing Tatum “a run for his money”.

The Punisher, whose Instagram profile is all abs, leather and chains, partied with some of America's most beautiful women, hunkiest men and biggest stars.

He never thought that his glamorous lifestyle would lead him to a courtroom, in which jurors would be shown footage of him having sex with the R&B singer Cassie Ventura during the blockbuster sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.

Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He denies all charges.

He is accused of intimidating women, including Ventura, into participating in “freak-offs”.

The parties were days-long, drug-fuelled orgies with male escorts, in which participants rubbed baby oil on each other and had sex as Combs watched.

On Friday, lawyers for the mogul will give their closing arguments, after the prosecution on Thursday told the court Combs was the “leader of a criminal enterprise”, who “doesn't take no for an answer”.

The jury will then decide the rapper's fate.

For Mr Hayes, his first entanglement with the music mogul and performer “Diddy” began on the evening of Oct 14, 2012.

That night, he received a call from a woman named “Janet”, asking for a male dancer to entertain her and some friends, he told The Telegraph.

He packed up and travelled to the Trump International Hotel in midtown Manhattan for the 3am booking.

But when a “stunning woman” with an “inviting smile” greeted him at the door of the suite in nothing but a bathrobe, he soon realised he was walking into an entirely different scenario.

“She immediately explained to me that she was not looking for a dance performance, that she wanted to set up this sexy scene where we would sit on couches adjacent from each other and put baby oil on in a sexy manner, and at some point her husband would come out and watch,” he said.

She handed him $800 in cash – four times the fee he had quoted for a dance – and he agreed, he said.

Mr Hayes has since said he would like to apologise to Ventura for his role in these nights, which she has said she did not want to take part in. He says he was not aware of this at the time.

Ventura was just 19 when she first met the rapper and was quickly signed to his label, Bad Boy Records. She claims that he pressured her to sleep with other men, sometimes for days at a time, and was physically, financially and psychologically abusive to her.

During the trial, the court heard testimony from the singer in which she claimed she had been pushed to her limits during the sessions, at one point blacking out and waking up in the shower, and also being forced to have sex while suffering from infections.

The court was also shown a video of the rapper beating her and dragging her by her hair in a hotel in 2016. She claimed that the CCTV clip was captured as she attempted to leave one of these sessions: “Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.”

Recounting that night in 2012, Mr Hayes, 51, said after agreeing to take part, he was told to go into the bathroom and take off his clothes and come out nude or in a towel.

The room was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was covered in sheets, which he now realises was to protect it from being damaged by baby oil.

“I was instructed to sit on one single chair that was kind of adjacent to a sofa, she positioned herself on the sofa, and then we began to do the baby oil... I would put it on myself, she's putting it on herself, we would put [it] on each other, and then there were sexual gestures of self pleasuring and stuff like that to try to set the mood,” he said.

Eventually Combs, who he believed was Ventura's husband, and says he did not realise at the time was the A-list musician, came out completely nude, with a niqab covering his face, and sat in a chair around 12 to 15 feet away.

“It was very strange, just the idea of understanding a partner would come in was already strange but, seeing his face completely covered it threw me off,” he said.

Combs would give them directions, Mr Hayes said, mainly based on the lighting and the positioning of their bodies, or if he wanted them to apply more baby oil.

“It was clear that this scene was based on his preference and something that he enjoyed”, he said.

The “scene” lasted around 25 to 35 minutes, when Combs left the room, Ventura followed.

Five minutes later she returned and told him it had been “perfect”, and asked him if he would like to finish, he says. He declined, and she handed him an extra $1,200.

A few months later, Ventura called him again and they carried out the same scenario with the baby oil, but this time had sex.

He would see the couple around eight to 12 times over a two-and-a-half-year period, and would be paid between $1,200 to $2,000 each time.

Each session would last for a minimum of four hours, he said, with the sexual activity lasting up to 45 minutes.

Sometimes Combs would leave the room, Ventura would follow, and then they would return and Mr Hayes would be asked to resume.

During one session, when Mr Hayes and Ventura were having intercourse on the bed, Combs “slammed” a stack of hundred dollar bills down “in approval”.

“[Ventura] kind of looked at him... to gauge was he okay or whatever, and he just says, ‘I'm fine. I like that s---, I'm enjoying this s---.'”

Mr Hayes said he never saw Combs being aggressive towards Ventura, and she did not appear as though she was being forced to take part in the sexual acts.

There were moments she appeared “frustrated” and would sigh, but he said these were in response to Combs's directions, which could be as specific as telling her to move a candle slightly to the left.

Mr Hayes said he did not discover who the celebrity couple were until around 15 months after their first encounter, when he saw a sign on the television at JW Marriott Essex House saying: “Welcome Mr Sean Combs.”

His final encounter with the couple took place in 2015 after an extended break. Mr Hayes explained he felt uncomfortable and was unable to perform sexually, and they did not call again.

He has since written a self-help book on erectile dysfunction called In Search of Freezer Meat, which included an anonymised passage about the couple.

Mr Hayes said he did not feel used, but felt “special” that this high-profile couple had chosen him.

“Now in hindsight, I know I was one of many and it kind of killed that, burst that bubble, but in the moment I thought it was something to be honoured to be a part of”, he said.

Testifying in court last month was a nerve-wracking experience, Mr Hayes said, adding that he was physically shaking when he took the stand.

He avoided eye contact with Combs until the end of his testimony, when they nodded at each other as he left the courtroom.

Initially, Mr Hayes was confused why he had been called to testify, as he did not witness physical abuse and did not travel across state lines for these encounters.

As part of his sex trafficking charge, Combs is accused of transporting male escorts across state lines to engage in the “freak-offs”.

But his role in the case appeared to become more apparent when the jury was played videos of “freak-offs”, which included one recorded the night Mr Hayes first met Combs and Ventura.

“I had no idea anything was possibly filmed, so it's a surprise to me to know that there is video footage”, he says, adding: “It creates a degree of worry.”","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

The Democrat's rant has sparked calls for her to resign over her bigoted language.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (New York) went on an Islamophobic rant against New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a radio interview on Thursday, spewing lies about Mamdani and suggesting that he would represent a threat to public safety if elected.

In an appearance on WYNC's “Brian Lehrer Show,” the senator repeated numerous lies about Mamdani, echoing oft-repeated bigoted statements made about Palestinians and the pro-Palestine movement.

During the segment, kicked off by a call-in question by a listener, Gillibrand said that Mamdani, who is Muslim, is dangerous and supports violence, citing his refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada” and equating the words “intifada” and “jihad” to fear monger about them.

Her statements were completely removed from reality, and clearly informed by some of the worst hatred spread against Arabs, Muslims, and Palestinians in particular over the past decades. For instance, Gillibrand said that just the phrase “global intifada” — with “intifada” meaning “uprising” or “rebellion” in Arabic — is “violent and destructive.”

“It doesn't matter what meaning you have in your brain, it is now how the word is received. When you use a word like intifada, to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that means you are permissive for violence against Jews,” Gillibrand said. Her statements ignored the many times that Mamdani has denounced antisemitic violence — instead suggesting that Mamdani made an explicit call for violence when he did not.

“I would be very specific in these words, and I would say you may not use them again if you expect to represent everyone, ever again, because they are received as hateful and divisive,” she said, discounting the many Arabic speakers for whom the word simply means “uprising.”

Gillibrand was referring to recent comments made by Mamdani after he was asked to denounce the phrase “globalize the intifada.” Mamdani, who has been active in the movement for Palestinian rights, said that the phrase speaks to Palestinians' desire for equal rights. He pointed out that the word has been politicized to incite violence against Palestinians, even though the word “intifada” was used by the Holocaust Museum in its Arabic translation for the Warsaw Uprising.

Gillibrand steamrolled over Lehrer's attempts to correct her and rein her rant back in — even as she admitted that Mamdani has assured her that he will work to protect all New Yorkers, including Jewish people. 

“I just feel compelled to say, we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or has supported violent jihad, as the caller was asserting,” Lehrer said. Later, he also chimed in, saying, “I think we also clarify, or he was clarifying that he never said ‘globalize the intifada.' He was asked in an interview if he would denounce the phrase.”

But Gillibrand refused to back down. “He should denounce it. And that's it. Period. And you can't celebrate it, you can't value it, you can't lift it up,” she said, going on to reference the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack. 

“When you hear things like intifada, when you hear things like jihad, when you hear ‘from the river to the sea,' it is received as ‘slaughter the Jews and destroy Israel,' period,” she said, suggesting that the mere use of two Arabic words is violent.

Never once did she acknowledge the Muslim and Arab communities that she represents as senator of New York, who may feel alarmed by her blatant Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian bigotry. Directly following her comments, the conversation shifted to President Donald Trump's strikes on Iran, which Gillibrand criticized for being unauthorized by Congress but praised for their supposed strength.

Many commentators noted the shocking nature of Gillibrand's bigotry, with some calling for her to resign.

“I think she should resign for falsely smearing [Zohran Mamdani] as a terrorist,” said Zeteo Editor-in-Chief Mehdi Hasan. “He has never invoked a ‘global jihad'. This is a nasty, Islamophobic racist smear from a sitting Dem senator.”

After a recording of the interview spread widely on X, Gillibrand's communications director claimed in a post that the senator “misspoke.” “She also highlighted that Mr. Mamdani assured her that, if elected, he would protect Jews and all residents of NYC,” her spokesperson said.

But Gillibrand delivered her rant with confidence, without stuttering or hesitation, and went on for nearly six minutes. While she did offer scant acknowledgement of Mamdani's commitment to equal rights for all, those comments were nestled in between other parts of her rant.

Gillibrand joins a large chorus of those on the right who spewed Islamophobia after Mamdani's landmark win on Tuesday, inciting violence against the Muslim politician.

This bigotry has been taken to an extreme by some Republicans, with one, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tennessee), calling Mamdani a bigoted nickname while calling on him to be denaturalized and deported on Wednesday. Ogles, in a letter to the Trump administration, also fear mongers about the phrase “globalize the intifada,” similarly likening it to a call for “terrorism.”

            The Treasury Department and Congress on Thursday moved to kill a so-called revenge tax that was set to raise taxes on foreign investment and had spooked Wall Street and global business leaders.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday announced a deal with G7 partners that will exclude US companies from some global taxes in exchange for the US dropping Section 899 from Republican's “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
    


            Bessent said in a post on X that he would ask Congress to remove Section 899 from the budget bill. Senator Mike Crapo and Rep. Jason Smith, who co-chair the joint committee on taxation, said in a statement Thursday that following Bessent's request, they would remove Section 899 from the bill.
    


            Section 899 was a tax code tucked in to President Donald Trump's budget bill that would have raised taxes on the income earned from US assets held by individuals or businesses in other countries with taxes the US perceived as unfair for American businesses.
    


            The provision would “facilitate penalty taxes on foreign companies operating in the US if their home country is deemed to have a ‘discriminatory' tax system,” analysts at Citi said in a note.
    


            The tax code was considered a “revenge” tax because it was designed to retaliate against a global tax framework agreed upon in 2021 by the Biden administration and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer.
    


            Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had negotiated a tax agreement with other OECD countries that included setting a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Republicans had opposed the agreement and thought it was unfair, arguing it ceded authority on taxation, Luscombe said.
    


            The “revenge tax” also was set to retaliate against digital services taxes, or taxes on US tech companies that provide services to users in other countries. Digital services taxes were perceived as “discriminatory” by the Trump administration, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
    


            Trump had previously signed an executive order on his first day in office announcing that tax deals agreed upon between the Biden administration and the OECD were null. Bessent's announcement leaves room for how the United States and other countries might negotiate on taxes.
    


            “The Trump Administration remains vigilant against all discriminatory and extraterritorial foreign taxes applied against Americans,” Bessent said in his post on X. “We will defend our tax sovereignty and resist efforts to create an unlevel playing field for our citizens and companies.”
    


            The so-called revenge tax, which had stirred debates on Wall Street and law firms across the Atlantic, is moot before it even went into effect.
    


            There had been back-and-forth debates in recent weeks about the implications of Section 899 and whether it would push global investors away from the United States.
    


            The provision had sent shivers up Wall Street's spine as it appeared to be another protectionist policy that would penalize global investors who put their money in the United States.
    


            “Great concern had been expressed by Wall Street and affected stakeholders about the enactment of Section 899 and its impact on foreign investment in the United States, particularly in view of its complexity, potential scope of application and compliance obligations,” attorneys at law firm Holland & Knight said in a note. “Those concerns have been alleviated for now.”
    


            International business groups were in Wasington in recent weeks negotiating with lawmakers. Jonathan Samford, CEO of the Global Business Alliance, which opposed Section 899, told CNN the provision would have “squandered opportunity and more investment” and contributed to “further isolation.”
    


            “We're very pleased that President Trump and the administration have pursued this negotiation, and as a result, called for withdrawal of this punitive and discriminatory provision,” he said. “I commend Chairman Smith and Chairman Crapo for focusing on making the United States the most competitive it can be.”
    


            Republicans this week had begun hinting that Section 899 might be negotiable. Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday that Section 899 might not be included in the final budget bill.
    


            “You can try to retaliate, but it's probably better to work out an agreement than just have a tax fight, just like we're having tariff fights,” Luscombe said.

Russia and Iran have resumed direct flights following a temporary flight ban imposed by Moscow due to the conflict between Israel and Iran. Flights have also been resumed between Russia and Iraq and Jordan.

Major global carriers, including Lufthansa, Emirates, and Air France-KLM, also rerouted or canceled flights to avoid the airspaces of Israel, Iran, Jordan, and Iraq. Some 650 flights were scrapped during the period of hostilities between Israel and Iran, according to Eurocontrol, a pan-European air traffic organization.

In a statement on Friday, Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said it had lifted the ban on flights over Iran, Iraq, and Jordan following a “continuous analysis” of the risks to civil aviation in the region. 

“Rosaviatsia continues to monitor the situation in the Middle East,” the agency said. “If there are any significant changes, airlines will be promptly informed.” 

The first post-ban arrival from Iran touched down at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Friday. The Mahan Air flight had departed from the northeastern city of Mashhad. A return flight left at noon.

Russian flagship carrier Aeroflot has also resumed sales of tickets to Tehran. The first flight is scheduled for July 4. The route will operate three times a week.

Israel launched a series of airstrikes on June 13 targeting Iranian military and nuclear sites, as well as senior commanders and nuclear scientists, in what it described as a mission to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The US later joined Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Iran, which denies that it is pursuing nuclear weapons, condemned what it called unprovoked attacks and retaliated by launching ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones at Israeli cities.

A US-brokered ceasefire has since come into effect and has so far held, with both sides claiming victory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","UK starting to turn away Ukrainians","https://www.rt.com/news/620659-uk-reject-ukrainian-refugee-claims/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:05:00 GMT","



The UK has begun turning down asylum claims from Ukrainians, asserting that applicants can safely relocate to other parts of Ukraine, the Guardian has reported.

A London-based legal firm told the newspaper on Friday that it receives weekly inquiries from Ukrainians whose refusal letters commonly state that they do not meet the threshold for persecution under the Refugee Convention, as applicants are deemed able to relocate to safer parts of Ukraine.

The letters also cite the availability of public services in Ukraine and suggest that seeking help from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and local organizations.

The firm noted that the growing number of refusals was linked to updates made in January to the UK Home Office's guidance, which now identifies regions such as Kiev and western Ukraine as “generally safe.”

Refugee status in the UK grants recipients five years of residency with access to work, benefits, healthcare, housing support, and family reunification.

The UK also offers temporary visas through the Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family schemes, allowing stays of up to 18 months. As of March 2025, over 270,000 visas had been issued.

A Home Office spokesperson told the Guardian that the UK has offered or extended sanctuary to over 300,000 Ukrainians since the escalation of the conflict in February 2022. The ministry emphasized that asylum claims are assessed individually and noted that the Homes for Ukraine scheme remains open.

Several million Ukrainians have fled their country over the past three years. According to Eurostat data, around 4.3 million had been granted temporary protection in the EU as of March 2025. Russia, meanwhile, reported that 5.5 million people had arrived from Ukraine by the end of 2023.

The outflow has been driven not only by the ongoing conflict but also by increasingly aggressive mobilization tactics used by the Ukrainian military. These efforts have led to violent confrontations between draft officers and those resisting conscription, with male Ukrainians risking criminal prosecution for fleeing the country.

London has committed billions in military assistance to Ukraine since 2022. Moscow has repeatedly accused the UK and its Western allies of using Ukraine as a “battering ram” against Russia and of pursuing the conflict “until the last Ukrainian.”

Lawmakers have voted to suspend family reunification rights for refugees who do not hold full asylum status. Meanwhile, as Germany faces labor shortages, figures show much of its workforce is untapped. 



Germany's parliament has just voted to put a hold on family reunifications for refugees without full asylum status—a move that's part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to tighten immigration rules.

The new law, passed Friday in the Bundestag, means refugees with what's known as ""subsidiary protection"" won't be able to bring close family members to Germany for the next two years.

In other news, a large pool of the German labor market isn't being used, according to recent data, at a time when business groups are bemoaning a lack of available staff.

Childcare shortages are cited as one reason, especially for women, while health concerns were the main issue that men listed as obstructing their path to work.

The blog is now closed, thanks for joining us. Below is a roundup of stories out of Germany on Friday, June 27:

Lars Klingbeil was re-elected as co-leader at the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) congress in Berlin, receiving 65% support, a significant decrease from the 85.6% he garnered in 2023.

A number of SPD members told DW that Klingbeil made mistakes during the election campaign, which contributed to Germany's oldest party achieving its worst-ever election result earlier this year. 

They say he has still not drawn the right conclusions and accuse him of being too power-hungry.

Klingbeil interpreted the poor result for him today as criticism of his Ukraine-friendly and Russia-critical course. 

That's not the real reason, say many SPD members. 

Was tonight an expression of frustration that needed to be vented once? Or will Germany's finance minister be busy dealing with a party whose full support he does not have for quite some time to come? 

The latter could weaken the Social Democrats' position as the Conservatives' junior partner in the German government.

German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider on Friday lamented the weak outcome of a 10-day climate conference in Bonn, Germany, designed to prepare participants for this November's UN World Climate Conference in Belem, Brazil.

Schneider said the result of 10 day event did not reflect the urgency of the global climate situation.

Some 5,000 delegates were in Bonn for talks that ended late Thursday. Schneider said he was disappointed to see that old problems, such as north/south animosity or fossil versus renewable fuel blockages, persist. 

""We can only come to grips with global warming if we work together. That's why we need to leave the old conflicts behind us,"" said the Social Democrat. Moreover, Schneider went on to urge all countries to improve their current plans for limiting global warming as outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. 

Schneider was no outlier with his assessment of the conference's meagre results. ""I don't want to sugarcoat it,"" said UN Climate Chief Simon Stiell, ""we still have a lot to do before we meet again in Belem.""

The Social Democratic Party (SPD) chairman Lars Klingbeil was re-elected at the party congress in Berlin.

Klingbeil, who is Germany's vice chancellor and finance minister, received 64.9% of the votes in Friday's poll.

Labor Minister Bärbel Bas was elected co-chair with 95%, replacing Saskia Esken.

Germany's February parliamentary elections saw the SPD relegated to third place in what was its worst showing in many decades.

Austria understands what it means to be confronted by migration pressures, said Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker at a joint press conference with his German counterpart Friedrich Merz in Berlin.

He made this statement in response to a journalist's question about migrants being turned away at the Austrian border by German authorities.

Stocker said that Austria had been protecting its borders since 2015, and that Germany's policy was not casting a shadow over their mutual relations. Merz agreed with him.

""Austria knows from experience in 2015 and 2022 what it means to be confronted by migration pressures,"" Stocker said. Needing to protect borders within the European Union was not the aim, ""but in this situation, it may be necessary,"" he added.

At the beginning of May, German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt imposed stricter controls to limit irregular migration, instructing that asylum-seekers be turned away at Germany's borders.

Germany has taken steps to block Chinese AI startup DeepSeek from the Apple and Google app stores over data protection concerns.

Meike Kamp, commissioner for the city state of Berlin's data protection authority, confirmed that DeepSeek has been reported to both US tech firms as illegal content. The companies must now assess the case and decide whether to remove the app from the German market.

""DeepSeek has not been able to provide my agency with convincing evidence that German users' data is protected in China to a level equivalent to that in the European Union,"" Kamp said.

She added that ""Chinese authorities have far-reaching access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies.""

The move follows a Reuters report this week alleging that DeepSeek is supporting China's military and intelligence operations.

DeepSeek made headlines in January with claims that its AI model could rival US systems such as ChatGPT, but at a much lower cost. The company has acknowledged that it stores personal data — including user prompts and uploaded files — on servers in China.

Vice chancellor, finance minister, co-leader of Germany's oldest party, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD): This week, Lars Klingbeil faces tough questions by his party as it kicks off its three-day party conference on Friday.

Read the full profile of German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil here.

 

A man accused of giving a Nazi salute during a party on the German island of Sylt in 2024 has accepted a penalty order from prosecutors and paid a fine.

The case relates to a party in Kampen during Pentecost 2024, where guests were filmed chanting ""Germany for the Germans, foreigners out"" to the song L'amour toujours by DJ Gigi D'Agostino.

In the video, the man is seen raising his arm in a Hitler salute and placing two fingers over his upper lip to mimic a mustache.

Prosecutors assessed the gesture as the use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations. In April 2025, they issued a penalty order, which the accused accepted without contest, the spokesperson confirmed.

According to the public prosecutor's office in Flensburg, the man accepted the charge and paid €2,500 (around $2,900) in late April, a spokesperson told Der Spiegel.

Investigations against three other partygoers have been dropped.

Following the incident, similar far-right episodes were reported elsewhere in Germany. Some event organizers have since banned the song. L'amour toujours was removed from playlists at the Munich Oktoberfest last year.

German federal prosecutors have charged a teenager with aiding in the preparation of a suspected terrorist attack targeting a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna last summer.

The Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe said the accused, a Syrian national, was in contact with an Austrian suspect who allegedly planned to carry out a bombing at the concert. 

The teenager in Germany is accused of translating a bomb-making manual from Arabic and connecting the Austrian man with a member of the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) abroad.

He also allegedly provided a template for an oath of allegiance to IS, which the Austrian suspect is believed to have used to declare his membership in the terrorist organization. 

The German Federal Prosecutor has filed charges before the state security senate of the Berlin Court of Appeal, which must now decide whether to open a trial.

Meanwhile, Austrian authorities continue to investigate the main suspect, who remains in pretrial detention.

German prosecutors are investigating possible links to Russia after six Bundeswehr trucks were set on fire in Erfurt over the weekend.

The fire broke out Saturday evening at a workshop site where the military vehicles were parked. The blog ""Besessen vom Krieg"" (""Obsessed with War"") published photos on Thursday showing the trucks before and after the blaze, as well as the same video clip. Earlier reports came from MDR and t-online.

""We are also investigating in that direction,"" a spokesperson for the Erfurt public prosecutor's office said, referring to a video that surfaced on a Russian Telegram channel. The footage appears to show the beginning of the attack. Authorities are trying to identify who may have uploaded the video.

The video includes a Russian-language message claiming a link to the war in Ukraine. It remains unclear whether the destroyed trucks were actually intended for Ukraine, as claimed in the video.

Two weeks ago, six Bundeswehr vehicles were burned in a similar attack in Soltau, Lower Saxony. 

German politicians are fond of saying, ""Work must be worth it."" But ever more people who work full-time need state benefits. And the new minimum wage hike is seen as disappointing.

Germany is set to raise its minimum wage from €12.82 per hour to €14.60 by 2027, according to a plan announced Friday by the country's Minimum Wage Commission.

The increase will come in two stages. From the start of 2026, the legal minimum hourly wage will rise to €13.90. One year later, it will increase by a further €0.70.

The commission, which includes representatives from trade unions, employers, and an independent chair, reviews the rate every two years based on overall wage trends.

Germany first introduced a statutory minimum wage in 2015 under then-Chancellor Angela Merkel. Since its launch at €8.50 per hour, it has been adjusted 10 times.

Ahead of February's federal election, the Social Democratic Party — now a junior coalition partner — had campaigned to raise the minimum wage to €15.

The German Bundestag has approved a two-year suspension of family reunification visas for certain migrants, passing the measure by a wide margin on Friday.

The bill, introduced by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), applies to relatives of people living in Germany without recognized asylum status. It was adopted with 444 votes in favor and 135 against.

The far-right AfD had announced in advance that it would support the proposal from the conservative-Social Democrat coalition.

Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has defended the proposed suspension of family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status, just ahead of a Bundestag vote.

Speaking during Friday's parliamentary debate, Dobrindt — from Bavaria's conservative CSU party — said the measure would reduce immigration by 12,000 people annually and disrupt criminal networks and smugglers' business models.

Critics of the renewed suspension point to the constitutional protection of family life and warn of negative consequences for integration. Supporters of it, meanwhile, argue that many municipalities have reached their intake limits.

Also in the Bundestag today, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is pushing to ban public funding for NGOs that it claims act as political allies of other parties. 

They argue the move about protecting state neutrality — but critics see it as a crackdown on civil society and dissent.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

            Canadian consular officials are pressing for more information from the United States government after a Canadian citizen died while in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Florida detention center this week.
    


            Johnny Noviello, a 49-year-old lawful permanent resident of the US, was being detained at the Federal Detention Center in Miami while facing deportation over a 2023 conviction for racketeering and drug trafficking, according to ICE.
    


            He was found unresponsive and pronounced dead by the Miami Fire Rescue Department Monday afternoon, according to ICE. The cause of his death is still under investigation, the agency said.
    


            “Medical staff responded immediately and began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation, automated external defibrillator shock and called 911,” ICE said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Miami Fire Rescue Department for additional information.
    


            Noviello was arrested by ICE at a probation office on May 15 and issued a notice to appear for removal proceedings, “having been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation … relating to a controlled substance,” ICE said in a news release.
    


            The arrest came amid the Trump administration's expanding deportation campaign that has spotlighted the capture of immigrants convicted of crimes.
    


            The Canadian government was notified of Noviello's death on Thursday, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs Anita Anand said in a statement. “Canadian consular officials are urgently seeking more information from US officials,” the statement said, adding further details will not be provided to respect the family's privacy.
    


Less than 10% of immigrants taken into ICE custody since October had serious criminal convictions, internal data shows



            Global Affairs Canada said consular officials are in contact with US authorities to gather more information about Noviello's death.
    


            Noviello became a lawful permanent US resident in October 24, 1991, after entering the US in January 1988 with a legal visa, ICE said.
    


            He was convicted in Volusia County, Florida, in October 2023 for racketeering, trafficking Oxycodone and Hydrocodone, and sentenced to 12 months in county jail, court records show.
    


            Noviello only served around 125 days of his sentence with credits for good behavior and time served, said Daniel Leising, an attorney who represented Noviello in the criminal case. The attorney added the last he'd heard from Noviello was in February when a judge granted him community service.
    


            ICE in its statement noted that detained migrants have access to 24-hour emergency care while in custody and said it's “committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments.”
    


            The agency has reported seven in-custody deaths in 2025 as of May 5, according to ICE's website.

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala President Bernardo Arévalo said Friday he has not signed an agreement with the United States to take asylum seekers from other countries, pushing back against comments from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Noem and Arévalo met Thursday in Guatemala and the two governments publicly signed a joint security agreement that would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to work in the capital's airport, training local agents how to screen for terrorism suspects.

But Noem said she had also been given a signed document she called a safe third country agreement. She said she reached a similar deal in Honduras and said they were important outcomes of her trip.

“Honduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,” Noem said. “We've never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn't necessarily have to be the United States.”

Asked about Noem's comments Friday during a news conference, Arévalo said that nothing new was signed related to immigration and that Guatemala was still operating under an agreement reached with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February. That agreement stipulated that Guatemala would continue accepting the deportation of its own citizens, but also citizens of other Central American nations as a transit point on their way home.

Arévalo said that when Rubio visited, safe third country was discussed because Guatemala had signed such an agreement during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term in office. But “we made it clear that our path was different,” Arévalo said.

He did add that Guatemala was willing to provide asylum to Nicaraguans who have been unable to return to their country because of the political situation there out of “solidarity.”

The president's communications office said Noem had been given the ratification of the agreement reached through diplomatic notes weeks earlier.

During Trump's first term, the U.S. signed such safe third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They effectively allowed the U.S. to declare some asylum seekers ineligible to apply for U.S. protection and permitted the U.S. government to send them to those countries deemed “safe.”

Former Naval Intelligence Officer Capt. Todd Sawhill provides analysis of the B-2 bomber strikes aimed at destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites. 

President Donald Trump is not like his predecessors. Confronting a hostile regime in Tehran that has played American presidents for 35 years, the commander in chief took decisive action on Saturday to keep his promise that he would never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Operation Midnight Hammer was a success — America's fine men and women in uniform destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities and came home safe.

Now begins ""the Art of the Deal."" In the aftermath of the war between Israel and Iran, President Trump will need to employ all his dealmaking acumen to maintain a fragile ceasefire and — most importantly — to keep his promise to prevent America from being dragged into another forever war in the Middle East.

Recent history has taught us that it won't be easy. Between the end of the Cold War and President Trump's first term, every single American president was drawn into protracted conflicts around the world. They knew how to make war, but not how to broker peace.

TRUMP EXERTED 'MAXIMUM PRESSURE' ON IRAN AND ISRAEL TO 'DELIVER PEACE': LEAVITT

In the Balkans, President Bill Clinton laid the groundwork for liberal interventionism — boots on the ground for ""peacekeeping,"" moral preening, and no plan for what comes next. Then, in the wake of the devastating attacks on 9/11, instead of confining himself to destroying the terrorists who had used Afghanistan as a base, President George W. Bush implemented this same playbook: launching an invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein while prolonging the U.S. presence in Afghanistan to nation build.

At the time, I supported it, as did more than 70% of Americans and almost 90% of Republicans. But soon, Iraq devolved into a sectarian nightmare that led to thousands of dead soldiers and decades of regional instability. The war consumed Bush's presidency, shattered GOP foreign policy credibility, and sowed the seeds for the rise of ISIS.  Meanwhile, the ""good war"" in Afghanistan went sour as dreams of a liberal democracy ran up against the reality of the ""graveyard of empires.""

America's experience in Iraq and Afghanistan transformed my view of foreign policy. So much so, that by the time President Barack Obama pursued a disastrous intervention in Libya, I was decidedly opposed to it.

BUSH'S WAR ON TERROR VS TRUMP'S IRAN APPROACH: HOW US MIDDLE EAST STRATEGY EVOLVED

Millions of conservatives, bitter at being sold a bill of goods by their own party, had this same experience. They wanted a new type of national security policy focused on their needs and interests. And when President Trump — whose longstanding opposition to the Iraq war was well known — announced his campaign in 2016, they rallied behind him.

Throughout his first term, President Trump rewarded their confidence time and again — and proved what the Art of the Deal could achieve on the world stage.

Trump was no dove, mind you.

He dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb used in combat by the United States on Afghanistan, ruthlessly decimated ISIS, and took out Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani. But he always prevented these aggressive actions from becoming protracted conflicts, and he never allowed the Middle East to absorb his attention to the detriment of more important national security priorities: securing our borders and deporting illegal immigrants, pushing our allies in NATO to pay their fair share for our common defense, and confronting America's number one adversary, China.

No doubt, the current conflict between Iran and Israel is more serious than any that occurred in the region during Trump's first administration. And the United States' involvement is more direct, more dangerous, and more likely to escalate into a wider war if not checked by firm, prudent leadership, capable of completing the President's stated mission to deny the Iranian regime a nuclear weapon without drifting into other lanes, notably regime change.

But that's entirely in President Trump's wheelhouse. This is his moment. This is why millions of Americans, disheartened by the surrender of Afghanistan and grinding war in Ukraine overseen by President Joe Biden, went to the ballot box in November to bring him back to the White House.

He is the only leader in the world who could pull off this daring operation to ensure the safety of the American people without it turning into another Middle East quagmire. And if he can now keep us out of war and focused on the various domestic challenges that confront us — from our falling birth rate to our failing schools — it will be one of the greatest accomplishments in modern American history.

I'm confident that he will.

Why? Because President Trump is not like his predecessors. He isn't driven by ideology or bought by special interest groups. He is a statesman who makes deals on behalf of the American people. And in this uncertain moment, as we are poised to celebrate America's 249th Independence Day, that's exactly what we need. For America's freedom is hard-won and easily squandered.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett dismissed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent to a new Supreme Court decision that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against the executive branch, a problem that the Trump administration has faced for months.

Jackson claimed lower courts do not have limits on their authority to issue universal injunctions, writing that the executive branch should always comply with said injunctions.

Barrett did not entertain her liberal colleague's argument.

“We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,” Barrett wrote in the 6-3 majority opinion. “We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.”

“No one disputes that the Executive has a duty to follow the law,” Barrett continued. “But the Judiciary does not have unbridled authority to enforce this obligation—in fact, sometimes the law prohibits the Judiciary from doing so.”

The Supreme Court ruled Friday that district courts exceeded their power by issuing universal injunctions against President Donald Trump's executive order to take away birthright citizenship for children of those who entered the country illegally. The court did not rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh joined Barrett in the majority opinion. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Jackson in the dissenting opinion.

SUPREME COURT LIMITS NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS IN TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE

Barrett continued critiquing Jackson's reasoning and cited the Judiciary Act of 1789, which requires judges to observe their limits on judicial authority. Barrett said Jackson “skips over that part” because the law “involves boring ‘legalese,'” as Jackson put it.

“Justice Jackson would do well to heed her own admonition: ‘Everyone, from the President on down, is bound by law,'” Barrett concluded. “That goes for judges, too.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law requiring age verification for accessing online pornography, giving the green light to similar laws in more than a dozen states.

The high court ruled 6-3 in favor of the law, rejecting the adult entertainment industry's argument that the law infringes on privacy rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion.

“The power to require age verification is within a State's authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content. H. B. 1181 is a constitutionally permissible exercise of that authority,” Thomas wrote.

“The statute advances the State's important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit content. And, it is appropriately tailored because it permits users to verify their ages through the established methods of providing government-issued identification and sharing transactional data,” Thomas said, affirming the lower court's ruling.

Justice Elena Kagan wrote a dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan rejected the majority's conclusion upholding the law, arguing it unlawfully burdens adults from seeking constitutionally protected sexually explicit material.

“The First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials for every adult. So a State cannot target that expression, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children. That is what we have held in cases indistinguishable from this one. And that is what foundational First Amendment principles demand,” Kagan wrote.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton hailed the Friday decision as a “majority victory for children, parents, and the ability of states to protect minors from the damaging effects of online pornography.”

“Companies have no right to expose children to pornography and must institute reasonable age verification measures. I will continue to enforce the law against any organization that refuses to take the necessary steps to protect minors from explicit materials,” Paxton said.

The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment industry group that sued Texas over the law at the center of Friday's decision, expressed its disappointment with the outcome.

“As it has been throughout history, pornography is once again the canary in the coal mine of free expression,” Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden said. “The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet.”

“This law has failed to keep minors away from sexual content, yet continues to have a massive chilling effect on adults. The outcome is disastrous for Texans and for anyone who cares about freedom of speech and privacy online,” Boden added.

Justice Elena Kagan wrote a dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The justices heard arguments in the case on Jan. 16 and appeared open to upholding the age verification laws at the center of the case.

TOP CASES THE SUPREME COURT WILL DECIDE AT THE END OF THIS TERM

Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson defended the law by arguing to the justices that it protects minors without infringing on the rights of adults who wish to view the content. Derek Shaffer, a lawyer representing the adult entertainment industry, argued before the high court that the age verification laws infringe on adults' rights to view the content by requiring them to submit personal information to view pornography. Shaffer argued that families can filter content on their own devices if they wish to protect their children from it.

The Supreme Court's decision will have implications beyond Texas, as it will determine the fate of 19 states with similar laws.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What the Islamophobic Attacks on Mamdani Reveal","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/zohran-mamdani-maga-islamophobia/683349/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 17:26:00 GMT","

Rather than cement its new multiracial coalition, the MAGA movement seems almost desperate to break it apart.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Coming up with nondefamatory ways to attack Zohran Mamdani is not exactly an insurmountable task. The 33-year-old Democratic nominee for New York City mayor is an avowed socialist from a privileged background, has defended inflammatory rhetoric such as “Globalize the intifada,” and has a back catalog of hyper-woke social-media posts that would be electoral poison in any remotely competitive district.

Instead, many leading voices within the Republican Party have decided to criticize him on the grounds that, like 4.5 million other Americans, Mamdani is Muslim.

After Mamdani's victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary earlier this week, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene shared an image on X of a burka-clad Statue of Liberty. Influential activists including Charlie Kirk and Laura Loomer invoked 9/11, unsubtly implying that all Muslims, even secular ones like Mamdani, are jihadists. The New York Young Republican Club urged the Trump administration to deport him—Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, is a U.S. citizen—as did Representative Andy Ogles, who called Mamdani “little muhammad.”

None of this comes as a shock when the party is led by a president who has, among many other offenses, called immigrants “animals,” claimed that “they're poisoning the blood of our country,” and told a radio host that they commit murder because “it's in their genes.” In one sense, the outburst of nakedly xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric from today's Republican Party is simply a dog-bites-man story (or maybe, in Donald Trump's case, a man-claims-people-eat-dogs story).

In another sense, however, there is something odd about the response to Mamdani's victory. Trump won a second term in part because he drew larger numbers of minority voters, including Muslim Americans and immigrants, than any other Republican in decades. This shift was especially notable in big cities like New York. And yet, rather than cement this new coalition, the MAGA movement seems almost desperate to break it apart.

In 2016, 88 percent of Trump's voters were white, according to a Pew Research Center survey of validated voters. In 2024, just 78 percent were. His expanded support among minorities seems to have been a reaction to inflation and unpopular progressive stances on immigration and other social issues taken by the Biden administration. Some Arab and Muslim voters also recoiled at the administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza.

Of course, elected presidents don't always govern in a way that perfectly matches their campaign messages or winning coalitions. Joe Biden won largely thanks to voters' displeasure with Trump's chaotic governing style and mismanagement of the pandemic, and then pursued transformative climate-change legislation. George W. Bush famously ran for reelection on opposing gay marriage and mocking John F. Kerry's manhood, and then tried to privatize Social Security.

But Trump's second-term agenda is not merely unrelated to the source of his campaign success. In some ways it is diametrically opposed to it.

Trump was bound to impose less restraint on Israel than Biden did, but Trump has exceeded his predecessor by proposing mass population transfer from Gaza and by bombing Iran. Rather than cater to support among Latinos for stricter border control, Trump has seemed determined to alienate those voters by encouraging the indiscriminate detainment of Latinos, inevitably sweeping up legal residents and even citizens. Treating brown-skinned Americans like criminals has had the predictable effect of driving up support for comprehensive immigration reform and driving down Trump's approval among Latinos.

Rather than pursue policies to bring down costs, as he promised to do during the campaign (at least when he was reading from scripted remarks prepared by advisers familiar with what voters wanted), Trump has largely ignored this imperative in office. Instead, his major economic initiatives—raising tariffs, deporting day laborers and other low-wage employees en masse, and blowing up the deficit with tax cuts—have put upward pressure on inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell has explained that some of these policies will delay interest-rate cuts, to which Trump's response has been to berate him rather than adjust to economic reality.

Jonathan Chait: Why won't Zohran Mamdani denounce a dangerous slogan?

Trump has governed as if he was cryogenically frozen when he left office and awakened in January. He has prioritized taking revenge on enemies from his first term, and learned almost nothing from the four years in between.

He seems to continue to subscribe to the “Great Replacement” theory, which posits that Democrats have deliberately encouraged mass illegal immigration in order to transform the electorate. Trump recently claimed on social media that Democrats “use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens.” Stephen Miller, his unofficial secretary of everything, concluded that Mamdani's election shows “how unchecked migration fundamentally remade the NYC electorate.”

Just a few months ago, Trumpists were bragging about the multiracial working-class coalition that got them a second term. Now it's as if they've forgotten that coalition entirely. Or perhaps, at some level, they don't want to keep it intact, because they refuse to recognize those communities as fully American, or even fully human. Replicating the formula that won the 2024 election would mean turning Mamdani into a symbol of out-of-touch urban progressivism. Republicans seem unable to resist attacking him for his religion instead.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate.

On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that parents with religious objections to books with LGBTQ+ characters must be allowed to opt their children out of any public school instruction that uses those books. The decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor was handed down along party lines, with all six Republicans in the majority and all three Democrats in dissent.

The Mahmoud case highlights the Republican justices' impatience to remake constitutional law in a more socially conservative image, especially in cases involving religion. It is certainly possible for public school instruction to violate a religious child's constitutional rights. The Constitution, for example, forbids government institutions like public schools from coercing students into violating their religious views. As Justice Samuel Alito notes in the Mahmoud opinion, the Constitution would also forbid teachers from openly mocking a student's faith.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

But, as a federal appeals court which previously heard the Mahmoud case warned, we don't actually know whether the Constitution was violated in this case. Although Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ+ characters for use in public schools, the lower court found that the record in this case contains no information “about how any teacher or school employee has actually used any of the Storybooks in the Parents' children's classrooms, how often the Storybooks are actually being used, what any child has been taught in conjunction with their use, or what conversations have ensued about their themes.”

Nevertheless, Alito handed down a fairly broad opinion which is likely to impose substantial new burdens on public schools, and he did so without waiting until the record in this case was more fully developed by lower courts. The result is that many schools may struggle to comply with the new obligations that were just imposed, and most schools are likely to exclude books that introduce queer themes or that even mention LGBTQ+ characters.

The plaintiffs in Mahmoud include Muslim and Christian parents who do not want their children exposed to these books. And their lawyers came to the Supreme Court with an audacious request — seeking a broad decision that parents who object to any form of classroom instruction on religious grounds must be notified in advance, and be permitted to opt their child out of that instruction.

The problem with this request is that schools cannot possibly know, in advance, which religious views are held by which parents, and which books or lessons those parents might find objectionable. In the past, parents have sued school districts objecting, on religious grounds, to lessons that touch on topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, and “immodest dress.” They've objected to books which expose readers to evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.”

Courts have historically been very cautious about ruling in favor of parents who raise these sorts of objections, in part due to concerns that schools would be overwhelmed by administrative burden.

Nevertheless, the Court's decision in Mahmoud largely embraces the plaintiffs' request — Alito orders the school board to notify parents “in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.” 

Alito's opinion does not discuss how this rule should apply to parents with more uncommon religious beliefs, but the Constitution forbids the government from treating people with idiosyncratic religious beliefs differently than people with more common beliefs. The upshot is that a school may also need to warn parents if a teacher wants to read from a Harry Potter book (because those books are about magic), or if they want to teach a lesson about a famous pacifist like Martin Luther King Jr. Schools may even need to warn parents if any of their children's teachers are women, just in case a parent objects on religious grounds to women having achievements outside of the home.

That said, Alito's opinion is slightly narrower than the Mahmoud plaintiffs' proposed framework. Alito argues that the books at issue are objectionable, not just because they feature LGBTQ+ characters, but because they suggest that certain aspects of queer culture should be “celebrated.” One of the contested books is a medieval fairy tale about a prince who marries a knight. According to Alito, the book “relates that ‘on the two men's wedding day, the air filled with cheer and laughter, for the prince and his shining knight would live happily ever after.'” 

Thus, Alito claims, this book is objectionable not because it includes a same-sex wedding, but because it portrays this wedding as a good thing. Under Alito's framework, a book that featured a same-sex wedding without portraying it as desirable might not trigger the new rule. Similarly, Alito would likely permit women to work as teachers without warning parents of their femininity, so long as the teacher does not do anything to celebrate their womanhood or suggest that being a woman who works outside the home is a good thing.

Still, schools will likely struggle to determine when they are required to warn parents of a particular lesson under Mahmoud. And schools that draw the line in the wrong place now risk being dragged into an expensive lawsuit.

One very likely consequence of Mahmoud is that schools will be very reluctant to teach any lesson that mentions homosexuality, transgender people, or anything else that touches on queer sexuality or gender identity. Mahmoud is likely to impose a Florida-style “Don't Say Gay” regime on every public school classroom in America.

The reason why is fairly straightforward. While it is somewhat unclear how Mahmoud applies to parents who object to fantasy novels or working women, the decision quite clearly limits schools' ability to teach books with queer characters. Nor is it clear when a book crosses the line from merely mentioning a gay character to celebrating some aspect of gay culture. So schools that want to avoid lawsuits will need to exclude these sorts of books from their classroom altogether.

Lawyers, meanwhile, have a financial incentive to sue schools that behave more boldly. Federal law typically allows the “prevailing party” in a civil rights lawsuit to collect attorney's fees from the losing party. And suits enforcing Mahmoud are considered civil rights cases because they arise under the First Amendment's religious liberty provisions. 

So, lawyers can search for schools that teach books with LGBTQ+ characters, find a parent who objects to those books, and then sue and demand that the school district pay their client's bills. School districts that don't want to be treated like an ATM for anti-LGBTQ+ lawyers, meanwhile, will only be able to avoid these lawsuits by excluding queer-themed books from the classroom entirely.

The Supreme Court, in other words, has decided that in order to accommodate one identity group — religious conservatives — schools should be hypercautious about teaching books that feature members of another identity group — LGBTQ+ people. Given the Court's Republican majority, that decision is not a surprise. But it is likely to impose very difficult burdens.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

﻿This decision isn't really about birthright citizenship.

The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿

The Court picked a hell of a time to give lawsuit immunity to federal law enforcement.

The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.

What the hell did the Court just do to equal protection law?

Trump v. AFGE asks if the Republican justices' new approach to separation of powers applies to Trump.

I support Starbucks' new policy to charge for the extras in your drink. Don't hate me — let me explain!

For many things, I don't mind paying a little more to benefit society. I know my taxes pay for things like schools and the military, and I think that's just fine. I pay the same gym membership fee as someone who goes every single day — in a sense, I'm subsidizing the swole. And I'm fine with that.

But there is a limit to even my strongest socialist impulses. I refuse to subsidize your disgusting Starbucks custom order, with its extra pumps of flavored syrup and fruits and powders. I believe healthcare is a human right. Matcha powder isn't.

Starbucks just changed its policies so that adding extra syrups or matcha powders will cost extra. People are upset. I'm sympathetic — I wouldn't be happy to pay more, either.

But the logic here is sound. Adding extra ingredients costs money. Inflation is real. Starbucks likely has two options if it wants to keep its profit margins: charge people extra for custom add-ons, or raise the prices on all drinks.

This new charge is for adding ingredients that wouldn't be included in the standard version of a drink. Extra matcha powder scoops will cost $1 a scoop, extra pumps of syrups and sauces will see a flat fee of 80 cents, and fruit bits will be 50 cents a serving. There are details in the fine print, which my colleague Alex Bitter reported on earlier this week.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is not unfamiliar with this issue. He was previously the CEO of Chipotle, the place that taught us the sacred millennial phrase, ""Yes, I know guac is extra."" Sometimes, adding in pricey extras like avocados should be an option.

In the last few years, elaborate custom drinks have become a thorn in Starbucks' side. They came as a byproduct of the shift to in-app ordering during the pandemic — it's a lot easier to remember the details of an eight-ingredient custom drink when you're ordering on the app vs. an actual store. These custom drinks would go viral on social media — a windfall of earned media!

But actually serving the drinks was a huge pain for baristas and slowed down service, creating extra wait times for everyone.

Niccol has expressed a desire to return Starbucks to its coffeehouse roots, and has said that problems tied to mobile ordering had ""chipped away"" at the brand's ""soul.""

There is another element to the changes, too: People have been sharing ""hacks"" on social media where you can load up on powders or syrups to ""cheat"" the system for a cheaper Starbucks drink. For example, I saw a recent TikTok of someone ordering a small matcha latte with four times the amount of normal matcha powder and no ice, and then using it as a concentrate at home to pour over several glasses of milk. I'm not sure how prevalent this was, or how much these sneaky people inspired the new pricing.

Now here's where my personal bias comes in: I like regular coffee, hot or iced — and I'm not a fan of overly sweet coffee drinks like the Frappuccino or a hazelnut shaken espresso. I'm not yucking anyone's yum or stopping anyone from ordering what they like. But I don't want caramel syrup or dried fruit in my coffee, and I don't want to subsidize the people who do.

As you might imagine, the people who are now being forced to pay more for their regular drinks are not happy.

I watched TikTok videos from people who were outraged by the new pricing for their regular drinks. One woman was mad that her drink, which includes two extra syrups, had gone up by over a dollar. ""I might as well buy a bottle of the syrup and make it at my coffee station at home!"" she said.

Well, yeah. You should! You should absolutely just make coffee at home instead of buying Starbucks every day! That is, in fact, a very wise thing for anyone to do. I feel like a real boomer saying so, but you should absolutely just make it at home. If you don't want to: Well, there's a price for that!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Florals, animal print, and loud luxury are in at the Bezos wedding, with some outfits costing nearly $10,000","https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-fashion-guest-outfits-2025-6","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:43:00 GMT","

It's safe to say no one is underdressed at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding.

Bezos, 61, and Sánchez, 55, are getting married in Venice, Italy, in a lavish celebration surrounded by about 200 of their famous and powerful friends, who packed their best — and most expensive — outfits.

From animal prints and florals to a three-dimensional heart, check out some of the most eye-catching looks Bezos and Sánchez's wedding guests have worn so far.

Bezos' wedding ensemble was traditional, as he wore a black tuxedo with a vest and bow tie.

He brought a fun pop to his look with $650 sunglasses from Louis Vuitton.

Altman wore a navy tuxedo with black lapels and a black bow tie, forgoing a cummerbund.

Gates kept his black ensemble simple, but his black bow tie was slightly oversize, adding dimension to the look. He wore his signature glasses with the formal outfit.

The star of Winfrey's monochromatic ensemble was a pink, off-the-shoulder ball gown. The dropped-waist bodice hugged her figure with ruched fabric before flowing into a floor-length skirt.

The long sleeves were made of semi-sheer lace, and Winfrey accessorized the look with sunglasses and a matching clutch.

A sparkly flower sat on the hip of Trump's strapless dress, with petals extending across the gown in a circular pattern.

A slit cut the skirt, and a train flowed out behind the glamorous garment.

Jared Kushner wore a navy tuxedo with black lapels and a black bow tie.

Brady wore dark colors for the wedding, pairing his suit jacket with a navy shirt and tie.

Usher wore a classic double-breasted jacket, but its black-and-white pattern made it fashion-forward. A bow tie and white pocket square completed his look.

Her dress had a V-neck bodice with a subtle sheen and lacy sides embellished with sparkles.

She wore a massive diamond pendant on her neck and chunky sunglasses.

She wore a strapless gown with a corseted, push-up bustier top and a long skirt. The garment was a light-silver shade, which almost looked white in some lighting.

She also wore black sunglasses and big diamond studs.

Her strapless dress came from the fashion house's Icarus couture line. It featured a tight, metallic corset, a satin band with embroidered flowers across the chest, and a form-fitted skirt with a matching print.

Equally loud was her jewelry. In addition to her massive engagement ring, Sanchez sported large diamond earrings and a second diamond ring.

Bezos kept his outfit simpler, wearing a charcoal suit and $975 Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses.

She wore a snakeskin-print dress with a daring top. It was fitted at the waist, embellished at the straps, and plunging at the neckline. It also had crisscross straps down its front.

She wore it with smoky makeup, wavy hair, and a large diamond ring shaped like a butterfly.

The TV star waved at photographers from a water taxi, showing off her massive diamond cuff and designer sunglasses in the process.

It was her bedazzled mesh gown, however, that really deserved attention. The piece was see-through and covered in stripes of silver sparkles. Its neckline was also so low that it revealed the bra-style top of her undergarment.

While Gamble sported an all-black suit and layers of pearl necklaces, Jenner chose a tulle gown with puffy sleeves, a rose-embellished belt, and long diamond earrings.

The ""momager"" also wore designer sunglasses and multiple silver bracelets, matching the accessories Gamble wore.

Her halter dress was originally made for the designer's 2002 runway collection.

It had a deep V-neckline, a tight skirt, and a mix of floral and decorative prints in pink all over the dress.

She wore a sheer, body-hugging dress crafted entirely from yellow lace. The makeup mogul also seemingly wore peach-colored undergarments beneath it, including a bra that poked out above the chest.

To complete the look, she added a black leather bag and round sunglasses.

Ceretti, an Italian model, stepped onto a water taxi in a gray gown with a ruffled bow at the chest, floral embellishments across one strap, and strings laced up its skirt.

Poonawalla, an Indian businesswoman, boarded the boat behind her in a red AZ Factory piece created for the brand's 2022 spring runway.

It was strapless and made from a mix of fabrics, including velvet, with massive 3D hearts attached all over.

She took a water taxi on Thursday with her husband, Jared Kushner. Though his outfit, a navy-blue suit, was simple, Trump's was the opposite.

She wore an Oscar de la Renta minidress embellished with white and pink ombré sequins and an assortment of white floral pieces. The straps were also created to look like stems.

Online, the dress retails for $9,990.

Winfrey and King caught a water taxi together on Thursday. King, who joined Sánchez in space in April, wore a yellow and white dress, while Winfrey chose a maroon and white floral look.

Winfrey's dress had subtle cutouts on the waist, giving it a daring edge.

The besties both wore sunglasses, too.

The bride-to-be wore a form-fitting gown with a one-shoulder neckline from Alexander McQueen's spring 2003 collection. Diagonal stripes of sparkles covered the dress, making it stand out.

Bezos kept his eveningwear casual, wearing a suit with a cream T-shirt. He added sunglasses to the outfit to make the look feel even more laid-back.

Khloé Kardashian supported her sister with her first look for the Bezos wedding, wearing a Skims x Dolce & Gabbana catsuit in cheetah print.

She paired it with brown, open-toe heels and big sunglasses.

Kim Kardashian stepped into Venice in a black Balenciaga set that consisted of a strapless top, a high-waisted skirt, and a matching hoodie. The skirt said ""Balenciaga"" in white font on the waist.

Chunky sunglasses and white, printed boots completed the loud-luxury ensemble.

President Donald Trump on Friday said the United States is immediately ""terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada"" in response to Ottawa's decision to impose a digital services tax on American tech firms.

Trump's surprise announcement on Truth Social accused Canada of ""copying the European Union"" with the ""egregious"" tax.

""We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,"" Trump added.

Read Trump's full post:

""We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country. They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately. We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

The office of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The president's angry declaration suddenly imperils America's trade relationship with a close ally that has long been one of its top two global trading partners.

U.S. goods trade with Canada totaled roughly $762 billion last year, according to the office of the U.S. trade representative.

Following Trump's announcement, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both turned negative, retreating from the record highs they had reached earlier in the day.

The first payments from Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year and applies retroactively to 2022, are set to be collected Monday. The tax would hit both domestic and foreign tech companies, including U.S. giants such as Amazon, Google and Meta.

Canadian officials said this month that they would not pause the digital services tax, despite ferocious opposition from the United States.

The Supreme Court on Friday limited federal judges from issuing universal injunctions, which had been used to block President Donald Trump from implementing his executive order ending birthright citizenship.

The 6-3 decision, which divided the conservative-majority court along ideological lines, helps clear the way for the Trump administration to push forward with its efforts to unilaterally upend long-standing U.S. citizenship rules and other major policies.

The ruling also bolsters Trump's frequent claims that his expansive use of his executive powers has been unfairly thwarted by judicial overreach.

""GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!,"" Trump wrote on social media after the opinion was released.

The case centered on nationwide injunctions that federal district court judges had granted in three separate lawsuits challenging Trump's citizenship order.

Those injunctions temporarily blocked enforcement of the order while the cases moved through the court system.

But on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that, ""Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.""

The majority granted the Trump administration's request to pause those injunctions, ""but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.""

Crucially, the court declined to rule on whether the executive order, which would end centuries of birthright citizenship in the United States, was constitutional.

""Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch,'"" Justice Amy Coney Barrett, one of three Trump appointees on the bench, wrote for the majority.

""But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,"" wrote Barrett.

""When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,"" she wrote.

In a blistering dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor decried the government's efforts to end birthright citizenship, while criticizing her conservative colleagues for ""shamefully"" permitting judicial ""gamesmanship"" by the Trump administration.

""No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,"" wrote Sotomayor in the dissent, where she was joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

""Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,"" Sotomayor wrote.

The ""patent unlawfulness"" of Trump's executive order ""reveals the gravity of the majority's error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case,"" she wrote.

""As every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land.""

In a separate, equally vehement dissent, Jackson added, ""The Court's decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.""

The bid to quash universal injunctions is essentially ""a request for this Court's permission to engage in unlawful behavior,"" Jackson, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote.

""With its ruling today, the majority largely grants the Government's wish,"" she wrote. ""But, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Nation of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to deny it.""

The world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker is going all-in on international expansion and could shake up the EV market in the process with its battery-swapping tech rollout.

China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) is a key player in the global transition to more sustainable transport, with a market share in the EV sector of roughly 38%. CATL's clients include global players like Tesla, Volkswagen and BMW, with the firm boasting technology far superior to that of Western competitors. 

Despite its outsized impact on the EV industry, the company had mostly flown under the radar until May this year, when it launched the world's largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2025 to date in Hong Kong. 

The IPO raised 41 billion Hong Kong dollars ($5.2 billion), after CATL stocks surged and an over-allotment option was fully exercised. 

Here is what CATL has in the works following its IPO.

Ahead of its public offering, CATL said 90% of the funds raised by going public would be put toward its expansion into Europe, particularly its under-construction factory in Hungary. 

The company's 7.6-billion-euro ($8.2 billion) investment into the Debrecen battery plant was first announced in August 2022 and is expected to begin production this year. 

The battery maker has already established a wholly owned manufacturing base in Germany, which first opened in 2023. It has also announced plans to build a battery plant in Spain through a joint venture with Stellantis. 

Bill Russo, founder and CEO of investment advisory firm Automobility, said CATL's expansion plans appear designed to sustain its global leadership and scale, citing limited growth momentum in its domestic market and rising competition.

""CATL's early mover advantage helps lock in long-term contracts, and pricing power is stronger in Europe, supporting higher margins compared to China,"" Russo told CNBC by email.

""The Hungary plant is a strategic gateway into the EU market,"" he added. ""Hungary offers proximity to major OEMs, government incentives, and lower labor costs — making it an attractive hub for Chinese EV and battery players seeking a foothold in Europe,"" he added.

CATL's global investments follow a trend of more Chinese EV companies, including auto giant BYD, shifting to Europe amid aggressive competition and price wars in the domestic market. 

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, on Thursday, Ni Jun, CATL's chief manufacturing officer, said the brutal discount war would not end without intervention from Beijing. 

He added that, if a big player continues to cut prices, it could lead to other competitors being driven out of the market and create a monopoly. While CATL's Jun did not name any companies, CATL's main competitor BYD announced price cuts in late May. 

Tight margins and overcapacity in China have been a driving force in CATL's Europe push, said Tu Le, founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, adding that the company is already supplying ""virtually every"" EV maker in China, limiting domestic growth opportunities. 

But not everything in Europe has been easy. The bloc placed punitive tariffs on made-in-China EVs last year, following an even more severe crackdown in the U.S. 

Le said that the Hungary facility is another major step toward the company's localization plans and that it will lead to lower labor costs and a geopolitically friendlier environment when compared to Germany. 

CATL is also involved in an integrated electric vehicle battery project in Indonesia. According to local media reports, government officials expect production to begin in March 2026, which could give CATL a presence in the growing EV market of Southeast Asia. 

CATL said in a recent interview with The Financial Times that it also plans to roll out its battery-swapping and recycling technology to Europe, in a move that could have significant ramifications for the regional market. CNBC has contacted CATL for further details. 

Modern battery-swapping technology, while popular in China, is yet to take off in Europe. Chinese EV maker and battery-swapping pioneer Nio is one exception. The company has introduced 60 battery swap stations across Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

Jeep and Dodge maker Stellantis, meanwhile, recently partnered with U.S.-based Ample to integrate battery swapping technology to a fleet of 100 Fiat 500 EVs in Madrid, Spain.

The experience of using a battery swap station is thought to be very similar to using an automated car wash. The EV driver parks the car on a platform with an integrated system, which removes the depleted battery from beneath the vehicle and replaces it with a fresh, fully charged one. The whole process takes about five minutes.

Advocates of battery charging through a swapping station say the technology solves a number of issues, particularly relating to fast charging and long-term performance — two major sticking points for the widespread adoption of EVs.

Analysts say another key benefit to swapping is that it allows car manufacturers to maintain ownership of the battery, which lowers the initial price of the vehicle and creates a regular revenue stream for the OEMs.

Some drawbacks, however, include high initial infrastructure costs and a lack of standardization across car manufacturers.

Connor Watts, battery raw materials analyst at consultancy Fastmarkets, said CATL, which has a number of partnerships with Chinese OEMs, is well positioned to implement the necessary level of product standardization across its customer base.

""And particularly following its recent influx of cash from its Hong-Kong listing, it has the necessary capital to develop infrastructure within the European market,"" Watts told CNBC by email.

""Of companies that could succeed in developing the European battery swapping industry, none are better placed than CATL considering its market position,"" he added.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said major carmakers would have to agree to a standardized cell design for battery-swapping technology to work at scale in Europe.

""Battery swapping is a good addition to the charging space, and in some parts of the market it makes sense … but it is not a silver bullet to solve our problems,"" Poliscanova told CNBC by phone.

""We will still need batteries and we will still need materials for them, whether they are swapped or whether they are in the car permanently,"" she added.

In this article

Nike stock soared 17% on Friday after the company said the worst of its struggles are behind it, following a better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. 

Nike on Thursday reiterated it would take the biggest financial hit from its turnaround plan during the quarter, soothing investors who worried President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on key Nike manufacturing hubs like China and Vietnam would derail the company's comeback.

Nike posted a poor fourth quarter, as sales dropped 12%, net income plunged 86% and profit margins dwindled. But CEO Elliott Hill stressed the company has emerged from the worst of its slump, and the slide in sales and profits would begin to moderate in the quarters ahead. 

""The results we're reporting today in Q4 and in FY25 are not up to the Nike standard, but as we said 90 days ago, the work we're doing to reposition the business through our 'Win Now' actions is having an impact,"" said Hill on an earnings call, referencing the name of the company's turnaround plan. ""From here, we expect our business results to improve. It's time to turn the page."" 

With few details about the progress of Nike's turnaround strategies in the company's earnings release, the company's shares initially fell when it posted results after the closing bell Thursday. By the end of an hourlong call with Nike executives and Wall Street analysts, the stock had surged more than 10% in extended trading.

Beyond assuring investors that the turnaround plan is working, Hill shared promising updates on new product launches and Nike's efforts to win back wholesale partners, which have been key areas of focus since he took over in October. 

Hill shared details behind Nike's decision to begin selling on Amazon for the first time since 2019 and its push to win over female shoppers, another priority for the company. 

During the quarter, the company launched products in more than 200 women's led shops, including Aritzia, and released its collection with WNBA star A'ja Wilson, which Hill said sold out in three minutes. 

By Friday morning, the stock climbed even higher after numerous banks issued bullish commentary on the company. HSBC upgraded Nike to buy from hold, its first buy rating on the stock in 3½ years. 

HSBC also raised its price target to $80, implying 28% upside from Thursday's close. 

""Long in the making but we think the inflection is finally here,"" analyst Erwan Rambourg wrote in a research note. ""We think there is more than tangible evidence that Nike has a path to see its sales rebound in the not-too-distant future, and its margins to be repaired, and this despite an unfavorable tariff headwind."" 

Nike's results show the company is rebounding on a timeline Wall Street likes. But don't call it a comeback just yet. 

The sneaker giant is trying to grow again at a shaky time for the economy, as weaker consumer sentiment, rising debt, tariffs and mass deportations raise questions about spending and GDP.

Nike still expects sales to decline in its current quarter by a mid-single-digit percentage, in line with Wall Street expectations of a 7% drop, according to LSEG.

It also has more work to do to clear out stale lifestyle inventory from its classic Dunks and Jordan lines. Those efforts to liquidate old inventory have hit profit margins and sales because Nike has had to rely on deep discounts, clearance channels and the off-price sector to clear out that glut. 

In fiscal 2025, which ended last month, sales for classics like the Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and Dunks declined more than 20% compared with the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, that accelerated to 30%, which impacted sales by nearly $1 billion, finance chief Matt Friend said. 

Air Force 1 inventory levels have started to stabilize but Nike is still working to clear out supply of its Dunk franchise, which will affect the company's profits through the first half of its current fiscal year, said Friend.

Both Hill and Friend said Nike's profits will be under pressure through the first half of fiscal 2026 as it works through its inventory and contends with higher costs from tariffs. They said they expect profits to improve in the second half of the year. 

However, when it comes to actual sales growth, it's still too early to tell when the company will stop shrinking. 

When asked if there are any scenarios where the company could get back to revenue growth this year, Hill declined to share a timeline. 

""Just because of everything that's going on, we're going to take it 90 days at a time,"" said Hill. ""We believe full recovery will take time.""

Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Aritzia.

 Corporations race to build Bitcoin treasuries as stablecoins gain momentum and landmark regulations take shape worldwide. 

The race to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is accelerating as corporations increasingly view the digital asset as a valuable addition to their balance sheets. Beyond publicly traded firms, private companies are joining the movement, including a Norwegian deep-sea mining company planning to acquire $1.2 billion worth of BTC.

This week also marked the official unveiling of a new venture by crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, aimed at building a billion-dollar Bitcoin treasury.

As Bitcoin accumulation intensifies, stablecoins are emerging as a key driver of crypto adoption. The United States is edging closer to passing landmark stablecoin legislation, South Korea is pushing banks to issue won-backed stablecoins and the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins — described by one venture executive as an “inevitability” — appears to be on the horizon.

This week's Crypto Biz explores the growing momentum behind Bitcoin treasuries and the surging influence of stablecoins.

Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals AS has announced plans to allocate up to $1.2 billion to its Bitcoin treasury, highlighting the growing institutional appetite for digital assets.

The Bitcoin treasury strategy is part of broader ambitions to incorporate blockchain technology into the company's operations. The company said Bitcoin will help diversify its assets from fiat currencies. 

Corporations are racing to buy Bitcoin, with new entity formations scooping up billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. Earlier this month, Tether and Bitfinex moved $3.9 billion worth of Bitcoin to Twenty One Capital, a new company backed by SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. 

Entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano has also launched a new Bitcoin financial services firm, called ProCap BTC, which announced plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of BTC.

Bitcoin treasuries aren't the only digital asset stockpiles making waves — crypto hedge fund executives from Coral Capital Holdings are reportedly raising $100 million to invest in Binance's BNB (BNB) token.

Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger and Johnathan Pasch plan to complete the fundraising this month and begin accumulating BNB immediately, Bloomberg reported. The BNB treasury will be managed by a new entity called Build & Build Corporation, which will also file for a public listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange. 

Horsman, Kruger and Pasch were part of Coral Capital, which was acquired by DNA Fund in 2024 for an undisclosed amount. 

Crypto venture firm CoinFund has backed DeFi protocol Veda in an $18 million raise to support the expansion of its vault platform, which enables issuers to create crosschain yield products like yield-bearing stable assets.

“The natural next step for wealth onchain is to earn yield and to make your assets (fiat currency or digital assets) productive,” CoinFund managing partner David Pakman told Cointelegraph. 

Although the US banking lobby is reportedly spooked about the impact of yield-bearing stablecoins, Pakman described them as an “inevitability,” since they are “a much more convenient way of earning low-risk yield on fiat than traditional bank savings and money market accounts.”

“I do agree that, once we have more and more yield-bearing stablecoins, traditional bank savings accounts will be endangered and need to evolve,” Pakman said.

Stablecoins are coming to South Korea, with buy-in from the country's central bank and broader financial sector. 

Eight major South Korean banks are developing a won-backed stablecoin in an attempt to curb US dollar dominance in the country. The stablecoin rollout could begin later this year or early next year. 

The Bank of Korea's deputy governor, Ryoo Sangdai, wants regulated financial institutions to be the primary issuers of stablecoins in the country, according to local media reports. 

“The aim is to establish a safety net, considering the potential for market disruption or consumer harm,” Sangdai said.

Stablecoins are a $239 billion market, according to industry data. However, 99% of that value is tied to the US dollar.

President Donald Trump is backing Bitcoin, calling it a vital American asset that the US must continue to dominate.

Today, Former President Donald Trump has voiced strong support for Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry, calling it a vital American asset that the US must continue to dominate.

“So I became a fan of crypto, and to me it's an industry,” Trump said. “I view it as an industry and I'm president and if we didn't have it, China would or somebody else would, but most likely China.”

Trump emphasized the economic resilience and strategic importance of Bitcoin, pointing out its relative strength during recent market downturns. 

“In fact, when the stock market went down recently, crypto and Bitcoin and all of that went down much less than anybody else as a group,” he stated. “And we've created a very powerful industry and that's much more important than anything that we invest in.”

The former president talked about his personal involvement with Bitcoin before launching his 2024 presidential campaign. “I got involved with it a couple of years ago and before this, before the second term, I got involved, before I decided to run… I was in Bitcoin then, not knowing if I was going to do it a third time,” he emphasized, referring to his decision to run again.

Trump also suggested that Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream. “It's the jobs that it produces and I noticed more and more you paying Bitcoin. I mean, people are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar. And it's a great thing for our country, so I don't care about investing, you know.”

He concluded by asserting that under his leadership, the US has built a critical industry in Bitcoin and crypto. “I have kids and they invest in different things. They do believe in it, but I'm president and what I did do there is build an industry that's very important and you know if we didn't have a China would,” Trump said.

The slight pullback follows a generally positive week for crypto majors, fueled by lower inflation readings and increased confidence about crypto regulatory frameworks in Asia.

Ethereum might consolidate for a little while longer as the daily RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance of supply and demand. If the price rises above the moving averages, Ethereum might climb to $2,738 and then $2,879.

In contrast, if the Ethereum price falls and breaks below $2,323, it indicates that bears are selling on rallies. Ethereum may then retest its strong support at $2,111.

The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) continues to exert pressure on the broader crypto market, casting a shadow on the prospects of an incoming altcoin season. Despite recent volatility and decline in the market, a crypto analyst observes that Bitcoin Dominance remains firmly elevated, signaling that capital is still concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend, they argue, is preventing any meaningful breakout for altcoins and could persist unless a decisive shift in market structure occurs. 

Altcoin Season Stifled As Bitcoin Dominance Surges

The Bitcoin Dominance in the cryptocurrency market is tightening its grip, crushing hopes of an imminent altcoin season. According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin's market cap dominance has reached 65.72% with both monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings pushing above the critical 70 level. 

At the time of the analysis, the RSI on the monthly timeline stood at 73.19, while the weekly registered at 70.58—both firmly in overbought territory. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin's command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. 

Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin's ongoing upward momentum. BTC.D has been climbing since late 2023. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. 

As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70—effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. 

Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. 

Dragonfly Doji Forms On BTC.D Chart

In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. With four days left in the weekly session, the analyst notes that the distinct candle pattern is still developing but presently resembles the classic Dragonfly Doji, characterized by a long lower wick and a close near the opening price. 

Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. However, in this case, it has emerged during a broader uptrend in BTC.D, creating a more complicated technical picture.

Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin's growing market dominance relative to altcoins.

The stolen funds from the ChainSaw collections remain idle, while most Favrr proceeds have already passed through Gate.io and several nested services.

Projects tied to Pepe meme creator Matt Furie and the NFT studio ChainSaw lost roughly $1 million to contract takeover exploits last week, according to on-chain investigator ZachXBT.

On June 27, ZachXBT reported transaction records showing that the attacker seized control of the “Replicandy” contract at 4:25 a.m. UTC on June 18 by transferring ownership to the externally owned address 0x9Fca. 

Two hours later, the new owner withdrew mint proceeds and, at 5:11 a.m. the next day, reopened the mint, issued fresh NFTs, and dumped them into open bids, pushing the floor price to zero.

On June 23, the same address took over three additional ChainSaw contracts: Peplicator, Hedz, and Zogz. The bad actor then repeated the mint-and-dump cycle. 

ZachXBT estimated the combined theft at more than $310,000 and linked the funds to three collector addresses: 0xf6a9, 0x7e58, and 0x58f4. He traced a 2.05 ETH payment from 0x9Fca to an exchange deposit that converted to 5,007.91 USDT and was then moved to MEXC. 

He subsequently mapped many smaller monthly deposits from unrelated projects into the same exchange wallet.

Two GitHub accounts, “devmad119” and “sujitb2114,” list wallets that intersect the stolen fund trail. 

Both accounts share indicators that ZachXBT associated with North Korean IT workers, including Korean language system settings, Astral VPN sessions, and Asia-Russia time zones, despite résumés that claim US residency.

A second incident surfaced on June 25, when the freelance services token project Favrr lost more than $680,000 following its listing on a DEX. On-chain analysis linked the exploit to the consolidation wallet 0x477, which received recurring payments from Favrr payroll addresses 0x1708 and 0x6412. 

Gate.io deposit address 0xab7 received part of the stolen Favrr tokens, and was previously funded by the suspected developer behind “sujitb2114”.

Favrr announced that it would refund all initial decentralized offering participants, cancel its MEXC listing, and initiate a thorough audit of its codebase. The project added that it will publish a new launch timeline “in the coming weeks” and advised users to avoid trading impostor tokens in the interim.

ZachXBT reported that Favrr's chief technology officer, listed as Alex Hong, deleted his LinkedIn profile after the exploit. Attempts to verify his work history with previous employers were unsuccessful. 

The investigator plans to release aggregate data on payroll flows to wallets tied to the same North Korean cluster, contending that basic due diligence checks would have flagged the hires.

The stolen funds from the ChainSaw collections remain idle, while most Favrr proceeds have already passed through Gate.io and several nested services. 

ZachXBT said he has not reached the teams because their direct message channels are closed, and official Telegram or Discord rooms do not provide contact options.

The incidents bring renewed attention to the risks of “shadow hiring” in crypto projects that outsource development through gig-work platforms. 

Investigators continue to follow the on-chain trails, and affected communities await formal statements from Furie, ChainSaw, and Favrr.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Pudgy Penguins PENGU Crypto Is Waddling Into The Spotlight","https://blockchainmagazine.net/pudgy-penguins-pengu-crypto-is-waddling-into-the-spotlight/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:06:42 GMT","

It's the quirky world of Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a cryptocurrency that's making waves with its adorable penguin-themed charm!  This memecoin, born from the beloved NFT collection, is quacking its way into the crypto scene with a community-driven vibe and a surprising market cap surge. As of June 27, 2025, PENGU is trading at an exciting $0.01066, boasting a 15.05% price jump in the last 24 hours. Let's explore its journey, why it's hopping in value, and what it means for crypto enthusiasts!

Pudgy Penguins started as an NFT project launched in July 2021 by Luca Donofrio and others, featuring 8,888 cute, pudgy penguin avatars on the Ethereum blockchain. The collection quickly gained traction, selling out within days and becoming a cultural hit among NFT collectors. In 2023, the project pivoted to launch its native token, PENGU, on the Solana blockchain, transforming it into a memecoin with a playful yet ambitious vision. Backed by a passionate community and strategic partnerships, PENGU has waddled from NFT fame to crypto stardom.

Since its token launch in 2023, PENGU has seen a rollercoaster ride. From a modest start, it faced the typical volatility of memecoins but began gaining momentum in 2024 with community events and collaborations. By June 2025, its 24-hour trading volume hit $107.18M, reflecting growing interest. The recent 15.05% price spike to $0.01066 signals a breakout moment, though its all-time high remains a target for eager investors.

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or cultural trends, often driven by community hype rather than traditional utility. Think Dogecoin (DOGE) with its Shiba Inu mascot or Shiba Inu (SHIB) with its doge-inspired roots. PENGU fits this mold, leveraging the Pudgy Penguins NFT brand to create a fun, community-focused token. While memecoins can be volatile, their viral appeal often fuels rapid price surges, making them a wild but entertaining part of crypto.

As of June 27, 2025, PENGU's price sits at $0.01066, up 15.05% in 24 hours from $0.00928, with a trading volume of $107.18M. Several factors are fueling this rise:

Community Buzz: Social media hype and penguin-themed events have reignited interest.

Market Trends: The broader memecoin rally, spurred by market optimism, is lifting PENGU.

Partnerships: Recent collaborations with gaming and NFT platforms are boosting visibility. The chart shows a steep upward trend post-9:00 AM IST, suggesting sustained buying pressure. However, with a circulating supply of 344.66M, its market cap remains modest, hinting at room for growth—or a potential correction if hype fades.

The price increase ties to PENGU's growing ecosystem. The team's focus on expanding utility (in-game rewards and NFT staking) combined with a loyal fanbase, is driving demand. The 24-hour volume spike indicates new investors jumping in, while the NFT collection's nostalgic appeal keeps the community engaged. Watch for updates on token unlocks, as they could impact future price stability.

Pudgy Penguins PENGU is waddling its way to crypto fame, blending meme culture with NFT heritage. With a price of $0.01066 and a 15.05% daily rise, it's a hot topic for investors. Its journey from 2021 NFTs to a 2025 token surge shows resilience, but the road ahead hinges on community momentum and market conditions. Whether you're here for the laughs or the gains, PENGU's story is one to watch!

What Makes PENGU Different from Other Memecoins?

PENGU stands out with its NFT roots, offering unique digital collectibles alongside its token. Unlike pure meme tokens, it blends community fun with tangible assets, adding a layer of value.

Is PENGU a Good Investment?

Like all memecoins, PENGU is high-risk, high-reward. Its recent 15.05% gain is exciting, but volatility is a factor. Research the project's roadmap and community strength before diving in!

What Are NFTs, and How Do They Relate to PENGU?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets on blockchains. PENGU's origin as an NFT collection ties its token to a collectible culture, enhancing its brand identity.

Can PENGU's Price Keep Rising?

It could, with strong community support and new utility. However, memecoin prices often depend on hype, so monitor market trends and volume closely.

A summary of the most significant changes made to the Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO” )  and the ICO's powers, under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (“DUAA”; “the Act”).

The Act will come into force in stages. Details of the regulations and exact dates that each measure will come into force will be available on GOV.UK. 

This information is only for reference and is not regulatory guidance or legal advice. The ICO is responsible for publishing regulatory guidance on its website - www.ico.org.uk.

Provision(s) in the DUAASection 91
TitleInformation Commissioner's role – duties of the Commissioner
Description of measureThe DUAA introduces a new strategic framework for the ICO when carrying out its data protection functions, which includes a principal objective and several matters to which the Commissioner must have regard when undertaking its tasks, including the promotion of innovation and competition and the fact that children merit specific protection. The Act also includes requirements for the Commissioner to publish a strategy, setting out how the new framework will be delivered, and to report on what has been done in relation to it as part of the ICO's annual reporting to Parliament.
How is this different from previous legislation?The legislation brings clearer strategic direction to the ICO as it fulfils its regulatory tasks and functions for data protection, strengthening its obligations, reflecting the breadth of issues that impact data protection regulation, and delivering a greater degree of transparency and accountability.

The primary duty of the Commissioner will be to uphold the new principal objective. This incorporates the pre-existing duty in section 2(2) of the DPA 2018, requiring the Commissioner to secure an appropriate level of protection for personal data, alongside a new requirement for the Commissioner to promote public trust and confidence in the processing of personal data.

The other duties sit below the principal objective, formalising some of the existing ways in which the ICO works and reinforcing the importance of several specific areas, which should be considered across the full scope of the ICO's data protection activities.The new duties require the Commissioner to consider:(a) the desirability of promoting innovation;(b) the desirability of promoting competition;(c) the importance of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences;(d) the need to safeguard public security and national security;(e) the fact that children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of the risks and consequences associated with processing of personal data and of their rights in relation to such processing.There is also a duty for the Commissioner to consult other regulators regarding economic growth, innovation and competition.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 91 of the DUAA omits section 2(2) from the DPA 2018, inserts new sections 120A-D into the DPA 2018 and amends section139 of the DPA 2018.

Provision(s) in the DUAASections 92-93
TitleInformation Commissioner's role - codes of practice for the processing of personal data; codes of practice panels and impact assessments
Description of measureThe DUAA ensures that all statutory codes of practice issued by the Information Commissioner have the same legal effect and follow the same approvals process and review requirements. It also makes several changes to the process through which the ICO develops statutory codes, requiring a draft of a new code, or draft amendments to an existing code, to be considered by a panel of relevant experts, and for the ICO to undertake and publish impact assessments.
How is this different from previous legislation?This ensures that any codes required by the Secretary of State under new section 124A of the DPA 2018 will have the same effect as all other codes issued by the Commissioner. They will be subject to the same Parliamentary approval, review requirements, and will be consistent in their legal effects, meaning that they are automatically admissible as evidence where relevant to issues in legal proceedings, and courts and tribunals will be required to take them into account where relevant. The DUAA also strengthens the processes through which the ICO develops these codes, with the new statutory requirements to consult a panel on a draft of the code and to publish impact assessments.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 92 of the DUAA inserts new section124A into the DPA 2018, amends sections 125, 126 and 129, and omits section 128 of the DPA 2018. It also amends the Registration Service Act 1953, the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and the Digital Economy Act 2017.

Section 93 of the DUAA inserts new sections 124B and 124C into the DPA 2018.

Provision(s) in the DUAASection 94
Title Information Commissioner's role – manifestly unfounded or excessive requests
Description of measureThe Commissioner is permitted to charge a reasonable fee or refuse requests from data subjects or data protection officers which are manifestly unfounded or excessive. The DUAA extends this to requests made by any person.It remains the case that the Commissioner is expected to respond to a request in most cases, with no charge. And in those instances where a request is deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive, it is for the Commissioner to show that it is.
How is this different from previous legislation?While the DPA 2018 permits the Commissioner to charge a reasonable fee or refuse a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, this only applies to requests from data subjects or data protection officers. These changes take account of the Commissioner's broad range of stakeholders and will enable the regulator to act proportionately.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 94 of the DUAA amends sections 135 and 136 of the DPA 2018 and omits Article 57(4) of the UK GDPR.

Provision(s) in the DUAASections 95 and 102
Title Information Commissioner's role – analysis of performance
Description of measureThe DUAA introduces 2 new requirements to increase transparency of the Commissioner's activities and strengthen accountability to Parliament and other stakeholders. The first is the requirement for the Commissioner to publish an annual analysis of its performance, using Key Performance Indicators through which performance can be measured effectively. The second is the requirement for the Commissioner to publish an annual report on regulatory action, including the nature of investigations, the time taken and the powers used.
How is this different from previous legislation?This strengthens the reporting requirements for the ICO, increasing transparency and the means and metrics through which the ICO is held to account for its performance.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 95 of the DUAA inserts new section 139A into the DPA 2018.Section 102 of the DUAA amends section 139 and inserts new section 161A into the DPA 2018

Provision(s) in the DUAASections 96-101
Title ICO enforcement
Description of measureThe DUAA makes a number of changes to the Information Commissioner's enforcement powers. Firstly, it makes a clarificatory amendment to its power to issue information notices, to make it clear that an information notice can require recipients to provide documents.The Act  introduces two  new powers: extending the Commissioner's existing power to issue assessment notices to enable such notices to require an organisation to commission and pay for a report to assist in an investigation; and a new power to issue interview notices, which enables the Commissioner to require a person to attend an interview to answer questions.The Act  also makes changes to the time available to the Commissioner to issue a final penalty notice after issuing a notice of intent. The change means that the Commissioner must issue a final penalty notice within the period of 6 months, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter . If the Commissioner decides not to issue a penalty, this provision also contains a new requirement to give a written notice stating this.The DUAA  removes an exemption to the Commissioner's power to issue assessment notices to Ofsted in relation to its registration function for children's homes, family centres, or adoption/fostering agencies.  The removal of this exemption means that the relevant functions of Ofsted are subject to appropriate scrutiny of their data protection practices and processes where necessary. 
How is this different from previous legislation?This makes changes to 2 existing provisions: firstly, making clear that the information notice power in section 142 of the DPA 2018 empowers the Commissioner to request documents and secondly, amending the notice of intent in Schedule 16 of the DPA 2018 to allow the ICO more time to issue a penalty notice where needed.The DUAA introduces 2 new investigatory powers which are designed to enable the Commissioner to obtain the evidence it needs to inform investigations and monitor compliance with the data protection framework.The power to commission a report adds a new element to the assessment notice power in section 146 of the DPA 2018. In practice, while investigating compliance with the data protection regime, the Commissioner may need further information that goes beyond what organisation has shared or where this is particularly technical, such as on how specific encryption systems work. The organisation receiving notice from the Commissioner to commission such a report will need to identify an appropriate person to produce a report to the Commissioner's specifications (or the Commissioner can appoint someone if they are not able to). The organisation will also need to pay for the report, which will then be shared with the organisation and the Commissioner. It will be used by the Commissioner to support his understanding of how personal data is being processed.The Act introduces a second new power after section 148 of the DPA 2018. At present, the Commissioner can call a person to interview on a voluntary basis. The new interview notice power enables the Commissioner to require a person to attend an interview. If a person decides not to answer questions and if the Commissioner decides there has been an infringement of the data protection legislation and if enforcement action is appropriate, then this may be considered an aggravating factor and could result in a higher fine than had they cooperated. There are also criminal sanctions if an individual knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement under questioning.

Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 97 of DUAA amends section 142 DPA 2018 and makes consequential amendments to sections 143, 145, 148, 160 and Schedule 17.
Section 98 of DUAA amends section 146 DPA 2018 and adds new section 146A. This also makes consequential amendments to sections 155 and 160 of the DPA 2018.Section 99 of DUAA amends section 147 of the DPA 2018.Section 100 of DUAA adds new sections 148A, 148B and 148C after section 148 of the DPA 2018.

Provision(s) in the DUAASection 103; Schedule 10
Title Information Commissioner's role – enforcement - complaints by data subjectsDescription of measureThe DUAA introduces a requirement for controllers to put in place a complaint-handling process, ensuring that data subjects are able to lodge complaints directly with the controller. The Act requires controllers to acknowledge receipt of the complaint within a period of 30 days, and to take appropriate steps to respond to the complaint.The Act also provides that the Secretary of State may legislate in the future to require a controller to notify the Information Commissioner of the number of complaints made in a given time-period.
How is this different from previous legislation?This creates new statutory requirements for controllers to put in place complaints-handling processes and to respond to complaints lodged with them by data subjects.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 103 of the DUAA inserts new sections 164A and 164B into the DPA 2018.Schedule 10 of the DUAA makes consequential amendments to the UK GDPR and DPA 2018.

Provision(s) in the DUAASection 105
TitleElectronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations 2016 (EITSET)
Description of measure The DUAA amends the Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations 2016 (EITSET) to ensure certain new and amended enforcement powers are available for the Information Commissioner for the purposes of regulating trust service providers under the UK eIDAS Regulation.  The changes are expected to facilitate regulatory investigations and to help ensure that the Information Commissioner continues to be able to act as an effective supervisory body for trust service providers established in the UK.
How is this different from previous legislation?The amendments made to the current enforcement provisions within the DPA 2018 apply equally to the Information Commissioner's enforcement powers as the supervisory body for trust service providers, including the new enforcement power to require an organisation to commission and pay for a technical report to assist in an investigation by issuing an assessment notice (an extension of the Information Commissioner's existing power to issue assessment notices), and the new enforcement power to require a person to attend an interview and answer questions.The new offence of intentionally or recklessly making a false statement in response to an interview notice will also apply to trust service providers.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 105 amends sections 146A, 148A, 148B and 148C of the DPA 2018.

Provision(s) in the DUAASection 115; Schedule 13 
Title Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PEC Regulations) - Commissioner's enforcement powers Description of measureThe DUAA updates the Commissioner's powers of enforcement in relation to the PEC Regulations. It applies some of the more modern approach to enforcement powers, as already set out in Parts 5 to 7 of the DPA 2018. The new powers include, amongst other things: powers for the Commissioner to impose information notices, assessment notices, enforcement notices, and penalty notices; the power to commission a report; the interview notice power; and the relevant rights of appeal for persons who wish to appeal against the imposition of such notices.The new applied powers are subject to modifications, to make them relevant to the PEC Regulations, set out in new schedule 1.The DUAA also introduces a delegated power, which permits the Secretary of State to amend the fixed monetary penalty amount for infringements of regulation 5A (Personal data breach).
How is this different from previous legislation?Currently Part V and Sections 55A to 55E of, and Schedules 6 and 9 to, the Data Protection Act 1998 are applied for the purposes of enforcing the PEC Regulations. These provisions are subject to modifications set out in schedule 1.The DUAA aligns the PEC Regulations' enforcement sanctions (powers and fines) with the DPA 2018. These reforms will ensure the regulator has the tools it needs to enforce effectively and reflects the increasingly complex nature of some investigations.
Which provision(s) in the UK GDPR and/or the DPA 2018 are changing?Section 115 amends regulation 5C of the PEC Regulations and repeals and replaces regulation 31 and Schedule 1. It also repeals regulations 5(6), 5B, 31A and 31B of the PEC Regulations.

Provision(s) in the DUAASections 117-120; Schedule 14
TitleThe Information Commission
Description of measureThe DUAA establishes a body corporate, the Information Commission, to replace the Information Commissioner's Office, which is structured as a corporation sole.

Avalanche's ecosystem growth and Morpho's DeFi traction earn spots on Grayscale's latest list, diverging from XRP's path.

Grayscale has updated its Top 20 crypto assets for the third quarter of 2025, naming Avalanche (AVAX) and Morpho as new entrants while dropping Optimism and Lido DAO, according to a July 26 report.

The firm emphasized that the changes reflect a research-driven selection process that favors on-chain traction over popularity or market capitalization.

Following these additions, the Top 20 list includes a mix of established names such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and Chainlink, along with DeFi protocols like Aave, Uniswap, Hyperliquid, and newer entrants like Bittensor, Ethena, Story Protocol, Aerodrome, and Geodnet.

Grayscale said Avalanche made the cut following a noticeable increase in activity across its ecosystem.

The investment firm explained that Avalanche has seen meaningful growth in transaction volumes, which may be linked to the integration of blockchain-powered gaming titles and stablecoin usage.

While the long-term sustainability of this growth remains uncertain, the firm sees it as a promising signal of traction within the network.

On the other hand, Grayscale stated that it added DeFi lending protocol Morpho due to its rapid growth in the past year.

According to the firm, Morpho doubled its total value to over $4 billion and generated an annualized fee income approaching $100 million during the past year.

In addition, its newly launched second version aims to attract institutional players and further strengthen its position in the decentralized finance space.

Considering this, Grayscale wrote:

“Grayscale Research is optimistic about the future of on-chain lending activity, and Morpho seems well positioned to potentially capture a meaningful share of that growth (along with the other lending-related protocols on the Top 20 list, Aave and Maple Finance).”

Notably, Grayscale's revised list does not include several high-profile digital assets such as XRP, Cardano, BNB, and TRON.

While these assets remain among the largest by market cap, Grayscale clarified that its Top 20 list focuses on assets with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts, and sustainable network activity.

Meanwhile, those assets have seen significant ecosystem developments and institutional adoption this year.

For context, XRP has seen increased attention in recent months, partly due to Ripple's enterprise partnerships and continued expansion of the XRP Ledger.

The same can be said for Cardano, which has made strides with its scaling roadmap and plans to incorporate Bitcoin within its DeFi ecosystem.

However, both assets have underperformed the broader market despite the current bullish sentiments in the industry.

CryptoSlate's data shows that XRP has declined more than 4% since the start of the year and remains roughly 45% below its all-time high. At the same time, Cardano's ADA has fallen over 35% in the same period and sits more than 80% below peak levels.

So, this lack of price momentum may be one reason for their continued exclusion.

Bolt, San Francisco-based checkout and payments platform, said on Friday it has added support for stablecoin payments, a move aimed at streamlining cross-border commerce for marketplaces and merchants using its network.

The addition is part of Bolt Connect, a new product focused on helping digital marketplaces scale quickly by automating merchant onboarding, compliance and payouts.

For merchants, receiving stablecoin payments means fewer bank intermediaries, faster settlements and lower transaction costs, the company explained the initiative in the press release. Consumers can benefit, too: a shopper without a bank account or buying from a store across the world can pay instantly using digital dollars without incurring foreign transaction fees or waiting on credit card clearances.

""Marketplaces shouldn't have to choose between scale and simplicity,"" said Ryan Breslow, Founder and CEO of Bolt. ""With Bolt Connect, we're giving them the tools to grow without the usual technical burden, while stablecoin support opens the door to faster, borderless payments for everyone in the network.""

Bolt is the latest example of global payment firms like Mastercard, Visa and Stripe racing to embrace stablecoins, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies, into their offerings. It's a $260 billion, and rapidly growing, asset class which promises programmable transactions and faster, cheaper cross-border payments than through traditional banking channels. Adoption is expected to accelerate after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act to regulate the stablecoin sector.

Bolt's stablecoin initiative came on the heels of debuting its financial ""SuperApp"" that allows users to hold, send and receive cryptocurrencies including stablecoins within the application.

Hold your hats—big changes are lurking just around the corner in the world of cryptocurrency, and the GENIUS Act has emerged as a lightning rod for this transformation. Far more than an ordinary piece of legislation, this ambitious proposal could redefine America's place in the burgeoning digital asset domain and influence perceptions of the U.S. dollar on the global stage. As regulatory tides shift, let's peel back the layers of the GENIUS Act and explore its profound implications for the future of digital currencies.

The essence of the GENIUS Act lies in its effort to clarify the muddled waters of digital assets and replace the current confusion with a coherent framework. This legislation seeks to lay down rigorous guidelines designed to enhance consumer safety and encourage institutional players to dive into the cryptocurrency realm. Noteworthy features include:

With these robust measures, the GENIUS Act aspires to normalize the presence of digital assets, embracing innovation while ensuring consumer protections.

This act is not just another regulatory move; it stands as a historical declaration of the U.S. dollar's enduring supremacy. By devising a thorough framework for digital assets, lawmakers are reinforcing the dollar's global standing at a time when the digital landscape is rapidly evolving. Clarity in regulations creates a fertile ground for innovation and restores investor confidence in cryptocurrency ventures.

Bo Hines, currently leading the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, stated emphatically, ""We are well on our way to making the United States the Crypto Capital of the World."" This ambitious vision underscores the pressing need to integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system, notably through initiatives like the proposed Bitcoin Act, which aims to incorporate Bitcoin reserves within the U.S. Treasury.

As the U.S. strives to solidify its position in the digital finance arena, a global race to establish regulatory frameworks has escalated. Nations across the globe are rushing to chalk out their regulations, each eager to carve out their space in the expanding crypto economy. The GENIUS Act could become a touchstone for international regulatory standards, emphasizing the critical balance between compliance and innovation.

This push for regulatory clarity is resonating far beyond U.S. borders; it signals a broader global movement, capturing the attention of institutional investors ready to navigate the crypto trading sphere with newfound assurance. By setting forth clear guidelines, the GENIUS Act could help establish a well-balanced international financial ecosystem, enhancing the U.S.'s credibility while motivating other nations to refine their own cryptocurrency regulations.

However, this promise of a well-ordered market comes with potential hurdles for smaller Web3 startups. With compliance regulations and operational costs mounting, larger, established firms may find themselves at an advantage, which could stifle budding innovation. New players in the ever-evolving landscape must remain nimble, adeptly maneuvering through the regulatory maze.

To thrive amidst these new demands, startups should zero in on integrated crypto-fiat payment solutions that can effectively manage regulatory risks—a requirement that becomes increasingly vital for offshore crypto companies. Their survival hinges on building trust and finding a distinctive niche in this crowded marketplace.

With the GENIUS Act ushering in a transformative regulatory epoch, the familiar dynamics of the crypto market are on the verge of significant upheaval. The regulatory clarity it promises could amplify institutional interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more, fostering increased confidence in the digital asset landscape.

Stakeholders—from influencers to traditional financial institutions—must prioritize compliance in their strategies. The complex relationship between regulatory oversight and market commercialization will shape the rhythm of innovation and growth in the crypto environment moving forward.

The introduction of the GENIUS Act signifies a substantial leap—one that intertwines the vast possibilities of digital assets with the enduring legacy of the U.S. dollar. As we anticipate its ramifications, it becomes clear that the future of finance will hinge on the synchronization of groundbreaking technologies with our existing economic frameworks. While challenges beckon for smaller innovators, the promise of clearer regulations holds the potential to redefine the landscape of international finance and establish a new hierarchy within digital assets. All eyes will be fixed on the U.S. as it navigates this pivotal moment, shaping not just its financial legacy, but also the trajectory of the global financial system.

Shares in Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) are fast approaching an overvaluation threshold, 10x Research, headed by Markus Thielen, said Friday. Thielen is recommending a pair trade that comprises a short position in COIN and a simultaneous long position in bitcoin BTC$107,068.90.

In a note sent to clients, Thielen explained that Coinbase's fundamentals, mainly trading volumes, haven't kept pace with the rally in share prices, which are fast nearing the overvaluation threshold, a classic setup for a ""tactical reversal.""

""While Coinbase hasn't quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it's approaching fast, and despite being one of the few high-quality, listed crypto plays, its current premium suggests the risk of underperformance ahead,"" Thielen detailed. ""Traders looking to capitalize on this dislocation might consider going long Bitcoin while shorting Coinbase, or using options by selling a COIN call and buying a BTC call to express the same view with defined risk.""

According to 10x's linear regression model, 75% of Coinbase's stock price action is explained by bitcoin's price and trading volumes. That means just 25% of COIN's price action is led by other factors, such as the potential impact of Circle's IPO or U.S. crypto and macro developments.

In quantitative terms, it suggests that COIN's price tends to rise by $20 for every $10,000 move in BTC and by $24 for every $100 billion increase in trading volume.

The recent price action suggests the rally is overextended relative to bitcoin's price and trading volumes. Shares in Coinbase have surged 84% over the past two months, while bitcoin has risen by just 14%.

""Not only is this premium stretched relative to bitcoin's current price, but it also appears disconnected from underlying crypto trading volumes, which are hovering around $108 billion,"" said Thielen. ""This rare deviation suggests Coinbase's valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion.""

The report said that other factors – Circle's IPO on June 3, the June 17 “GENIUS” stablecoin bill and the buying frenzy from Korean investors – seem to have been priced in.

""As this momentum cools, evident in the recent reversals of Circle, KakaoPay, and Metaplanet, there is growing risk that Coinbase shares could also be nearing a local top,"" Thielen said.

 Countries that ban crypto payments often have no restrictions on using crypto abroad, but such legal overlaps may attract scrutiny from global regulators like the FATF. 

The popularity of stablecoins for cryptocurrency payments has increased in recent years, with many global companies embracing new payment methods.

Despite the trend, crypto payments remain prohibited for retail users in multiple countries, including China, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey and others.

Still, while domestic crypto payments may be banned in these jurisdictions, using cryptocurrency to pay for services abroad may be legally permissible, according to some legal experts and observers of crypto regulation.

“As a general rule, the laws of a country apply only to events occurring within that country or to its own citizens,” said Meric Paldimoglu, a lawyer in Turkey and managing partner of Paldimoglu Law Firm.

In early June 2025, Georgian travel company Tripzy began accepting payments in Tether's USDt (USDT) stablecoin via the CityPay infrastructure, allowing international clients to book services using the stablecoin.

“We started accepting cryptocurrency to offer our clients more freedom and convenience in payment,” a Tripzy spokesperson told Cointelegraph. “This is especially relevant for guests from countries with currency restrictions or just for those who value the speed of transactions,” the spokesperson added.

Given that Georgia relies heavily on tourism from countries like Russia and Turkey — where crypto payments are restricted for residents — the new feature raises questions about the legality of cross-border payments for travelers from these jurisdictions.

However, there are no laws explicitly prohibiting the use of cryptocurrency for payments made abroad.

“Russian Federal Law No. 259 On Digital Financial Assets has never prohibited the use of cryptocurrency for payments made outside of Russia,” Yuriy Brisov, founder of D&A CryptoMap, told Cointelegraph. He said that the Russian laws currently only forbid residents from accepting crypto specifically for contractual purposes.

Paldimoglu shared a similar perspective while addressing the issue in relation to the Turkish laws.

“When a Turkish citizen shops from a company based abroad, Turkish law does not apply,” the lawyer stated. He said the Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments specifically applies to licensed payment and electronic money institutions operating in Turkey.

“So it is legal for Turkish citizens to shop on foreign websites, and I do not believe this would cause any issues between Georgia and Turkey,” he added.

While not creating new explicit conflicts between the jurisdictions that allow crypto payments and those that do not, such regulatory overlaps are more likely to attract the attention of global authorities, according to Brisov.

“If Georgian companies, like Tripzy, start accepting crypto from Russian tourists, this may be seen in Brussels as a loophole,” he said, adding:

A single travel agency may not trigger any sanctions from European authorities, though, Brisov suggested. Still, if patterns emerge, the response could escalate — not from Russia but from the global system that enforces compliance, he speculated.

Brisov's remarks align with recent warnings from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on the increasing role of stablecoins in facilitating illicit transactions.

“Since 2024, the use of stablecoins by illicit actors, including DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] actors and terrorist financiers, has risen, with most onchain illicit activity now involving stablecoins,” the FATF stated in an update on the implementation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures in crypto.

The agency also provided a detailed report on various AML measures taken by FATF member countries and other jurisdictions and pledged to provide a targeted report on stablecoins in the first quarter of 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","The Rodents of Chicago Are Evolving in Real Time, Scientists Say","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a65197537/chicago-rodent-evolution/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

The rats aren't what they used to be.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

As Pizza Rat proved, some creatures can adapt to just about anything, even the concrete jungle. And it isn't just New York City—Chicago rodents have become so used to city life that they have actually evolved for urbanization.

Anyone who lives in Chicago might think nothing of a chipmunk scurrying by, but all the scraps of processed food that the local chipmunks have pilfered from human garbage cans have both made them larger than they used to be and shrunk their teeth. And as a result of all the horns honking, brakes screeching, and everything else that turns up the volume of a bustling city, voles have developed smaller inner ears to turn down the noise. 

Humans have obviously had a profound impact on the environment. By studying chipmunk and vole specimens hidden away in the backroom drawers of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, a research team—lead by assistant curator of mammals Anderson Feijó, along with mammalogist and XCT lab manager Stephanie Smith—found that there have been morphological changes to the skulls of these animals over the last 125 years. The changes have corresponded with the growth and industrialization of the Chicago metro area.

“These different patterns between chipmunks and voles reveal species-specific responses to the same human-induced habitat changes and the need for nuanced conservation plans in the face of continuing change,” Smith and Feijó said in a study recently published in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology. 

Skulls were the focus of this research because they reflect the effects of habitat and ecology on the animals' diets, sensory systems, navigational abilities, cognitive abilities, and body sizes. Voles and chipmunks were chosen because their biologies and proximity to humans were thought to be different enough from each other to show distinct responses to urban stressors. Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) are squirrel relatives, while eastern meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) are more closely related to hamsters. Most previous studies on the effects of urbanization have looked at body size, but not much else. 

Feijó and Smith compared the usual habits and habitats of chipmunks and voles. Eastern chipmunks forage throughout the year in woods with thick canopies and open understories, hoarding nuts and seeds in their burrows when they hibernate in the winter. Voles live in dense grasslands, nesting on the ground and eating mostly grasses and the occasional insect. Most urban specimens were collected after 1980, while specimens from less urbanized areas were from before 1950.

After measuring different sections of specimen skulls and taking surface scans,  the researchers found that both species experienced changes due to a number of factors, including temperature. The skulls of chipmunks have a wider brain case, are flatter than they used to be, and feature a longer rostrum (the frontal part of the skull containing the palate and nasal cavity), which could be a result of specific navigation needs. Their auditory bullae—bony structures near the back of the skull that protect parts of the inner ear and convert sound waves into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain—have also shifted backward. 

Like chipmunks, urban voles had flatter skulls and auditory bullae that were further back. Their auditory bullae have also shrunk as a result of needing to handle the loud, incessant noises of Chicago. While voles' average body size has remained virtually the same, other cranial bones revealed that the creatures have actually been affected by urbanization more than chipmunks. Vole skulls from more urbanized sites were not as diverse in shape as those from regions that were less urbanized, which could mean that the lower variance in closed urban environments keep voles more morphologically similar to each other. 

It became obvious that chipmunks in urban areas are increasing in size, and their rows of teeth have grown shorter. The researchers think this is because more food is available throughout the year, and that chipmunks having more human interaction has put more things on the menu. Among the free meals chipmunks grab in the city are high-calorie, highly processed foods that add body weight and are easier to chew than nuts (meaning they don't need to use their teeth as much). Urban brown rats have been experiencing the same evolutionary phenomenon.

“As cities continue to sprawl and push outwards, understanding complex morphological responses to increasing urbanization and associated effects can elucidate the impact of human population growth on biota,” the researchers said. “[It can] help us forecast how wild populations will cope with continuing change in the coming decades.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This breakthrough turns old tech into pure gold — No mercury, no cyanide, just light and salt","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250626081540.htm","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 06:04:51 GMT","

An interdisciplinary team of experts in green chemistry, engineering and physics at Flinders University in Australia has developed a safer and more sustainable approach to extract and recover gold from ore and electronic waste.

Explained in the leading journal Nature Sustainability, the gold-extraction technique promises to reduce levels of toxic waste from mining and shows that high purity gold can be recovered from recycling valuable components in printed circuit boards in discarded computers.

The project team, led by Matthew Flinders Professor Justin Chalker, applied this integrated method for high-yield gold extraction from many sources - even recovering trace gold found in scientific waste streams.

The progress toward safer and more sustainable gold recovery was demonstrated for electronic waste, mixed-metal waste, and ore concentrates.

""The study featured many innovations including a new and recyclable leaching reagent derived from a compound used to disinfect water,"" says Professor of Chemistry Justin Chalker, who leads the Chalker Lab at Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering.

""The team also developed an entirely new way to make the polymer sorbent, or the material that binds the gold after extraction into water, using light to initiate the key reaction.""

Extensive investigation into the mechanisms, scope and limitations of the methods are reported in the new study, and the team now plans to work with mining and e-waste recycling operations to trial the method on a larger scale.

""The aim is to provide effective gold recovery methods that support the many uses of gold, while lessening the impact on the environment and human health,"" says Professor Chalker.

The new process uses a low-cost and benign compound to extract the gold. This reagent (trichloroisocyanuric acid) is widely used in water sanitation and disinfection. When activated by salt water, the reagent can dissolve gold.

Next, the gold can be selectively bound to a novel sulfur-rich polymer developed by the Flinders team. The selectivity of the polymer allows gold recovery even in highly complex mixtures.

The gold can then be recovered by triggering the polymer to ""un-make"" itself and convert back to monomer. This allows the gold to be recovered and the polymer to be recycled and re-used.

Global demand for gold is driven by its high economic and monetary value but is also a vital element in electronics, medicine, aerospace technologies and other products and industries. However, mining the previous metal can involve the use of highly toxic substances such as cyanide and mercury for gold extraction - and other negative environmental impacts on water, air and land including CO2 emissions and deforestation.

The aim of the Flinders-led project was to provide alternative methods that are safer than mercury or cyanide in gold extraction and recovery.

The team also collaborated with experts in the US and Peru to validate the method on ore, in an effort to support small-scale mines that otherwise rely on toxic mercury to amalgamate gold.

Gold mining typically uses highly toxic cyanide to extract gold from ore, with risks to the wildlife and the broader environment if it is not contained properly. Artisanal and small-scale gold mines still use mercury to amalgamate gold. Unfortunately, the use of mercury in gold mining is one of the largest sources of mercury pollution on Earth.

Professor Chalker says interdisciplinary research collaborations with industry and environmental groups will help to address highly complex problems that support the economy and the environment.

""We are especially grateful to our engineering, mining, and philanthropic partners for supporting translation of laboratory discoveries to larger scale demonstrations of the gold recovery techniques.""

Lead authors of the major new study - Flinders University postdoctoral research associates Dr Max Mann, Dr Thomas Nicholls, Dr Harshal Patel and Dr Lynn Lisboa - extensively tested the new technique on piles of electronic waste, with the aim of finding more sustainable, circular economy solutions to make better use of ever-more-scarce resources in the world. Many components of electronic waste, such as CPU units and RAM cards, contain valuable metals such as gold and copper.

Dr Mann says: ""This paper shows that interdisciplinary collaborations are needed to address the world's big problems managing the growing stockpiles of e-waste.""

ARC DECRA Fellow Dr Nicholls, adds: ""The newly developed gold sorbent is made using a sustainable approach in which UV light is used to make the sulfur-rich polymer. Then, recycling the polymer after the gold has been recovered further increases the green credentials of this method.""

Dr Patel says: ""We dived into a mound of e-waste and climbed out with a block of gold! I hope this research inspires impactful solutions to pressing global challenges.""

""With the ever-growing technological and societal demand for gold, it is increasingly important to develop safe and versatile methods to purify gold from varying sources,"" Dr Lisboa concludes.

Fast Facts: 

Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world. In 2022, an estimated 62 million tonnes of e-waste was produced globally. Only 22.3% was documented as formally collected and recycled.

E-waste is considered hazardous waste as it contains toxic materials and can produce toxic chemicals when recycled inappropriately. Many of these toxic materials are known or suspected to cause harm to human health, and several are included in the 10 chemicals of public health concern, including dioxins, lead and mercury. Inferior recycling of e-waste is a threat to public health and safety.

Miners use mercury, which binds to gold particles in ores, to create what are known as amalgams. These are then heated to evaporate the mercury, leaving behind gold but releasing toxic vapours. Studies indicate that up to 33% of artisanal miners suffer from moderate metallic mercury vapor intoxication.

Between 10 million and 20 million miners in more than 70 countries work in artisanal and small-scale gold mining, including up to 5 million women and children. These operations, which are often unregulated and unsafe, generate 37% of global mercury pollution (838 tonnes a year) - more than any other sector.

Most informal sites lack the funding and training needed to transition towards mercury-free mining. Despite accounting for 20% of the global gold supply and generating approximately US$30 billion annually, artisanal miners typically sell gold at around 70% of its global market value. Additionally, with many gold mines located in rural and remote areas, miners seeking loans are often restricted to predatory interest rates from illegal sources, pushing demand for mercury.

Genetic and dietary cues are known drivers of obesity, yet how they converge at the molecular level is incompletely understood. Here we show that PPARγ supports hypertrophic expansion of adipose tissue via transcriptional control of LPCAT3, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident O-acyltransferase that selectively enriches diet-derived omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) in the membrane lipidome. In mice fed a high-fat diet, lowering membrane n-6 PUFA levels through genetic or dietary interventions results in aberrant adipose triglyceride (TG) turnover, ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance. Additionally, we detail a non-canonical adaptive response in ‘lipodystrophic' Lpcat3–/– adipose tissues that engages a futile lipid cycle to increase metabolic rate and offset lipid overflow to ectopic sites. Live-cell imaging, lipidomics and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that adipocyte LPCAT3 activity enriches n-6 arachidonate in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-dense ER–lipid droplet interface. Functionally, this localized PE remodelling optimizes TG storage by driving the formation of large droplets that exhibit greater resistance to adipose TG lipase activity. These findings highlight the PPARγ–LPCAT3 axis as a mechanistic link between dietary n-6 PUFA intake, adipose expandability and systemic energy balance.

(a) qPCR analysis of Lpcat1-4 mRNA levels in eWAT and iWAT of 12-week-old NCD-fed wild-type mice (n = 5, 5), and (b) in iWAT from wild-type mice fed low-fat diet (LFD) with or without rosiglitazone (Rosi; 50 mg kg–1) for 14 days (n = 7, 7). (c) Immunoblot analysis of LPCAT3 protein levels in iWAT lysates from (b). Tubulin served as a sample processing control. (d) Immunoblot analysis of LPCAT3 protein levels and known adipogenic markers during the course of 10T1/2 adipocyte differentiation. Calnexin served as a loading control for LPCAT3. (e) Sequence alignment of conserved PPAR and LXR response elements in the Lpcat3 promoter across multiple species. The PAM sequence of sgRNAs targeting Lpcat3-PPRE and LXRE are underlined in red. (f) ChIP-qPCR analysis of PPARγ (or normal rabbit IgG) occupancy at Lpcat3, Plin1, Fabp4, Agpat2, or Aqp7 PPRE elements in wild-type and ΔPPRE 10T1/2 adipocytes (n = 3/group; 100–mm plate per replicate from 3 independent experiments). A region of the 36b4 promoter served as a negative control. (g) PCR analysis of a 700-bp genomic segment flanking the PPRE/LXRE sites in the Lpcat3 promoter region of WT, ΔPPRE, and ΔLXRE clonally-derived cell lines, revealing no major deletions introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Primer anneal sites in the Lpcat3 promoter are shown in orange, indels in green (insertions) or red (deletions). (h) Immunoblot analysis of LPCAT3 protein levels in WT, ΔPPRE, and ΔLXRE 10T1/2 adipocytes differentiated for 4 days. Calnexin served as a loading control for LPCAT3. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ***P < 0.001 by Welch's t-tests with FDR correction using the Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli procedure (b); or one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test (f).

Coronary arteries develop under constant mechanical stress. However, the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in this process remains poorly understood. Here we show that the ion channel PIEZO2, which responds to mechanical stimuli, is expressed in specific coronary endothelial cell populations during a critical phase of coronary vasculature remodeling. These Piezo2+ coronary endothelial cells show distinct transcriptional profiles and have mechanically activated ionic currents. Strikingly, PIEZO2 loss-of-function mouse embryos and mice with human pathogenic variants of PIEZO2 show abnormal coronary vessel development and cardiac left ventricular hyperplasia. We conclude that an optimal balance of PIEZO2 channel function contributes to proper coronary vessel formation, structural integrity and remodeling, and is likely to support normal cardiac function. Our study highlights the importance of mechanical cues in cardiovascular development and suggests that defects in this mechanosensing pathway may contribute to congenital heart conditions.

The branching system of the coronary vasculature has a unique structure adapted to the particular physiology of the heart muscle. During its formation in the embryo and throughout adult life, the coronary vasculature is uniquely challenged by mechanical loads from the heartbeat more than 100,000 times a day and from coronary perfusion pressure. The coronary arteries are particularly susceptible to disease. Pathologies of these vessels are a main cause of ischemic heart disease, a leading cause of mortality in Western societies1. In this context, a better understanding of embryonic coronary artery formation processes holds the potential to recreate and enhance the developmental process for coronary artery regeneration under disease conditions.

Embryonic coronary vasculature formation involves the intricate orchestration of endothelial cell populations, originating from three primary sources: the sinus venosus (SV), the endocardium and the (pro)epicardium2. While the role of chemotaxis in guiding angiogenesis is well described, also for coronary vasculature3,4, there is emerging evidence that mechanical guidance cues, termed durotaxis, have a role in the patterning and morphogenesis of blood vessels5. However, there are only few reports on the presence and function of mechanosensitive ion channels in endothelial cells during vasculogenesis or angiogenesis6. In particular, piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (PIEZO1), which is widely expressed in many cell types7, is known to play an important role in the initiation of embryonic vessel formation and function8,9. PIEZO1-deficient mice show disrupted vascularization and a failure in the maturation of endothelial cells into larger blood vessels9,10. The role of its homolog, piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) in angiogenesis during embryonic development has so far not been explored. However, expression of Piezo2 in endothelial cells of the brain and lungs has been suggested before8,11. One study reported PIEZO2 to be involved in tumor angiogenesis12, and another study described a dramatic loss of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in endothelial cell-specific Piezo2 knockout rats13.

Ever since the discovery of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels7, PIEZO2 has been primarily characterized as a sensory ion channel, present in a variety of sensory neuron types, the function of which is to sense mechanical forces important for touch, interoception and pain14,15. Importantly, PIEZO2 pathogenic variants are associated with congenital disorders in humans, including joint, craniofacial, brain and cardiovascular defects16,17. Interestingly, the University of Cambridge PhenoScanner V2 database of human genotype–phenotype associations suggests a PIEZO2 genetic linkage with heart failure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertensive heart disease and thoracic aortic aneurysm18. However, the precise function of mechanosensitive PIEZO2 channels in non-sensory cells, including endothelial cells, remains largely unstudied. In particular, a specific function of mechanosensitive ion channels in coronary artery endothelial cells during embryonic development has not been studied. Here we aimed to investigate the role of PIEZO2 in the developing cardiovascular system. Using a combination of genetic fate mapping, single-cell sequencing, physiological analysis and light-sheet imaging, our study uncovers a unique role of PIEZO2 channels in shaping the coronary vasculature during development. Specifically, we show that dysfunction or loss of PIEZO2 leads to aberrant coronary artery branching, impaired vessel morphology and cardiac hyperplasia.

To delineate the trajectory and contribution of Piezo2+ cells in the mouse embryonic heart, we used a genetic fate mapping approach in which Piezo2-Cre (ref. 15) drives tdTomato expression in Piezo2-expressing cells and their progeny (Piezo2-tdTomato mice) (Fig. 1a). Whole-mount three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging revealed specific populations of tdTomato-positive (tdTomato+) cells in the heart at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) (Fig. 1b). We found tdTomato+ cells in the SV and the nascent coronary plexus (CP), and we identified them as endothelial cells positive for endomucin (EMCN) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) (Fig. 1b, arrowheads). At E13.5, the tdTomato+ cell population had expanded to form a nascent coronary endothelial plexus as evidenced by cells staining positive for the pan-endothelial marker platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) (Fig. 1c). Whole-mount confocal microscopy also revealed that tdTomato+ cells were positive for Dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1), a transcription factor specifically expressed in embryonic coronary endothelial cells3,19 (Fig. 1d). Thus, the Piezo2-expressing cell lineage specifically contributes to the developing coronary vasculature. At E13.5, the coronary plexus finally connects to the ascending aorta and triggers plexus remodeling into a mature vasculature. At E18.5, tdTomato+ cells now clearly form the neonatal coronary vasculature as revealed by light-sheet microscopy imaging of the entire heart (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Video 1). Optical sections through the whole-mount light-sheet images highlighted the connection of the tdTomato+ fate-mapped vessels to the ascending aorta, indicating that these vessels are the coronary arteries (Supplementary Video 2). The coronary vessel character was verified on transverse cryosections, and we identified tdTomato+ cells as coronary endothelial cells by fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) staining20 (Fig. 2b). Further characterization showed that tdTomato+ cells contribute to both small arteries in the remodeling zone (DACH1 positive)3 (Fig. 2c) and mature arteries, which are positive for SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17)21 (Fig. 2d). EMCN-positive cells in the endocardium were negative for tdTomato signals (Fig. 2b–d), supporting the coronary nature of Piezo2 fate-mapped endothelial cells. We observed other non-endothelial cell types with tdTomato labeling, one in the outflow tract with morphological characteristics of vascular smooth muscle cells. These cells were also positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), confirming their identity as vascular smooth muscle cells. Cells making up all four valves of the heart were also tdTomato+ and were surrounded by endothelial cells, indicating their likely identity as valve interstitial cells (Extended Data Fig. 1). As Piezo2-lineage endothelial cells evidently contribute to coronary vasculature formation, we proceeded to analyze both, Piezo2 expression and the transcriptional profile of Piezo2-expressing cells.

Immunolabeling revealed that tdTomato+ cells comprise coronary endothelial cells of small (DACH1 positive) and mature (SOX17 positive) arteries, as well as endothelial cells in the coronary FABP4-positive population. tdTomato signals did not co-localize with EMCN in the endocardium (cyan), confirming the coronary endothelial cell nature of the tdTomato+ cells (scale bars, 25 µm) (n = 2).

While fate mapping provided insights into the trajectories of Piezo2-expressing cells, examining the transcriptional profile of Piezo2-expressing cells could help identify the developmental stages in which this mechanosensitive ion channel contributes to coronary development. By using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we could show continued Piezo2 mRNA expression in coronary endothelial cells at E13.5 along with Dach1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, single-cell RNA (scRNA) datasets from fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted cardiac endothelial fractions (CD31+ alias PECAM1+/CD45− alias PTPRC−) from four different stages: E12.5, E15.5, postnatal day (P) 2 and adult (8 weeks old) were used to monitor ongoing Piezo2 expression22. Unsupervised clustering was performed using the uniform manifold approximation and projection method, and cell type clusters were classified based on the expression profiles of the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs)22 (Fig. 3a). At E12.5, Piezo2 expression was mainly found in the coronary endothelial cells (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, at E15.5, Piezo2 expression was observed in two subclusters of coronary endothelial cells designated capillary-to-vein and capillary-to-artery, which are capillary cells22 (Fig. 3b). At P2, Piezo2 expression was still present in the same capillary cell types (cap-to-vein and cap-to-artery) and in the proliferating cell cluster (Fig. 3b). However, in adult hearts, no Piezo2 expression was found in any of the endothelial cell types analyzed (Fig. 3b). To quantify the proportion of Piezo2+ and Fabp4+ cells, we extracted data from our scRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis across different developmental stages (E12.5, E15.5, P2 and adult). The strong correlation between Piezo2+ and Fabp4+ endothelial cells across developmental stages (Fig. 3b) suggests that PIEZO2 is specifically enriched in a subset of coronary endothelial cells involved in vascular remodeling. The results show that over the developmental stages, the majority of Piezo2+ cells become also Fabp4+ (Fig. 3c). While Piezo2+/Fabp4+ cells persist through embryonic and early postnatal stages, Piezo2 expression is lost in adult endothelial cells (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). These data show a dynamic Piezo2 expression pattern in distinctive coronary endothelial cell populations during embryonic heart development. Given that Fabp4+ cells contribute to capillary-to-artery transitions, the co-expression of Piezo2 and Fabp4 indicates that PIEZO2-mediated mechanosensing may play a role in endothelial differentiation and artery formation.

We next asked whether Piezo2-expressing coronary endothelial cells show a distinct transcriptional profile when compared with coronary endothelial cells lacking Piezo2 expression (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Tables 1–3). At E12.5, Piezo2+ coronary endothelial cells showed higher expression of genes such as Neuropilin 2 (Nrp2), a receptor for semaphorin family members, and Apelin (Apln), a sprouting marker, both having been implicated in blood vessel formation23,24,25. We also noticed enrichment of collapsin response mediator protein 1 (Crmp1), a protein involved in neuronal migration and development26. Piezo2 was still enriched at E15.5 along with other well-known markers of coronary endothelial cells such as Fabp4 (ref. 27) and the capillary markers Rgcc (regulator of cell cycle) and Gpihbp1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1)28. At P2, Piezo2+ cells still showed enriched expression of Fabp4 and interestingly were positive for fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (Fscn1), an actin-bundling protein that can induce membrane protrusions and is involved in cell migration and motility29 (Fig. 3d). The PIEZO2 homolog PIEZO1 is a stretch-activated ion channel that is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system9,30. Consistently, our analysis revealed that numerous cell types show Piezo1 expression across all stages investigated (Extended Data Fig. 2b). By contrast, Piezo2 expression appeared to be maintained primarily in coronary endothelial cells specifically during the angiogenic phase of heart vascularization. The distinct transcriptional signature of Piezo2-expressing coronary endothelial cells, including Nrp2, Apln, Crmp1 and Fscn1, indicates potential roles in cell migration and motility. These findings provide insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maturation of coronary endothelial cells, highlighting the importance of PIEZO2 and associated markers in cardiovascular biology.

The electrophysiological function of PIEZO2 in endothelial cells has not been studied. PIEZO2 ion channels are very efficiently activated by substrate deflection but, unlike PIEZO1 channels, are poorly activated by membrane stretch31,32,33. We identified the yolk sac (YS) from E13.5 to E18.5 embryos as being rich in tdTomato+ endothelial cells, which may express functional PIEZO2 channels (Extended Data Fig. 3). We asked whether these cells possess functional mechanosensitive currents characteristic of PIEZO2 channels. We made whole-cell patch–clamp recordings from tdTomato+ and tdTomato− YS endothelial cells and cardiac endothelial cells (cECs) cultured on pillar arrays to study currents gated by substrate deflection31,32 (Fig. 4a). We also tried cell indentation, a method often used to activate mechanically activated channels31,32,34,35, but the endothelial cells were too small and flat to make this method feasible. Nanometer-scale pillar displacements move the substrate–cell contact and are limited to the pillar area (10.3 µm2). This mechanical stimulus efficiently evoked inward currents with short latencies (<5 ms) in almost all cells studied owing to the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels sub-adjacent to the stimulated pillus (tdTomato+, 12 of 13 cells; tdTomato−, 11 of 12 cells). Mechanosensitive currents could be classified into three groups with different inactivation time constants similar to what has been shown in sensory neurons32: rapidly adapting (RA) currents (<5 ms), intermediately adapting (IA) currents (5–50 ms) and slowly adapting (SA) currents (>51 ms) (Fig. 4b). Notably, the RA currents possessed ultrafast kinetics in that many of the currents inactivated within a millisecond (Fig. 4c). Very fast inactivation is a characteristic property of PIEZO2 channels, in contrast to PIEZO1 channels that inactivate much more slowly7,31,32. Consistently, RA currents with very fast inactivation kinetics were found to be significantly more frequent in tdTomato+ cells (chi-squared P < 0.05) (Fig. 4b). In addition, mean inactivation time constants for all measured currents were faster in tdTomato+ than in tdTomato− cells (Fig. 4c). The frequency with which mechanosensitive currents could be evoked was higher in tdTomato+ than in tdTomato− cells, indicating enhanced mechanosensitivity in Piezo2+ lineage cells. However, no statistically significant differences were observed when comparing deflection–current amplitude relationships (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4a). In summary, almost all YS endothelial cells possess very sensitive mechanically activated currents, but cells from the Piezo2+ lineage possessed more currents with kinetics characteristic of recombinantly expressed PIEZO2 channels7,32. To directly test what proportion of these mechanically activated currents were dependent on PIEZO2 channels, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown targeting Piezo2 in these cells followed by electrophysiological analysis. We could still measure mechanically activated currents in cells where Piezo2 was knocked down (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4d); however, the incidence of such currents was halved compared with controls (Fig. 4g). In control cells, we found mechanically gated currents in all cells measured, but after Piezo2 knockdown, around a quarter of the cells showed no mechanically gated currents (Extended Data Fig. 4c). The currents measured in the Piezo2 knockdown cells also tended to have slower inactivation kinetics, which is consistent with a loss of ultrafast inactivating currents mediated by PIEZO2 channels (Fig. 4f). To get closer to the role of mechanosensitive currents in the development of the coronary circulation, we managed to isolate tdTomato+ cECs from E13.5 hearts and cultured these cells on pillar arrays. Almost all cells identified as tdTomato+ 2 weeks after plating showed very robust and large mechanically activated currents to substrate deflection (14 of 15 cells tdTomato+, 7 of 8 cells tdTomato−) (Fig. 4a,h–j). However, unlike YS cells, the kinetics and current amplitudes of mechanosensitive currents did not differ between tdTomato+ and tdTomato− cells (Fig. 4h,i). We measured absolute deflection thresholds and currents were evoked by movements of less than 50 nm (Extended Data Fig. 4b); a similar sensitivity to that is seen for PIEZO2-dependent touch receptors32,36,37. However, the frequency with which mechanosensitive currents could be evoked was higher in cECs that were tdTomato+ (Fig. 4j). Thus, there appears to be clear PIEZO2-dependent endothelial cell mechanosensitivity, but other mechanosensitive ion channels such as PIEZO1 and ELKIN1 are probably also present9. Consistent with this idea, we could also measure clear stretch-activated currents, typical of PIEZO1 channels, in excised outside-out patches from tdTomato+ YS endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). In addition, calcium influx responses indicated that the PIEZO1 activator Yoda1 (ref. 38) induces calcium influx in the majority of tdTomato+ and tdTomato− YS cells (Extended Data Fig. 5). Furthermore, 63.6% of the tdTomato− and 66.6% of the tdTomato+ YS cells showed a significant YODA1 response, indicating that both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are present in YS endothelial cells. Moreover, Elkin1 transcripts were detected in the same endothelial cell populations in which we had detected Piezo2 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, apart from PIEZO2, other mechanosensitive ion channels contribute to mechanotransduction in yolk sacs and cECs.

We next asked whether PIEZO2 channels are necessary for normal heart development. As Piezo2−/− mutant mice die perinatally14,15, we examined hearts from these mice at E18.5. Piezo2−/− mutant hearts were smaller and shorter (base to apex length) at birth than those of wild-type (WT) Piezo2+/+ littermates (Fig. 5a,b). However, measuring heart-to-body weight ratios, we found that the ratios were increased in mutants, indicating that Piezo2−/− embryonic hearts were heavier than WT hearts (Fig. 5c). We made a detailed morphological analysis using the endocardial marker EMCN to differentiate between the trabecular myocardium (TM) and compact myocardium (CM) (Fig. 5d). The results revealed that Piezo2−/− hearts showed clear ventricular hyperplasia, which was most evident for the left ventricle (LV) (Fig. 5e,f). In addition, the interventricular septum (IVS) was also substantially thickened (Fig. 5g). No obvious outflow tract defects, such as common arterial trunk and double outflow tract right ventricle (RV), were observed in the Piezo2−/− mutants. Pulmonary artery and ascending aorta diameters were comparable between WT and Piezo2−/− hearts (Extended Data Fig. 7). Longitudinal and transverse sections of the valves showed clear separation of the leaflets (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Rare PIEZO2 pathogenic variants in humans are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Gordon syndrome and Marden–Walker syndrome as well as distal arthrogryposis16,17. We generated mice carrying a pathogenic homozygous gain-of-function mutation (Piezo2R2756H/R2756H) that dramatically sensitizes the activation of endogenous PIEZO2 channels by relieving voltage block of the channel39. At E18.5, Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant hearts showed no overt phenotype with similar size (Fig. 5h) and heart-to-body weight ratio compared with WT littermate controls (Fig. 5i). As homozygous Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutants are viable, we examined the hearts of these animals at 20 weeks of age postmortem (Fig. 5j). Similarly to embryonic Piezo2−/− hearts, we found that the Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant hearts were smaller and shorter than hearts from age-matched WT littermates. We noted that Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant mice at 10 weeks weighed significantly less than WT littermates (Fig. 5k). Indeed, echocardiography (ECG) measurements from living Piezo2R2756H/R2756H and WT littermate mice at 10 weeks of age showed that Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant mice displayed a significantly elevated heart-to-body weight ratio compared with controls (Fig. 5l). LV mass was comparable between genotypes (Fig. 5m), but mutant hearts were significantly shorter than WT hearts (Fig. 5n). These results suggest that both loss- and gain-of-function PIEZO2 can lead to macroscopic hyperplastic changes in the embryonic and adult heart.

The LV hyperplasia observed in Piezo2−/− mice is a phenomenon that can result from reduced perfusion of the cardiac muscle. As PIEZO2 is highly specific to the coronary endothelium, we hypothesized that PIEZO2 mechanosensory function in these cells guides the normal assembly of the coronary vasculature. We performed whole-organ immunostaining against αSMA in immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO)-cleared embryonic hearts. Using light-sheet imaging and vessel segmentation, we could visualize the entire coronary vasculature in WT and Piezo2−/− hearts (Fig. 6a,b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Videos 3–18). The majority of the main branches of the coronary artery network follow a stereotypical pattern40. From the coronary artery ostium at the left coronary cusp of the ascending aorta, the left main coronary artery (LCA) extends ventrally before the first bifurcation into the left anterior descending artery (LDA) and left circumflex artery (Cx). Further ventrally, the diagonal branch (D) bifurcates from the LDA. Conversely, the right coronary artery (RCA) connects to the aorta at the right coronary cusp.

In Piezo2−/− hearts, the coronary vasculature topology was clearly altered compared with the WT. In particular, the circumflex artery branched off from the left coronary artery closer to the ostia (Fig. 6a (orange asterisks) and Extended Data Fig. 8 (orange asterisks)). Quantitative analyses revealed a significantly shorter segment length between the coronary ostia and the Cx branching point in Piezo2−/− hearts compared with controls (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Moreover, in Piezo2−/− hearts, the branching of the left coronary artery into the Cx, D and the LDA did not follow the pattern seen in the WT. There was no clear distinction between the main LDA and its branches in the mutant heart compared with the WT (Fig. 6a (white arrows) and Extended Data Fig. 8 (white arrows)). The branch points in mutant vessels were frequently trifurcations rather than bifurcations. In addition, in one mutant heart, an ectopic artery branching off the Cx projecting toward the anterior pole of the heart was observed (Fig. 6a (yellow arrowheads)). Manual and computer-vision-based quantification of branch points revealed that while the number of branch points was not altered in the RCA tree of Piezo2−/− mutants (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9d), fewer branch points were observed in the left coronary artery tree of mutants compared with controls (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 9e).

Most importantly, the light-sheet reconstruction indicated that Piezo2−/− hearts have more constricted coronary vessels. As LV hyperplasia was most prominent in Piezo2−/− hearts, we quantified the average diameter of the left and right main coronary artery over 600 µm from the ostia (Fig. 6f–h). We observed significant narrowing of the left coronary artery diameter in Piezo2−/− hearts compared with the WT (Fig. 6h).

To assess potential perfusion changes caused by the LCA constriction, we applied physical first principles. We considered a cylindrical pipe of constant cross-section where an incompressible, Newtonian fluid is flowing under laminar flow conditions as an idealized model of the LCA. Poiseuille's law relates the flow rate in the pipe Q, the pressure drop between both ends of the pipe ΔP and the resistance of the pipe R (equation (1))

where μ is the constant dynamic viscosity of the fluid, L is the length of the pipe and r is the radius of the pipe (equation (2))41. The LCA diameter has narrowed, on average, from 66.377 μm to 58.492 μm, that is, an 11.879% reduction in Piezo2−/− hearts compared with Piezo2+/+ controls. Given a comparable pressure drop between the entrance of the LCA and its post-capillary venous return in both the Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2−/− groups (as can be expected from a hierarchically branched vascular tree with multiple major arteries running in parallel, for example, LCA and RCA), the fact that the largest pressure drop along this path happens in small arteries and arterioles42, and all the remaining variables being equal, it follows from the previous equations and assumptions that the resistance of the LCA will have increased by 65.7% in Piezo2−/− hearts and that this will lead to a very significant reduction of perfusion downstream from it despite the relatively modest reduction in LCA diameter.

We next assessed the coronary artery topology in E18.5 Piezo2R2756H/R2756H hearts using iDISCO clearing, αSMA immunostaining and light-sheet imaging followed by vessel segmentation and coronary vasculature surface reconstruction in a total of six Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant and seven WT control samples (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Videos 19–31). Quantification of segment length and branch point numbers was conducted by two different methods (manual and computer vision based) and performed by different researchers in a blinded manner.

Quantitative assessments of the coronary artery topology revealed that the length of the segment between the coronary ostia and the Cx branching point was slightly increased in Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mutant hearts at E18.5 compared with controls (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 9f). Moreover, the number of total left coronary artery branch points was increased in Piezo2R2756H/R2756H gain-of-function mutant hearts (Fig. 7d and Extended Data Fig. 9h).

Taking these results together, we conclude that the proper function of the mechanosensitive PIEZO2 ion channels is necessary for the normal assembly of the cardiac endothelium to form an adequate vasculature supply to the developing myocardium.

Our investigation reveals a critical role of mechanosensitive PIEZO2 function in the formation of the coronary vasculature, particularly in developing coronary endothelial cells. We detected a transient expression for Piezo2 within the Fabp4+ endothelial cell population in the heart, which peaked during the embryonic and early postnatal stages but diminished in adulthood, suggesting that PIEZO2 is crucial for coronary vessel formation but not for maintaining mature endothelial identity under healthy conditions. Piezo2-expressing coronary endothelial cells show unique expression profiles characterized by the enrichment of genes involved in cell migration, guidance and angiogenesis, including neuropilin 2, apelin and Crmp1 (ref. 23). Neuropilin 2, originally recognized for its role in neuronal guidance25, also influences angiogenesis and probably guides endothelial cell migration and vessel formation23. Similarly, apelin, a hormone known for supporting angiogenesis, enhances endothelial cell survival and stabilizes blood vessels43. In addition, CRMP isoforms, initially associated with neuronal development26, are present in endothelial cells, where they probably contribute to cytoskeletal regulation, cell movement and angiogenesis.

Of note, PIEZO2 expression has been reported in human cultured coronary artery endothelial cells44 and in endothelial cells of cardiac tissue samples from transplanted human hearts45. In an scRNA-seq analysis of P7 murine brain endothelial cells, it was shown that Piezo2 was among the 25 most enriched tip cell transcripts46. PIEZO2 has been implicated in transducing physical cues into mechanobiological responses, such as cytoskeletal rearrangements47. It is therefore plausible to hypothesize that PIEZO2 is needed to guide endothelial navigation at the angiogenic front of the coronary vascular plexus in response to mechanical cues. Additional previously published data further support a potential role for PIEZO2 in endothelial cell motility. Yang et al. described that PIEZO2 siRNA-treated HUVEC cells showed a significant decrease in tube formation compared with the control group. They also showed that shRNA-mediated Piezo2 knockdown in mice caused a significant reduction in the radial extension of vascular plexus from the optic nerve to the periphery at P3 and P5, as well as fewer branch points12. Wei et al. describe impaired cell migration and tube formation in pulmonary microvasculature endothelial cells isolated from endothelial cell-specific Piezo2EC/− knockout rats compared with WT rats13.

Chemical signaling (chemotaxis), particularly through pathways such as VEGFA-VEGFR2, BMP2 and CXCL12/CXCR4, is well established in orchestrating endothelial cell movements underlying angiogenesis in various organs, including the heart3,4. However, there is increasing evidence that combinatorial effects of chemotaxis and ion channel-mediated durotaxis fine-tune cellular migration and navigation in diverse cellular systems5,48,49. In particular, the study by Canales Coutiño and Mayor in Xenopus showed that Piezo1 cooperates with chemotactic signaling cues to control neural crest migration48. PIEZO2 was also shown to balance mechanosensitivity and chemosensitivity at the blood–tumor barrier in medulloblastoma50.

Indeed, endothelial PIEZO2 could be a major sensor of mechanical cues in the developing myocardium, facilitating cellular migration and motility through durotaxis. We propose that mechanical cues sensed by Piezo2+ coronary endothelial cells are crucial for precise cellular navigation during coronary vasculature plexus formation and remodeling.

Our functional analysis showed that Piezo2+ endothelial cells possess fast mechanosensitive currents that have sensitivities and kinetics similar to those of Piezo2-dependent currents in sensory cells32,36,39. However, many cECs that had never expressed Piezo2 also exhibited mechanosensitive currents (Fig. 4), showing that PIEZO2 is only one of several functional mechanosensitive channels in cECs51. Using a knockdown approach in YS cells, we show directly that PIEZO2 contributes to mechanically gated currents in these cells, but it is clearly not the sole mechanosensitive ion channel present (Fig. 4). Indeed, our data show that Elkin1 and Piezo1 are also expressed in cECs, and both channels are efficiently gated by substrate deflection or membrane stretch32. Nevertheless, it is striking that PIEZO2 loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed a nonredundant role of endothelial PIEZO2-dependent mechanosensitivity in shaping coronary artery formation and branching.

In the absence of Piezo2 expression, we observed aberrant coronary artery branching, that is, significantly decreased proximal left coronary artery segment length and less branch points of the left coronary artery tree and most importantly a decreased left coronary artery diameter. We propose that cardiac muscle perfusion deficits result from coronary anomalies in Piezo2−/− mutants during embryonic development. Reduced blood supply could lead to hypoxia-induced compensatory growth. Hemodynamic stress could additionally be a cause of heart malformations and hyperplastic myocardial growth observed in PIEZO2-deficient mouse embryos (Fig. 5a–g). Human pathogenic gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2, documented in human patients16,17, dramatically increase the channels' sensitivity to mechanical force39. By introducing this gain-of-function mutation into mice, we show here that PIEZO2 hypersensitivity can also lead to coronary artery branch point anomalies (Fig. 7d and Extended Data Fig. 9f–h) and disruption of postnatal heart development (Fig. 5j–n). The increased number of branch points in the left coronary artery of Piezo2R2756H/R2756H gain-of-function mutants, even with a normal proximal LCA diameter, could potentially lead to cardiac hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Increased local shear stress due to more branch points and increased local perfusion could stimulate cell cardiomyocyte proliferation in the embryo or cell growth in the adult.

However, a direct functional link between PIEZO2 dysfunction in coronary arteries and cardiac muscle anomalies still needs further experimental evidence and a potential role of PIEZO2 in the outflow tract and the valves of cardiovascular phenotypes needs to be assessed in further studies.

While the main causes of coronary artery disease are adult-onset conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes due to lifestyle modifications, genetic predisposition can also have an important role in disease etiology52. Congenital coronary artery defects have been implicated in cardiac hyperplasia and hypertrophy53, and although they might be mild without any symptoms during development and in adolescence, they are considered important factors that can predispose individuals to cardiac disease in adult life54. Indeed, the heart malformations that we have observed are likely to contribute to early perinatal mortality in Piezo2−/− mice, which was attributed to failure to inflate the lungs after birth14,15.

The importance of PIEZO2 in a variety of sensory functions, including pain, makes it a potentially attractive target for drug therapies. However, our findings indicate that PIEZO2 is also crucial for the development of coronary arteries in the heart. Considering that developmental programs are often reused in regeneration and remodeling conditions, PIEZO2 might be a promising candidate to be reexpressed in the adult heart to facilitate angiogenesis following cardiac ischemic episodes. Findings from recent studies support this hypothesis, for example, in rodents, Kloth and colleagues observed a clear upregulation of Piezo2 in stressed cardiac tissue55. Further studies describe upregulation of Piezo2 in pharmacologically stressed cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells44 and in cardiac samples from patients with heart failure56. Indeed, cardiovascular problems have been associated with PIEZO2 pathogenic variants in a small number of human patients57,58 and the University of Cambridge PhenoScanner V2 database of human genotype–phenotype associations suggests PIEZO2 genetic linkage with heart failure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertensive heart disease and thoracic aortic aneurysm18.

In summary, our study elucidates the indispensable role of PIEZO2-dependent mechanosensitive signaling in coronary vasculature formation and highlights its implications for cardiac development and disease. Our study also raises a new issue for the use of therapeutics targeting PIEZO2 in the somatosensory system as such approaches may have serious consequences for cardiovascular (patho)physiology.

All mouse experiments complied with the German Animal Protection Act and were approved by the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine and the local Berlin authority, Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin, under the following animal protocol numbers: G0233/19, G0017/17 and X9006/21. Mice were housed under standard conditions (22 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 10% humidity, 12:12 h light–dark cycle) with ad libitum access to food and water, and provided with nesting and hiding materials. Timed matings using mice >10 weeks old were set up to collect embryos at specific stages (plug day = E0.5). Pregnant females were killed by cervical dislocation at the desired embryonic stage.

B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J: Ai14 is a Cre reporter strain (The Jackson Laboratory, 007908) and expresses tdTomato fluorescence following Cre-mediated recombination. Ai14 mice were used for timed matings with B6(SJL)-Piezo2tm1.1(cre)Apat/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, 027719)15, herein referred to as Piezo2-Cre mice, to obtain Piezo2-cre; Ai14 embryos expressing dtTomato in the Piezo2+ lineage (herein referred to as Piezo2-tdTomato mice).

Generation of the Piezo2 null allele (Piezo2−) was originally achieved by crossing the B6(SJL)-Piezo2tm2.2Apat/J strain (The Jackson Laboratory, 027720) with the E2a-cre strain (FVB/N-Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd/J; The Jackson Laboratory, 003314) as described in Extended Data Fig. 3 from Woo et al.15. EIIa-cre-mediated recombination leads to germline transmission of the recombined Piezo2 allele. Piezo2−/− embryos were isolated after timed matings of Piezo2+/− parents >10 weeks.

The Piezo2R2756H/R2756H strain was generated as described in Sánchez-Carranza et al.39. All these strains were kept on a C57BL/6N background (backcross onto C57BL/6N from C57BL/6J for more than 12 generations).

Mouse embryonic hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at room temperature (RT), washed in 1× PBS, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose, embedded in optimal cutting temperature embedding matrix (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek) and sectioned at 10 µm using a Leica CM1950 cryostat. Sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and blocked with 10% donkey serum (Biowest) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) with 1% serum were applied overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 62248, Invitrogen) was used for nuclear counterstaining, and DAKO fluorescent medium (S302380-2, Agilent) was used for mounting.

Whole-mount immunostaining of E13.5 hearts was performed in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes under rotation. Hearts were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, then blocked with 10% donkey serum in 0.5% PBST for 2 h at RT. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied sequentially for 24 h at 4 °C, with PBST washes between steps. DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining. Samples were mounted in µ-slide eight-well glass-bottom chambers (IBIDI) using Fluoromount G (00-4959-52, eBioscience).

E18.5 Piezo2-tdTomato hearts were cleared using the SmartClear protocol (LifeCanvas Technologies), which preserves endogenous fluorescence. Before clearing, paraformaldehyde-fixed samples underwent SHIELD epoxy-based fixation. Clearing was performed for 3 days at 42 °C using the SmartClear device. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50% EasyIndex and distilled water with shaking, then in 100% EasyIndex for refractive index matching.

E11.5 Piezo2-tdTomato and E18.5 Piezo2−/− hearts were cleared and labeled using an optimized iDISCO protocol59. Samples were dehydrated, washed and incubated in 66% dichloromethane–33% methanol overnight at RT, then bleached overnight in 5% H2O2–methanol, rehydrated, washed and permeabilized. Samples were blocked and incubated in antibody solution for 4 days at 37 °C. Hearts were embedded in 1% low-melting agarose, dehydrated, incubated for 2.5 h in 66% dichloromethane–33% methanol, followed by 100% dichloromethane, and stored at RT in ethyl cinnamate.

The following antibodies were used: goat anti-PECAM1 (1:250, AF3628, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-DACH1 (1:100, 10910-1-AP, Proteintech), rat anti-EMCN (1:100, clone V.C7C7, sc-65495, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-FABP4 (1:100, ab13979, Abcam), goat anti-SOX17 (1:100, AF1924, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, 600-401-3979S, Rockland), rat anti-VE-Cadherin (555289, clone 11D4.1, BD-Pharmigen), mouse anti-SMA (1:200, clone 11D4.1, A5228, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-SMA-Cy3 (1:250, clone 1A4, C6198, Sigma-Aldrich), Alexa Fluor 488 rat (1:500, ab150153, Abcam), Alexa Fluor 555 rabbit (1:500, ab150074, Abcam), Alexa Fluor 647 rabbit (1:500, ab150075, Abcam), Alexa Fluor 647 goat (1:500, ab150131, Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 647 rat (1:500, ab150155, Abcam).

Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed, following the manufacturer's instructions on 10-µm-thick cryosections. Stained sections were imaged using a Leica DM5000B microscope.

Single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent V2 assay, 323110, ACD) on E13.5 WT heart sections. Piezo2 (Probe-Mm-Piezo2, 400191, ACD) and Dach1 (Probe-Mm-Dach1, 12071-C3, ACD) expression was studied. Opal 570 (FP1488001KT, Akoya Biosciences) and Opal 690 (FP1497001KT, Akoya Biosciences) fluorophores were used.

Immunofluorescently stained tissue sections and whole-mount E11.5 and E13.5 hearts were imaged using an LSM700 confocal microscope with ZEN software. Imaging was performed using ×10 NA 0.3 EC Plan-Neofluar, ×20 NA 0.8 Plan Apochromat and ×40 NA 1.4 Oil Plan Apochromat objectives. Fluorophores were excited and detected as follows: DAPI (405 nm excitation, 420–450 nm detection), Alexa Fluor 488 (488 nm, 500–550 nm), Alexa Fluor 555 (555 nm, 570–620 nm) and Alexa Fluor 647 (639 nm, 660–730 nm). The pinhole was set to 1 AU for all channels.

Cleared and immunolabeled whole E18.5 hearts were imaged with a Zeiss Lightsheet 7 microscope, with the ZEN 3.1 (black edition) LS software. The acquisition was done with dual-side illumination (6.08 µm light-sheet thickness), using LSFM ×5/0.1 foc objectives for illumination and an EC Plan-Neofluar ×5/0.16 foc lens for detection, with the correction collars adjusted to the correct refractive index, depending on the immersion used (1.46 for EasyIndex, 1.56 for Ethylene Cinnamate). Acquisition was done sequentially, using solid-state lasers 405 nm and 561 nm (camera beamsplitter LP 510 nm, emission filters BP (420–470) nm/(575–615) nm), with a PCO.Edge 5.5 sCMOS camera (6.5 µm per pixel, 1,920 × 1,920 pixels), and using a zoom of 0.96 (0.97 × 0.97 × 2.00 µm per voxel). Post-acquisition processing was performed with the ZEN 3.4 (blue edition) software to fuse the dual-side light sheets of each sample while the FIJI BigStitcher plugin was used to stitch the tiles.

Identical settings for laser power, detector and pixel size were used for all samples analyzed qualitatively or quantitatively. For image post-processing (FIJI 2.14.0), all parameters were uniformly applied across all samples.

Ventricular wall thickness was measured from longitudinal sections of E18.5 Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2−/− E18.5 hearts. Six sections per animal were selected, three with the pulmonary artery and three with the aorta. Measurements were taken, using FIJI, from the LV, the RV and the IVS. A region of interest below the atria was defined to measure compact and TM thickness. Ten measurements were taken per area per section. The average thickness per area per animal was used for final quantification.

Right and left coronary artery diameters were measured in FIJI from whole-mount E18.5 Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2−/− immunolabeled hearts. Measurements were taken precisely at 200 µm, 300 µm, 400 µm, 500 µm and 600 µm from the connection of the artery to the aorta. These five values per artery were averaged and used in statistical analysis.

The diameters of the pulmonary artery and the aorta were measured using FIJI from optical sections obtained from whole-mount E18.5 Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2−/− immunolabeled hearts. Two measurements were taken per vessel and averaged. The resulting values were used for the statistical analysis.

Coronary vasculature surface reconstruction was based on the iDISCO-cleared, αSMA-immunolabeled Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2−/− hearts. The surface package of IMARIS 10.0 was used to semi-automatically detect, segment and reconstruct the immunofluorescence signal. Segmentation and 3D reconstruction were used for qualitative and quantitative coronary architecture analyses. Filaments plugin from IMARIS was used to measure the ostia-to-circumflex artery length.

Branching point analysis was based on the surface reconstruction of the coronary vasculature. We manually labeled the coronary artery root points for the right and left ventricles and refined segmentation masks using napari 0.5.6 (https://napari.org/stable/). Unwanted regions outside the right and left ventricles were removed and broken structures reconnected. Binary closing was used to fill the interior of the blood vessels and skeletonized the resulting 3D masks using Kimimaro (https://github.com/seung-lab/kimimaro), with roots as starting points. From these skeletons, we computed the distances to each branching point and the total number of branching points. We manually identified the branching points of interest and recorded their measurements (ostia–circumflex). The code is available at https://github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/piezo2_branching_point_analysis.

The code has been deposited in a capsule with Code Ocean.

Ultrasound examination was performed on anesthetized 10-week-old Piezo2+/+ and Piezo2R2756H/R2756H mice using the Vevo 3100 system (VisualSonics Fujifilm) with an MXD550D ultrasonic probe. Anesthesia was induced with 3–4% isoflurane (anesthesia box) and maintained with 1.5–2% isoflurane (mask ventilation). The examination area was shaved and treated with hair removal cream; eye ointment (Bepanthen) was applied to prevent dryness. The mice were placed on a warming plate with additional heat from a lamp, and body temperature was monitored via a rectal probe. ECG was recorded throughout to monitor heart rate and anesthesia depth. Contact gel ensured proper coupling between the transducer and skin. The examinations lasted 45 min. Recovery occurred under supervision in a warm, quiet environment. ECG data were analyzed using VevoLAB software (version 5.5.0).

Primary cECs were isolated from pooled E13.5 Piezo2-tdTomato embryos (10–15 hearts per experiment). Atria and outflow tracts were removed, and ventricles mechanically dissociated and filtered through a 70-µm strainer. The retained tissue was digested in Collagenase/Dispase (10269638001, Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37 °C, homogenized and filtered into a tube with 5 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS (P40-37500, PAN-Biotech) and Gentamicin (G1272, Sigma-Aldrich). An additional 5 ml of the same medium was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 r.p.m. (160 × g).

The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS–BSA 0.5% and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 µl PBS–BSA 0.5%, and 100 µl of bead–antibody solution was added and carefully homogenized. After 30 min of incubation at RT, 800 µl PBS–BSA 0.5% was added, and bead-bound cells were washed several times with MLEC medium containing 400 ml DMEM-F12 (21041-025, Invitrogen), 20% inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140122, Gibco) and 4 ml ECGS-H (C-30120, Promocell).

Cells were resuspended in 500 µl of MLEC, and each pool was seeded in one well of a 24-well plate coated with 0.5% gelatin (G1393, Sigma-Aldrich). The next day, cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS–BSA 0.5%, and 500 µl of MLEC was added to each well.

After reaching confluency (usually 1 week), the cells were dissociated with trypsin and seeded on pillar arrays for electrophysiology.

For the bead–antibody preparation, per heart pool, 6 µl of sheep anti-rat IgG Dynabeads (11035, Dynal Invitrogen) was placed in 1 ml of PBS–BSA 0.5%, washed several times and resuspended in 6 µl of PBS–BSA 0.5% for each pool. Then, 1.5 µl per pool of VE-cadherin antibody was added to the beads and incubated for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation. After incubation, 100 µl of PBS–BSA 0.5% per pool was added and gently homogenized. Technical replicates were generated as follows: embryonic hearts were collected from 5 pregnant females on 2 separate days, yielding over 50 hearts in total. These were divided into groups of 10–15 hearts to create at least 4 independent cEC preparations. Each preparation was plated in a single well for expansion. After expansion, each well was dissociated and the cells were seeded onto multiple pillar arrays, keeping each preparation separate to maintain independent replicates.

YS cells were collected on ice in plating medium, consisting of DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 8 mg ml−1 glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal horse serum. YS cells were treated with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in a water bath. Cells were washed 3× with PBS and incubated with 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C. Collected tissue was triturated in plating medium using a pipette tip and then centrifuged at 900 r.p.m. (60 × g) for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of plating medium and plated on elastomeric pillar arrays or coverslips pre-coated with 4 μg cm−2 laminin (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured overnight, and electrophysiology experiments were performed 18–24 h post-dissection.

YS electrophysiological data were obtained from three separate experiments (cell cultures from embryos isolated from three pregnant females).

YS cells were cultured overnight on pillar arrays. Subsequently, 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with Accell siRNA and Accell media as per the manufacturer's protocol (Dharmacon, Horizon) using either non-targeting control siRNA (SMARTpool, D-001960-01-20) or piezo2-siRNA (SMARTpool, E-163012-00-0020). Electrophysiological recordings were carried out 96 h post-transfection. Every culture of YS cells was made from at least five different YSs of embryos at stage E13.5 from three different pregnant females. Three independent transfections were performed.

Pillar arrays were prepared following the established protocol32. In summary, silanized negative masters served as templates, which were subsequently coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) from the syligard 184 silicone elastomer kit (Dow Corning) mixed with a curing agent in a 10:1 ratio (elastomeric base-to-curing agent ratio). The mixture was incubated for 30 min, and glass coverslips were positioned on the top of negative masters containing PDMS, followed by banking for 1 h at 110 °C. Subsequently, pillar arrays were peeled from the negative masters. Each pilus within the array had a radius of 1.79 µm and a length of 5.8 µm. Before cell culture use, the pillar arrays underwent plasma cleaning using a Femto low-pressure plasma system (Deiner Electronic) and were salinized using vapor phase (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane 97% (AB111444, ABCR GmbH & Co. KG)) for 45 min, followed by a coating with EHS laminin and poly-l-lysine in a 1:1 ratio (v:v) for at least 2 h at 37 °C.

Whole-cell patch–clamp recordings were conducted on YS and cEC cells (isolated as described above) using borosilicate glass pipettes (Harvard apparatus, 1.17 mm × 0.87 mm) with a resistance of 3–6 MΩ. The pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 110 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 4 glucose and 10 HEPES; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Pipette and membrane capacitances were compensated using the auto-function of Patchmaster (HEKA, Elektronik) while series resistance was compensated to minimize voltage errors. For pillar arrays, currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV, sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz using an EPC-10 USB amplifier and Patchmaster software version 2×91 (HEKA, Elektronik). Data were analyzed with FitMaster, version 2 × 91 (HEKA, Elektronik).

A single pilus was deflected using a heat-polished borosilicate glass pipette driven by an MM3A micromanipulator (Kleindiek Nanotechnik) as previously described in Poole et al.32. Pillar deflection stimuli range from 1 nm to 1,000 nm, with larger deflections discarded. For quantification and comparison analysis, data were binned by the magnitude of the stimuli (1–10 nm, 11–50 nm, 51–100 nm, 101–250 nm, 251–500 nm and 501–1,000 nm), and the mean current amplitudes within each bin were calculated for every cell. Deflection-gated currents were classified according to their inactivation kinetics: RA (τinact < 5 ms), IA (τinact 5–50 ms) and SA (τinact > 50 ms).

To calculate pillar deflection, bright-field images (Zeiss 200 inverted microscope) were captured using a ×40 objective and CoolSnapEZ camera (Photometrics) before and after every pillar stimulus. Pillar deflection was determined by comparing the light intensity of the center of each pilus before and after every stimulus using a 2D-Gaussian fit (Igor Software, WaveMetrics).

High-speed pressure clamp experiments (ALA Scientific) were conducted on excised outside-out patches from YS cells. Recording pipettes with a final resistance of 6–8 M were used. Positive-pressure pulses were delivered through the recording pipette. The pressure steps protocol involved a series of stimuli ranging from 10 mm Hg to 150 mm Hg, in 20-mm Hg increments, while maintaining the patch potential at −60 mV. Recording solutions were prepared in symmetrical ionic conditions containing the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES and 5 EGTA adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH.

For both methods, currents and biophysical parameters were analyzed using FitMaster (HEKA, Elektronik).

YS cells were cultured on plating medium (DMEM-F12, Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 8 mg ml−1 glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal horse serum, and then loaded with Cal-520 (5 mM, CAL520 AM, AAT Bioquest). Cells were perfused with extracellular solution (in mM: 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 4 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) at RT. Images were acquired with an Olympus BX51WI microscope equipped with a DG4 (Sutter Instruments) and a CoolSNAP ES camera (Visitron). Image acquisition and analysis were performed using MetaFluor (Molecular Devices). Every image was taken in cycles of 3 s. The baseline of the fluorescence (F0) was established by taking the average of the first 10 cycles. Ionomycin (1 µM) was used to normalize the maximum signal of Cal-520. Data were plotted using the formula ΔF/F0 = (F − F0)/F0.

Gene count matrices from single-cell sequencing from E12, E15, P2 and 8-week-old C57BL/6J animals were generated by Cano et al.22 and deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus repository with accession number GSE223266. Sequence data were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10, pre-build references v 2.1.0). Custom code was generated using R to analyze the data and generate plots as described in Cano et al.22.

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 and tested for normality. Parametric data were compared using unpaired Student's t-test, and nonparametric data were compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Results are reported as mean ± s.e.m. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Exact P values and n are provided in the figure legends.

a - d, Outflow tract and cardiac valves three-dimensional rendering and immunolabelled sections from an E18.5 tdTomato+ heart. tdTomato signal (yellow) in the outflow tract (a) colocalizes with αSMA (magenta). In the cardiac valves (b - d), tdTomato+ cells (yellow) are surrounded by endothelial cells (PECAM1 positive, magenta), indicating that they are likely valve interstitial cells (n = 2, Scale bar: 100 µm [3D] and 50 µm [sections]).

a, Expression of Piezo2 mechanosensitive ion channels in heart tissue. Single-molecule in situ hybridization showing coronary endothelial cells expressing Piezo2 and Dach1 at E13.5. Nuclei are labeled with DAPI. Scale bar: 10 µm. Hybridization was performed on at least 5 sections and repeated on 2 different hearts. b, scRNAseq identifies distinct cluster representations for Piezo2+ and Piezo1+ cardiac cells. Volcano plots showing Fabp4, Piezo1 and Piezo2 expression levels on cardiac endothelial cells and all cardiac cells from E12, E15, P2 and murine adult hearts (8 weeks old) showing the following clusters: endocardium (Endoc_I to Endoc_V), coronary endothelium (cap-to-vein, cap-to-artery and CoEC_III), proliferating cells (Prolif_I to Prolif_II), valvular endocardium (Valve_I and Valve_II), arterial cells (Arter), venous cells (Vein), outflow tract cells (OFT), pericytes, fibroblasts (FB_I and FB_II), lymphatic cells (lymph), smooth muscle cells (SMC), epicardial cells (Epic), macrophages (macroph) and red blood cells (RBC), Cardiomyocytes (CMs), Immediate Early Genes-expressing Coronary Endothelium (IEG_CoEC). Note: The analysis includes some non-endothelial cells, as the isolation of CD31 + /CD45- endothelial cells by BD FACSAria II sorting following heart dissociation is never completely pure (Cano et al., 2025, Circ. Res; DOI: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.124.324868).

The gastrointestinal tract contains a wealth of chemical information that can be used to decipher the health of the digestive and nervous systems. Traditional methods of analysis, such as faecal analysis and biopsies, are invasive, costly and incapable of providing real-time metabolic and hormone profiling across the gastrointestinal tract. Commercial ingestible capsule sensors have been developed, but only monitor basic markers, such as pH and pressure, neglecting detailed chemical analysis. Here we report an integrated smart capsule that can simultaneously detect a spectrum of biochemical markers, including electrolytes, metabolites and hormones. The capsule, which is termed PillTrek, is 7 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length, and houses a miniaturized wireless electrochemical workstation capable of executing a range of electrochemical measurement techniques (potentiometry, amperometry, voltammetry and impedimetry), allowing it to interface with a variety of electrochemical sensors and detect various parameters in the gut. Using an array of sensors (serotonin, glucose, pH, ionic strength and temperature), we illustrate the capabilities of the system in vitro and in vivo in animal studies involving rat and rabbit models, monitoring the dynamic profile of these crucial biomarkers and their responsiveness to different dietary intakes.

Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) that evaluate an individual's T-cell activation response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb)-specific peptides serve an important role in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB). However, there are substantial challenges to the use of IGRAs in resource-limited settings. Further, IGRA diagnostic performance can also be compromised in anergic individuals. Here we describe a microfluidic chip-based antigen-specific T-cell response assay (ASTRA) that automates the detection of M.tb-specific T-cell activation responses to facilitate screening for latent M.tb infection and TB. We observe that ASTRA demonstrates high specificity for M.tb infection in independent patient cohorts. Compared with IGRA, ASTRA shows greater diagnostic sensitivity in individuals with HIV-1 co-infections (93.8% versus 67%), comparable diagnostic sensitivity in HIV-negative individuals (92.8%) and faster detection (4 h versus 24–48 h). We also find that a self-powered ASTRA chip that analysed microsample (~25 μl) whole-blood samples produced comparable results. ASTRA holds the potential to facilitate efforts to control the global TB epidemic and serve as a versatile platform for analysing T-cell responses across various infectious diseases and immunotherapeutic interventions.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infections carried by one-quarter of the world population have a 5–10% lifetime risk for progression to tuberculosis (TB), which is responsible for 1.6 million deaths each year1, more than any other infectious disease except during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals are at greatest risk for TB disease within the first 2 years after M.tb infection but remain at risk for disease progression throughout their lifetime. Preventing new cases arising from this latent disease reservoir is thus critical for the End TB Strategy to reduce TB incidence by 90% by 2035 and eliminate TB by 20502.

Current methods used to diagnose latent M.tb infections (LTBI) include tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) that can detect immune responses to M.tb-derived antigens, but both these methods have shortcomings. Individuals screened using TST results must be evaluated by a trained health care worker within 48–72 h after subcutaneous injection of M.tb-derived material, and previous M. bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccination, non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection or erroneous interpretation can produce a false-positive TST result3. IGRAs do not require a repeat visit or produce false positives for BCG-vaccinated individuals4, but employ whole-blood samples that must be maintained under controlled conditions and used within ~16 h after collection. Both tests are also less reliable for individuals with compromised immune systems, recent M.tb infections, or those who have received recent live-virus vaccinations for measles or smallpox, all of which can induce false-negative results by suppressing T-cell IFNγ release5. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a particular concern for M.tb screening efforts since HIV-co-infected individuals are at increased risk for rapid progression from LTBI to TB6, which is responsible for one-third of HIV-related deaths7. M.tb and HIV co-infection rates are also often high in regions with high endemic TB rates and exceed 50% in parts of southern Africa8, with studies demonstrating that around one-quarter of HIV–TB patients have an anergic IGRA response9.

CD4 T-cells play an essential role in the IFNγ response induced following M.tb infection10 but IGRA cannot reliably detect LTBI in immunosuppressed individuals who have CD4 T-cell counts ≤200 cells per µl (ref. 11). We thus hypothesized that analysing activation markers not restricted to CD4 T-cells12 could enhance detection of M.tb-specific T-cell responses in HIV co-infected individuals. We selected OX-40 (TNFRSF4/CD134) and 4-1BB (TNFRSF9/CD137) as candidate markers (Fig. 1a), since both are upregulated on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells13, although 4-1BB is upregulated more rapidly and to a higher degree on CD8 than on CD4 T-cells14, and are surface proteins that can be detected without the cell fixation and permeabilization steps required to detect intracellular IFNγ.

Here we describe the development and characterization of an antigen-specific T-cell response assay (ASTRA) that detects OX-40 and 4-1BB activation markers using a streamlined microchip-based procedure. This platform integrates all assay steps following sample collection and requires substantially less time, infrastructure and technical expertise than standard IGRAs while offering improved diagnostic sensitivity for M.tb infection in HIV-positive individuals. The ASTRA microchip features six inlets, three outlets and three antibody-functionalized reaction chambers, allowing multiplexed analysis of T-cell responses to both M.tb-specific and control stimuli. To enable point-of-care deployment, we further developed a self-contained, pump-free ASTRA chip powered by a chemically driven fluid propulsion system inspired by insect defence mechanisms. Its two-layer sliding design activates nanozyme-mediated oxygen generation, driving precise reagent flow without external pumps or electricity. This self-contained format maintains analytical accuracy with ~25 μl whole-blood samples, supporting decentralized TB screening using fingerstick collection in low-resource settings. ASTRA delivers robust results within 4 h, compared with the 24–48 h typically required for conventional IGRAs.

T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of M.tb-derived peptides presented on class I and II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induces T-cell activation and the expression of multiple factors that can serve as biomarkers of this process (Fig. 1a). For example, Ras-ERK and PKCθ pathway mediated AP-1 and NF-κB activation can induce 4-1BB and OX-40 expression, while calcineurin increases NFAT and Tbet expression to enhance CD4 T-cell-selective IFNγ production10,15. However, HIV-mediated DNA methylation can repress IFNγ expression, hence 4-1BB or OX-40 may represent better markers of T-cell activation in people living with HIV10,16.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors treated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) revealed significant 4-1BB, OX-40 and IFNγ expression increases by 4 h post treatment, with similar rates of increase observed for all three biomarkers (Fig. 1b). Analogous expression was observed when PBMCs from IGRA-positive individuals were incubated with M.tb-specific peptides or PHA, but not after they were incubated with an Ebola-specific peptide to which they had no previous exposure (Fig. 1c). Comparable numbers of cells in the PHA and M.tb-peptide-stimulated groups stained positive for each biomarker, although higher overall induction was observed in the PHA-treated cultures, and more positive cells (20~25%) were detected when peptide- or PHA-treated PBMC cultures were double versus single stained for 4-1BB or OX-40 expression.

Microfluidic capture and staining can streamline the analysis of T-cell activation17, but assay performance can be influenced by multiple factors, including surface modifications and flow rates. We observed that positive-cell frequency differed when PHA-treated PBMCs were captured on non-specific polylysine- versus anti-CD4/CD8 antibody-conjugated slides (Fig. 1d), suggesting that selective T-cell capture and/or greater capture affinity improves ASTRA signal detection. We also observed a rapid drop in T-cell capture at flow rates >10 μl min−1 on an optimized microfluidic chip (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figs. 1–9), perhaps due to shear stress effects on cell capture, viability and functionality. Subsequent analysis of PBMCs from 30 individuals with positive IGRA (T-SPOT.TB) results using this chip and optimized conditions revealed consistent differences after activation with PHA or M.tb-specific peptides; these differences were analogous to those detected in our previous results but consistently higher than detected in settled PBMC samples, and correlated with the T-SPOT.TB results of these samples (Supplementary Figs. 10–12).

ASTRA microchip diagnostic performance was next evaluated with samples obtained from four independent cohorts enrolled at distinct geographic locations with varying rates of TB diseases or M.tb and HIV-1 co-infection (Supplementary Fig. 13, Table 1, Extended Data Tables 1–4 and Supplementary Tables 1–4). Blinded ASTRA test results distinguished HIV-negative individuals with positive and negative IGRA results, although IFNγ and 4-1BB + OX-40 results performed the best in distinguishing these groups (Fig. 1f, 1% as cut-off) and significantly correlated (R2 values of 0.90 and 0.92) with the IGRA results of these individuals (Fig. 1g). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values yielded similar results (1% cut-off) for their ability to distinguish IGRA-positive and -negative individuals, although 4-1BB + OX-40 had equal or better classification performance than IFNγ at all points along their ROC curves (Fig. 1h). ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 results were thus primarily used to detect M.tb infections when evaluating patient samples in all cohorts.

Blinded ASTRA was next employed to analyse archived PBMCs from a suspected TB cohort enrolled in Eswatini, which enrolled HIV-1 and HIV-1-negative individuals with TB, LTBI, or non-M.tb-affected controls, as defined by their microbiologic (smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF) and immunologic (IGRA) test results, or clinical findings obtained at enrollment or follow-up (Fig. 2a). LTBI was diagnosed by a positive T-SPOT.TB or QuantiFERON test result, although these tests are known to sometimes return false negatives for anergic HIV-positive individuals. Most individuals diagnosed with TB were HIV positive (70%), but HIV-1 infection frequency was lower in the LTBI (20%) and non-TB control (40%) groups.

Source data

Most individuals in the combined TB and latent M.tb infection groups had positive ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 results (93.3% sensitivity, 28 of 30), including most of the individuals with HIV-1 co-infections (93.8%, 15 of 16). Notably, ASTRA results were positive for 5 HIV-1-positive TB cases with false-negative IGRA results, while both false-negative ASTRA results were detected using PMBC samples with poor viability (~70%) that may have compromised their T-cell activation responses. No false-positive ASTRA results were detected for any of the non-M.tb control samples (100% specificity; 14 of 14).

Separately, ASTRA 4-1BB and OX-40 signals had higher diagnostic sensitivities than ASTRA IFNγ signal (92.9% and 62.5% versus 46.4% sensitivity, respectively) across the TB and LTBI groups (Extended Data Fig. 1). ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 responses were greater than ASTRA IFNγ responses in both the TB and LTBI groups, regardless of HIV-1 infection and IGRA status (Fig. 2b,c) and yielded positive results for 95% versus 55% of the TB (19 versus 11 of 20) and 90% versus 40% of the LTBI cases (9 versus 4 of 10). However, IGRA-negative TB patients tended to have lower ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 responses than IGRA-positive individuals, implying that they may have an attenuated response to M.tb infection (Fig. 2d,e), although cell counts were not available for analysis of factors that could have influenced this differential response.

ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 diagnostic sensitivity was greater than IGRA sensitivity in the overall TB + LTBI group (93.3% [28 of 30] versus 76.6% [23 of 30]), comparable to IGRA in the HIV-negative subgroup (92.9%; 13 of 14 for both), and markedly outperformed IGRA in the HIV-positive subgroup (93.8% [15 of 16] versus 62.6% [10 of 16]), with both methods demonstrating complete specificity regardless of HIV-infection status.

Comparable results were obtained with archived PBMCs from a Houston cohort comprising TB and LTBI cases, their non-M.tb-infected household contacts, and individuals with other respiratory infections (Fig. 3a) when ASTRA results were evaluated in a blinded manner. Similar ASTRA IFNγ results were obtained when PBMCs from HIV-positive and HIV-negative TB cases and their non-M.tb-infected controls were incubated with and without PHA, indicating that all these groups had similar backgrounds and activation potentials. However, ASTRA IFNγ results detected following M.tb-peptide stimulation differed by HIV-infection status, as only PBMCs of the HIV-negative M.tb-positive individuals (TB or LTBI) yielded signal greater than the background signal of the M.tb-negative individuals (healthy control and other disease) (Fig. 3b), consistent with an HIV-mediated effect to suppress M.tb-peptide-induced IFNγ expression. No equivalent inhibitory effect was observed in the ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 responses, as most PBMC samples from M.tb-positive individuals, including 3 TB suspects who had negative, inconclusive or missing IGRA results, had ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 responses greater than those detected for M.tb-negative individuals (Fig. 3a). Notably, this included 6 instances where positive ASTRA responses were detected for TB cases with valid but negative IGRA results, indicating that these individuals had an anergic IFNγ response to M.tb-peptide stimulation while retaining an active 4-1BB + OX-40 response.

Source data

ASTRA IFNγ signal was similar within PHA-stimulated and unstimulated PBMC samples of all these groups, but differed among the M.tb-peptide-stimulated PBMCs of the M.tb-positive (TB and LTBI) and M.tb-negative (healthy and other disease) groups (Fig. 3b). ASTRA IFNγ signal detected in PBMCs of HIV- and M.tb-positive individuals did not differ from that observed in PBMC samples of the M.tb-negative group (Fig. 3a), consistent with an HIV-1-associated suppression of TCR-driven IFNγ expression, since the former group revealed no evidence of an IFNγ secretion defect when stimulated with PHA. ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 better resolved M.tb-positive and -negative individuals than ASTRA IFNγ, as its results did not differ between M.tb-positive individuals with and without HIV-1 co-infection, and were consistently higher than ASTRA IFNγ results regardless of HIV status (Fig. 3c).

Standard IGRAs require that venous blood samples be collected and rapidly processed by trained personnel with access to necessary equipment and infrastructure, either on site or at a central testing laboratory, to retain cell viability and obtain valid results, which limits their utility in resource-limited settings. ASTRA microchips allow assay automation to reduce personnel and equipment requirements but still require a syringe pump to control the flow of assay reagents across these chips, limiting their use to sites that have both this equipment and reliable electricity. We thus refined the ASTRA chip design to allow it to function as self-contained assay suitable for use as point-of-care tests in resource-limited settings. First, an on-chip chemical reaction based on an insect defence mechanism (Fig. 4a) was used to replace the motive force supplied by the syringe pump to control sample and reagent passage across the chip. This revised self-contained ASTRA chip (1) employs a two-layer design in which sliding these layers at a 45-degree angle changes linkages between their channels to produce a lateral to longitudinal shift in fluid movement across the chip, and (2) connects two reservoirs to initiate the O2 production used to drive assay sample, probe solution and wash buffer across the cell capture and detection region of the chip (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2).

Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics (nanozymes) can provide a more stable and cost-effective alternative to enzymes18; this alternative is of particular importance for point-of-care assays as nanozymes can often overcome refrigeration, stability and cost issues associated with enzyme use to permit development of point-of-care assays that can be shipped, stored and used at ambient temperature19,20. We therefore evaluated the ability of 10 nm Pt–Ni nanozyme particles, which can mimic catalase activity (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 3), to serve as a catalase substitute to control sample, reagent and buffer movement across the self-contained ASTRA microchip. Studies used to characterize nanozyme-driven fluid movement on self-contained ASTRA microchips detected (1) nonlinear flow rates when these chips were loaded with increasing nanozyme or H2O2 concentrations (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15), (2) that catalase and the 10 nm Pt–Ni nanozyme particles exhibited comparable flow rates per mass, and (3) that nanozyme- but not catalase-induced flow rates were stable across a broad temperature range (Fig. 4e,f).

Nanozyme concentration was then titrated to determine the optimal flow rate for the self-contained ASTRA chip, since low flow rates supporting efficient cell capture and antibody binding might not permit efficient washing of the sample chamber between reagent steps, while high flow rates could improve wash steps at the expense of the cell capture and antibody recognition reactions. Nanozyme concentrations from 50 to 200 μg ml−1 yielded on-chip flow rates (30–150 μm s−1) that allowed robust detection of cell signal over assay background (Fig. 4g), and a 50 μg ml−1 nanozyme concentration was employed for all subsequent analyses. Self-contained and syringe-pump-driven ASTRA chip results were similar in a pilot study that analysed PBMC samples from 3 TB cases (Xpert and IGRA positive) and 3 non-TB controls (IGRA negative). Self-contained ASTRA chip results tended to yield stronger and less variable positive signals than the pump-driven chips in this analysis, at the expense of slightly higher background, but both approaches produced good signal-to-noise ratios (5.29 ± 0.86 versus 10.41 ± 5.30) (Fig. 4h) and lower overall cost (Supplementary Table 5).

Self-contained ASTRA chips analyse sample volumes consistent with those of fingerstick blood samples (~25 μl), suggesting that it might be possible to sensitively quantify T-cell activation in such samples and thus eliminate the phlebotomy and sample processing procedures used by standard ASTRA and IGRA analyses. Blinded analysis of 25-μl aliquots of prospectively collected venous blood samples from 20 TB suspects (New Orleans cohort) by self-contained ASTRA chips revealed increased ASTRA 4-1BB/OX-40 signal in matched whole-blood versus PBMC samples (Fig. 4i), indicating that ASTRA can robustly detect T-cell activation responses in unprocessed whole-blood specimens. Whole-blood ASTRA results also revealed strong correlations with corresponding IGRA results (Fig. 4j), which were comparable to those detected in the Vietnam cohort (Fig. 1g). However, unlike results from the Vietnam cohort (Fig. 1h), ROC regression models detected larger AUC values for the ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 versus IFNγ response, consistent with a greater ability of ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 signal to distinguish IGRA-positive and -negative samples (Fig. 4h), with ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 signal demonstrating better classification performance at all points along these curves.

Here we describe the development of a microfluidic chip-based ASTRA platform that enables automated diagnosis of M.tb infection, and report that its diagnostic performance does not differ by HIV-1 infection status or infection state (LTBI or TB disease), unlike current IGRA-based diagnostic applications. This approach addresses personnel, equipment, reagent and sample requirement issues that currently limit the use of IGRAs in screening-limited settings where the use of IGRAs is not feasible.

IGRAs can detect past or current infections and the potential of the immune system to mount an effective response, by detecting the activation response of pathogen-specific T cells, but can have limited utility in some patient populations and in resource-limited settings. For example, IGRAs have reduced diagnostic sensitivity in individuals who have low CD4 T-cell counts21,22,23, are immunocompromised24, are HIV positive9, have had helminth infections25, or have extrapulmonary M.tb infections26; moreover, regulatory T-cell (Treg) increases during TB can suppress T helper cell IFNγ expression to limit IGRA sensitivity27,28,29. Further, since IGRAs detect release of IFNγ, which is primarily produced by CD4 T cells10, they may not accurately measure antigen-specific CD8 T-cell activation responses. Our findings suggest that ASTRA can address these issues to facilitate the population-based screening efforts required to reduce M.tb transmission and TB-related mortality, since ASTRA detected LTBI and TB cases missed by IGRA, particularly in individuals with HIV-1 co-infection.

ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 results had greater diagnostic sensitivity than IGRA (QFT) results in the subset of 15 HIV-positive TB or LTBI Eswatini cohort cases in the Eswatini cohort that had valid results for both tests (93.3% (95% CI: 68.1–99.8) versus 66.7% (95% CI: 33.4–88.2%)). ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 sensitivity in this subgroup was also greater than the QFT (69% (95% CI: 50–84%)) sensitivity estimate determined in a meta-analysis of IGRA performance30 in HIV-positive individuals, but similar to the corresponding meta-analysis sensitivity estimate for T-SPOT.TB assays (89% (95% CI: 66–97%)) that require greater technical expertise and specialized equipment. However, ASTRA 4-1BB + OX-40 overall diagnostic sensitivity estimates for TB and LTBI (95% (95% CI: 71.67–98.89%) versus 90% (95% CI: 35.46–72.24%)) were similar to those reported in a meta-analysis of QFT-Plus performance (94% (95% CI: 90–98%) versus 91% (95% CI: 84–96%)). Notably, this analysis also yielded higher sensitivity estimates when using assay tubes that contained shorter peptides capable of inducing both CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation responses (95% (95% CI: 88–99%)) than paired tubes containing longer peptides that preferentially induce CD4 T-cell responses (91% (95% CI: 79–98%)), implying that detection of the CD8 T-cell response, as done by ASTRA, can improve diagnosis. Further, while ASTRA signal tended to be higher for Eswatini specimens with QFT-positive versus QFT-negative results, the overall ASTRA responses of these groups did not differ.

ASTRA results also identified cases that indicate the potential effect of HIV co-infection on interpreting QFT results. For example, two individuals enrolled in the Eswatini cohort had positive QFT results but lacked microbiologic evidence or symptoms consistent with TB. ASTRA results indicated that these individuals did not have a high level of M.tb-specific T cells. A careful interpretation of their QFT results revealed that the Nil result was high, but the PHA result was low, potentially leading to a false positive. In addition, in the quality control experiments of cell viability analysis in ASTRA, the cell viability did not appear to be high. This contradiction could stem from a false positive in clinical diagnosis due to inaccurate QFT analysis results or a false negative in ASTRA caused by insufficient cell viability (Fig. 2a).

ASTRA results were positive for 6 TB cases in the Houston cohort with negative IGRA results. One of these individuals was HIV positive and had extrapulmonary TB (TB meningitis), which could account for their negative IGRA response, since HIV infection and extrapulmonary M.tb infection can attenuate IGRA sensitivity. No information was available to explain the remaining 5 IGRA-negative results for these TB cases but these may also be due to attenuated IFNγ release in these samples.

Three Houston cohort participants with suspected TB had positive ASTRA results but lacked corresponding IGRA results, including two individuals with HIV-1 co-infections. One of these co-infected individuals was a 32-year-old male who discontinued anti-retroviral therapy during the pandemic, developed Kaposi sarcoma (KS), succumbed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), KS and multi-organ failure, and was diagnosed with TB despite a negative IGRA. The other co-infected individual was a 33-year-old AIDS and KS patient with a pulmonary nodule, had negative culture and Xpert results, and missing IGRA results, but was highly suspected to have TB due to symptoms.

The third individual lacked clear lab evidence of TB disease as she lacked positive culture and Xpert results. This patient had typical TB symptoms, including a long-term cough and weight loss, and was found to have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, pulmonary carcinomatosis and diffuse pulmonary nodules, but succumbed to lymphoma (Fig. 3a) before a QFT tests was performed, and thus could not be directly assessed for LTBI. Nonetheless, taken together these results indicate that abnormal immune activity may attenuate IGRA but not ASTRA results.

Several groups have evaluated alternative methods to evaluate antigen-induced T-cell activation responses, by employing approaches that evaluate additional or alternative T-cell markers, including HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 (refs. 31,32,33). These approaches rely on flow cytometry analysis of CD4 T-cell subsets and are reported to distinguish individuals with TB from those with LTBI, or to evaluate TB treatment response; LTBI cases with recent versus persistent IGRA-positive results, to identify individuals at greater risk for disease progression; and individuals with low versus high disease burden. These assays thus fundamentally differ from ASTRA, which is intended to facilitate diagnosis of M.tb infection in resource-limited settings to improve LTBI and TB diagnosis. ASTRA also detects the percentage of captured T cells that express either 4-1BB or OX-40, not the percentage that express both; moreover, while ASTRA could be adapted to detect cells expressing both these biomarkers, or other biomarker combinations, this would require use of ASTRA antibodies tagged with different fluorophores, additional fluorescent filters and a software revision to accurately quantify only those cells that are positive for all target biomarkers.

Our findings suggest that a self-contained ASTRA microfluidic chip platform could permit rapid and high-throughput point-of-care screening for M.tb infection that is not feasible by IGRA, particularly for individuals with HIV co-infection. However, these results have limitations. First, ASTRA results should be replicated in larger cohorts powered to determine whether ASTRA results obtained using venous and fingerstick blood specimens are comparable. Second, further studies should also evaluate ASTRA performance in different populations known to have attenuated IGRA responses. This study focused on the differential effect of HIV-1 infection status on ASTRA versus IGRA performance due to the prominent role HIV-1 infection can play in LTBI progression to TB, as well as the differential performance for LTBI versus TB diagnosis, but other conditions could also have differential effects on ASTRA performance (for example, age, extrapulmonary infection, or previous and current infection). Finally, further studies are needed to refine the chip manufacturing process and to validate the performance of the final assay at the point of use.

Nevertheless, our findings suggest that this automated approach has the potential to address several key concerns for IGRA-based screening efforts, particularly in resource-limited settings and in populations affected by conditions that are known to attenuate IGRA performance. Successful development and adoption of this approach would therefore not only benefit current efforts to control the TB epidemic but could also facilitate the evaluation of immunologic responses associated with other diseases and treatment responses (for example, cancer immunotherapy).

PBMCs were isolated from clinical specimens submitted to a College of American Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Ammendments certified clinical laboratory for IGRA testing, banked and frozen according to ongoing IRB protocol (Pro00002480, Vietnam; STUDY00001999, New Orleans; and 112233, Eswatini and Houston). After IGRA testing and analysis, blinded PBMCs were spun in a 15 ml conical tube (cell suspension) at 350 RCF for 5 min. The supernatant was poured off and 500 µl of frozen medium (prepared freshly by adding 10% dimethylsulfoxide to 90% fetal bovine serum) was added. The cell solution was then transferred into a new screw-cap tube placed in an isopropanol cell freezing chamber and stored at −20 °C. The following day, the frozen cell solution tube was removed and stored at −80 °C until use.

COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, a robust software, serves to model and simulate interconnected physical phenomena. First, the process commences with the creation or importation of the system/device geometry into the software. The study entails the application of physics interfaces, particularly laminar flow and particle tracing, which were used for the channel simulation. Material properties of the fluid, including density and dynamic viscosity, are integrated within specified boundaries and were assigned according to the blood sample. Boundary conditions are established, meticulously defining inlets, outlets and wetted boundaries, and applied to the initial fluid interface. Inlet velocities are imposed (0.002 m s−1), and particle tracing properties for fluid flow are delineated in the design. Meshing is subsequently employed to discretize the geometry, preparing it for simulation computation. Stationary and time-dependent simulations are carried out to obtain the fluid velocity profile and the residence time in a microfluidic channel, respectively. The residence time simulation is carried out from 0–12 s in steps of 0.01 s. Result outputs reveal critical parameters such as velocity, pressure and particle tracing dynamics.

The layout of the syringe pump-driven ASTRA chips was designed with AutoCAD 2024 (Autodesk) software and its performance properties were simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics software v.6.1 to evaluate critical parameters, including velocity, pressure and particle tracing dynamics. The chip design was then transferred to a commercial supplier (HTA Photomask) to generate a film photomask, and subsequent fabrication of the ASTRA microfluidic chip employed a combination of rapid prototyping and UV-photolithography techniques. The ASTRA chip design was fabricated on a silicon wafer with a conventional soft photolithography method and a negative epoxy-based photoresist (MicroChem, SU-8 2035). Substrate preparation involved cleaning and drying before applying SU-8 2035 resist, enhancing surface hydrophilicity with oxygen plasma treatment. For coating, 4 ml of resist was dispensed per 4 inches of substrate diameter, spun at 300 g for 12 s, then at 800 g for 35 s. Soft baking is recommended at 65 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 35 min for thickness of 85–110 µm. UV exposure uses a long-pass filter, eliminating UV radiation below 365 nm for 15 s, with energy requirement of 215–240 mJ cm−2 for 85–110 µm thickness. Post baking involved 65 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 8 min. After the post-baking step, the mould was developed with an SU-8 2035 developer. The silicon wafer was then cleaned with acetone, isopropanol and deionized water to remove any remaining photoresist, and then gently dried with nitrogen gas. A 10:1 mixture of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS):curing agent was then poured onto the master wafer and heated at 100 °C for 45 min, after which the solidified PDMS device was cut from the wafer.

Aminosilane-coated glass slides (Fisher Scientific) and fabricated PDMS devices were then oxygen plasma treated for 3 min at 200 mTorr vacuum to create surface SiOH groups on both components, which were then immediately placed in contact with each other to allow formation of Si-O-Si bonds at the glass–PDMS interface. These assembled microfluidic devices were then incubated with T-cell-specific antibodies mixed with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in PBS solution to couple the amine group on the glass surface to the carboxylic group of the antibody. For this step, a 5 mM solution of EDC was prepared by adding 1 mg of EDC per 1 ml of PBS. Then, a 1 mg ml−1 solution of NHS (5 mM) in PBS was prepared. EDC (0.5 ml) was mixed with 0.5 ml of NHS, and 10 µl each of anti-CD4 antibody (eBioscience, 14-0048-82) and anti-CD8 antibody (eBioscience, 14-0008-82) were promptly added to the solution. The EDC, NHS and antibodies were thoroughly mixed by pipetting. The 100 µl solution was transferred into a syringe, ensuring no bubbles were present, and injected into the microfluidic chip at a flow rate of 5 µl min−1 by a syringe pump, taking care to avoid bubble formation. Loaded chips were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, then antibody solution was removed at a 5 µl min−1 flow rate by the syringe pump withdrawal function, after which ASTRA chips were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C until use.

Cryopreserved PBMC aliquots were rapidly thawed in a 35 °C water bath, then immediately mixed with an equal volume of 35 °C RPMI-1640 media (Cytiva, Hyclone SH30255-01). These cell suspensions where then centrifuged for 5 min at 500g, and the resulting cell pellets were washed with 2 ml media, then resuspended in 1 ml media; aliquots of these cell suspensions were then analysed for viability using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. PBMC samples that demonstrated ≤70% cell viability were excluded from further analysis, and all other cell suspensions were supplemented with additional media to achieve final working concentrations of ~3 × 106 viable cells per ml. The PBMCs were distributed into different vials at concentrations ranging from 1 × 106 to 2 × 106 viable cells per ml, as specified for different assay types. The cut-off was defined as the mean positive cell ratio of non-stimulated cells plus three times its standard deviation.

A Cole-Parmer Microbore PTFE tubing (0.022 ID × 0.042 OD) was connected to the microfluidic chip inlet to load PBMCs, fluorescent antibodies and PBS wash buffer onto the chip via 1 ml syringes equipped with 0.64-mm-diameter needles connected to the inlet tubing via a syringe pump (NE-1200, 12 VDC, 1.0 Amperage, New Era pump system) using indicated flow rates. PBMC aliquots (50 µl, 1 × 106 cells per ml) were stimulated by addition of 10 µl of 7.9 µM phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; InvivoGen, inh-phap-2) or 1 μg (~0.6 nmol) ml−1 of each peptide from M.tb CFP-10 (Mabtech, 3625-1) and ESAT-6 (Mabtech, 3624-1), or untreated for use as non-stimulated control samples. These PBMC samples were then loaded onto the ASTRA chip at the indicated flow rate and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, after which the loaded 50 µl 1 × 106 cells per ml was withdrawn by the syringe pump at a 5 µl min−1 flow rate to avoid placing shear stress on the cells captured on the chip surface. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, these chips were immediately loaded at 5 µl min−1 with staining buffer. Staining buffers contained 0.29 mM DAPI (Invitrogen, D3571) and alexaFluor488-tagged antibodies specific for (1) human 4-1BB and OX-40 (0.06 and 0.5 µg per test; eBioscience, 11-1379-42 and11-1347-42) in IC fixation buffer (eBioscience, 00-8222-49) or (2) human IFNγ (eBioscience, 50-168-09) in cell permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, 00-8333) and fixation buffer. The chips were then incubated for 15–25 min at room temperature in the dark.

Cells captured in the ASTRA chip cell detection chamber were imaged using an EVOS M5000 imaging system (ThermoFisher) at ×10 magnification to quantify the total T-cell population (DAPI+, blue fluorescent) and the biomarker-positive activated T-cell subpopulation (AlexaFlour488+, green) using the ImageJ image-analysis software (NIH). Captured blue and green signal images were converted to 8-bit greyscale format and processed by applying low (70) and high (255) pixel intensity thresholds before counting cell signals within a 1–100 pixel size range (pixel2) and with circularity values ranging between 0.00 and 1.00.

Pt–Ni nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified version of a previously reported method34. Briefly, 0.15 mmol Pt (acac)2, 0.15 mmol Ni (acac)2, 80 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 300 mg benzoic acid were dissolved in 30 ml of benzyl alcohol with vigorous magnetic stirring. This mixture was then sonicated for 30 min, transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. To precipitate products, an ethanol:acetone mixture (1:1, 10 ml) was added and the mixture washed six times by centrifugation (11,300g, 10 min). Pt–Ni nanozyme samples were then resuspended in distilled water and stored at 4 °C until use.

A self-contained sliding chip design generated with AutoCAD 2024 software (Autodesk) was used to produce transparency photomasks (HTA Photomask), after which chips were fabricated using a previously reported method35. Briefly, the top and bottom chip sections were prepared from two glass slides (75 × 50 × 1 mm3, Corning) by conventional photolithography and glass wet-etching techniques (Supplementary Fig. 7). A 60-min etching at 40 °C was conducted to produce a >50 µm depth for the etched patterns, and access holes were formed using a 0.8 mm diamond drill. These slides were then treated with tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane to generate a hydrophobic coating, after which the slide channels were treated with NaOH to render them hydrophilic. Wells in the second line were conjugated with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies to generate a cell capture region on the chip. Finally, the chip could be assembled by oil (FC-70) to seal the air during operation.

PBMC and microsample (~25 μl) whole-blood samples isolated from EDTA vacutainer tubes were stimulated as described above, after which ~3 μl of a sample was added to the left channel inlet hole (to completely fill the entire reaction channel of the chip) and incubated for 30 min to permit T-cell capture. PBS solutions (3 μl each) containing specific antibodies to human 4-1BB and OX-40, Hoechst dye, PBS, nanozyme and H2O2 were loaded into the corresponding wells through the left inlet holes to fill the entire channels. Finally, the top slide of the chip was carefully slid at an oblique angle, forming ‘Z'-shaped fluidic paths vertically. This manoeuvre facilitated the contact between catalase and H2O2, leading to the generation of O2, which automatically propelled the liquid forward for cell staining and washing.

Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between ASTRA and IGRA results. ROC regression models were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ASTRA assay. The AUC values were calculated to determine the ability of different biomarkers (IFNγ, 4-1BB + OX-40) to distinguish between IGRA-positive and -negative samples. The cut-off for positive ASTRA signal was defined as the mean of the positive cell ratio detected in non-stimulated cells plus three times its standard deviation36. Student's t-test or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical significance of differences observed in the study. All analyses and data visualizations were done using GraphPad Prism v.10.2.1.

Mutations are often thought of as untargeted and non-adaptive, but in rare cases, organisms perform programmed, targeted and adaptive rearrangements of their own DNA sequences. Notable examples include the somatic diversification of immunoglobulin genes, which is the foundation of the vertebrate immune system, and natural CRISPR spacer arrays in bacteria, which recognize and cleave foreign DNA. These systems, along with a dozen known analogs scattered across the tree of life, often underlie critical biological functions, particularly in host–pathogen conflicts. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which organisms edit their own genomes. We show that superficially dissimilar editing systems often rely on surprisingly similar genetic mechanisms, regardless of function or taxon. Finally, we argue that the recurrence of editing in host–pathogen conflicts and the bias to a handful of well-studied organisms strongly suggest that new editing systems will be found in understudied pathogens and their hosts.

A small clause inside OpenAI's contract with Microsoft, once considered a distant hypothetical, has now become a flashpoint in one of the biggest partnerships in tech.

The clause states that if OpenAI's board ever declares it has developed artificial general intelligence (AGI), it would limit Microsoft's contracted access to the startup's future technologies. Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, is now reportedly pushing for the removal of the clause and is considering walking away from the deal entirely, according to the Financial Times.

Late last year, tensions around AGI's suddenly pivotal role in the Microsoft deal spilled into a debate within OpenAI over an internal research paper, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Titled “Five Levels of General AI Capabilities,” the paper outlines a framework for classifying progressive stages of AI technology. By making specific assertions about future AI capabilities, sources claim, the paper could have complicated OpenAI's ability to declare that it had achieved AGI, a potential point of leverage in negotiations.

“We're focused on developing empirical methods to evaluate AGI progress—work that is reproducible, measurable, and useful to the broader field,” OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum said in a written comment to WIRED. “The ‘Five Levels' was an early attempt at classifying stages and terminology to describe general AI capabilities. This was not a scientific research paper.” Microsoft declined to comment.

In a blog post describing its corporate structure, OpenAI notes that AGI “is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft.” OpenAI defines AGI as ""a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.”

The two companies have been renegotiating their agreement as OpenAI prepares a corporate restructuring. While Microsoft wants continued access to OpenAI's models even if the startup declares AGI before the partnership ends in 2030, one person familiar with the partnership discussions tells WIRED that Microsoft doesn't believe OpenAI will reach AGI by that deadline. But another source close to the matter describes the clause as OpenAI's ultimate leverage. Both sources have been granted anonymity to speak freely about private discussions.

According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI has even considered whether to invoke the clause based on an AI coding agent. The talks have grown so fraught that OpenAI has reportedly discussed if it should publicly accuse Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior, per the Journal.

A source familiar with the discussions, granted anonymity to speak freely about the negotiations, says OpenAI is fairly close to achieving AGI; Altman has said he expects to see it during Donald Trump's current term.

That same source suggests there are two relevant definitions: First, OpenAI's board can unilaterally decide the company has reached AGI as defined in its charter, which would immediately cut Microsoft off from accessing the technology or revenue derived from AGI; Microsoft would still have rights to everything before that milestone. Second, the contract includes a concept of sufficient AGI, added in 2023, which defines AGI as a system capable of generating a certain level of profit. If OpenAI asserts it has reached that benchmark, Microsoft must approve the determination. The contract also bars Microsoft from pursuing AGI on its own or through third parties using OpenAI's IP.

Bloomberg previously reported on the existence of the “Five Levels” paper, and that OpenAI was planning to share the scale with its outside investors, though it was considered at the time as a “work in progress.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and chief research officer Mark Chen have spoken about the five levels of AI capabilities in various interviews since. A version of the paper dated September 2024 viewed by WIRED details a five-step scale for measuring how advanced AI systems are, citing other research that claims many of OpenAI's models at that point were at Level 1, defined as “An AI that can understand and use language fluently and can do a wide range of tasks for users, at least as well as a beginner could and sometimes better.”

It notes that some models at the time were approaching Level 2, which the authors define as “An AI that can do more advanced tasks at the request of a user, including tasks that might take an hour for a trained expert to do.” The paper deliberately avoids giving a single definition of AGI, arguing the term is too vague and binary, and instead opts for using a spectrum of capabilities to describe increasingly general and capable AI systems.

The paper doesn't predict when OpenAI's systems will reach each of the five levels, but it does predict how each step up in capabilities could change different facets of society, including education, jobs, science, and politics, warning about new risks as AI tools become more powerful and independent. In a podcast with YCombinator president and CEO Garry Tan in November, Altman said that the company's o1 model could be defined as Level 2, and he expects they'll reach Level 3 “faster than people expect.”

Last July, a coauthor of the paper gave a presentation of the research at an internal event where teams highlighted their most important projects for research-wide awareness, according to multiple sources. The research was well received by other staffers, one source added.

Sources also believe that the paper seemed to be in final stages, and the company had hired a copy editor to finalize the work late last year along with generating visuals for a blog announcing the paper. OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft was cited internally as one reason to hold off on publishing the paper, according to multiple sources who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they were not permitted to speak to the press. Another source says that discussions with Microsoft were often “mentioned as a blocker for putting the paper out.”

McCallum said in a comment to WIRED that “it's not accurate to suggest we held off from sharing these ideas to protect the Microsoft partnership.” Another source familiar with the matter said that the paper wasn't released because it didn't meet technical standards.

“I think mostly the question of what AGI is doesn't matter,” Altman said at a conference in early June “It is a term that people define differently; the same person often will define it differently.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Substack Is Having a Moment—Again. But Time Is Running Out","https://www.wired.com/story/substack-is-having-a-moment-again-but-time-is-running-out/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:29:00 GMT","

Before June 8, the skilled and respected ABC News television journalist Terry Moran was neither a household name nor political lightning rod. That changed abruptly when Moran posted on X that Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller was “a world-class hater,” followed by an addendum that the president was a hater as well. (The post was later taken down.) While the statements were certainly defendable, they apparently violated ABC policy, and Moran was suspended, then dismissed. Moran, though, had one move left. On June 11, he started writing on Substack.

Moran was joining a movement based on a dream: Journalists could start a Substack newsletter and garner subscription fees that would match or exceed their previous salaries. And they would be editorially liberated! No editors to screw up copy, no censorship from bosses when advertisers complain, no corporate overlord to fire you when you say the president of the United States is a hater. Substack says that some people are indeed living the dream. CEO Chris Best recently boasted in a speech that “more than 50” of its users were pulling in a million dollars in revenue.

As more journalists get pushed out of their jobs, get fed up with their bosses, or just want to breathe the cool air of freedom, they now have what appears to be a viable escape hatch. Recently a lot of them are taking advantage of it. Jeff Bezos has been good to Substack: The Washington Post editorial page's apparent recent disinterest in stopping democracy from dying has led popular opinion writer Jennifer Rubin to start a publication called The Contrarian, and censored editorial Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes now publishes on Substack as well. Former MSNBC host Mehdi Hassan started his own publication. Even Chuck Todd has gone indie.

You might be tempted to think that the Substack revolution is shaking up the foundations of journalism, agreeing with Substack star Emily Sundberg that newsroom leaders everywhere should be barring their doors to prevent further defections. Well, not so fast. The Substack model may work very well for a few, but it's not so easy to march in and match a salary. Readers have to pay a high price for a voice that they once enjoyed in a publication they subscribe to. And writers have to get used to the idea that the breadth of their wisdom is limited to a small percentage of patrons. Is Substack sustainable for writers addressing a general audience?

Just in the last week or so, a cluster of critics have been publishing that the platform may be on shaky ground. It started when Eric Newcomer—posting on his own successful Substack—celebrated Substack's recent influx of big names and reported that the platform told investors it was taking in $45 million a year in revenue. He claimed it was seeking a new investment round which would value the company at $700 million. (Substack did not confirm those numbers.)

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

But then Dylan Byers of Puck looked at those numbers and wondered whether the bottom line valuation was actually less than in the previous rounds. Byers, like other critics, charged that once you get past the few real big earners, the platform was full of low-flying mediocrities: “The truth is that the vast majority of the content on Substack is boring, amateurish or batshit crazy,” he wrote. His conclusion was that Substack was a media company trying to be valued as a tech company, which is a familiar fail point for similar companies. (WIRED itself once failed at an IPO for that very reason.)

Ana Marie Cox, who once enjoyed blogging fame as Wonkette, is even grimmer, writing in her newsletter that Substack “is as unstable as a SpaceX launch.” She wasn't impressed with the more recent influx of name writers. “How many Terry Morans does Substack have room for?” she wrote. “Is there even a public appetite for a dozen Terry Morans, each independently Terry Moran-ing in his own newsletter?”

Cox is referring to subscription fatigue, which is something I think of every time a sign-up page pops up when opening a new Substack. Typically, Substack pros solicit a monthly fee of $5-10 or an annual rate of $50-150. Usually there's a free tier of content, but journalists who hope to make at least part of their livelihood on Substack save the good stuff for paid customers. Compared to subscribing to full-fledged publications, this is a terrible value proposition. After leaving The Atlantic, celebrated writer Derek Thompson started a Substack that cost $80 a year—that's one penny more than a digital subscription to the magazine he just left! (The Atlantic will probably spend $300,000 to replace him with someone else worth reading.) It doesn't take too many of those subscriptions to match the cost of The New York Times, which probably has 100 journalists as good as Substack writers, and you get Wordle to boot.

Those fees can pile up. I asked one news-junkie pal of mine how many indie subs she was paying for, and a quick audit showed 31 subs costing over $2,000 per year. But my friend is the exception who actually pays. The vast majority of subscribers on Substack don't. The cost emphasizes the non-egalitarian nature of the independent concept. While I love the idea of liberated journalists speaking out, the fact is that compared to a bundled package known as a publication, the lone-voice model monetizes by delivering full content only to patrons who can afford it. It's a downside for writers, who typically want to reach wider audiences.

“I'm guessing a lot [those writers] don't like not being in the broader conversation on a regular basis, even if they're getting paid more,” says M.G. Siegler, who writes tech commentary on Spyglass, his own free-and-pay indie column.(You will note that this newsletter, and this writer, are delivered to you as part of a larger legacy media stack, That's a conscious choice.)

Substack prefers to dwell on its success stories. Look what happened to Casey Newton. In 2020, he left the Verge and started Platformer, and it's still going strong with a six-figure number of subscribers, some thousands of whom actually pay him real money for all his posts. “Platformer succeeded beyond my expectations,” he told me. “It let me buy a house in San Francisco. I'd honestly never thought I'd be able to do that.”

But Newton no longer publishes on Substack. Platformer is now on another platform called Ghost. It's a choice that a number of successful indie journalists have made, mainly because alternatives don't take a tenth of revenues. (Newton left Substack mainly because he said he was unhappy that the founders didn't sufficiently condemn Nazi-oriented content.) Substack says that it uniquely offers journalists access to a broad community and has offered a social-media-like feed that's sort of an internal Twitter, but I don't sense that those features have taken off. Other potential Substackers, like former CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy, have chosen a platform called Beehiiv.

Unless they already have huge, passionate followings, newly independent journalists have a tough time rounding up enough subscribers to pay for even a fraction of a decent legacy media job. Newton says that early adopters like him had an easier time.

“Substack was shiny and new, and people were warming up to the idea,” he explains. He says that the decline of Twitter is another disadvantage for newer Substack writers. “There was nothing like Twitter in the old days for finding new customers,” he says. “Taking that away has made it meaningfully harder to promote their stuff.”

Even Sundberg, who advised legacy media to sound the alarm about the Substack exodus, told a writer for Status that the window of opportunity for newbies might be closing. “I wouldn't want to be starting now,” she said.

For its part, Substack seems to be pivoting away from its roots. I first met the founders when they were going through Y Combinator's boot-camp-like experience, and they eagerly pitched me on their crusade to improve journalism. But now the Substack “about” page promotes the site as “the home for great culture,” describing itself as “a new media app … [where] you can discover world-class video, podcasts, and writing from a diverse set of creators.”

Note that “writing” comes last in that hierarchy of creator output. Does Substack really think that its creator videos can compete with TikTok and Meta? (Substack did not make its executives available to comment.)

Meanwhile, Moran is off to the races, posting anti-Trump comments without worrying about his job. He has over 100,000 subscribers, though it's not clear how many pay him. I read his comments and view his video posts via his free tier. No way will I pay him: I've already got ABC News on my cable, paid subscriptions to nearly a dozen publications and, yes, a bunch of Substack subs that I or my wife get billed for yearly or monthly. These include James Fallows, Jonathan Alter, Joyce Wadler, and Gregg Easterbrook, during the months he writes Tuesday Morning Quarterback.

Even though the price is high for one single voice, I find those writers worth the cost. But I wish the legacy publications they once wrote for still employed them so I wouldn't have to pay a la carte.

Facebook is asking users for access to their phone's camera roll to automatically suggest AI-edited versions of their photos — including ones that haven't been uploaded to Facebook yet. 

The feature is being suggested to Facebook users when they're creating a new Story on the social networking app. Here, a screen pops up and asks if the user will opt into “cloud processing” to allow creative suggestions. 

As the pop-up message explains, by clicking “Allow,” you'll let Facebook generate new ideas from your camera roll, like collages, recaps, AI restylings, or photo themes. To work, Facebook says it will upload media from your camera roll to its cloud (meaning its servers) on an “ongoing basis,” based on information like time, location, or themes.

The message also notes that only you can see the suggestions, and the media isn't used for ad targeting. 

However, by tapping “Allow,” you are agreeing to Meta's AI Terms. This allows your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI, it says. The company will additionally use the date and presence of people or objects in your photos to craft its creative ideas.

The creative tool is another example of the slippery slope that comes with sharing our personal media with AI providers. Like other tech giants, Meta has grand AI ambitions. Being able to tap into the personal photos users haven't yet shared on Facebook's social network could give the company an advantage in the AI race. 

Unfortunately for end users, in tech companies' rush to stay ahead, it's not always clear what they're agreeing to when features like this appear.

According to Meta's AI Terms around image processing, “once shared, you agree that Meta will analyze those images, including facial features, using AI. This processing allows us to offer innovative new features, including the ability to summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image,” the text states. 

The same AI terms also give Meta's AIs the right to “retain and use” any personal information you've shared in order to personalize its AI outputs. The company notes that it can review your interactions with its AIs, including conversations, and those reviews may be conducted by humans. The terms don't define what Meta considers personal information, beyond saying it includes “information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content.” 

We have to wonder whether the photos you've shared for “cloud processing” also count here.

Meta has not responded to our requests for comment or clarification. 

So far, there hasn't been much backlash about this feature. A handful of Facebook users have stumbled across the AI-generated photo suggestions when creating a new story and raised questions about it. For instance, one user on Reddit found that Facebook had pulled up an old photo (in this case, one that had previously been shared to the social network) and automatically turned it into an anime using Meta AI.

When another user in an anti-AI Facebook group asked for help shutting this feature off, the search led to a section called camera roll sharing suggestions in the app's Settings.

We also found this feature under Facebook's Settings, where it's listed in the Preferences section. 

On the “Camera roll sharing suggestions” page, there are two toggles. The first lets Facebook suggest photos from your camera roll when browsing the app. The second (which should be opt-in based on the pop-up that requested permission in Stories) is where you could enable or disable the “cloud processing,” which lets Meta make AI images using your camera roll photos. 

This additional access to use AI on your camera roll's photos does not appear to be new. 

We found posts from earlier this year where confused Facebook users were sharing screenshots of the pop-up message that appeared in their Stories section. Meta has also published complete Help Documentation about the feature for both iOS and Android users.

Meta's AI terms have been enforceable as of June 23, 2024; we can't compare the current AI terms with older versions because Meta doesn't keep a record, and previously published terms haven't been properly saved by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

Since this feature dips into your camera roll, however, it extends beyond what Meta had previously announced, in terms of training its AIs on your publicly shared data, including posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram. (EU users had until May 27, 2025 to opt out.)

Less than a week ago, Tesla robotaxis began rolling out and giving rides to invited customers in Austin. As Sean O'Kane and I wrote this week, the rollout is the first big test of CEO Elon Musk's belief that it's possible to safely deploy fully autonomous vehicles using just cameras and end-to-end AI — an approach that differs from other players in the space, like Waymo. 

By all accounts (including Tesla's), this is a limited first run. The operating area covers South Austin, the fleet of vehicles is fewer than 20, and there is still a safety “monitor” sitting in the front passenger seat. 

That doesn't mean there was a subdued reaction. Social media provided a flurry of video and personal accounts — from riders and onlookers — of the robotaxis milling about Austin. And in numerous cases, the vehicles appeared to be violating traffic laws such as moving across double yellow lines into the oncoming traffic lane and abruptly hitting the brakes in the middle of intersections. 

The videos prompted federal safety regulators to reach out to Tesla and ask for information on the deployment.  

The reaction to the Tesla robotaxi rollout — and more specifically, to the videos on social — provided an informative view on just how polarizing the company is. As O'Kane quipped to me the other day, “It's like a Rorschach test.”

Tesla's robotaxi rides are either evidence of the company's hubris and Musk's broken promises on automated driving, or the beginning of the end for Waymo, Uber, and Lyft. 

Here's what gets closer to the truth: One week in, and we have a lot of noise and very little signal.

Let's get into the rest of the news. 

On the back of a series of executive departures over the past year, we're hearing that Tesla is planning another round of layoffs across the company this month. CEO Elon Musk spent the last year working on politics, which culminated in a dramatic exit from his duties as head of DOGE. Now he's poised to bring that slash-and-burn energy to his own organization and DOGE-ifying the team at Tesla, with low performers on the chopping block, according to one source who is connected to the company. 

Meanwhile, Tesla is pushing ahead on Cybercab production. One source noted it's created a pressure-cooker environment that has caused some employees to leave the company.

The news cycle this week is giving me 2016 vibes. Take this deal involving Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.

Kalanick is reportedly working with investors to buy the U.S. arm of Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI, and Uber might even help make it happen. 

That's an interesting move. In 2017, Kalanick was pressured to resign due to reports that he fostered a toxic workplace culture rife with sexual harassment, among other complaints. His resignation came a year after Uber purchased Otto, the self-driving trucks startup co-founded by Anthony Levandowski (CEO Pronto AI), Lior Ron (CEO Uber Freight), Don Burnette (founder of Kodiak Robotics), and Claire Delaunay (former Nvidia, former farm-ng CTO, and current seed investor). That deal, which was absorbed into what became Uber ATG, was controversial from the start and ultimately led to Waymo suing Uber over trade secrets theft.

Fast-forward eight years: Waymo and Uber are on friendly business terms, and Kalanick is still wondering, “What if?” The founder has been pretty vocal about saying Uber would have its own self-driving fleet had he still been in charge. 

Then there's Pony, which has operations in the U.S. that are at risk due to national security rules. The company has been poised to sell off its U.S. arm since at least 2022. 

Nascent Materials, a new startup developing cathode materials to drive down the cost of LFP batteries, raised $2.3 million in a seed round led by SOSV. The New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund and UM6P Ventures also participated.

Raphe mPhibr, the Indian drone startup, raised $100 million in an all-equity Series B round led by General Catalyst.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent Ford a lengthy list of questions about its hands-free driver-assistance system BlueCruise as part of an investigation that started more than one year ago following two fatal crashes involving the software.

There was a time when AV startups tried to avoid talking about remote driving as a means of supporting its driverless tech. Now companies are openly talking about it. Take self-driving trucks company Kodiak Robotics and Vay, a remote driving startup out of Berlin. The two companies, which announced a partnership this week, have been working together since last year. 

Waymo and Uber have officially entered another market. The companies, which launched the “Waymo on Uber” service in Austin earlier this year, are now operating in a 65-square-mile area of Atlanta. 

On top of that, Uber Eats launched sidewalk delivery robots in Atlanta with Serve Robotics, an Uber spinout that went public last year. 

The upshot: Momentum seems to be building for all three companies. Uber is turning into the network connector to autonomous tech (it has 18 AV partnerships globally). Waymo is the robotaxi market leader. It provides 250,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across five major cities. With Atlanta joining that list and expansions in its existing markets, that figure has surely exceeded the 300,000 mark. And Atlanta marks Serve's fourth commercial city as it works to scale to 2,000 bots on sidewalks by the end of 2025. 

Redwood Materials is launching an energy storage business that will leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected from its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. And it's starting with — what else? — AI data centers. 

Rivian has laid off 140 employees ahead of its launch of the more affordable R2 SUV in 2026. The manufacturing team was hit the hardest. 

Tesla's top sales executive has reportedly gotten the boot from Elon Musk. Omead Afshar was one of Musk's closest confidants who just this week was posting on X about the “historic day for Tesla” when the company rolled out its robotaxis in Austin. 

There was a moment around 2017 when Intel appeared poised to become a dominant player in automotive. The company had acquired Mobileye, and its VC arm was investing millions into the sector. It was part of the future of transportation conversation. Now Intel is saying goodbye to its automotive architecture business — including its AI-enhanced system-on-chip design for vehicles that had been set for production by the end of 2025 — and laying off most of its staff as part of a broader restructure.

TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is coming to Moscone West in San Francisco on October 27–29, and we're bringing the heavy hitters to the Builders Stage. On October 28, three names that helped shape the modern internet are sitting down for an exclusive fireside chat on what it takes to build, scale, and fund startups in today's ever-shifting tech landscape.

Adam Bain, Dick Costolo, and David Fischer are now leading the charge at 01 Advisors, a venture firm investing in breakout companies like Tipalti and SpotOn. But before they were backing the next generation, they were the operators running some of tech's most iconic companies.

Adam Bain, former COO of Twitter, helped transform the platform from a scrappy social tool into a global business. He built Twitter's sales, product, and ad operations teams from the ground up, growing revenue from millions to billions in just five years.

Dick Costolo, Twitter's former CEO, led the company through hypergrowth — expanding headcount by more than 400%, establishing its long-term strategy, and increasing annual revenue from $28 million to $2.25 billion. Before that, he founded FeedBurner, one of the earliest content distribution platforms, later acquired by Google.

David Fischer, former chief revenue officer at Meta, was the architect of the company's global ad business. Over more than a decade, he scaled annual revenue from under $1 billion to over $100 billion and helped more than 200 million businesses connect with customers across the globe. He also helped build Google's early sales engine and once served in the U.S. Treasury Department.

This session isn't just about what these three have done — it's about where they believe tech is headed next. From finding product-market fit to scaling with intention, they'll share firsthand advice and stories that go beyond boardroom strategy. Expect sharp takes on fundraising in today's market, how to build high-performing teams, and what they look for when backing founders through 01A.

Elon Musk may be out of the picture, but the Department of Government Efficiency is still around and being deployed to terrorize the public servants at agencies across the federal government. The latest target: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, where DOGE will be tasked with slashing gun restrictions, according to the Washington Post.

DOGE staff (those who are left, at least, seeing as high-profile figures like Big Balls have tapped out of the operation) are reportedly being sent into the ATF with the goal of cutting or revising 47 gun regulations. That goal is apparently a reference to Trump being the 47th President of the United States, though the Washington Post reported that they are likely to blow past that figure and change more than 50 existing rules. No respect for regulations or symbolism. They have also been given a deadline of accomplishing this by July 4, because nothing would be a better gift to America for her birthday than easier access to firearms.

Just from a process standpoint, it's always good to start with an arbitrary number and go looking to make cuts solely to meet that quota rather than because something actually needs changing. That's just smart governance, extremely efficient stuff.

As to what those regulations are that will be changed, it's hard to say. The Post noted that the agency enforces hundreds of rules that help to dictate the way that firearms are bought, sold, and used in the country. The report floated the possibility that DOGE may change the rules on what types of guns can be imported and make licensing fees refundable.

The pseudo-agency will also reportedly make changes to the mandated 4473 Form that gun buyers are required to fill out when purchasing a firearm, and sellers are required to keep in their records to help trace guns. The plan is to cut the form from seven pages down to three. How will they do that? By asking fewer questions of the gun buyer. Per the Post, questions that are currently seperate that ask things like whether a person has been committed to a mental institution, has been dishonorably discharged from the military, or has used illegal drugs will all just get smushed together into a single “yes” or “no” question as to whether a person is legally allowed to own a firearm.

While DOGE is unleashed on the ATF's rule book, the Trump administration has been hacking away at the agency's size and purpose. The Department of Justice recently announced plans to cut the number of inspectors on its staff by two-thirds, significantly reducing the agency's ability to investigate businesses that sell guns to criminals. That doesn't go as far as other Republicans, who have introduced legislation to abolish the agency entirely.

The Constitution still says “well-regulated” in the Second Amendment, right? Or can DOGE cut that line?

It's never a bad time to elevate your home entertainment setup whether it's in your living room, bedroom or home theater, especially if you love hosting. Don't underestimate just how important audio is when it comes to immersive viewing. What you want is a really good sound system, and the good news is you don't need to break the bank to install one. Right now, Amazon has its Fire TV soundbar on sale for 29% off. Normally going for $120, that discount is enough to bring this television audio accessory down to $85—its lowest price ever.

See at Amazon

The movie-watching experience is built on two part, picture and sound—and people drastically undervalue the importance of the latter. You can have the best picture in the world available, but it won't leave its full impact if the audio is coming out of the TV's built-in speakers. The best way to improve your home audio for watching movies, football games, and big budget TV shows without breaking your own budget is with a soundbar.

Amazon's 2.0 channel soundbar has a built-in tweeter and a deep, powerful bass. The slim design makes it perfect for smaller living spaces like those apartment-living in the city. It rests easily on top of your TV stand or can be mounted to the wall, whichever you prefer. It's only 24″ across so it can fit pretty much anywhere without sacrificing sound quality.

The soundbar connects to your TV easily using HDMI ARC and then fills your room with spectacular sound thanks to the DTS Virtual:X surround sound. This emulates full, 3D cinema quality sound and makes it so you have a great listening experience no matter where you are sitting in relation to the soundbar. Take the sound even further with Dolby Audio-supported entertainment.

It's just plug and play. Once connected, your audio output should change instantly from the TV speakers to your new soundbar. You can even connect to your phone or other devices to listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more using either USB or Bluetooth.

The Fire TV soundbar works seamlessly with Fire TV smart TVs and streaming media players, so you will only need one remote to control your TV and your audio. Just use the remote that came with you Fire TV.

So if you're ready to turn your back on the low-quality audio you TV's built-in speakers are providing you, you can upgrade to the Fire TV soundbar for the low price of $85 over at Amazon.

It's a lovely time of year to be outdoors. The weather is nice, the vibes are on point, and there's no denying the appeal of a good long walk, a day at the beach, or just hanging out in the forest. However, just because you're going back to nature doesn't mean you have to do away with all of the lovely modern conveniences, and that's where a great portable power station comes in.

See at Amazon

Thanks to a great deal on Amazon right now, you can get your hands on the excellent Anker 521 Portable Power Station for just $160. That's 27% off the normal price of $220, and a fantastic price. It's a limited-time offer though, so don't expect to be around for very long.

The Anker 521 Portable Power Station is actually just flat out better than previous models for a lot of reasons, and one of those is the LiFePO4 Battery, which makes for a more reliable option with a better battery life and faster charging. In fact, it has an incredible output of up to 600W, which is more than enough to power a huge number of devices at once. It helps that it also has six ports to choose from, with it having two AC, two USB-A, one USB-C, and a car outlet too. That means you'll never have an issue recharging the majority of devices you might be using.

It charges incredibly quickly as well, thanks to a 256Wh capacity, meaning it not only charges a lot, but also does so with haste. It's the kind of power station you can rely on nearly everywhere you might want it. It just makes beach days or camping trips better, and can even be useful at home in the event there's an issue with the power.

It's also built-to-last. The LiFeP04 battery means that it can last up to 10 years of use, and does a great job of regulating temperatures, and it's all in a very durable shell as well. This thing isn't going to break without a fairly large effort on your part. Not that you should be trying to break it.

There's no doubt that this is a great pickup at the normal price of $220, so being able to get it for just $160 is a chance that shouldn't be missed. Just make sure you're quick if you do want it to avoid missing out on this great discount.

Researchers have found that even after recovery, individuals who previously experienced depression may retain a heightened sensitivity to negative cues and face challenges in regulating responses to potential punishment. The findings from the new study in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier, could lead to better ways to identify individuals at risk for relapse and help develop more targeted interventions to improve long-term recovery and prevent future episodes of depression.

Depression is characterized by high relapse rates, with up to 80% of individuals experiencing a return of symptoms within five years, demonstrating that recovery does not always guarantee lasting resilience. To improve prevention, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to an individual's vulnerability to relapse is needed.

Lead investigator Henricus G. Ruhé, MD, PhD, Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, and Donders Institute for Brain-Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, Netherlands, says, ""The high relapse rates observed in depression suggest that there must be ongoing processes in the brain that continue to make individuals vulnerable to future episodes, even after symptoms have improved. Prior research has shown that people with depression often remain sensitive to punishment, even after remission. This led us to focus on aversive learning—a type of Pavlovian classical conditioning where a person learns to avoid a stimulus or behavior by associating it with an unpleasant outcome. We focused on the habenula—a small region of the brain involved in processing negative feedback. We wanted to find out whether abnormalities in this system persist even after someone has recovered from depressive symptoms.""

For this study, researchers used functional MRI (fMRI) to assess brain activity during an aversive learning task in 36 patients with recurrent depression and 27 healthy controls. Participants learned associations between a picture and an unpleasant bitter taste while undergoing the fMRI scan.

Imaging revealed evidence that individuals with remitted depression showed increased habenula activity specifically during the expectation of punishment, along with reduced connectivity between the habenula and the ventral tegmental area, an important midbrain nucleus responsible for producing the reward related neurotransmitter dopamine and an area thought to be regulated by habenula activity. These patterns suggest a heightened sensitivity to negative cues and a reduced ability to regulate responses to potential punishment, even after symptoms have subsided.

Editor-in-Chief of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine, concludes, ""While much is known about how depression affects brain function during active illness, we have little understanding of whether these changes persist after recovery. This study highlights that even when individuals no longer show obvious symptoms of depression, they may still experience heightened sensitivity to negative cues, which could contribute to relapse risk. Understanding these lingering effects could lead to better ways to identify at-risk individuals and help develop more targeted interventions to improve long-term recovery and prevent future episodes of depression.""

A team of researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) has identified a new brain imaging benchmark that may improve how researchers classify biologically meaningful changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, especially in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations. The new study, published in Imaging Neuroscience, is part of the Health and Aging Brain Study–Health Disparities (HABS-HD), a multi-university collaboration led by the University of North Texas Health Science Center and supported by the National Institute on Aging.

Using an advanced brain imaging scan called tau PET, the research team studied over 675 older adults from HABS-HD, aiming to identify the optimal brain signal that distinguishes individuals with clinically-relevant biological markers of AD from those who are aging normally.

Tau PET enables researchers to visualize abnormal proteins in the brain which contribute to Alzheimer's disease, known as tau, by using a small amount of a special radioactive tracer that highlights areas where tau has accumulated. With these scans, researchers can establish tau cut-points, a new type of biomarker used to determine whether a scan shows an amount of tau protein in the brain high enough to suggest possible early signs of Alzheimer's disease or related conditions. This new benchmark could eventually inform the way clinicians interpret tau PET scans and better identify who may be at risk for AD.

In this study, researchers compared tau PET scans of study participants who were cognitively impaired with those who were not impaired based on cognitive tests to establish a tau cut-point that would indicate a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. They found one-but it was only effective in certain circumstances.

Our tau cut-point was able to distinguish whether study participants had cognitive impairment – but only when another abnormal protein, amyloid, was also present in those with cognitive impairment, and only in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White participants. In non-Hispanic Black participants, the tau cut-point did not perform as expected. This suggests that other pathologies or conditions may be driving cognitive decline in this group. Our study is an important step toward better understanding how tau relates to cognition in diverse populations and has important implications for future clinical trials that aim to target tau.""

Meredith N. Braskie, PhD, senior author, assistant professor of neurology

The team used a new imaging tracer called 18F-PI-2620, to measure tau protein buildup in the brain. They found that when tau levels in the medial temporal lobe­-a region deep in the brain-exceeded a certain threshold, it strongly indicated cognitive impairment related to AD.

""While our findings support prior research linking medial temporal lobe tau to cognitive impairment, establishing a cut-point in this region using 18F-PI-2620, marks an important step toward defining tau positivity for both research and clinical applications. At the same time, the limited reliability of tau as an indicator of cognitive impairment in non-Hispanic Black participants highlights the need for more diverse populations in research and for future studies to examine both biological and social determinants of Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead author Victoria R. Tennant, a PhD candidate in USC's Neuroscience Graduate Program.

The findings reflect a growing focus in AD research on making sure diagnostic tools work for everyone-not just in narrow clinical trial populations. Alzheimer's disease is known to affect the brain in stages. While amyloid plaques often build up early, tau tangles are more closely tied to memory loss and other symptoms.

""This type of imaging is critical for understanding who is at risk and how the disease develops,"" said Stevens INI director Arthur W. Toga, PhD. ""These findings are just the latest to come from HABS-HD, which is the most comprehensive study of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in diverse communities. HABS-HD has already produced key findings related to ethnic variations in AD biomarkers, the influences of social determinants on cognitive health, and vascular contributions to dementia, just to name a few. We hope this work will lead to more personalized care and better outcomes for all communities.""

COMMERCE CITY, CO–The NWSL is on break until August 1st as events like the Women's Euros are on the horizon. For the US Women's National Team, it was a chance to get back on the pitch and did so with a 4-0 win over Republic of Ireland.

Rose Lavelle, earning her first cap in over six months, set up the first goal in the 18th minute as Avery Patterson headed it in just past Courtney Brosnan to make it 1-0. Just before halftime, Sam Coffee came into the penalty area and then beat Brosnan far post to double the USA's advantage.

Lavelle would get her goal in the 53rd minute after a feed from Ally Sentnor. Lavelle became the 19th player in USWNT history to score 25+ goals and 25+ assists for the national team.

The final goal was a work of art from Alyssa Thompson. After taking the ball at midfield, she got around Jessie Stapleton and then made a run toward the area where she would shoot and beat Brosnan far post to make 4-0 on 63 minutes.

As usual, it was all United States in this match outshooting Ireland 26-2 as the visitors would hardly test Claudia Dickey's goal on the evening in Colorado. The two sides will meet again on Sunday in Cincinnati at TQL Stadium at 3pm ET (TNT/TruTV/Universo/Max/Peacock).

Alex Freeman has been asked about Antonio Freeman lately – including what's the favorite highlight of his dad from the NFL days.

The younger Freeman readily answers, saying it's his dad's famous game-winning catch in overtime on Monday Night Football from 2000 that even got play-by-play announcer Al Michaels to exclaim ""He did what?!"" in disbelief.

""Very, very important for Packers fans,"" Freeman said. 

But Alex is also making his own impression – it's just on a different type of field.

At age 20, Freeman is the youngest player on the U.S. men's national team roster at the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He's already started all three games for the U.S. at right-back, helping the team reach the tournament's quarterfinals. And he was named this week as

This USMNT squad is missing several key stars at the Gold Cup for various reasons. Rest from long seasons. Injuries. Playing in the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup. But that's given rising talents like Freeman the chance to make a big impression on U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino. 

So, who is Alex Freeman? Here's what he had to say about his burgeoning soccer career, his dream about reaching the World Cup – and yes, his Super Bowl-winning dad. 

What was it like to get your first USMNT call-up, and to have it be for something as important as the Gold Cup? 

Alex Freeman: It means a lot. I feel like this is something that is very important to the U.S., to the team, and to myself. It's an honor to get called up and represent the country at this high-level tournament. It's just something that pushes all of us each day in training and especially in the games, to be able to win and try to get a trophy out of this.

Were you expecting to be on this roster or were you surprised? 

Freeman: I would say I was surprised. I was just grateful to be on the [60-man] preliminary roster. Knowing that I was chosen for that final roster was a very big surprise for me and something that I'm forever grateful for.

What has the USMNT camp and the tournament experience been like for you so far? 

Freeman: It's been good getting to know all the guys. We have a good group here, but also just being able to build chemistry with these guys in practice and everything like that. It's something that, you know, going into this camp that I really wanted to do was be able to get to know the guys' stories, where they come from and all that. And it's been good so far.

Did you have expectations that you would be starting and playing as much as you have at this point? 

Freeman: When I came in, I was just going to work and see what Pochettino wanted and how I could fit his playing style. I didn't think I was going to play this much, but I just have to show [what I can do] when I'm on the field and just take my chances and show him why I deserve to be out there in the first place.

What's your favorite highlight from your dad and how many times have you watched it? 

Freeman: (laughs) My favorite highlight is probably the Monday Night Football catch when he's on the ground and [the ball] hits his shoulder and he kind of catches it and gets up and scores the winning touchdown. It was a rivalry game [against the Vikings], so that was something that was very, very important for Green Bay fans.

When I was a kid, I would watch that over and over and over. I'd look up ‘Top 10 catches' and it would always be there. It was just a big moment for him and something that I admire.

What is your dad's favorite highlight of your career and how many times has he watched it? 

Freeman: It's probably the one when I had my first start [at Orlando] and scored a goal against Toronto. He has a whole video of himself that he recorded and it's very popular. I think you could just tell in that moment that he was excited and happy. I saw him after the game and he actually couldn't believe it. I feel like that will be a moment he will remember forever.

Was it tough to break it to your dad that you were going to play fútbol and not the same football he played? 

Freeman: It wasn't tough to tell him because he just wanted me to do something that I was passionate about and be able to excel at something. When I was younger, I played all the sports and when it came time, I chose [soccer] and I feel like he was supporting me the whole time. 

Obviously, it's weird telling your dad, who played another sport, that you want to play [a different sport]. But I feel like at the end of the day, he accepted it and just supported me.

How close are you guys? Does he come to all of your games? 

Freeman: He's been to all the games at the Gold Cup and I think he's coming to the game in Dallas, too. He's just making this his own little vacation. But yeah, he's very supportive. Even in Orlando, he comes to a lot of the games.

Who else is part of that support system that comes to your games? 

Freeman: I have a lot. My mom, my stepdad, and then I have my two little brothers and I feel like they're really the ones that I play for the most because they're the ones who look up to me as an example. And I feel like for them, it's just being able to be that good role model. 

[Tyler, 15, and Josh, 13] are both soccer players as well and just want to do what I'm doing. So just to be able to guide them in the right direction or any direction they want to go through.

They must think you playing for the USMNT is pretty cool then? 

Freeman: Yeah, yeah. Whenever I go home, I watch them play and they tell all their friends [about my career]. It's good they're able to brag about me a little bit (laughs).

Who is the coolest person you've met through your dad? 

Freeman: I've met a lot of cool people through him. The most notable one I'd say is Scottie Pippen. When I was little, I was a big basketball fan so seeing him was really enjoyable.

When did you realize your dad was a Super Bowl-winning wide receiver? 

Freeman: When I was younger you'd hear about it, but you don't really understand it fully. I think I understood it when I was in middle school. Like in sixth grade I actually started doing research on my dad — it's funny. I realized how inspirational he was not just in Wisconsin, but to football in general. And so I think that was when I really realized how much of an impact he made on the game and in Green Bay.

Are the Packers your favorite team? 

Freeman: Yeah, the Packers are my favorite team. But my second favorite team is probably the Steelers because my stepdad is a big Steelers fan.

Who was the first person you called or texted when you found out you made the roster? 

Freeman: My mom [Rochelle]. 

What do you like to do when you're not playing soccer? Any cool or unique hobbies? 

Freeman: I've been getting into golf a lot. And I like to read. Right now I'm reading this book called ‘Win The Day' [by Mark Batterson]. It's about being your best self. 

What's your pre-game meal? 

Freeman: Pasta and chicken. That's a must.

The U.S. women's national team loves to get on TikTok during training camp. Is that something this younger USMNT group does too? 

Freeman: We don't really post, but we're the type to see a trend on TikTok and do it. We'll make little jokes about it or stuff like that. But the dancing and posting, this isn't really the group that does that.

What would it mean to you to be on the U.S. World Cup roster next year? 

Freeman: It would mean the world to me. That's what every kid dreams of. And I feel like it's something that everyone wants to work towards and be able to get there. And so right now, it's just about putting your head down and putting in that extra work to be able to show the coaches here and to show the world that you're ready to compete at that level against the best.

Mic'd Up: The ex-U.S. international discussed the state of the USMNT, Street FC and the return of Showdown to NYC

Kyle Martino, the former U.S. international turned commentator, knows much about USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, dating back more than a decade back he was Tottenham Hotspur manager and Martino was a host for NBC Sports Soccer. And what he's seen so far from Pochettinto and the USMNT?

""The first impression is that it's not good enough yet,"" Martino told GOAL.

Martino, however, is backing him to succeed long-term with the program.

""I've gotten to spend a lot of time with him,"" he said. ""I have always been impressed in my time being able to observe him, whether from afar, through my role at NBC, or being at Spurs trainings when he first got there, and now getting a chance to be on the inside.""

Currently competing at the 2025 Gold Cup, the USMNT is preparing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup that will be hosted in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. However, Martino - in contrast to some other voices of the game - doesn't believe the current tournament matters much in the grand scheme.

""I hate to take wind out of the talking heads that want to be hyperbolic in this moment, but the Gold Cup has almost never created the majority of a World Cup roster,"" he said.

The TNT commentator sat down with GOAL ahead of the Steve Nash Foundation's Showdown in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Martino, founder of Street FC - a street soccer community across NYC - partnered with Nash to bring some of the top high school players from around the city to play along with legends such as Ali Krieger, Sacha Kljestan, Bradley Wright-Phillips and Dutch legend Edgar Davids.

""I built Street FC to be a platform to shift the paradigm away from the construct of grass and coaches and expensive play,"" he said, ""and that being the only avenue to get in for the game and move up the pyramid.""

Showdown, a staple of NYC footballing culture, is a competition Martino has fond memories of, dating back to 2008, the first edition of the 5v5 tournament.

""I'll never forget,"" he recalls. ""I was walking around in Manhattan, and one of my buddies called me and was like, 'I think that Steve Nash and Claudio Reyna - because he knew I was friends with these guys - are playing like a pickup soccer game in Chinatown with, like, Thierry Henry and Jason Kidd' And I was like, 'Dude, you're f*cking with me!'

""And so when he told me that the game had already kicked off, I jumped in a cab, got there, and I couldn't even see the game through the wall of kids and adults, and everyone that had scaled the fence to get a view of the spectacle.""

Martino discussed the return of Showdown, Pochettino's World Cup opportunity, and the state of the USMNT in the latest edition of Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL US taps into the perspective of broadcasters, analysts, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad.

The FIFA Club World Cup bracket has taken shape as the group stage wrapped up Wednesday. The round of 16 matchups are confirmed as fans can begin predicting who will lift the trophy.

Nearly every major European side advanced to the bracket except for Atlético Madrid who were stunned by Botafogo. Inter Miami are also the sole Major League Soccer representative after Seattle Sounders and LAFC were bounced from the competition. Still, there's plenty of tantalizing matchups in the round of 16 with some Champions League final rematches on the horizon potentially.

Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are the perceived favorites to go deep in the competition given their group stage performances. But, anything can happen in come the knockout rounds.

Here's a look at the FIFA Club World Cup bracket at the round of 16 stage and possible quarterfinal matches.

Stevie Nicol backs Pep Guardiola's stance on restricting Rodri's minutes despite his frustration. (2:09)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, and has produced plenty of talking points and storylines already. Let's catch you up on what's happening, what you've missed and what's still to come.

We will update this file throughout each matchday with the latest reporting, analysis and fun from the competition.

PHILADELPHIA -- As the rain fell in Philadelphia, Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid started to take shape. This was, by some distance, Madrid's best group stage performance at this Club World Cup, with a new formation -- Alonso's favored three-at-the-back -- a new sense of certainty of purpose, and a reborn Vinícius Júnior scoring a superb goal, and providing a backheel assist for Federico Valverde. By halftime at Lincoln Financial Field, Madrid were already 2-0 up, and out of sight.

Until now, circumstances -- notably a long injury list -- had limited Alonso's freedom to pick the team that he really wants to. Here, for the first time, Antonio Rüdiger was fit to start in a back three alongside Dean Huijsen and Aurélien Tchouaméni. In the moments before kickoff, before reaching for a raincoat, Alonso spoke to Tchouaméni on the touchline, sharing some last-minute instructions. Whatever they were, it worked. Madrid have long been wedded to a back four, but watching them here, you wouldn't know it.

Ahead of the defense, Valverde and Arda Güler sat in a well-balanced double pivot. On either side of them, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Fran García were free to push forward, playing to their attacking strengths. Jude Bellingham -- who worked hard without the ball, and was decisive with it -- played as an inside-right, with Vinícius on the left, and Gonzalo García in constant motion up front.

It was a formation which seemed to suit all of the players: simultaneously fresh, but comfortable. And the fans in the stadium, the overwhelming majority of them Madridistas, enjoyed every minute, despite the pouring rain.

After 20 minutes, Vinicius could have put Madrid ahead, but his shot was saved by RB Salzburg goalkeeper Christian Zawieschitzky. It was the first sign that the Brazilian was finding his form. Previously at this tournament, Vinicius had looked unsure and awkward, as likely to trip while attempting a rainbow flick as to be influential.

But there was nothing hesitant about his finish in the 40th minute to make it 1-0, collecting Bellingham's visionary pass, finding space with a change of direction, and shooting low into the corner. His role in Madrid's second goal, just before halftime, was equally incisive, backheeling the ball into Valverde's path for a straightforward finish.

Salzburg had their moments in the second half, but Thibaut Courtois was there to make his usual saves, and when he was beaten once, in the 66th minute, Bellingham was there to clear off the line. There was never really a sense of a way back into the game for the Austrians, even before García made it 3-0 in the 84th minute. It's now two goals and an assist for the 21-year-old in three games.

So Madrid top Group H, and will play Juventus in Miami on Tuesday in the round of 16, with the feeling that, unquestionably now, they're heading in the right direction. -- Alex Kirkland

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Manchester City haven't had a recognized left back in the squad for nearly four years, but Rayan Aït-Nouri seems determined to show Pep Guardiola what he's been missing, playing a key role in Thursday's 5-2 win over Juventus.

It was August 2021 when City last played with a proper left back -- Benjamin Mendy's final appearance before he was suspended by the club. Guardiola has made do in the meantime with a series of stopgaps. Nathan Aké, João Cancelo, Aymeric Laporte, Josko Gvardiol and Nico O'Reilly have all filled in. Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden were pressed into action during in-game emergencies.

Aït-Nouri, though, is already showing the benefits of having a specialist. After arriving from Wolverhampton Wanderers ahead of the Club World Cup, the 24-year-old was so bright on his debut against Al Ain that when Guardiola was asked to assess his performance, he simply said: ""Wow.""

The City boss picked a stronger team against Juventus -- handing starts to Rodri and Rúben Dias for the first time -- and Aït-Nouri was even better. He created two big chances inside the opening 10 minutes. After just four minutes, the Algerian -- playing high up the pitch and tucked into midfield at times -- arrowed a cross at Bernardo Silva, who saw his header saved. Moments later, it was Aït-Nouri's pinpoint pass through the Juventus defense that allowed Jérémy Doku to cut inside and score the first in what was an impressive win over the Italian side at Camping World Stadium. Aït-Nouri almost capped his first-half performance with a goal of his own, but his shot into the turf from outside the box was stopped from nestling in the corner by a diving Michele Di Gregorio.

It's exactly the kind of attacking output that Aït-Nouri was brought in to produce. He got five goals for Wolves in all competitions last season. Perhaps even more impressive was his seven Premier League assists. That matched Kevin De Bruyne's output and was one more than Trent Alexander-Arnold.

It's still early days, but Aït-Nouri looks to have filled a gaping hole in Guardiola's team. And having signed a fee of only £31 million, he could yet go down as one of the transfers of the summer. -- Rob Dawson

Dusan Vlahovic is arguably the player who has been linked most with a move to the Premier League without actually coming close to a transfer to England's top flight. The Juventus forward went into the Group G clash against Manchester City with reports in Italy suggesting that he is on Manchester United's list of summer targets.

In the past, the 25-year-old has been targeted by Arsenal, Chelsea, West Ham United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, but after hitting 49 goals in 108 games for Fiorentina, he opted to stay in Italy with a move to Juventus in 2022. With Juventus open to offers for Vlahovic this summer, the game against City was a chance to prove his credentials to United, or any other major club in the market for a new striker, but the Serbia forward had a frustrating 90 minutes against Pep Guardiola's side in Orlando.

Vlahovic missed two good chances before finally getting on the scoresheet in the 84th minute -- when the game was lost for Juventus, who had already conceded five against City. And while he took his goal well to make the score 5-2, Vlahovic struggled against City defenders Ruben Dias and Manuel Akanji and did little to suggest he could be the answer to United's goalscoring problems. -- Mark Ogden

PHILADELPHIA -- Xabi Alonso is already putting his stamp on Real Madrid. After two standout seasons at Bayer Leverkusen, the Spanish manager was chosen by club president Florentino Pérez to take over from Carlo Ancelotti. And just three games into his spell, he is showing why.

The team started the competition in a familiar 4-3-3 setup, but by the end of the match against Pachuca, Alonso had switched to a five-man backline, a change he kept in place for the 3-0 win over RB Salzburg. In Philadelphia, Aurélien Tchouaméni dropped into the back three, playing between Antonio Rüdiger and Dean Huijsen.

Further up the pitch, Federico Valverde anchored the midfield with Jude Bellingham and Arda Güler. In attack, Vinicius Júnior partnered with Gonzalo García, forming a front two that shaped the team into a 3-5-2 when in possession and a 5-3-2 out of possession.

Alonso's tactical flexibility and attention to structure are already evident. If these early matches are any indication, Real Madrid under him could become one of the most tactically sophisticated sides in Europe. -- Gustavo Hofman, ESPN Brazil

With no consequences on Thursday, Al Ain finished their Club World Cup participation with a breezy, busy 2-1 win over Wydad AC in Nashville to ensure they went home on a high note.

It has been a tough tournament for the 2023-24 AFC Champions League winners, whose naive defending was picked apart to the tune of 11 goals by Man City and Juventus. Early in Thursday's clash, it looked to be another long afternoon as the Moroccan side found the net inside four minutes: right back Mohamed Moufid's low cross found Cassius Mailula unmarked in the box, and Mailula had time to control and fire into the top corner beyond Rui Patrício.

Yet Al Ain quickly regrouped and bossed much of the first half, with eight shots and over 60% of the ball. They got their well-deserved equalizer in first-half injury time, with Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba converting a penalty -- after some 30 seconds of waiting -- following Ayoub Boucheta's clumsy challenge. Then, just five minutes into the second half, they scored again in somewhat controversial fashion. Kaku's curled, left-footed finish from 15 yards out was highlight-worthy, but rewatching his goal reveals Al Ain's good fortune. Matías Palacios looked to have lost possession inside the area after a clumsy touch, but remarkably, he won the loose ball with a heavy challenge -- one lucky not to have been reviewed -- before getting back to his feet and finding Romero unmarked for the elegant finish.

The second half played out at a gentler pace from there, with Al Ain preventing Wydad from registering a single shot on target en route to victory.

In the end, Group G was really the only group to be resolved before the final round of games, which is a cruel fate for two teams that brought plenty of panache in their carry-on luggage for this Club World Cup party. -- James Tyler

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Al Hilal survived Group H and, along with Real Madrid, advanced to the round of 16 of the Club World Cup thanks to a 2-0 victory over Pachuca in the final match of the group stage, with goals from Salem Al-Dawsari and Marcos Leonardo.

The South American clubs taking part in the FIFA Club World Cup have been one of the tournament's biggest stories on and off the pitch. 

On it, Brazilians clubs have shocked some of European soccer's best — Botafogo toppled French powerhouse PSG before Flamengo took down England's Chelsea — and off of it, supporters of teams such as Palmeiras and Fluminense have fueled an exciting atmosphere for the reconfigured tournament. 

It has put a spotlight on the passion South Americans have for their clubs and how the support has helped propel their teams during the Club World Cup.

At MetLife Stadium, Palmeiras fans packed the sections behind the net, chanting throughout the match while waving banners and flags. And the party continued during a weather delay during one match with fans packing the concourse, banging drums and continuing to chant. 

Similar scenes played out in stadiums across the United States during the group stage of the Club World Cup. Away from the field, fans turned local landmarks into soccer hubs — it went viral when Palmeiras fans taking over Times Square the night before the tournament.

All four of the Brazilian clubs — including Palmeiras and Fluminense, which each played a pair of games at MetLife Stadium during the group stage — advanced to the knockout round beginning Saturday.

The turn of events has shocked some, but Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola hardly seemed surprised about the atmosphere the fans have created or about the results on the pitch. 

“I love when I see Botafogo, all the Brazilian teams, Argentinian teams, how they celebrate, how they are together, I love them,” Guardiola told reporters recently.

“I like how all the games are tight, except one or two, and people are surprised, European teams lose. … Welcome to the real world, my friends.”

The strong support has been bolstered by fans willing to travel to the United States to follow their favorite clubs, along with a strong base of support already in North America.

Palmeiras, for example, has a club-recognized group called Palmeiras Consulate in New York, which has organized a number of events since the start of the Club World Cup earlier this month.

Adriano Branco helped create the group two years ago after he relocated from Brazil to the New York area for work. In a conversation with The Post, he called helping to bring together so many fans from so many backgrounds a “rewarding experience.” 

“I'm having the time of my life to see people that are in the U.S. [and] have never left the U.S. as their first time watching a [Palmeiras] match,” he said. “I could see a lot of supporters crying, from the emotion of being in the atmosphere of the stadium. And I can tell you that what you saw at the stadium here is the same as you would see in Brazil if you were there in a big match. 

“For me, I was telling friends, I don't think I've ever been that happy in my life with everything that's happening surrounding Palmeiras here in New York.”

Branco hasn't been surprised by the support the South American clubs have had — Palmeiras in particular — but the sheer number of fans that have shown up has been eye-opening. 

He estimated that 30,000 of the 45,000 fans announced for Palmeiras' first match against Porto on June 15 had been there to support the Brazilian side. 

“To be honest, I was not surprised [about the enthusiasm], but I was surprised at the size, at the quantity,” he said.

The Club World Cup has allowed other fans to come together as well. Egyptian side Al Ahly also saw a sizable turnout of supported during their stint in the tournament and fans praising the unity the games created. 

“It's incredible,” said Flobatir Abdou, who drove down from Massachusetts to see Al Ahly face Palmeiras last week. “Coming from Egypt, soccer is one thing that unites everybody together and having everybody support the same club, same badge, it's a whole [different] feeling, especially in a stadium like this with a team like this, and a moment like this.” 

“I met a lot of people from Miami, Orlando, New York, New Jersey. It's a lot of people from different states coming together,” said a Palmeiras fan who identified himself as Guilerme.

John Victor Maciel Furtado's representatives have now reacted to rumblings that Manchester United are interested in signing the Botafogo player this summer.

The 29-year-old Brazilian shot-stopper is currently representing Botafogo at the reformatted FIFA Club World Cup tournament, which is held in the United States.

John Victor started in all three of Botafogo's Group B matches, with the Manchester United-linked player seeing out the full 90 minutes in each Club World Cup clash.

Botafogo finished second in Group B – level on points with first-place Paris Saint-Germain – and they have now reached the round of 16 at the tournament.

The Brazilian Serie A outfit will play fellow Brazilian side Palmeiras on Saturday at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, with kick-off slated for 5pm UK time.

The winner of Palmeiras and Botafogo's round-of-16 encounter will face either Benfica or Chelsea in the last eight of the Club World Cup on 5th July.

John Victor has been linked with Manchester United recently after the Botafogo player has impressed during his time in the Club World Cup tournament.

The Brazilian shot-stopper is under contract with Botafogo until 2028 and had been linked with a January exit, but he remained at the club for FIFA's tournament.

However, John only has a £5.8m release clause in his current deal with the Brazilian side and United have been tipped to sign a new ‘keeper in the summer window.

A post shared by John Victor 🇧🇷🇮🇹 (@johnvictor)

The Botafogo man has been at the Brazilian Serie A team since 2024 after he was signed from Santos, with John making 78 appearances for his current side.

Goal Brasil has now reported that the publication contacted John's representatives after reports linked United to potentially triggering the Botafogo player's release clause.

However, John's camp has shut down the speculation over a move to Old Trafford and Goal reports that they have ‘denied any contact' from the Red Devils so far.

The verdict is still out if United will actively pursue a new ‘keeper this summer amid the need to strengthen other key areas of Ruben Amorim's first-team squad.

Andre Onana has retained his place as United No 1, but the former Ajax and Inter Milan star's future remains uncertain amid another disappointing season.

Altay Bayindir, much like Andre Onana, left United fans deeply frustrated at times last season with howlers and the Red Devils have looked weak between the sticks.

Ruben Amorim could see the arrival of a new shot-stopper this summer and Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez has been linked with United in recent months.","{'href': 'https://www.unitedinfocus.com', 'title': 'United In Focus'}","soccer"

The Club World Cup hasn't yet blossomed into the spectacle promised by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, but there's still time for the revamped tournament to capture hearts and minds. 

Its grand expansion meant 32 teams started with the hope of claiming global glory, but only 16 remain following the conclusion of the group stages. 

Projections of European domination haven't quite come to pass, with the form of Brazil's representatives, Mamelodi Sundowns' exuberance and Auckland City's point emerging as some of the stories of the tournament so far. 

There are things wrong with this expanded competition, no doubt, but the sport's inherent beauty lies deep within. South American fervency has come to the fore, and stars you perhaps hadn't heard of before June 14 have dazzled on the sun-kissed American stage. 

Here is Sports Illustrated's Team of the Group Stage at the Club World Cup.

No goalkeeper recorded three clean sheets during the group stage, but eight recorded two, including Al Hilal's Yassine Bounou—commonly known as 'Bono'.

Bono played a leading role for Morocco's history-makers at the 2022 World Cup, and was Sevilla's penalty saving hero in the 2023 Europa League final. 

The goalkeeper has since joined Al Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, but remains one of the world's premier shot-stoppers. His talent has manifested yet again on the big stage this summer, with Bono boasting the second-highest save percentage (91.7%) of all goalkeepers at the tournament who played at least two group stage games. 

Only Thibaut Courtois has been more efficient between the sticks (93.3%), but the Belgian didn't save a penalty to preserve a point for his side on Matchday 1, did he?

There's been an array of outstanding centre-back performers at the Club World Cup so far, but perhaps none more impressive than former Manchester City defender Nicolás Otamendi. 

It's been a busy start to the tournament for the Benfica man, who won a penalty and scored against Boca Juniors during the opening round of fixtures to help his team earn a point. 

The World Cup winner continues to perform at the highest level, and he was at his very best on Matchday 3 as Bayern Munich were shut out. Otamendi was once regarded as somewhat of a liability in Manchester, but he's come of age in Lisbon and his maturity has been on full display in the U.S.

No player won more aerial duels during the group stage than the Argentine (14). 

Thiago Silva is 40-years-old, by the way. 

Fluminense took on Borussia Dortmund in their opening group game, and many expected the in-form Germans to ease past the Brazilians. However, Fluminense were dominant in the stalemate, with only some outstanding stops from goalkeeper Gregor Kobel preventing them from snatching a memorable victory. 

While Fluminense and, in particular, Jhon Arias, impressed with their work in transition, Silva was an immovable force in defence. Despite his age, the veteran moves like he never escaped his apex. The fundamentals will never disappear, and he's marshalled his defence expertly at the tournament so far. 

You can't mention the best defenders in the world and not bring up Alessandro Bastoni in discussion. 

The Italian defender, who broke out at Inter under Antonio Conte, has been a cornerstone of Inter's defence for half a decade, and Christian Chivu is set to be the next man to benefit from Basoni's unique talent.

There aren't many who can do what Bastoni does. He combines vintage Italian style with the requisite adventure in possession to thrive in this day and age. His consistency in Inter's defence has impressively stood out amid a period of transition for the Nerazzurri, and Bastoni capped off the group stage with a brilliant solo goal to seal all three points against River Plate.

In truth, there aren't too many outstanding candidates here. 

Achraf Hakimi, however, has continued from where he left off in 2024–25. The marauding Moroccan full-back scored the opening goal in the UEFA Champions League final against Inter, and he took three games to open his Club World Cup account.

Hakimi was used relentlessly by Luis Enrique last season, and he's shown no signs of wasting away in the energy sapping conditions facilitated by American heatwaves. The PSG star continues to dominate down the right flank. 

Both Jude and Jobe Bellingham are worthy of praise for their starts to the tournament, but we've opted for an unfamiliar name in Richard Ríos here.

While much has been made of Chelsea-bound Estêváo Willian, who has looked bright so far, Palmeiras have impressed as a collective and won Group A after fighting back on Matchday 3 to earn a point against Inter Miami.

Ríos was noted pre-tournament as one of the players to keep an eye on, and the Colombian international hasn't disappointed. He's an imposing midfield figure who can overwhelm opponents physically but is also blessed with the necessary technique to shine in possession. 

Ríos possesses a well-rounded profile, which was on full display during the group stages. He's one to watch in the knockouts and will undoubtedly occupy a few transfer rumour mills after the tournament.

Chelsea certainly didn't have it all their own way in the group stages, and they required a 3–0 victory over ES Tunis during the final round of fixtures to qualify behind Flamengo in Group D. 

Enzo Fernández, off the back of a productive Premier League season, has continued to threaten in the final third for the Blues. While the Argentine isn't the type to take over games, Fernández is developing a great sense of timing and a knack for being in the right place at the right time.

He's recorded three goal contributions at the Club World Cup so far, and was responsible for creating the most 'big chances' (three) in the group phase.

Much has been made of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City at the Club World Cup so far, especially after they thrashed Juventus 5–2 in their final group game.

After utilising full-backs in midfield and centre-backs as full-backs, it looks as if Guardiola is returning to a more traditional approach after City completed the signing of Rayan Aït-Nouri. One of three new arrivals featuring in the U.S., Aït-Nouri has perhaps been the most exciting of the group despite flashes from both Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki. 

The Algerian international gets into this team based on his performance against Juve alone. Aït-Nouri refused to give the ball away as he struck up a deadly dynamic with Jérémy Doku down the left. He was a joy to watch.

Crystal Palace fans certainly knew what Bayern Munich were getting when they signed Michael Olise last summer, but Bayern supporters surely had little hope that the Frenchman would blossom into the bona fide superstar that manifested during his debut campaign. 

The lights haven't been too bright for the self-assured Olise, who plays the game at his own pace no matter the occasion. After helping Bayern reclaim their Bundesliga crown, the winger is now aiming to inspire Vincent Kompany's side to Club World Cup glory. 

He so often looks a class above, with his rhythm and fluency in possession capable of thrusting viewers into a trance. Olise's campaign started with a cheap brace against Auckland City, but there was nothing cheap about his match-winning display on Matchday 2 against Boca Juniors—arguably the standout individual performance of the tournament so far. 

Igor Jesus's rise has been meteoric over the past year, and the Botafogo forward may soon be plying his trade in the Premier League with Nottingham Forest. 

Forest supporters must be excited with what they've seen from the 24-year-old this summer, with Jesus starting his tournament with two goals in two games. His first demonstrated his impressive aerial ability for someone of his size (only Otamendi won more aerial duels than him in the group stages), while his second came against Paris Saint-Germain, 

A willing runner, Jesus burst in behind the PSG backline and coolly finished past Gianluigi Donnarumma via a wicked deflection. Given how effective he‘s been leading the line for a Botafogo team reliant on transitions, Jesus seems to be the ideal fit for Nuno Espírito Santo's Forest.

The Juventus starlet was cruelly denied a hat-trick on Matchday 2 as his first finish against Wydad AC was ruled an own goal. His other two strikes were outstanding and well worthy of acclaim in their own right. 

The Turkish starlet's thumping effort from distance may well be the goal of the tournament so far. 

Juve's No. 10 flickered his brilliance last season but struggled to put together a run of form that suggested he was worthy of inheriting the shirt previous donned by Michel Platini, Alessandro Del Piero, Roberto Baggio and Paulo Dybala in Turin. 

However, Yildiz's instinctive magic has come to the fore in the U.S., and Juventus will hope his electric group stage form permeates into knockouts.

The FIFA Club World Cup group stage is in the books as 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage while the other 16 were eliminated from the competition.

The new-look tournament featured eight groups of four, akin to most international tournaments, where the top two teams over three games each would advance from their respective groups. Teams like Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain—perceived favorites coming in—qualified with relative ease. 

Of the feel-good stories, Inter Miami, Botafogo and Flamengo to name a few defied the odds and advanced to the final 16.

Trent Alexander-Arnold has aired his relief at only having to face Vinicius Junior in training, with the Real Madrid forward now terrorising others.

England international Alexander-Arnold came up against Brazilian forward Vini Jr on five occasions during his time at Liverpool. All of those contests took place on the Champions League stage.

Alexander-Arnold was never on the winning team when facing Vinicius, with the South American superstar making his most telling contribution in those meetings when scoring the winning goal in the 2022 Champions League final.

The 24-year-old winger was on target again in his latest appearance, against Red Bull Salzburg at the FIFA Club World Cup, with Alexander-Arnold now operating alongside Vinicius after making his own move to Santiago Bernabeu.

The 26-year-old right-back is still charged with the task of trying to contain Vinicius in training sessions, but is relieved that they no longer lock horns in competitive battle. Alexander-Arnold said: ""Vini Jr has given me a lot of difficult games in the past. It's good that it's now happening to other people rather than me!""

Real are safely through to the last-16 of Club World Cup competition, with their first outing in the knockout stages of that event set to see Alexander-Arnold and Co come up against Serie A giants Juventus at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Tuesday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Corentin Moutet's inspired run continues to light up the Mallorca Championships presented by ecotrans Group. 

 The mercurial Frenchman on Friday overcame Alex Michelsen 6-4, 7-6(3) at the grass-court ATP 250 with a typically highlight-filled semi-final display. With his win, Moutet advanced to his second tour-level championship match, in which he will face Tallon Griekspoor, 1,994 days after his first (Doha, 2020, l. to Rublev). 

 “I'm very happy about my performance,” said Moutet after his one-hour, 55-minute win. “He's such a great player. A good guy as well, so I was happy to share the court with him. I feel better and better every day. I am playing better from the baseline. It was nice to play at night today. It was not that hot like the other days, so I'm very happy.” 

SUPER COCO 💥

5 years later, @moutet99 is back in an ATP final, outplaying Michelsen 6–4 7–6(3)!@MallorcaChamps | #MallorcaChampionships pic.twitter.com/d8QPCV9wr9

 The semi-final between Moutet and Michelsen began with three consecutive breaks of serve, two of which went to Moutet. That proved enough for the Frenchman to take the opening set. In the second, Moutet let slip an early break lead but later held firm in the tie-break to complete victory despite only managing to convert two of 10 break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. 

 Moutet played with plenty of variety to nullify the big-serving threat of Michelsen in the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. He used the drop shot to bring the American forwards whenever possible, and he produced a series of classy lob winners that had the evening crowd at the Mallorca Country Club on its feet. 

 Watch one of Moutet's lovely lobs: 

 Moutet has risen 14 spots to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his Mallorca run so far. If he claims his maiden ATP Tour title, he will rise to No. 60 in Monday's edition of the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 The 26-year-old's opponent in his second ATP Tour final will be Griekspoor after the Dutchman earlier continued his impressive start to the 2025 grass season with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph against Felix Auger-Aliassime. 

 The fourth-seeded Griekspoor, competing in his first event since Roland Garros after an abdominal injury, clinched the only break of serve in each set to sink second seed Auger-Aliassime in 91 minutes. With his victory, Griekspoor avenged his defeat in the pair's only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, on the grass of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 2022.

 The World No. 34 Griekspoor is chasing his third ATP Tour crown following his 2023 title runs in Pune and ‘s-Hertogenbosch, respectively. He is into his second final of this season after also reaching that stage in April in Marrakech. 

 Saturday's showdown between Griekspoor and Moutet will be the first tour-level meeting between the two. However, they did play twice in 2018, once in qualifying at the ATP 250 in Antwerp and once at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Orleans. Griekspoor prevailed in straight sets on both occasions.

We talk about players coming into events with momentum. Well, here comes an entire sport, thundering into the year's third major with all that propulsive energy. Three weeks ago, tennis wrapped up a sensational Roland Garros—featuring No. 1 vs. No. 2 in both finals, no real controversies, emerging stars, veterans hanging on and a generationally spellbinding last match. 

Now, here comes the grampy/grandmum of them all, as the Brits might say. Wimbledon 2025 kicks off Monday morning at the All England Club, all bangers and mash. Will Carlos Alcaraz defend his title and win a third straight, something neither Serena Williams nor Novak Djokovic ever did? Will Jannik Sinner avenge his defeat from the jaws of victory at the French Open?

Stay tuned. But first, our men's seed report:

1.  Jannik Sinner

The glass-half-empty perspective: Sinner is coming off a devastating defeat, a point from his first Roland Garros title, having been the finalist in the best match of the decade. (And lost to the indomitable Alexander Bublik heading into Wimbledon.) The half-full outlook: In just his third tournament of the year, Sinner came within a point of winning. He remains No. 1. He has won half of the past six majors held. And we know his game translates fine to grass. 

2. Carlos Alcaraz

Coming off his exhilarating title in Paris, and then a fine showing at Queen's Club, he now goes for his third consecutive Wimbledon (and fourth straight tournament) title. He'll be the favorite. He'll be the center of attention. And it's all well-deserved.

3. Alexander Zverev

It doesn't take much to rewrite a script and reset a reputation—21 sets, in fact. But there's a hard-to-shake feeling that the window is closing fast on that elusive major for Zverev. And it's hard to imagine that it will happen here. (This is the rare German who's better on clay than grass.)

4. Jack Draper

By a hair—15 points—he gets the fourth seed and he's thoroughly capable of winning the title. The game is there, more an issue of handling the moment and not letting nerves affect him physically, which—by Draper's own admission—has been a challenge in the past. Other players will get $4.1 million or so for winning. A handsome, young, charismatic, homegrown champ? He could get $50 million.

5. Taylor Fritz

Fritz has had a rough, injury-addled year, punctuated by a first-round loss in Paris. But he's on the grass and snapping back, winning in Stuttgart and looking closer to 100% physically. A quarterfinalist in 2024 has a bushel of points to defend, but a good bet to do so.

6.  Novak Djokovic

While it was hard to ignore his poignant departure from Roland Garros and wonder how long the show continues, the truth is that he has a better shot of winning major No. 25 on grass—and a Roger Federer–tying seven Wimbledons—than he does on clay. Djokovic came within a match of winning Wimbledon in 2023 and '24. 

7. Lorenzo Musetti

He's a stylish Italian—and his one-handed zing is a joy to watch. One wishes he were a bit more durable, but he is now at a career high ranking. And he reached the semis at Wimbledon in 2024, a result that looks like the rule, not the exception. One hopes there are no ill effects from the groin injury that caused him to retire from the French semifinals. 

8. Holger Rune

His game is built for grass, and Rune has won seven of his past nine matches at the All England Club.  Is it folly to take a player seriously based on one point? (Less optimistically, he's still too prone to tapping out on days he gets frustrated, especially against lower-tier opposition.) 

9. Daniil Medvedev

Talk about a player in need of a strong result. Medvedev has shown some signs of life on grass, but it's been a rough few years for an exceedingly capable player. Wimbledon semifinal runs in 2023 and '24 bode well, but the GPS coordinates on his brain tennis can vary greatly. 

10. Ben Shelton

Shelton is the third American in the top 10. The lefty serve should, alone, make him worthy of a second week appearance. He played well here in 2024 (before encountering Sinner), and I wouldn't read too much into his tune-up defeats.

11. Alex De Minaur

A thoroughly admirable pro's pro who wrings it all out of his game. And he's a fastest-man-in-the-sport candidate, which helps on grass. But De Minaur's modest weaponry will always be a concern.

12. Frances Tiafoe

Tiafoe is coming off a strong Roland Garros run (quarterfinals), and his game translates well to grass, even on the forehand side which requires more time. One wishes (surely he wishes as well) that there was more consistency here. He takes a lot of losses week-to-week, but he comes to play at the big events.

13. Tommy Paul

You wonder about his health first and foremost, specifically the abdominal injury that hampered his (nonetheless successful) Roland Garros. And here's a weird fact: At 28, he's only played Wimbledon three times. 

14. Andrey Rublev

Sadly, one wonders if this is a mere slump or if Rublev, 27, is a declining asset. He was a first-round loser here in 2024.

15.  Jakub Menšík

Menšík sneaks into the top 16 with Arthur Fils's withdrawal. Typically, Czech flat hitting can translate to grass. But he doesn't have a lot of experience on the surface and had a tempestuous early round loss at Queen's Cup.

16. Francisco Cerundolo

A first round loser in Paris, Cerundolo heads to a major where he's won one match for his career.

28. Alexander Bublik

Let's go out of order to highlight one of the hottest players … who might be at his best on grass. You know who is thrilled to see him seeded? The 31 other players in the top 32 who don't have to face him off the bat.

17. Karen Khachanov

Keep your eyes on this sneaky good grass court player.

19. Grigor Dimitrov

He is dangerous at full health, but that's seldom the case. Credit Dimitrov for remaining this relevant at 34 years old. 

24. Stefanos Tsitsipas

Wow, is that a big number next to his name. He heads to the All England Club with coach Goran, a former Wimbledon champ, in his box.

32. Matteo Berrettini

Health is always a concern with Berrettini. But the former Wimbledon finalist is so, so dangerous, especially on grass. 

Any player 6'6"" and above: Reilly Opelka, Gio Mpetshi Perricard (a Week 2 player in 2024 who barely missed a seeded slot) and Gabriel Diallo, the hard-serving Canadian just won Hertogenbosch. What nightmare early opponents, especially on grass.

Zizou Bergs: He's coming off a career high ranking (No. 49) after reaching the final in Hertogenbosch. 

Alexander Bublik: If he can reach the semifinals on clay, why not on grass? Though given the EKG movements of his career, who knows?

João Fonseca: Playing his first Wimbledon. Not exactly from a grass court hotbed … but covering our bases all the same.

Doubles Winner: the All-American team of Evan King and Christian Harrison

From a record attendance exhibition match in Africa to a money-spinning streaming show in Las Vegas, modern tennis might be expanding its horizon. Yet, at its heart remains Wimbledon.

And it's that time of the year when it springs to life. When the freshly cut green of the 1868-founded All England Club meets its sternest test of modern day battle-hardened baseliners. When players trade the flashy outfits for crisp whites. And when a gush of nostalgia hits Indian tennis, awakening a sport currently in slumber of its more stellar past.

For it's at the oldest and most revered Grand Slam that some of the country's greatest in the sport had their finest achievements. It's here that a father-son duo had the distinction of each becoming the junior singles champion. It's here that a teenager made the world sit up and take notice by reaching the singles quarter-final. It's here that a fire-and-ice doubles combination blazed through the men's championship. It's here that a trailblazing woman left her mark on the hallowed Centre Court as a doubles champion.

And yet, it is here, at the SW19, that India will not have a player in the main single's draw this year. No Indian has played the final in either the doubles or mixed doubles in a decade. And even in the juniors championships, it has been 10 years since an Indian boy or girl claimed the title.

Once, generational greats — from Ramanathan Krishnan, to Ramesh Krishnan and Vijay Amritraj, to Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza — carried India's flag at Wimbledon, and all of them left a mark at what many call the mecca of tennis. Today, that flag is left without a worthy bearer. In this edition starting Monday, Sumit Nagal, the country's lone face in singles, crashed out in the first round of qualifiers.

“Most academies and clubs, especially in India, have a lot more hard courts now,” Yuki Bhambri, India's former top 100 in singles and current doubles world no. 35, had told this paper.

“For every player, it's hard to adapt to grass. The grass courts at Wimbledon have changed too and are a lot slower, which only adds to the challenge.”

But it was not always this way.

India's sprinkling presence in the tournament that began in 1877 began from the early 1900s, but it wasn't until around the 1950s that Indian players advanced beyond the early round in singles. In 1947, Sumant Misra won his first two singles matches and also made the doubles quarter-finals.

India's flavour, though, truly and richly blended on those grass courts in 1954, when Ramanathan Krishnan captured the boys' singles title. The Indian was the first Asian player to achieve the feat in the junior level, and went on to break further barriers at the pro stage.

Ramanathan, the former world No.3, twice entered the singles semi-final at the 1960 and 1961 editions of Wimbledon, playing with wooden racquets and setting the bar where no Indian has managed to go again till date. In 1961, Ramanathan produced one of the most memorable results by defeating Australian Roy Emerson, a 12-time Grand Slam singles champion, in the quarter-final. The legendary Rod Laver up next would prove a bridge too far.

Yet, Ramanathan had trailed a path for the others to follow in the Open Era. Not least his son Ramesh, who also won the Wimbledon junior singles title in 1979 and, seven years later as a pro, reached the quarter-final.

“I grew up with the aura of Wimbledon all around, and with my father's achievements there in the background. So, very early on, I learnt about the importance of Wimbledon,” Ramesh said over phone.

“It was 50 years ago that I made my first visit to SW19. That was the year Arthur Ashe surprised in the final. I also remember watching the great Ken Rosewall play at Wimbledon. He was seeded second and was 40 years old. Quite remarkable.”

Before Ramesh's 1986 quarter-final finish, a wide-eyed 19-year-old from Chennai checked into the All England Club in a Rolls Royce — then the official tournament car — and walked off as a quarter-finalist. Flaunting a big serve and a style that suited grass, Amritraj motored along the draw and into the last eight in 1973. Amritraj would repeat the run in 1981, only to be stalled by Jimmy Connors.

India's Wimbledon momentum was picked up again in the next decade by two doubles stars who came together to form one sparkling combination.

Paes and Bhupathi had their phases of ups and downs, and friendship and friction, yet nothing could quite top their fireworks together at the 1999 Wimbledon. Coming fresh off their doubles triumph on Parisian clay, the Indian duo also lit up the grass courts of London with their contrasting games and personalities. One a net wizard, the other a baseline beast, together a heady concoction that left Wimbledon in a daze. Bhupathi bagged two more titles there in mixed doubles. Paes took four more, two of them with Martina Navratilova and Martina Hingis.

Sania, the only Indian woman to make Slam runs a routine in singles and then doubles, also had Hingis for company for among her most cherished moments — lifting the 2015 women's doubles Wimbledon title.

Sania and Paes lifting trophies there a decade back is, incidentally, the last time any Indian did that at Wimbledon. The country's tennis has nosedived since.

Almost fitting, thus, is Ramesh's fondest Wimbledon story from his playing days and Indian tennis' heydays: “We had reached Southfields tube station and asked someone, “How do we get to Wimbledon?” And he answered, “Practice, mate, practice”.”

Tennis' oldest tournament gets a couple of significant updates this year. The 2025 Wimbledon Championships begin Monday and run through the middle of July. Proceedings will be judged by an automated electronic system, rather than historically dapper humans, and the traditional 2 p.m. start time for the men's and women's singles finals will be pushed back two hours to maximize viewership.

The field itself remains constant. Italy's Jannik Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz are still at the top of the ATP table. Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka, the women's top-ranked player, is trailed by Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula of the U.S. Here's all you need to know for the early action.

Main coverage on ESPN. Secondary courts via ESPN+ and Disney+.

Sinner and Alcaraz produced an all-timer at the last major. The French Open singles final on June 8 was one of the sport's wildest comebacks ever. The five-hour and 29-minute epic clocked in as the second-longest major final, with defending champion Alcaraz down two sets to love. He rallied all the way back, while saving three championship points in the process. What could possibly be on tap for the follow up?

Alcaraz is the reigning champ at Wimbledon, too. He knocked off decorated Novak Djokovic in the 2024 final, destroying his opponent in the first two sets and showing a steely resolve in the third-set tiebreak, after he had been broken when serving to win the title.

Predictably, the world's top duo are favored to reach the July 13 men's final, followed by Djokovic and then British breakout Jack Draper. Playing in his home country at the age of 23, Draper was expected to advance far into this tourney. He won it all at Indian Wells in March, and his No. 4 Wimbledon seeding allows him to avoid Sinner and Alcaraz until at least the semis, but the draw has handed him a tough path.

The women's game is headlined by Sabalenka and Gauff, who are coming off their duel in the French Open final. It marked the first No. 1 versus No. 2 women's title match at Roland Garros in 12 years, and Gauff's triumph made her the first American champion since Serena Williams in 2015. Sabalenka withdrew from last year's Wimbledon due to a unfortunate shoulder injury. Gauff bowed out in the fourth round.

Barbora Krejčíková of Czechia is the incumbent Wimbledon champ, notching her second Grand Slam title as a stunning 31st seed last year. She defeated seventh-seeded Italian Jasmine Paolini in three sets. Krejčíková, who is dealing with a thigh injury, is now No. 17 in the WTA rankings; Paolini is up to fourth.

Singles play begins Monday, while the doubles bracket gets going on Wednesday and Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Wimbledon 2025 Men's Seed Report: Can Carlos Alcaraz Defend His Title?","https://www.si.com/tennis/wimbledon-2025-mens-seed-report-can-carlos-alcaraz-defend-his-title","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 17:39:53 GMT","

We talk about players coming into events with momentum. Well, here comes an entire sport, thundering into the year's third major with all that propulsive energy. Three weeks ago, tennis wrapped up a sensational Roland Garros—featuring No. 1 vs. No. 2 in both finals, no real controversies, emerging stars, veterans hanging on and a generationally spellbinding last match. 

Now, here comes the grampy/grandmum of them all, as the Brits might say. Wimbledon 2025 kicks off Monday morning at the All England Club, all bangers and mash. Will Carlos Alcaraz defend his title and win a third straight, something neither Serena Williams nor Novak Djokovic ever did? Will Jannik Sinner avenge his defeat from the jaws of victory at the French Open?

Stay tuned. But first, our men's seed report:

1.  Jannik Sinner

The glass-half-empty perspective: Sinner is coming off a devastating defeat, a point from his first Roland Garros title, having been the finalist in the best match of the decade. (And lost to the indomitable Alexander Bublik heading into Wimbledon.) The half-full outlook: In just his third tournament of the year, Sinner came within a point of winning. He remains No. 1. He has won half of the past six majors held. And we know his game translates fine to grass. 

2. Carlos Alcaraz

Coming off his exhilarating title in Paris, and then a fine showing at Queen's Club, he now goes for his third consecutive Wimbledon (and fourth straight tournament) title. He'll be the favorite. He'll be the center of attention. And it's all well-deserved.

3. Alexander Zverev

It doesn't take much to rewrite a script and reset a reputation—21 sets, in fact. But there's a hard-to-shake feeling that the window is closing fast on that elusive major for Zverev. And it's hard to imagine that it will happen here. (This is the rare German who's better on clay than grass.)

4. Jack Draper

By a hair—15 points—he gets the fourth seed and he's thoroughly capable of winning the title. The game is there, more an issue of handling the moment and not letting nerves affect him physically, which—by Draper's own admission—has been a challenge in the past. Other players will get $4.1 million or so for winning. A handsome, young, charismatic, homegrown champ? He could get $50 million.

5. Taylor Fritz

Fritz has had a rough, injury-addled year, punctuated by a first-round loss in Paris. But he's on the grass and snapping back, winning in Stuttgart and looking closer to 100% physically. A quarterfinalist in 2024 has a bushel of points to defend, but a good bet to do so.

6.  Novak Djokovic

While it was hard to ignore his poignant departure from Roland Garros and wonder how long the show continues, the truth is that he has a better shot of winning major No. 25 on grass—and a Roger Federer–tying seven Wimbledons—than he does on clay. Djokovic came within a match of winning Wimbledon in 2023 and '24. 

7. Lorenzo Musetti

He's a stylish Italian—and his one-handed zing is a joy to watch. One wishes he were a bit more durable, but he is now at a career high ranking. And he reached the semis at Wimbledon in 2024, a result that looks like the rule, not the exception. One hopes there are no ill effects from the groin injury that caused him to retire from the French semifinals. 

8. Holger Rune

His game is built for grass, and Rune has won seven of his past nine matches at the All England Club.  Is it folly to take a player seriously based on one point? (Less optimistically, he's still too prone to tapping out on days he gets frustrated, especially against lower-tier opposition.) 

9. Daniil Medvedev

10. Ben Shelton

Shelton is the third American in the top 10. The lefty serve should, alone, make him worthy of a second week appearance. He played well here in 2024 (before encountering Sinner), and I wouldn't read too much into his tune-up defeats.

11. Alex De Minaur

Oliver Tarvet will make his Grand Slam main-draw debut after coming through Wimbledon qualifying

British qualifier Oliver Tarvet has called for a change in United States college rules after being unable to claim all the prize money he will earn from reaching the Wimbledon main draw.

Tarvet, 21, moved into the first round - where players receive £66,000 - after winning his third and final qualifying match on Thursday.

The Englishman studies at the University of San Diego and has developed his game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) system.

Under NCAA rules, players are restricted in how much they can claim from professional tournaments.

On Friday, Tarvet explained players are allowed $10,000 (£7,290) in profit every year, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.

""I know there have been complaints about it but I don't want to speak too much about it and overstep the mark,"" he said.

GB's Tarvet, ranked 719, reaches Wimbledon main draw

""But in my opinion, I've worked hard to get this money. I don't feel like it's undeserved the money that I've got. 

""I think it would be good to see a change in the rules of the NCAA, but at the same time, I don't want to get involved. It's not really my place. 

""But I've done well this week. I think I deserve this money.""

Earlier this year, American college player Reese Brantmeier launched a class action, external against the NCAA over the restrictions.

Brantmeier, 20, was joined by Australian player Maya Joint - who forfeited more than $200,000 (£145,000) in US Open prize money after reaching the fourth round last year - as a co-plaintiff.

Britain's Jay Clarke believes there is still a ""barrier"" stopping young black tennis players from developing in the UK.

Last month, the LTA launched its 'equity, diversity and inclusion plan', saying it will ""not be satisfied until the diversity of everyone involved in tennis reflects the diversity of the communities in the country"".

Clarke, 26, is among several British top-200 players with black or mixed heritage, including Heather Watson, Paul Jubb and George Loffhagen.

""It is nice to see more black players breaking through and hopefully we can inspire more kids to pick up a racquet,"" said 26-year-old Clarke, who plays Dan Evans in the Wimbledon first round.

""I think there is still a barrier and the sport is not amazingly accessible for black players. 

""The LTA have done good things to resurface park courts and give people opportunities.

""The most important thing is seeing people like yourself playing and doing well on the big stages. Representation is important.""

This summer, Wimbledon is marking the 50th anniversary of Arthur Ashe's victory at the All England Club - the first black tennis player to win a Grand Slam men's singles title

Ashe, who won three major titles, has been one of Clarke's biggest inspirations after being told the American player's story.

""Having a black man win Wimbledon was amazing for my dad to see and that was passed on to me,"" Clarke added.

""I watched highlights of him when I was younger and my dad used to get me to play differently - that's how I learned to play the sport.""

Alexandra Eala overcame Varvara Gracheva in a three-set semifinal between qualifiers at the Lexus Eastbourne Open to become the first Filipina player ever to reach a WTA final.

Alexandra Eala became the first Filipina player in history to reach a WTA final after battling past Varvara Gracheva 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 in a high-quality semifinal between two qualifiers at the Lexus Eastbourne Open. She will face Maya Joint for the title after the 19-year-old Australian came from 5-3 down in the first set to defeat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-3. The final will be the youngest title match in terms of combined age at Eastbourne since 1981, when an 18-year-old Tracy Austin triumphed over a 16-year-old Andrea Jaeger.

Eala, 20, burst on to the tennis scene by defeating three Grand Slam champions -- Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek -- to reach the Miami semifinals in March, but lost four of her next five tour-level matches. However, her flat, left-handed strokes have thrived on grass. Having come through qualifying in Nottingham last week, Eala did so again this week in Eastbourne. In the main draw, she has bested Lucia Bronzetti, Ostapenko (via retirement), Dayana Yastremska and now Gracheva.

Even as Eala's fame -- particularly back at home in the Philippines -- has gone stratospheric this year, she has been a composed presence in interviews. But after completing the 2-hour, 22-minute victory over Gracheva, she was emotional and almost lost for words in her on-court interview.

""There were tough moments where she was playing well, and I didn't know how to get out of it,"" she explained. ""It was a challenge for both of us, physically and mentally. We both came from qualies and she's a really solid player, had some moments where she was really dominating. So the fact that I was able to stay there and wait for my opportunities was a big achievement for me.""

The final will be a first encounter between World No.74 Eala and World No. 51 Joint, and the latter will be seeking a second career title following her maiden WTA trophy in Rabat on clay five weeks ago.

Hot shots and momentum shifts: For most of Eala and Gracheva's terrific tussle, the match was impossible to call. Momentum had swung back and forth between the pair as they had responded to every shift in the other's favor by raising their own level.

Eala made the first move, leaping out to a 4-1 lead -- only for Gracheva to hit back with a four-game run and serve for the first set at 5-4.

Eala denied her, reeling off five games of her own to snatch the first set and lead 2-0 in the second.

Next, it was Gracheva's turn to hit a hot streak, seizing six games in a row to take the second set and level the match.

The decider was a microcosm of the match: an early 3-1 lead for Eala, but Gracheva pegged her back at 3-3. The seventh game ran to five deuces, and Gracheva held one point to break for 4-3 -- but Eala held firm, swatting away a winner to save it and eventually coming through. It proved decisive: she dropped just two points in the last two games of the contest.

Prior to that, the pair had thrilled the Eastbourne crowd with a series of all-court exchanges. Eala's reactions at net proved key in the opening set, while Gracheva's backhand was lethal throughout the second. Eala came out on top of a number of lung-busters at the start of the decider, utilizing her drop shot to superb effect, and a rally of ever-sharper angles highlighted Gracheva's mini-comeback in that set.

As close as the match had been, a few stats in Eala's favor indicated how she had triumphed. She was more clinical on break points, particularly in an opening set in which she converted three out of three, compared to Gracheva's two out of eight. She kept both her first-serve percentage (74% to 67%) and her first-serve points won (61% to 57%) slightly higher than Gracheva. 

Eala also managed to protect her vulnerability more effectively. She was able to win just 26% of her second-serve points throughout the match, but raised her first-serve percentage to 77% in the third set. By contrast, the Gracheva forehand had been the wing more likely to break down all day, and the Frenchwoman conceded the break in the penultimate game with a string of errors from that side.

Alexandra Eala overcame Varvara Gracheva in a three-set semifinal between qualifiers at the Lexus Eastbourne Open to become the first Filipina player ever to reach a WTA final.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

George Russell set the pace for Mercedes during Free Practice 1 at the Austrian Grand Prix.

George Russell has topped the timesheets during Friday's opening practice session ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver continuing his run of good form as he led the way from Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri.

There were a couple of new faces joining the action for FP1 at the Red Bull Ring as two teams opted to run a rookie; Formula 2 standings leader Alex Dunne stepped into Lando Norris' McLaren – making him the first Irish driver to take part in an F1 weekend for 22 years as he finished an impressive fourth – while fellow F2 driver Dino Beganovic was at the wheel for Ferrari in place of Charles Leclerc.

Dunne was amongst the first to hit the track when the green light appeared, with the MCL39 sporting aero rakes to kick off a weekend in which several teams have brought upgrades. The Irishman was also the only driver to run the soft tyres during the initial runs, the rest of the pack bolting on the medium and hard compounds.

While Canadian Grand Prix winner Russell had set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, Verstappen did not seem happy in the Red Bull, the Dutchman experiencing a lock-up in the RB21.

Verstappen reported back about the problems on the radio – but on this occasion the World Champion was speaking to Simon Rennie rather than his usual Race Engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, with ‘GP' taking the weekend off.

Also seemingly struggling in the sister Red Bull was Yuki Tsunoda, who experienced a wide moment of his own as he continues in his mission to get to grips with the car. Elsewhere, Lewis Hamilton was informed that his SF-25 had an “issue with the gearbox”, forcing the Briton to return to the pits.

The problems did not look to have ended there for Ferrari, with Beganovic's car up on the stands in the other side of the garage as the crew removed the floor. Russell, meanwhile, was sitting atop the timesheets, having pumped in a 1m 05.776s after running the soft tyres.

A yellow flag briefly appeared following a spin for Fernando Alonso, with the two-time World Champion running onto the grass thanks to a moment at the final corner. “That was the worst out-lap we can do – good to do it in FP1!” the Aston Martin driver commented.

As the majority of the field switched to the soft tyres and the times started to tumble – with Ferrari also getting both cars back out on track – Esteban Ocon sparked another yellow flag after locking up and going straight on at Turn 1. The Haas driver was able to rejoin, albeit with a flat spot on his front left tyre.

With Russell still leading the way from Verstappen and Piastri as the session entered its final quarter, Dunne caught the eye by going fourth fastest, his time just seven-hundredths away from Piastri's.

“A few small raindrops,” Russell reported as the last 10 minutes of FP1 approached, with clouds hovering above the Red Bull Ring. But questions over the weather did not prevent the Silver Arrows driver from maintaining his place at the top of the timesheets, having set the pace on a 1m 05.542s.

Verstappen – who has won at this track a record four times – was 0.065s adrift in P2, while Piastri and Dunne held third and fourth for McLaren ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in fifth. Gabriel Bortoleto slotted into an impressive sixth for Kick Sauber, while the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz, Hamilton and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the top 10.

Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli claimed 11th – off the back of completing his school exams – ahead of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg (12th), Aston Martin's Lance Stroll (13th), Alonso (14th) and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson (15th). Franco Colapinto put his Alpine into P16, while Tsunoda, Beganovic, Ocon and Haas' Ollie Bearman classified P17 through to P20 respectively.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

Alex Dunne hailed his Formula 1 practice debut with McLaren, for the Austrian Grand Prix, as ""something pretty special.""

Alex Dunne has hailed his Formula 1 practice debut as ""something pretty special"" after finishing only fractionally slower than the sister McLaren of Oscar Piastri during FP1 ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix.

The 19-year-old Irishman leads the Formula 2 standings after taking two Feature race wins so far this season, but got the chance to drive McLaren's MCL39 in his role as a development driver with the team.

Although Dunne previously sampled McLaren's 2023 challenger and underwent simulator running, this was his first time in an official F1 session.

Despite his relative lack of experience, Dunne posted the fourth fastest time at the Red Bull Ring in FP1, less than a tenth behind championship leader Piastri in the sister McLaren, and just over two tenths down on George Russell's session-best.

""I don't even know where to start,"" said Dunne after the session. ""Super happy, I think it's safe to say it went pretty well.

""I think we knew going through the session that the goal wasn't necessarily for performance it was more to help out with the car, help Lando [Norris] and just help the team improve as much as they can for FP2, FP3 and then onwards into the weekend.

""So to have the pace that I had and show what I'm capable of on the F1 stage is something pretty special, so massive thank you to McLaren and everyone for the opportunity. I'm extremely grateful.""

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was impressed by Dunne's performance, not only because of his speed but also that he was able to help the team develop the car, which featured a new suspension set-up.

This in turn helped regular driver Lando Norris once he got back behind the wheel of his car, before topping FP2 ahead of Piastri.

""I think we have to acknowledge that he [Dunne] has gone through quite an extensive plan of testing with some new parts, with some rake work, some adjustments on the steering wheel that we don't see on TV but definitely keeps the drivers very busy,"" Stella told Sky Sports F1.

""Alex has been quite diligent and impressive. Then he also had the chance to show some speed and no surprise, he's a fast driver.

""I think we need to be a bit careful looking at the lap times because his time came later on in the stint when the fuel was down but I think encouraging and impressive in terms of Alex himself and also I think a good session for McLaren.""

Off the back of his victory at the Canadian Grand Prix, George Russell has given his take on where things stand in terms of signing a new contract with Mercedes.

George Russell has admitted that he is not “pressing massively” to get a new contract signed with Mercedes as he insists that performance is the priority – though the Briton also acknowledged that “it does help if there was pen on paper”.

There has long been speculation over when Russell might agree a new deal with the Silver Arrows, with his current contract running until the end of 2025.

Following the Briton's strong Qualifying performance last time out in Canada, team boss Toto Wolff conceded that Russell was giving the squad “all the reasons” to re-sign him – but the Austrian went on to say that the driver's victory on race day had no bearing on his future as the team already “know he can perform”.

During Thursday's media day ahead of this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, Russell was quizzed on what more he had to do to secure a new contract off the back of his win in Montreal.

“You're asking the wrong person, to be honest!” the 27-year-old joked. “Don't know.”

Pushed on how the talks with Wolff were going – and whether they were indeed going – Russell continued: “Yeah, a little bit. No major updates as yet.

“It's not something that I'm pressing massively because, as I've always said, the performance is the priority, and I feel with the performance I'm showing at the moment – still in line with the performance I've shown over all these years – I've got zero reasons to be worried. But obviously it does help if there was pen on paper.”

The four-time race winner went on to give his take on why the process has not been done yet, as well as reflecting on why he has not felt the need to push to complete contract talks.

“I don't need to chase because I feel that I'm doing a good job,” Russell explained. “It goes both ways – I need them, they need me and that's how it goes. Mercedes are so ambitious, they want to be back on top.

“They need to understand and think how are they going to bring Mercedes back on top. You need to have the best team principal, you need to have the best drivers in your car, you need to have the best engineers within your team.

“Toto has made it clear to me that he thinks how I'm performing this year is as good as anybody. I think there's only one driver that you can debate in terms of performance, these are his words not my words.

“So that's why I have no concern about the future, but there's two seats to every team and I guess he needs to think who are those two drivers going to be for those two seats. I guess that's what the delay is.”

While Russell and Mercedes enjoyed their strongest weekend of the season so far in Montreal, the British racer is not convinced that they will consistently experience that level of performance going forwards.

“I think the performance of Canada was definitely a bit of a one-off,” said Russell. “We were on pole last year in Canada, we probably should have won the race, and our car performs really well when the tyres are not overheating, so on tracks where it's low-speed corners, where it's smooth tarmac, hopefully when the temperature is down.

“At fast circuit tracks where it's hot, like Barcelona, like Imola, probably here [in Austria], it's not so good.”

George Russell carried on his good run of form and set the pace in the opening practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix

George Russell set the pace in the opening practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver less than one-tenth ahead of Max Verstappen.

Russell, who won last time out in Canada, posted a 1m 05.542s on Pirelli's soft tyre at the Red Bull Ring, which left him 0.065s clear of Red Bull's Verstappen after the one-hour session.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri was third, while F2 championship leader Alex Dunne finished the session fourth, less than a tenth behind the lead McLaren, as he took the seat of Lando Norris during the session.

Formula 1's guidelines for driving standards – as well as a document covering penalties – are now available publicly in a bid to promote transparency and understanding.

Ahead of this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, two key documents created to assist the stewards in their decision making have been shared openly by F1's governing body, the FIA.

Firstly, the ‘Driving Standards Guidelines' – which were introduced at the drivers' request in 2022 – provide clarity on conduct across various racing situations, including overtaking on the inside and outside of corners and at chicanes or S-bends.

Also covered are topics such as impeding, moving under braking while battling for position, rejoining the circuit following an incident, conduct behind the Safety Car and track limits infringements.

The latest version of the ‘Driving Standard Guidelines' was drafted following a meeting between the drivers at last year's Qatar Grand Prix, organised by the FIA and the FIA F1 stewards.

In addition, the ‘Penalty Guidelines' – in existence for more than a decade – lists around 100 common infringements, recommended penalties and the penalty points that should be applied during each session of a race weekend.

While many details from both documents were already known by paddock insiders, the released files now make it clear for everyone, with F1.com taking a closer look at the Driving Standards document in particular…

The FIA's guidelines essentially split overtakes into two categories: ones that occur on the inside of a corner and ones that occur on the outside.

When overtaking on the inside of a corner, the document makes clear that the overtaking car must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the other car prior to and at the apex to be entitled to be given room.

The car must have been driven in a “fully controlled manner”, particularly from entry to apex, without “diving in”, as well as having taken a “reasonable racing line” and completed the move whilst remaining within track limits.

When it comes to overtaking on the outside of a corner, it is noted that this “will always be viewed as a more difficult manoeuvre to accomplish”.

To be entitled to room in this situation, including at the corner exit, the overtaking car must have its front axle ahead of the front axle of the other car at the apex, as well as being driven in a “controlled manner” from entry to apex and exit, and making the corner within track limits.

When it comes to chicanes and S-bends, the above guidelines for the inside and outside may apply for each element of the combination, with priority generally given to the first corner element.

The FIA's document goes on to describe racing as a “dynamic process”, with the stewards “always looking at how the situation played out in total when reviewing an incident”.

This includes the following pointers:

Moving on the straight is another important topic in the Driving Standards Guidelines, with the FIA's document highlighting Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 of the International Sporting Code when it explains: “More than one change of direction to defend a position is not permitted.

“Any driver moving back towards the racing line, having earlier defended [their] position off-line, should leave at least one car width between [their] own car and the edge of the track on the approach to the corner.

“However, manoeuvres liable to hinder other drivers, such as deliberate crowding of a car beyond the edge of the track or any other abnormal change of direction, are strictly prohibited.”

Moves intended to break the slipstream of a following car when the following car is a safe distance behind, considering relative speeds and position on the track, may be deemed acceptable.

Meanwhile, in terms of moving under braking, it is stressed that there must be no change in direction by the defending car after the deceleration phase has commenced, except to follow the racing line.

Drivers are also reminded about giving back any lasting advantage gained from leaving the track, re-joining in a safe manner, avoiding impeding incidents through “unnecessarily slow” or “erratic” driving, and not making any dangerous manoeuvres behind the Safety Car.

Track limits take up a significant portion of the Driving Standards Guidelines, which note that respecting them “is important for both racing fairness and safety”.

“Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not leave the track without a justifiable reason,” continues the document, bringing in Article 33.3 of the F1 Sporting Regulations.

“Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and, for the avoidance of doubt, the white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track, but the kerbs are not.”

Beyond Free Practice and Qualifying, where drivers can lose lap times for invalid attempts, a ‘three strikes' system is normally applied in race sessions prior to a black/white flag or penalty, as per the Sporting Regulations.

Any invalid lap is deleted and counted as a strike, with the following exceptions:

Alongside the Driving Standards Guidelines, the FIA has released its long-standing Penalty Guidelines, which covers both penalties and penalty points given out to drivers for a whole host of on- and off-track situations.

From leaving the track and gaining an advantage (as touched on above) to causing a collision, and failing to respect flags to general driver misconduct, all scenarios and advised sanctions are listed one by one.

You can read the full document – and extensive penalty tables within it – here.

In short, it is hoped that by making the Driving Standards and Penalty documents public, fans and the media will have a greater understanding of what goes into F1's judicial process.

FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem commented: “FIA stewards perform a hugely complex task, not just in Formula 1 but across all of our championships, and they do this voluntarily, with great passion and commitment. That dedication is all too often met with extreme and wholly unwarranted criticism.

“To demonstrate the rigour with which they pursue their role, we are today publishing the Penalty and Driving Standards Guidelines that assist them with their decisions. This will give fans and members of the media a much deeper and more accurate insight into how decisions are made in Formula 1.

“The Penalty Guidelines have been a core tool for almost a decade while the Driving Standards Guidelines introduced in 2022 and constantly updated have brought the most important voices, those of the drivers, to the table to create a genuine reference for certain racing situations.”

Mercedes driver and Grand Prix Drivers' Association Director George Russell added: “Greater transparency within the governance of our sport is an important issue and this is a useful step in that direction.

“Hopefully it will be beneficial for the sport to give the media and fans a clearer understanding of the rules of engagement when we're racing on track, and to help them understand how the stewards reach their decisions.”

Lando Norris led McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the top of the times in the second practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix

Lando Norris led McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the top of the times in the second practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix.

The Briton, who missed FP1 as his McLaren seat was taken by F2 championship leader Alex Dunne, was immediately up to speed on Friday afternoon despite a lack of earlier running.

His 1m 04.580s left him 0.157s clear of Piastri and was almost a second faster than George Russell's best from earlier in the day.

Max Verstappen completed the top three ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who also missed FP1 as Dino Beganovic drove his car.

Cena plays the American president and Elba the British prime minister in Ilya Naishuller's film, also featuring Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Paddy Considine, Jack Quaid and Carla Gugino.


							By 

	Caryn James



	An alternate history with different world leaders would be great escapism at the moment. Heads of State isn't that, despite a here-and-there subtext that turns out to be more pointedly political than you see coming. The film, from Nobody director Ilya Naishuller, is a typical action-comedy that benefits greatly from its two stars, and slightly from their unexpected characters, before plunging fast into explosive but trite set-pieces. You've never before seen John Cena as the American president and Idris Elba as the British prime minister, but by the end you may feel as if you've seen it all before.

	Casting is everything here, and the film aces that part. Cena plays a politician who is all showbiz and Elba is the statesman who has experience and respect. Both are fun to watch, as they approach the roles with more relish than the drab screenplay provides. Cena's Will Derringer is a movie star who has recently gone from the hit franchise Water Cobra to president in one quick swoop with the campaign promise “We did it at the box office and now we'll do it in the Oval Office.”

The Bottom Line

	
	Too much predictable action, too little comedy.
	



Release date: Wednesday, July 2 (Prime Video)Cast: Idris Elba, John Cena, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Carla Gugino, Jack Quaid, Stephen Root, Sarah Niles, Richard Coyle, Paddy ConsidineDirector: Ilya NaishullerWriters: Josh Applebaum & André Nemec and Harrison Query

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 53 minutes			






	He is clearly not Donald Trump, though. Derringer is a warm and fuzzy family man behind the scenes, a well-intentioned guy in over his head. Cena skillfully avoids playing him with any real-life political overtones.


	Elba is Cambridge-educated Sam Clarke, who has been prime minister for six years and now has bad poll numbers, which he'll take in the interest of serving his country's best interests. He disdains the president for his image-is-everything approach to politics and for his tendency to go rogue, which he maddeningly does at a joint press conference when Derringer stops off in London on the way to a NATO meeting. Elba has some of the better early lines, which work only because they are delivered in an effective, high-dudgeon tone. “You're the Commander-in-Chief, you're not some DJ in Vegas,” he snaps at Derringer.

	











	The leaders reluctantly agree to a PR scheme plotted by their advisors, sharply played by Sarah Niles on the American side and Richard Coyle on the British. She seems commonsensical, he seems cagey, but they're both mere conveniences for the plot. The president and prime minister reluctantly agree to take a short trip together on Air Force One in a fake show of solidarity. 


	That's when the action kicks in with an attack by assassins masquerading as flight attendants. (Better not to think about the American security failure behind that.) There is stabbing and shooting before Derringer and Clarke parachute out of the flaming plane together. The hapless president's parachute gets stuck in a tree and the savvy prime minister gets him down.


	Derringer wants to call his wife so she knows he's safe, but Clarke knows that they are targets and their phones are compromised so they can't call. From there, the funny-silly innovation of having world leaders as the mismatched buddies fades away. It's basically all action with the occasional dollop of plot that leads the rivals, inevitably, to become friends as they hitch a ride from Belarus to Warsaw and beyond while the world presumes they're dead. 


	Naishuller's action is solidly executed but predictable, as the men punch and shoot their way out of trouble while making their way to a fraught NATO meeting in time to announce they're alive and save the day. The highlight is a car chase with Clarke driving the presidential limo, The Beast, in reverse through narrow streets. More often there are rocket launchers and leaps from balconies in which no one ever gets hurt.

	











	And there is even more presumed-dead business in the creaky plot the action hangs on. The film opens with a massive food fight in Spain, the annual La Tomatina festival in which a whole town throws tomatoes at each other. It's being covered by a television journalist, Noel (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), who is actually an MI6 agent on a joint operation with the CIA. The mission goes wrong, blood mixes with the smashed tomatoes, then Noel disappears for much of the film — presumed not-alive. Toward the end she returns and proves to be more tactical and tougher than either of the men, although for all three stars the big action finale might as well be a game of Spot the Stunt Person (they are conspicuously everywhere). 


	In smaller parts, Paddy Considine plays an arms dealer Noel is after, Jack Quaid has a comic role as a CIA station chief and Carla Gugino has a dramatic role as the vice president.


	In a late scene that is almost a throwaway, the true villain is revealed. That character is intent on destroying NATO and unsettling the world, and gives an isolationist speech that includes the phrase “America First.” The scene comes out of nowhere and emphasizes that Derringer is not Trump while overtly placing one of Trump's main slogans on the side of the devil. The quick scene is very much not the point of Heads of State, but you might as well take what you can get in this sporadically diverting film.

The Formula One racing pic looks to be the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films, and will have no trouble topping the box office chart well ahead of 'M3GAN 2.0.'


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


Apple Original Films‘ critically acclaimed F1: The Movie is off to the races. 


	The Formula One movie, directed by Joseph Kosinski of Top Gun: Maverick fame, has already banked a hefty $10 million in previews at the domestic box office before officially opening everywhere Friday. That includes $7 million in Thursday shows and $3 million from a host of sneak screenings.




	Warner Bros. is distributing and helping Apple to market the big-budget summer tentpole, which is tipped to open to $40 million to $50 million in North America and another $75 million overseas for a global start of at least $115 million. The film has a huge advantage in having a lock on Imax screens for three weeks, in addition to playing other premium large-format screens, including Dolby Cinema, for part of that time. One major caveat: the movie sports a hefty production budget of at least $200 million before marketing.

					How 'M3GAN 2.0' Star Violet McGraw Kicked Off a Wave of Good Fortune for Blumhouse		
			









F1, starring Brad Pitt opposite Damson Idris, is a seminal moment for Apple as it tries to jump-start its theatrical ambitions after getting driven off the road with box office misses Killers of the Flower Moon, from Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. 


	In Kosinski's film, Pitt plays an injured former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to team up with a younger driver, played by Idris. Javier Bardem stars as the F1 team owner who orchestrates the scheme. Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score for the movie after working with Kosinski on Top Gun: Maverick.

	











Taking on Formula One is a bold move since it has never been the marquee sport in the U.S. that it is overseas (top Apple exec Eddy Cue is a lifelong fan and sits on the board of Ferrari NV). In 2013, the wheels flew off of Ron Howard's F1 movie Rush, which topped out at $26.9 million domestically and $97 million globally. F1‘s preview gross is well ahead of racing pic Ford v. Ferrari, a biographical action drama set against the backdrop of Europe's famous Le Mans endurance contest. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that film earned $2.1 in previews on its way to a decent three-day opening of $3 million in North America.


F1 will run laps around Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's M3GAN 2.0, which earned $1.5 million in Thursday previews. The Universal release is forecasting a $20 million domestic opening, $10 million less than the first film's $30.4 million record debut in December 2023, including $2.75 million in previews, on its way to earning $117.7 million in North America and $226.3 million globally against a minuscule $12 million production budget, not adjusted for inflation.


Jason Blum‘s Blumhouse and James Wan's Atomic Monster reteamed to make the follow-up, which launches amid a saturated market for horror fare. Nevertheless, pundits say the sequel is all but guaranteed to be a profitable piece of business, considering the budget was a scant $15 million. Universal believes the movie will serve as counter-programming for younger women who have no interested in F1.

	











M3GAN 2.0 is set two years after the AI doll went on a murder spree to protect her young human charge (Violet McGraw) and was subsequently shelved. Her creator (Allison Williams), the aunt of the young girl, is now a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of AI. But when another AI creature emerges that is even more dangerous, M3GAN is resurrected and mayhem ensues. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returned to direct the sequel from a story he wrote alongside Akela Cooper, and based on characters created by Cooper and James Wan.


	Actors Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return alongside McGraw and Williams, while franchise newcomers include Aristotle Athari, Timm Sharp and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement.

We apply Vegas-style odds to nine intriguing candidates.


							By 

	Laurie Brookins


Freelance Contributor


	Thursday's announcement that Anna Wintour would be stepping away from her day-to-day duties at American Vogue elicited a frenzy rarely seen in media news these days — though the headlines in many cases overemphasized the idea of a departure vs. the realignment of her role at Condé Nast. The legendary editrix is not departing the publishing behemoth that counts 28 international editions of Vogue among its considerable stable of magazines, as she still retains a pair of powerhouse titles: chief content officer for Condé Nast and global editorial director of Vogue.

	











	Instead, the hunt is now on to name the person who will oversee American Vogue's day-to-day duties, a role that also comes with a new title: head of editorial content. In that respect, the shift indeed justifies the “end of an era” discourse, as Wintour has held the editor-in-chief title for 37 years, following two years as editor of British Vogue between 1985 and 1987.

					Anna Wintour to Step Aside as Editor of American Vogue, Will Remain Global Editorial Director		
			














	
	Business
			



	
		
					Condé Nast Picks Vogue Veteran to Run Vanity Fair		
			









	Ultimately Wintour's departure from the daily job at Vogue will enable her to focus fully on the global aspects of her role, likely assuring an alignment in tone, content and partnerships across the vast array of Condé Nast titles, which also include Architectural Digest, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Bon Appétit, Glamour and Wired. Of equal importance to Hollywood and anyone who possesses an interest in red carpets: Wintour by all accounts will continue to oversee the Met Gala, also because her commitment to the Metropolitan Museum of Art runs deep; as proof of her influence and impact, in 2014 the museum's costume department was renamed the Anna Wintour Costume Center.

	











	With speculation already underway, here's a look at a variety of contenders for Vogue's upcoming head of editorial content and the Vegas-style odds of each to nab the plum new job:


	The editor of Architectural Digest since 2016, Astley should be a chief candidate to oversee American Vogue's evolution. Simply put, she's been killing it at AD, showcasing the homes of Hollywood A-listers, a list that recently includes Kendall Jenner, Michael Shannon and Lenny Kravitz. A just-published feature on Pamela Anderson's love of gardening, meanwhile, imbued the star of The Last Showgirl and the upcoming Naked Gun with yet another layer amid an evolution that was squarely in the spotlight throughout the 2025 awards season. Meanwhile, people still talk about the Dakota Johnson April 2020 cover story that highlighted her mid-century modern home and now-famous green kitchen. The job feels like Astley's if she wants it.


	When Enninful was making waves as the editor of British Vogue, his name often was bandied about as Wintour's natural successor. While helming the title from 2017 to 2023, Enninful oversaw buzzy, artful covers of everyone from Rihanna and Jane Fonda to Linda Evangelista and Oprah Winfrey, with diversity and inclusivity always at the forefront of cover placements, many shot by Black photographers. But in February Enninful founded EE72, positioned as a global media company, and in May announced that the brand's first digital and print publication, 72 Magazine, would debut this September. Might this take Enninful out of the running?

	











	A fixture at Vogue since 1999, Goodman checks a lot of boxes as a potential head of editorial content. A former model who possesses an exacting eye for layouts, Goodman was responsible for creating some of the magazine's most memorable editorials during her two-decade tenure as fashion director. In 2019, Goodman transitioned into the role of Vogue's first sustainability editor, a forward-thinking idea just six years ago.


	Firmly committed to sustainability in fashion, Goodman could put that concept under a klieg light while serving in the top spot — and perhaps Wintour agrees? In her meeting with Vogue's staff on Thursday, her comments included the thought, “But how thrilling it will be to work alongside someone new who will challenge us, inspire us and make us all think about Vogue in a myriad of original ways.”


	He's moved up through the ranks of GQ since 2007, originally recruited as an associate editor who covered music, fashion and pop culture, a tenure that escalated to editor of GQ Style in 2015 and ultimately editor-in-chief of the U.S. edition of GQ in 2019. A year later, he was named global editorial director of all 19 international editions of the men's magazine. The Summer 2025 issue, meanwhile, a split cover of F1 stars Brad Pitt, Damson Idris and Lewis Hamilton, is being touted as a print collectible. Though the move seems lateral in many ways — and perhaps even a demotion if it doesn't include a global title — Welch is also discussed in fashion circles as a favorite of Wintour's, undeniably an advantage in any Condé Nast horse race.

	











	The London-born Nnadi succeeded Enninful as head of editorial content at British Vogue in October 2023 — big shoes to fill, without question, yet she continues to propel the book forward with talked-about covers that in 2025 alone include Bella Ramsey, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa. Fold in Nnadi's history at American Vogue, where she worked on both the print and digital sides from 2010 to 2023, and it's clear Nnadi brings the pedigree and experience needed. As a bonus: Wintour referred to her as “beloved among her colleagues” when making the announcement that Nnadi was making the leap across the Atlantic to helm British Vogue (the position Wintour herself held before taking the top spot in New York). If Nnadi desires a return to New York, it sounds like the American team would cheer.


	It's been 10 years since Eva Chen joined Instagram as its director of fashion partnerships, and during that decade, social media (and the platform that employs her in particular) has only become more powerful in publishing conversations. Consider that every day in magazine offices, discussion of celebrity placements in editorials often now includes an assessment of a star's Insta numbers. That places Chen (and her 2.5 million followers) squarely in the running for a position that must consider both digital and social media as central to editorial conversations. Prior to Instagram, Chen served as beauty editor of Teen Vogue and became the youngest-ever editor-in-chief of Lucky, the now-defunct shopping magazine that everyone loved before e-commerce took over the world. All of which is to say, Chen likewise checks many boxes.

	











	The youngest of this group of potential candidates, 34-year-old Peoples Wagner has served as editor-in-chief of The Cut, the online and print component of New York magazine, since 2021. For three years prior, she helmed Teen Vogue as its editor-in-chief — undeniably a full-circle moment, as she started her career as an intern in that magazine's fashion closet. Peoples Wagner brought much-needed elements of inclusivity and social awareness to her tenure at Teen Vogue, and it's clear those needs have only grown in the intervening years at every publication that places a spotlight on current culture.


	The daughter of Candice Bergen and the late director Louis Malle, Chloe Malle has worked at Vogue since 2011 in a variety of roles before being named editor of Vogue.com in October 2023. That was the position Nnadi held before being named editor-in-chief of British Vogue, so is it possible the digital role serves as a route to the top job? The pair also co-host a podcast: The Run-Through with Vogue. One recent kerfuffle, however, may take Malle out of the running: Less than weeks ago, Wintour drew criticism when 36-year-old Mark Guiducci was announced as the new editor of Vanity Fair, replacing Radhika Jones, who exited in April. Guiducci is reportedly a friend of Wintour's daughter, Bee Schaffer, prompting cries of “nepo baby” and an alleged revolt within the VF newsroom. While Malle is clearly qualified to oversee editorial content, the timing is unfortunate for her chances. 

	











	Another editor who excels at her current gig, Moonves has served as editor-in-chief of W magazine since 2019 and as style director of the oversized magazine for two years prior to that. Her popular “Best Performances” issue featured multiple covers — of Zendaya, Demi Moore and Paul Mescal — while Beyoncé graced the magazine's first-ever digital cover in March 2024 to coincide with the release of Cowboy Carter. The daughter of former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves, Sara likewise might have to deal with a “nepo baby” charge if named, but by all accounts she reportedly is very happy at W and enjoys a great deal of autonomy, lessening the speculation of a change.

The North American leg grossed more than $250 million — and it's only halfway done. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



On June 18, Kendrick Lamar and SZA wrapped the North American leg of their co-billed Grand National Tour. The run's 23 shows grossed $256.4 million and sold 1.1 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. That makes it the highest grossing reported co-headline tour ever.


	After the first leg of the tour, Lamar and SZA top Billboard's ranking of the 40 biggest co-billed tours in Boxscore history. It's a narrow victory, surpassing Beyoncé and Jay-Z's On the Run II Tour (2018) by less than $3 million, or just 1%. In terms of ticket sales, the Carters still reign with 2.2 million tickets sold, though Lamar and SZA could make up the difference by the time the tour wraps later this year.


	The Grand National Tour and On the Run II Tour are the only co-headline runs that have made more than $200 million, while just four more crossed $100 million, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z's first On the Run Tour in 2014. The co-headline ranking is littered with classic rock and country tours, but hip-hop easily takes the top two spots, and half of the top six.


	While Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour still looms in the distance among the highest grossing tours by R&B artists ($579.8 million), Lamar now has the biggest stadium tour ever among rappers.


	The Grand National Tour kicked off on April 19 in Minneapolis and then hit 18 more cities in the United States and Canada. That routing included double-headers in New York and Toronto, and three shows in Los Angeles.


	The L.A. stop at SoFi Stadium was a homecoming for Lamar, yielding the biggest gross and attendance of the tour so far. On May 21, 23 and 24, the Grand National Tour grossed a collective $40.4 million from 147,000 tickets. The June 4 show in SZA's hometown of St. Louis (The Dome at America's Center) was just as well attended as any of the L.A. dates (48,600) on a gross of $8.8 million.


	The Grand National Tour is easily the biggest concert run of Lamar and SZA's careers to date. The former sold out arenas on The Big Steppers Tour in 2022-23, and the latter did so on the SOS Tour in 2023-24. But while those international jaunts averaged $1.6 million and $1.8 million per show, respectively, Grand National is pacing $11.1 million each night, toppling both solo runs six times over.


	In the case of any successful co-headline tour, one plus one should equal two (at least). But beyond the simple math of combining these rap and R&B superstars, both acts are riding buzzing momentum. Lamar released GNX in November and SZA dropped SOS Deluxe: LANA in December. Each record featured a Lamar/SZA duet, and the former's “Luther” spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart beyond the tour's first month. Add to that, both shared the stage during the Super Bowl LIX halftime show following Grammy wins for 2024 hits “Not Like Us” and “Saturn.”


	Lamar and SZA will kick off the tour's European leg on July 2 in Cologne, Germany. It's the first of 16 shows, including double-headers in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Then, they hit Latin America for five dates before two nights in Australia December, when the tour will hit Sydney and Melbourne. Both artists are bigger earners in the U.S. than overseas, which is to be expected for any American act, especially in hip-hop. Still, a 15%-20% dip in nightly grosses in Australia and a 35% drop-off in Europe and Latin America would put the Grand National Tour on track for a $400 million finish.

EXCLUSIVE: As Netflix gears up for the conclusion of its hit series Stranger Things later this year, Matt and Ross Duffer are eyeing their next project.


	The Duffer Brothers are developing the Ron Currie novel The Savage, Noble Death of Babs Dionne at the streamer, with the author and his writing partner Joshua Mohr set to pen the series and executive produce. Hilary Leavitt will also EP with the Duffers through their Upside Down Pictures.


	The crime-thriller centers on Babs Dionne, a proud Franco-American, doting grandmother, and vicious crime matriarch, who rules her small town of Waterville, Maine, with an iron fist. She controls the flow of drugs into Little Canada with the help of her loyal lieutenants, girlfriends since they were teenagers, and her eldest daughter, Lori, a Marine vet struggling with addiction. When a drug kingpin discovers that his numbers are down in the upper northeast, he sends a malevolent force, known only as The Man, to investigate. At the same time, Babs's youngest daughter, Sis, has gone missing, which doesn't seem at all like a coincidence. In twenty-four hours, Sis will be found dead, and the whole town will seek shelter from Babs's wrath.

this is so interesting, a spec that Ron took out and didn't sell due to the middling quality. he then went and wrote a gorgeous novel and reverse engineered it based on his own “IP”. well done, curious how under the duffers guidance he can make it good.

Hello, we are seated. The books has a lot of similar beats as Stranger Things. We need this to be made!!

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Nat Faxon & Jim Rash have been set by Netflix to direct Team Hoyt, based on the true story of how Dick Hoyt turned himself into a triathlete and marathoner so he could lug with him son Rick—a non-verbal quadriplegic whose strength and spirit helped galvanize a movement.


	Dick and Rick became an iconic father-son racing team, with Dick pushing and pulling his son through more than a thousand endurance events, including 32 Boston Marathons and six Ironman Triathlons. Off the course, Judy Hoyt carried the baton for inclusive education, playing a pivotal role in drafting Chapter 766—the groundbreaking Massachusetts law that became a model for federal special education legislation.

	The film will be produced by Kevin Walsh's The Walsh Company, Gotham Chopra's Religion of Sports, Ryan Stowell, and NFL icon Tom Brady, latter of whom hatched Religion of Sports with Chopra and another gridiron great, Michael Strahan. Russell Hoyt will co-produce in collaboration with the Hoyt family estate, honoring Rick and Dick's legacy in the racing and disabled people's community. Brady is fully on board, sparking to the inspirational strength of the material and the Hoyt story. Dick's completely Boston-flavored speaking voice probably also appealed to the New England Patriots legend QB.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	If you have a beating heart, you'd be hard pressed to hold back the waterworks watching footage of the bond that developed between a non-athletic father and his son, a young man robbed of mobility and the ability to speak when his umbilical cord strangled him in the womb. Dick got himself off the couch, worked his way into shape, and found that his son enjoyed being part of the race, where they motivated one another.

	











	The script was written by Grant Thompson (McFarland, USA).


	Faxon and Rash most recently directed the dramedy Downhill, starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. They won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2012 for The Descendants, directed by Alexander Payne and starring George Clooney and Shailene Woodley. 


	Walsh (The Instigators), is repped by WME and Johnson, Shapiro, Slewett & Kole. Chopra and Brady's Religion of Sports, which has done acclaimed docuseries on Aaron Rodgers, Serena Williams, Simone Biles and Kobe Bryant, is repped by WME, as is Brady along with Latham & Watkins. Stowell is Yorn, Levine. Faxon & Rash are repped by CAA, Untitled, and Goodman, Genow, and Thompson by Verve, Underground, and Sloane, Offer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Steven Spielberg promises not to retire","https://www.avclub.com/steven-spielberg-promises-not-to-retire","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

The godfather of the modern blockbuster isn't going anywhere. On Thursday, Steven Spielberg was honored with the dedication of a screening room at Universal, the studio where he launched his filmmaking career. Speaking at the event (via The Hollywood Reporter), Spielberg said he viewed the current moment in cinema as a rebirth—“And I don't mean Jurassic World Rebirth opening July 2,” he joked, referencing the franchise he created and continues to produce. “I mean the rebirth of the belief in the people that work as a family, as a community, as a team to make good [things] happen,” the 78-year-old said, ending his remarks with the declaration: “Just know that I love all of you, I'm making a lot of movies, and I have no plans, ever, to retire.”

Spielberg's comments echo that of the 81-year-old Martin Scorsese, who reassured the world last year that he's “not saying goodbye to cinema at all,” and in fact still has “more films to make, and I hope God gives me the strength to make them.” Similarly, 86-year-old Ridley Scott told The Hollywood Reporter he'd quit when he's dead. Perhaps the only modern auteur who has stated a desire is 62-year-old Quentin Tarantino, who wants to finish with a 10th film. (Scorsese reacted to this news by agreeing he's simply built different, while Scott scoffed, “I don't fucking believe that bullshit. Shut up and go make another movie.”) 

Steven Spielberg's Universal theater dedication was a star-studded event attended by the likes of John Travolta, Vin Diesel, Dakota Fanning, Seth Rogen, Jeff Goldblum, John M. Chu, Ava DuVernay, the Daniels, and more. According to Variety, the room got to see some of the first footage from the iconic director's upcoming sci-fi film, rumored to be a UFO thriller starring Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson, and Josh O'Connor (who previously teased the movie is “old-school Spielberg” in the vein of Close Encounters or E.T.). Asked which up-and-coming filmmakers Spielberg himself has his eye on, he told the outlet, “There are so many that excite me right now, and it's not just that they're young. It's the kind of stories they have to tell. If I name one, I'll have to name the last 50.” But in the words of NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios chairman Donna Langley, the studio hopes its new theater “is not just a place founded on Steven's extraordinary legacy, but a place of future hopes and dreams of storytellers who are going to take this company into the next 100 years, and the 100 years after that.”

Peruvian matador Andrés Roca Rey has enormous testicles. Easily one of the largest sets on Earth. We never see them for ourselves, but they're all that his crew of hypemen can talk about. “Such great balls!,” a member of Roca's entourage insists. “Your balls are bigger than the whole fucking arena!,” another concurs. 

The dominant subject of conversation in a documentary where almost nothing else is ever discussed, the size of Roca's nuts is remarked upon so often — and with such grim sobriety — throughout Albert Serra's transfixing “Afternoons of Solitude” that I started to worry if the world's greatest torero might have a serious medical condition of some kind. 

 








Related Stories Matt Reeves Shares Photo of Script for ‘The Batman Part II' ‘Smoke' Review: Taron Egerton's Apple Series Is a Sicko Pulp Thriller Driven by Dark Truths 

If he did, you certainly wouldn't learn about it here, as Serra's film isn't much for personal details. Where Roca was born, why he committed his life to the performative slaughter of horned cattle, and what he does with his time outside of the bullring are just a few of the many basic facts that “Afternoons of Solitude” elides in their entirety; if not for the opening title card that announces him as the movie's star, we might not even know his name. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Is Roca married? Does he resent his father? Has he ever felt a moment of pity for the animals who are only bred so that he can stab them to death for a cheap thrill? Serra estimates that he shot roughly 600 hours of footage in order to cut together this 120-minute documentary, and yet it's fair to assume that none of his rushes even hinted at the answers to those questions. Cycling between a trio of discrete and hermetically sealed environments (the arena, the Ritz hotel where Roca stays during events, and the van that shuttles him between those two locations), and remaining at such a remove from its subject that Serra claims to have only had a single proper conversation with Roca during the 18-month period he spent filming him, “Afternoons of Solitude” renders the torero with almost the same impenetrable blankness as that of the bulls he fights. 

Like the most resonant of Serra's fiction works (namely, “Liberté” and “Pacifiction”), the Catalan director's first documentary is set in a pocket universe too insular and solipsistic to care if it's shrinking — a liminal space that pathologically obeys its own logic as a form of self-protection against the threat of obsolescence. This is a film defined by a tunnel vision so intense that we seldom even see the crowds that come to Roca's events, as the torero's audience is reduced to abstraction over the soundtrack, their voices heard cheering and jeering him on like an ego at war with itself.

 










Indeed, “Afternoons of Solitude” doesn't tell us a single thing about the waning popularity of bullfights, nor does it include any explicit comment on the pre-Roman custom's struggle to survive in a world more sensitive to animal cruelty. On the contrary, Serra's ambivalent long shots — zoomed in from afar to offset the film's in-your-face intensity with an equally palpable sense of distance — build on themselves to create a perspective on the practice unlike any that have been captured on camera before in movies like Rouben Mamoulian's “Blood and Sand” and Francesco Rosi's “The Moment of Truth.” 

This is tradition divorced from history. Spectacle removed from context. It's a guy dressed in sequins mugging at an animal that's covered in its own blood; it's the naked reality of a dance between man and beast, for all of the danger, excitement, cruelty, and embarrassment that match-up provides. The sheer fact of watching it in the year 2025 is enough to convey everything you need to know. The film's unflinchingly repetitive shape allows viewers to lose sight of their perspective at the same time as it invites them to draw their own conclusions, a vertigo which proves to be more involving than the didacticism that a traditional documentary might bring to the same topic. 

 










Serra's approach is especially rewarding because the conclusions it encourages you to draw are ultimately just as irrelevant as the ones that he arrived at himself. Some might come away from this movie with a newfound respect for the monastic focus required of the world's remaining toreros, while others might laugh at the not so latent homoeroticism that allows Roca to feel like a man among men (see: the part where one of Roca's crew members is forced to hoist the boss into his skin-tight traje de luces, or “suit of lights”), or find themselves re-enraged by the slaughter of animals for sport. 

Whatever your own reaction, the open-ended nature of Serra's approach flies in the face of what people have been conditioned to expect from today's non-fiction cinema, much of which exists to challenge the audience for their provincialism while flattering them for their empathy. And while I tend to suspect that Serra had to stifle a few smirks behind the camera (“What you did today is not attainable by others nowadays,” one of Roca's hype men says to the torero after he and his team of sequined performers ganged up to stab a confused animal, “it causes envy among the mediocre, and that is why some spurn you”), “Afternoons of Solitude” is less concerned with the judgment we pass on its subject than it is with the judgment its subject refuses to pass on himself. 

 










The film's poise and structure create a perfect vacuum of self-reflection. “You killed those two bulls so truthfully,” Roca is assured, but the “truth” of those deaths is only maintained by the ritual and pageantry of staging them. For Roca to question why he does this for a living would be a fatal blow to the reality that he must (a reality that falls apart in the one scene without him in it, during which his distressed crew openly discusses their helplessness in preventing him from being gored). 

I don't mean to be skeptical towards the size of his balls, which I'm assured are large enough to have their own magnetic fields, but it's possible that the undeniable fearlessness Roca displays in the bullring stems from the mortal terror he feels at having to prove — or even know — himself in an environment of any other kind. 

How would a man like Roca, who only finds a peace within himself on “the front-lines of the soul,” ever learn to function in a world that no longer makes a spectacle of his bravery? How lonely might life be for the man in the arena without an audience to exalt in his defiance of death? Serra doesn't know, doesn't ask. Instead, he watches and watches and watches, offering Roca the largest crowd of his career, and daring him to tame time itself. 

 










“Afternoons of Solitude” is now playing in select theaters.

Every 10 years, it looks as though Lisa Kudrow will stage a brand-new “Comeback.” Exactly 20 years after the beloved comedy series' first season debuted in 2005, and 10 years after Season 2 in 2015, Kudrow officially is reprising her cult favorite role of Valerie Cherish for “The Comeback” Season 3.

Creator Michael Patrick King, who is now pulling double duty at HBO with “And Just Like That,” will return as showrunner. HBO is billing “The Comeback” Season 3 as “the final season,” but who knows if, in 2035, there will yet be another iteration. The third season will premiere in 2026 on HBO and HBO Max; production will begin this summer.

“The Comeback” centers on has-been sitcom actress Valerie Cherish (Kudrow) who makes her big return to network TV with a reality show called “The Comeback.” Valerie previously led comedy “Room and Board” and is looking to stage a reboot. Season 2 saw Valerie being Emmy-nominated (Kudrow also was nominated in real life for both seasons) after playing a version of herself for a HBO dramedy.

“No matter what the industry throws at her, Valerie Cherish is a survivor,” Amy Gravitt, Executive Vice President, HBO & Max Comedy Programming, said in a press statement. “On the 20th anniversary of her debut, Michael Patrick King and Lisa Kudrow have brilliantly scripted her return to HBO and we can't wait to see that.”

King and Kudrow added together, “Valerie Cherish has found her way back to the current television landscape. Neither of us are surprised she did.”

Dan Bucatinsky, Laura Silverman, and Damian Young will all be back for Season 3. King, Kudrow, Bucatinsky, and John Melfi will executive produce. 

King recently told Variety for the show's 20th anniversary that a Season 3 would be possible about “whether we can find an idea worth going beyond one joke.” He added, “The thing about Valerie — the reason why, if we find an arena, it's going to be great — is that Valerie will never get everything she wants. It's thrilling when you have somebody who's practically a Greek character, going through the underworld to get the golden apple and coming back up like, ‘Well, I got it!'”

It would seem Matt Reeves has finally delivered a script for “The Batman Part II,” on time and as promised.

The director shared a photo on Friday of himself seated with co-writer Mattson Tomlin (upcoming John Wick spinoff “Caine”) captioned “Partners in Crime (Fighting),” along with a blurry image of a script with the Bat Signal logo on the cover. 

Partners in Crime (Fighters) ⁦@mattsontomlin⁩ pic.twitter.com/smItoTOdEQ

A rep for DC Studios did not respond to IndieWire's request for comment. But the timing of the photo matches the planned timeline that DC Studios head James Gunn previously outlined. Gunn said in an interview that fans need to “get off Matt Reeves' nuts” amid some consistent questions about the status of the Robert Pattinson-led superhero sequel and said Reeves was expected to deliver the script by the end of this month. If all is good to go, the movie could begin shooting in London by January, as IndieWire previously reported. The movie is expected to hit theaters in 2027.

Gunn had also defended Reeves and suggested that these things just take time.

“Well, I don't think Matt really pays attention to that stuff so much,” Gunn said. “He's got a lot of other things happening, so I don't think he lets it affect him. He's fine. But I am irritated by people. I mean, it's just that thing people don't need to be entitled about. It's going to come out when he feels good about the screenplay. And Matt's not going to give me the screenplay until he feels good about the screenplay.”

So there you have it. We have a script. “The Batman Part II” had been delayed several times amid the regime change at DC Studios, and fans no doubt had questions and concerns after the success of spinoff “The Penguin,” after seeing the fate of “Batgirl,” or in knowing that “The Batman” and its sequel would not be considered canon in the new DCU but would be part of the “Elseworlds” banner. But fans can presumably put those fears to rest now. 

For some fanboys looking for some clues, Tomlin recently retweeted a page from the comic “Batman: The Imposter #1,” in which Batman sheds a tear after realizing that Gotham for the first time in 54 years experienced a night completely without violent crime.  

“The Batman Part II” is understandably a priority, though. The first film, which starred Pattinson as Bruce Wayne, made $772 million worldwide at the box office. The film also starred Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard, and Barry Keoghan in a cameo role as a prisoner who appeared to be the Joker.

I believe in Luke so much, and, yeah, this song in general has been my and Kyle's religion for some time. Luke is just a great songwriter, man.

Senator 'Misspoke' When She Falsely Claimed Zohran Mamdani Condoned 'Global Jihad'","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/kirsten-gillibrand-zohran-mamdani-global-jihad-1235373902/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 17:09:23 GMT","


							By 

	Tessa Stuart



	During a radio interview Thursday, New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand appeared to suggest that Zohran Mamdani had condoned “global jihad.” Her office tells Rolling Stone she “misspoke,” as she responded to a caller who provided a lengthy list of claims against Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday.  


	Gillibrand appeared Thursday on WNYC's The Brian Lehrer Show, a local call-in radio show. A caller named Gabe dialed into the studio on Thursday to ask Gillibrand about “the threats facing the Jewish community from Zohran Mamdani.” 


	Gillibrand probably should have stopped the caller right there — she could have said there is no evidence that Mamdani poses any threat to the Jewish community. To the contrary, the Muslim state assemblymember spoke often throughout his primary campaign about the threat of rising antisemitism and his desire to be a mayor for all New Yorkers. He was endorsed by many Jewish leaders, including the high-ranking Jewish official in New York, Brad Lander.

	











	But Gillibrand didn't do that, and the caller, Gabe, went on: “There was a bill that I was reading about that unfortunately, he wants to target synagogues and Jewish institutions which donate to nonprofits which are medical institutions like United Hatzalah and Magan Davod David Adam, which is like the Jewish Red Cross.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Gabe continued: “How do we make sure that Jewish institutions are protected from his plans to punish and fine our institutions which fundraise the medical non-profits, which do work both here in the United States and in Israel and other countries in the world? And also, how can we hold Mr. Mamdani accountable for his glorifying association of Hamas and other terror bombings of the Intifada in 1990s, where over 1,000 Jewish Israelis were killed, to his revisionist Holocaust knowledge, to the Warsaw ghetto uprising where Jews were mass exterminated and faced threats. He compared when Jews were killed to when Jews fought back against Nazis. It's quite despicable, I'm sorry.”

	The show's host, beloved New York icon Brian Lehrer, immediately broke in with a disclaimer: “There's a lot in there, senator, some of which may be inaccurate. So I don't know, I can't fact check everything in real time,” he said. 


	Lehrer went on: “But do you know any of that to be inaccurate or accurate, including the original premise that he would somehow target synagogues, if they were contributing to groups like Hatsala Ambulance Services in a way that he could hurt the synagogues? I just don't want to give out information that's false, but I also don't want to shrink from information that's true.”


	Disregarding Lehrer's warning, Gillibrand seemed to co-sign the misinformation the caller was spreading — and added her own blatant lie on top. “The caller is exactly the New York constituents that I've spoken to that are alarmed,” Gillibrand said. “They are alarmed by past public statements. They are alarmed by past positions — particularly references to global jihad.”


	Lehrer was soon forced to clarify, live on air, “On Mamdani, I just feel compelled to say, we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or supported violent jihad,” asking Sen. Gillibrand: “Can you?”


	The senator said, “Again Brian, I don't have all the data and information, and I've never sat down with Mr. Mamdani. So I've asked to have that meeting.”


	After her radio appearance, Rolling Stone reached out to Gillibrand's office to point us to any statements in which Mamdani has endorsed “global jihad.”

	“Senator Gillibrand misspoke in that instance as she sought to address the caller's assertions. As she noted subsequently throughout the interview, her concern was the refusal to denounce ‘globalize the intifada' rhetoric,” Gillibrand's spokesman Evan Lukaske said in a statement. Lukaske added, “She also highlighted that Mr. Mamdani assured her he would protect Jews and all residents of New York City, if elected.”


	A spokesperson for Mamdani's campaign declined to comment for this story. 


	The caller, in claiming Mamdani had targeted Jewish institutions, was presumably referring to Assembly bill A6943A, also known as the “Not on our dime!: Ending New York funding of Israeli settler violence act,” which was introduced in 2023. Mamdani was a sponsor of the bill, which sought to prevent tax-exempt nonprofits “from engaging in unauthorized support of Israeli settlement activity.” Israeli settler violence, particularly in the occupied West Bank, has increased in recent years, and a number of people have been injured and killed — including multiple Americans — as tensions have risen in the area. Over a nine-month period in 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs found that settlers and Israeli forces killed 189 Palestinians and wounded 8,192 more in the West Bank. “Funding war crimes is not a charitable purpose,” Mamdani said at the time, adding that many of the charities in question were “openly fundraising for that very activity.”

	











	Gillibrand has not been covering herself in glory of late. Once best known as a fierce and outspoken advocate for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, Gillibrand was among the number of Democratic lawmakers who called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after at least 13 women accused the former governor of sexual misconduct. But when Cuomo jumped into the mayoral race earlier this year, Gillibrand disappointed many by saying, “It's up to New York voters, it's not up to me,” when asked about Cuomo's decision to jump into the race. “He has a lot of talent as an executive, he's been a strong governor, but he has made mistakes… Serious mistakes.”


	One woman who was targeted by Cuomo after speaking out about his behavior told Rolling Stone what a bitter disappointment it was to hear Gillibrand, whom she says had called her personally to convey her support. 


	Later in the show, Lehrer asked Gillibrand to explain why she took the tact she did on Cuomo. “Why so soft on Andrew Cuomo?” Lehrer inquired. “An equal treatment of women has been a core issue for you. A number of our callers and texters want a version of that question answered.”

	Gillibrand answered: “It's very simple. When multiple allegations came out about Andrew Cuomo, I think it was eight or nine, I called on him to resign… That was my view at the time because people asked how do you think they can continue to govern with these allegations? …The question being asked today is what's my opinion about someone after they've resigned, after they've taken the penalty that I called on them to take? …And my answer to that is everyone gets to decide in this election who they want to vote for.” 


	She added: “It's up to New Yorkers. It is not up to me.”

	The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that lower federal courts should not have the power to issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential orders — no matter how obviously unconstitutional such an order may be.


	The decision is a monumental gift to Donald Trump's administration, which is seeking to implement much of its anti-immigration and other policy priorities through executive orders. The ruling was 6-3, with the court's six conservative justices opting to restrict the power of the lower courts. 


	The ruling comes in response to the Trump administration's argument that the judiciary does not have the power to block the president's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the Constitution. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively restricts the injunctions that blocked the birthright citizenship order, and could potentially apply to other authoritarian actions by Trump and his administration that have been blocked by federal courts.

	











	Trump was ecstatic. “GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves (same year!), not the SCAMMING of our Immigration process. Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Solicitor General John Sauer, and the entire DOJ.”


	“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, and some of the cases we're talking about would be ending birthright citizenship,” the president added at a news conference later on Friday.

	











	The day he was inaugurated, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which was intended to strip the children of non-citizen immigrants — regardless of their legal status — of the right to American citizenship if they were born in the United States. 


	The effort is blatantly unconstitutional. The 15th Amendment guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” The order was challenged in multiple lawsuits, and its implementation was quickly blocked by several district court judges across multiple states.

	In response, the Trump administration disregarded the question of the order's constitutionality almost entirely, appealing to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the lower courts don't actually have the right to issue nationwide injunctions against an executive policy. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, called out the administration's tactics in her dissent of Friday's decision.


	“The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the government makes no attempt to hide it,” she wrote. “Yet, shamefully, this court plays along.”


	“No right is safe in the new legal regime the court creates,” Sotomayor continued. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief. That holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only for any individuals who are not parties to a lawsuit.”


	During oral arguments in May, lawyers for the Justice Department argued that executive orders could not be blocked by the lower courts, and should be allowed to go into effect until something like a class-action lawsuit against a given policy makes its way to the Supreme Court.

	“Your argument turns our justice system into a catch me if you can kind of regime from the standpoint of the executive where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's rights,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said during one oral argument exchange with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer.

	











	The Supreme Court is controlled by conservatives, though, three of which Trump appointed in his first term. In the end, they agreed with the Justice Department.

This post contains spoilers for Season Four of The Bear, which is now streaming on Hulu.


	Late in “Bears,” the seventh episode of the new season of The Bear, 16 different people are seated under the same table at a wedding reception. When we first see this table — part of the furnishings in the home of Frank (Josh Hartnett), newly-married to Tiffany (Gillian Jacobs), who used to be married to Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) — it does not seem large enough to accommodate that many people. It looks like… a table, just big enough for Tiffany and Richie's daughter Eva (Annabelle Toomey) to hide under because she's nervous about doing a stepfather-stepdaughter dance with Frank. When Richie, Frank, and their friend Claire (Molly Gordon) join her to make sure she's OK, the area is so cramped that Richie's legs stick out from beneath the tablecloth. Yet one by one, this group is joined by Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), Carmy's sister Natalie (Abby Elliott), Natalie's husband Pete (Chris Witaske), Natalie's frenemy Francie Fak (Brie Larson), Neil Fak (Matty Matheson), Ted Fak (Ricky Staffieri), Ted's girlfriend Kelly (Mitra Jouhari), Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), cousin-in-law Stevie (John Mulaney), Marcus (Lionel Boyce), Marcus' friend Chester (Carmen Christopher), and finally Tiffany, and there is room for them all to not only sit, fully upright, but to move around without risk of injury. 

	











	Is this a table built for giants? Did Frank — who, admittedly, is quite wealthy as the CEO of a popular keyless entry app — have it imported from a castle in Gstaad? Is it like the TARDIS from Doctor Who, much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside? A magical object capable of expanding to accommodate however many people are providing emotional support for one another underneath it? No one in the scene questions the table's size, though they're eventually excited to all be under it together; Ted even takes a selfie of the group, whose encouragement and empathy finally convince Eva to rejoin the party. So we can only speculate as to its special properties.

	But the series' ability to incorporate so many people into such an allegedly small space, and to make an episode featuring all of them, plus nearly everyone else in the show's main cast, plus guest stars like Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, and Sarah Paulson, and to never make it feel too crowded, or like anyone is being lost in the shuffle, is part of its own magic. 


	Yet The Bear can cast just as potent a spell when it keeps things small and simple, like the season's fourth episode, “Worms,” where Sydney is the only regular character to appear, there are only three other substantial speaking parts, and Sydney interacts with each of those people one-on-one. 


	Co-written by Edebiri and Boyce, and directed by Janicza Bravo, “Worms” (named for the gummy candy Sydney enjoys at one point) finds Syd trying to address two problems on the same day: She needs to get her hair braided, and she needs to decide already whether she wants to leave The Bear to help Carmy's old colleague Adam Shapiro (played by the actor of the same name) launch a new restaurant, where she will be the head chef. The converted warehouse space Shapiro shows her is a raw lump of clay, which the two of them could theoretically mold into anything, but which could also turn out to be a mess. She knows about The Bear's problems — most notably Carmy being an erratic, undependable, at times maddening boss, mentor, and alleged creative partner — but she also loves the people there, and knows what the place can be like when everyone is on their game and working in harmony. Shapiro's spot could become anything, or nothing. 


	From there, Syd goes to the home of her cousin Chantel (Danielle Deadwyler), a professional hairstylist happy to do a favor for family away from the salon. Chantel is a single mom, raising her daughter TJ (Arion King) with occasional help from TJ's father — and Chantel's off and on boyfriend, it seems — Christian. Where Sydney is a bundle of nerves most of the time, Chantel is at ease with herself and her place in the world, happily gossiping about friends, family, and clients with her cousin. (Deadwyler, one of the most chameleonic actors we have, disappears into this relaxed, confident, funny role.) But she runs out of supplies while Syd's hair is only halfway done, so she ducks out to the store, leaving Syd in charge of TJ.

	The structure is not dissimilar from a classic episode of another FX comedy-drama hybrid, Atlanta, where Paper Boi's attempt to get a haircut from his favorite barber led him on an odyssey of crime and misfortune. Things don't go nearly as badly for Syd, but Chantel is gone a long time — it later turns out that she ran into Christian in her travels — and Syd winds up bonding with TJ. We already know that Syd's mother died when she was little, and that this loss helped define the person she is, for good and for ill. So the script doesn't have to lay it on thick that she is spending an afternoon playing surrogate mother, nor that she has complicated feelings simply watching Chantel and TJ interact. It's just understood by all. It doesn't take over the story — in which Syd's attempt to help TJ deal with a friend group crisis in turn helps her reckon with the Shapiro vs. Carmy question — but it adds another layer of complexity and emotional shading to it. 

	











	Because we're watching a show called The Bear, where Carmy and Syd are the two main characters, while Shapiro is a minor recurring character who hasn't been granted the level of depth of, say, the members of the extended Berzatto family who appear at the wedding, we're inclined to root for Sydney to stay at the series' titular workplace. But the choice is as difficult as Sydney makes it sound when she tries to frame it to TJ like she's picking between two different houses to visit for a sleepover. We know what a catastrophe The Bear, and particularly Carmy, can be. We know it's a family establishment that, while it treats Sydney, Marcus, Tina (Liza Colón-Zayas), and others like they're family, may never entirely feel to Syd like it's hers. (Chantel dismisses The Bear as a place from the predominantly white north side of Chicago, where they don't make beef the way she's used to.) But she knows Shapiro more by reputation than as a person, and the unknown of the new endeavor in some ways is even scarier than sticking around and waiting for Carmy's latest meltdown.


	The day spent with TJ doesn't exactly help Syd make the decision, but it at least gives her the courage to continue talking with Shapiro about terms. And being around her own extended family — when it seems that most of her life is either about work, or seeing her widower father (Robert Townsend, wonderful in other parts of the season) — reminds her of just how important it is to stay connected with people who aren't your co-workers. Hearing that Chantel and Christian are back on good terms, she suggests going out with them the next time she has a night off. Even if that's not for another three Saturdays, it's still a big leap for her. 


	In all, “Worms” is a lovely spotlight on the series' co-lead, that feels at once like a little interlude from the main action and like an important stepping stone in the season's larger arc about what will happen to The Bear, and whether Syd wants to keep working with Carmy. Like the cheffed-up Hamburger Helper meal Syd teaches TJ to cook — or, for that matter, like the pared-down menu The Bear has to deploy this season after the grocery budget starts getting too low — it turns its lack of ingredients into a strength. The simplicity of it allows the most important part — in this case, Edebiri's screen presence, charm, and palpable vulnerability in this role — to stand out, rather than getting lost in a busy sauce. 

	











	That said, when the sauce is as rich and thick and spicy as it is in “Bears,” that works splendidly, too. 


	The two episodes are linked in terms of Sydney's conflict, as we still don't know which way she's leaning by the end of “Bears.” (Nor, at that point, do we know what Carmy is trying to tell her about alterations to the partnership agreement she still hasn't signed.) Beyond that, they couldn't be more different. “Worms” is barely over a half hour, all of it about one character, with Shapiro, Chantel, and TJ all allowing Syd to confront different facets of the story. “Bears” is 69 minutes long — within spitting distance of feature film length. It has 20 significant characters in it, all of whom get at least one brief spotlight moment, if not a full arc within the episode. It is loud where “Worms” is quiet, chaotic where “Worms” is chill, and deeply sentimental where “Worms” is more than a little skeptical of the idea that Syd should stay with these people merely out of affection and familiarity. 


	Despite its runtime, “Bears” never seems padded because so much is happening, and because Joanna Calo's script and Bear creator Christopher Storer's direction makes every moment for every character — whether someone we know well like Richie, or someone relatively minor like Frank or Stevie — feel real and honest. Even the more exaggerated comedic material, like Francie and Natalie(*) cursing each other out for most of the evening over some incident that's never entirely explained(**), has a core of emotional truth to it, in the way that only the people we love the most can drive us that crazy.  


(*) Credit obviously to Brie Larson for absolutely going for it with this performance, when her comedic chops have been called upon less and less the bigger her career has become, and for also trying to fit into the show in a way that John Cena — as another Fak — didn't bother to last season. But the subplot's also a potent reminder that Abby Elliott was once an SNL castmember and a gifted comic actress, when The Bear mainly uses her (as it uses everyone else) for serious, heartfelt material. That said, the funniest bit of that subplot doesn't involve either of them, but rather the cut from Tiffany offering to help get a sad Neil a hot chocolate at the end of one scene, to a happy Neil sipping his hot chocolate and watching Francie and Natalie yell at each other at the start of the next scene.   












(**) Pete does at least figure out that Francie and Natalie once hooked up, though that doesn't seem to be the thing the two women are fighting about here.   


	The length, and the army of big-name guest stars, evokes “Fishes,” the famous, and famously stressful, Season Two episode where a Berzatto family Christmas at the home of Carmy and Natalie's mother Donna (Curtis) descended into chaos and rage, culminating in her crashing her car into the living room. Most of that episode's guest stars are back, even if some, like Odenkirk and Paulson, are only really in one scene apiece(*). Carmy and Odenkirk's Uncle Lee talk about the events of “Fishes,” and at another point Carmy flashes back on that terrible day while struggling to remain emotionally present and not too overwhelmed at the wedding. 


(*) Goodness, though, does the episode get great mileage out of each of those scenes! The one where Tiffany and Paulson's Michelle lie in bed together, and Michelle helps Tiffany work through her conflicted feelings about her own difficult mother not coming to the wedding, should not work. Michelle is barely a character on the show — no matter how many times someone tries to explain the Berzatto family tree, I can't keep track of whether she's a blood relative or another fake cousin like Richie — and Tiffany to this point has been defined almost entirely through Richie's sense of guilt about blowing things with her. But Jacobs and Paulson are so present and warm and open with each other that our lack of knowledge of either of them doesn't matter. And Odenkirk and Jeremy Allen White stage a spectacular little duet as Lee opens up to Carmy about all he's been through since they last saw each other. It's hard to choose which is the more powerful moment: the slight break in Lee's voice when he tells Carmy, “Sometimes, to break patterns, you gotta… break patterns, man,” or the look of astonished hope on Carmy's face when he realizes Lee is telling the truth about Mikey being proud of his little brother.  


	Ultimately, though, the episode proves to be its predecessor's spiritual opposite. “Fishes” was a story where everyone's theoretical holiday excitement was ruined by the stress of actually gathering that many Berzattos in the same place at the same time. “Bears” is a story about a day that everyone is worried about going in — Sydney is there not because she knows Tiffany or Frank, but because Richie needs a friend to lean on for what he assumes will be a dark, painful affair — that instead turns out to be wonderful for nearly all involved. 

	











	Again, nearly. Donna wanders through the reception like a figure out of one of the many horror movies Jamie Lee Curtis has starred in — the alcoholic, mentally ill mother who destroys all joy in her path, and who seemingly can't be destroyed herself. Carmy is so shaken by her presence that Richie and Sydney have to swoop in to rescue him, which means Syd is the one who gets stuck with the full D.D. experience. By the end of their conversation, Syd is shaking, as much for understanding what Carmy has been through as for her own complicated maternal feelings. (It's not Edebiri's rawest moment of the season, but only because she goes to such a dark and pained place in the episode where Sydney is at the hospital after her father's heart attack.) And on a lighter note, Frank is not at all pleased to learn that his mom invited Chester, whom Frank fired from his business. (And Marcus in turn is annoyed that Chester invited him as his plus-one without explaining his history with the groom.) 


	But Carmy's conversation with Lee, and then his time under the table with the big group — and especially with ex-girlfriend Claire — does wonders for his disposition, and for his usual difficulty being in crowds. He's able to open up to Claire, and to tell the truth about the scar on his hand that he lied about when they were together. 


	And almost everyone else gets what they want. Natalie and Francie reconcile. Ted tells Kelly that he loves her, and she says it back to him. (Kelly has never appeared before, and barely says or does anything, yet that scene works, too. That's how on rails the episode is.) Eva agrees to dance with Frank, and Richie helps Frank feel less self-conscious about his role as stepdad. Tiffany — in another knockout scene from Gillian Jacobs — tells Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt) that she worried she would lose the Berzattos when she and Richie divorced, since they feel more like her family than her actual family, and he assures her that she's stuck with all these Bears for life. Neil gets his hot chocolate. And Richie — for whom this day should have been the most difficult, since it makes the end of his marriage even more official than the divorce — comes out of it feeling oddly reassured by it all. He knows that Frank improbably feels inferior to him. And he tells Jimmy that where he once thought of himself as an isolated rock in the Zen garden of the Berzattos' lives, he's come to think that maybe he's the sand holding the whole group together. When you consider that all of these people are at this wedding, and in Tiffany's life, because of Richie, he's not exactly wrong, is he?

	While Syd is acting as Carmy's human shield, she and Donna talk about the differences between work-family and family-family. But the wedding is an example of how the definition of family can be amorphous. None of the Berzattos are related by blood or marriage to Tiffany, but they matter more to her than her biological kin. Mikey is gone, but Carmy still has a brother in Richie. And while Sydney understandably feels like she can never truly be part of the clan, she's under that table like everyone else, and we see at the end of the season that Carmy trusts and cares for her like he does his own sister. Like Tiffany, she's a Bear forever if she wants to be. 


	One episode is tiny. One is huge. One is mostly about Syd's family-family, the other about her work-family. But The Bear can be at its best at any size, no matter how many or how few people it needs to fit under the table.

In an ironic twist several years ago, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works, the supersecret lab that developed stealth technology and that has been implicated in many UFO conspiracy theories, wound up getting a mysterious, possibly extraterrestrial metal fragment from the military. It had been sent for evaluation after the Army struck a deal with (I kid you not) Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge's UFO-research organization To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, who had bought the fragment in 2019. The Army legitimately wanted to find out if it could defy gravity.

If this sounds absolutely bizarre, then you should read part two of a Wall Street Journal dive into the con-jobs-within-con-jobs that have defined the obsession with UFOs for decades. Part one explained that Unidentified Aerial Phenomena and the lore that has surrounded them was an psyop designed to distract the public and intimidate military insiders into keeping quiet about advanced weaponry.

Part two chronicles DeLonge's debris — which was supposed to have come from a crashed alien craft in Roswell, New Mexico, and was according to the Journal acquired for $35,000 — and the efforts of a Department of Defense investigator to figure out whether it was legitimately not of this world. The report also shows that UFO mythology has taken on a crazy, some might say unhinged, life of its own.



The DoD investigator, Sean Kirkpatrick, got Lockheed to hand over the mystery metal. He then sent it to a Department of Energy lab, where it was traced to an earthbound World War II-era project. It definitely could not defy gravity. Meanwhile, Kirkpatrick and his team were running down all manner of other UFO allegations, many of which involved the Skunk Works and people who claimed to know what had really gone on there.

There were reverse-engineered alien lasers. There were crashed UFOs in Russia. There was an FBI raid of what wound up being an empty safe that was supposed to contain secret alien data. There was an actual Russian laser program that probably entailed UFO disinformation. The scale of the scam was astonishing, and we should be thanking the Journal for connecting all the dots.

As Kirkpatrick pursued all this stuff, he predictably ticked off some of the people he had investigated, who clearly had a stake in keeping the UFO narrative from being debunked. Ultimately, the overall investigation concluded that UFO claims dating back to the 1950s were baseless. The UFO gravy train, however, shows no signs of ending.



The original U.S. government UFO psyop was wildly successful. Whoever dreamed it up is likely long gone, but their work is being carried on by a generation of opportunists who are more than happy to insist that we ignore the laws of physics. And believe that the government still has something to hide. And continue to pay attention as they go on podcasts to unravel the greatest cover up that never was. According to Politico, Kirkpatrick himself thinks that conspiracy theorists are feeding on the Pentagon's reluctance to talk openly about UFOs.

Of course, the most amusing aspect of the Journal's two-part foray into the convoluted realm of the big UFO story is that military secrets were being concealed at places like the Skunk Works. Secrets involving technology that you might have thought came from outer space. The F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, for example. Just imagine what real-world inventions the ongoing UFO myth is still distracting us from. Something might eventually defy gravity after all!","{'href': 'https://www.jalopnik.com', 'title': 'Jalopnik'}","other"

What if it were true? What if the decades if not centuries of strange stories of the unexplained were all rooted in a nugget of truth? Sure, intelligence agencies have had a field day planting dis- and misinformation in the field of UFOs, and there is no doubt that an avalanche of lies to further endless ends exists in this subject. I call it the Great Ocean of Bullshit for a reason.

But the Navy didn't change their reporting standards because they weren't seeing UAPs. There is something clearly going on here, and to argue there is not requires a grander and more unproven conspiracy theory than simply asserting that this is all something like it looks like.

And one dramatically under-investigated thing it looks like is something incredibly familiar to our much more terrestrial and known political world: corporate corruption backed by government secrecy.

I cover UAPs partially because I am interested in them and adhere to the belief that you write best when you write what you know, also partially because I fell backwards into becoming something of a UAP reporter and feel a responsibility to help others wade through this mystery, and because I think that the left needs to reclaim some ground in a subject that has more potential upside to change the world than any other in politics. It sounds weird to say but it's true, UFOs are potentially a climate change issue. Right-wing Representatives like Anna Paulina Luna and Tim Burchett cannot be the only people pushing this forward if we are ever going to uncover what the government has been lying to us about.

Let's just start with this thought experiment. The general story that has been told in our modern UFO era since the 1940s by people ranging from majors to astronauts to scientists to historical researchers is that something unexplained is doing whatever the hell it wants in our skies, and the US government has some degree of knowledge about it and is shielding this knowledge from the public.

The next logical question is why the US government would be covering something up, and we know some straightforward reasons why. In the 1950s the CIA believed a fake UFO invasion could be created by the Soviets to create mass hysteria as a pretext for a military invasion, and so their official policy became to downplay and denigrate this subject in the public to blunt that potential angle of attack. UFOs are also a great way for intelligence agencies to track very unique kinds of false information through other intelligence agencies, learning how they gather a wide array of non-UFO intelligence, and so there are a litany of covert state secrets that intersect with this arena that reasonably explain why the government is so guarded about this subject.

But those explanations only go so far, and don't do much to downplay the UFO reports from all over the world. The 2017 NYT article that changed the UFO world gets all the attention for good reason, but it didn't stop there. In 2020, the New York Times reported that longtime government contractor Eric Davis told them that he briefed the Defense Department on retrievals of “off-world vehicles not made on this earth.” The notion of crash retrievals has slipped from unproven lore to the center of the modern UFO mystery in the years since that NYT report. A lot of very credible people are saying some unbelievable things, and they all assert that the United States government and its military contractors are in possession of exotic technology utilizing a science we cannot reproduce.

If it were true, it would mean we have access to the cleanest and most powerful energy man has ever known, and we would have no need for an increasingly apocalyptic world that runs on oil. The entire economic structure of the globe would shift overnight if we could reproduce this technology at scale that is alleged to exist deep in Special Access Programs (SAPs) and military contractors. It is obviously fanciful to pin the entire hope of reversing catastrophic climate change on alien technology, but it would be foolish to dismiss its potential given the climate's increasingly desperate need for a game-changing event to shift it off the cataclysmic track it is on.

And according to veteran UFO journalist Geroge Knapp and every other credible reporter becoming increasingly brazen in stating this: we do have this game-changing technology, and it likely resides inside of military contractors. This would go a long way to explain how this secret has been supposedly kept hidden for so long, as the bowels of Lockheed Martin lie far away from pesky FOIA filings and other democratic measures. Matthew Brown told Knapp and Jeremy Corbell that he became a whistleblower because he thinks we do have this advanced technology, and it doesn't primarily reside in our government's hands. David Grusch said something similar under oath in 2023. Call Davis's, Brown's and Grusch's shared allegations hysteric lies if you want, but the more that mount, there more credible all of them become.

I cannot report anything on my latest investigatory track yet, but last year, my UAP source pointed me towards USAF Plant 42 with no further instructions. My digging since that fateful conversation has taken me down the path of Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) entities, which USAF Plant 42 is one. So is Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey and Air Force Plant 4 and Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth Texas, two other GOCOs that like Plant 42, have experienced unknown drone swarms in recent years. There aren't enough incidents or data to call it a correlation, but it does seem like a disproportionate number of the unknown drone swarms the government is admitting to are occurring at and around these vitally important GOCO facilities.

What if those unknown drone swarms are ours? What if they aren't? What if those unknown drone swarms are directed by private military contractors, and that's why the government is saying they don't know what these are, lest they declare that they have lost control of their clients? Why did my source tell me to look into USAF Plant 42 right before it was reported there were unknown drones swarming it? These are all unanswered questions that are worth investigating given the evidence presented, and despite Sean Kirkpatrick and the Wall Street Journal's best efforts to reheat known history with a side of tall tales, there is still a lot of compelling evidence worth digging into.

What would the odds that this isn't true have to be to make this something not worth digging into? If this is true, then we have a major scientific breakthrough siloed off from how actual science is done, frozen in time inside of SAPs and military contractors in the hope that one day someone could make it profitable for them and only them. If it's not true, you look silly finding out it's all lies. Big whoop. If it were true, we have a good explanation for one reason why the Pentagon budget expands nonstop. There are checks already cashed that raise serious questions, hence why Congress is so interested in this subject because they're the ones who wrote those checks.

By all rumored and reported accounts, the worst-kept secret in the world is that Lockheed and other private companies have exotic technology that elite black budget operators like Jake Barber say they have recovered for private military contractors. This is the thread to pull on. The woo-woo stuff is fun to ponder and all, but I firmly believe that the direction my UAP source pointed me in was something terrestrial, potentially not even directly UAP related, and GOCOs fit into practically every investigatory avenue I see right now.

Which leads to me to finalize this with a plea. I don't actually have to plead with lefties in general to pay attention to this, despite our faction's favored derision of it, just the ones inside of Congress. I have had some prominent Splinter readers DM me thanking me for covering this subject, and everything I write on UFOs lands in our most popular rotation despite the lack of folks boosting it on social media. There is no shame in being interested in a genuine mystery that unfortunately has come to be dominated with the right-wing in recent times. Republican lizard people like Tim Burchett and Anna Paulina Luna have helped advance this subject within Congress, so it's understandable why no liberal wants to touch it, even though Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asking thoughtful and pointed questions of David Grusch at his hearing two summers ago. Republicans' hands are not clean on this by a longshot however, as the Congressional record backs up journalist Jeremy Corbell's assertion that professional liar Nancy Mace “lied” under oath at last November's UAP hearing. This is not a partisan issue, demonstrated by AOC and Tim Burchett aligning under the same curiosity. There is something real here.

So this is my plea to Reps like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who have demonstrated an interest in this subject and are amenable to the potential climate change progress it presents: take more of an interest in this in Congress. Use the fact that Burchett genuinely seems to be pissed off about this to advance this investigation to an arena where his Republican allies will never go: the corporate world where the most trusted UAP reporters say the heart of the story is.

Military contractors have far too much influence, as President Eisenhower warned us about nearly three quarters of a century ago. Their profit motive has usurped American foreign policy to an extreme anti-democratic degree in the parts of the Pentagon we know about, and if these longstanding allegations against giants like Lockheed Martin are true, then maybe Eisenhower's prophetic warning was also about something more profound, and private military contractors have committed a far graver crime against humanity than bombs and bullets can fully encapsulate. By allegedly not allowing genuine advancements in science to be studied in a scientific manner, and instead siloing it off in a desperate undermanned chase to monopolize a profit center, we may have lost a generation or more of progress as we have hardened into a society who rightly believes our government and elite are lying to us for their own financial gain. Again I ask, what if it were true?

Using Congress's investigatory powers (whatever is left after the GOP's full abdication of them) is a worthy endeavor for lefties to dig into the private contractor angle of this issue, because even if this is all bullshit and my GOCO investigations are leading me to a dead end, based on Congress's testimony, that means they likely apportioned millions if not billions to programs that were bullshit! That's theft. As I have stated many times before, every angle on this mystery makes it a big story, and it's time that lefties in Congress took up the mantle to dig into what exactly private military contractors and UFOs have in common.

Guest Column
 | June 27, 2025        

By Mike Flanagan

The connections between searching for extraterrestrial life and exploring new cancer therapies probably seem few and far between. One involves searching the universe for signs of intelligence beyond our planet, while the other instead revolves around the hunt for sub-microscopic clues that a cell harbors mutations that bring about disease.

But from my early years working as an engineer at NASA, now to leading as a cofounder and Chief Technology Officer of an early-stage biotech startup, Delve Therapeutics, I've learned that there's more connections than many may think, and that by looking at the links between the two, we can help to develop new treatments in a way that can make a meaningful change for millions of people impacted by cancer.

My post-graduate career began three decades ago at NASA, specifically at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) after finishing my Ph.D. at Caltech. While many at JPL were focused on unmanned rockets exploring outer space, my team was largely focused on trying to find and receive signals that may be coming from extraterrestrial life. It was a daunting task, but an exciting prospect. The work we were doing was aiming to reach through billions of miles or more, to try and pick up just the faintest trace of a signal.

When I was ready for my next opportunity, I joined Bell Labs which at that time was pioneering advanced communications between mobile phones and cell towers. So, in theory, I was working in the same capacity, looking to find and learn how to receive faint signals across a wide distance, only this time, the span was less in the billions, and more in the dozens of miles range. After Bell Labs, I was CTO at Arieso, a UK-based startup where we developed innovative, location-based products to help mobile service providers answer the question: based on signals from my customers, where am I having problems in my network?

It's that same communications and signal-based approach that now applies to the work we're doing at Delve Therapeutics at the New Jersey Bioscience Center, a strategic innovation center located in North Brunswick, NJ in the heart of the state's research corridor. While working to develop potential immunotherapies for cancer, we're actually dialing in to try and detect, and then respond to, the signals that mutated cells naturally give off, so the body can be trained to fight the disease right at its core. We know that the body has the underlying tools it needs to ward off cancer, but cancer is a cunning opponent skilled at evading its enemies. So, for targeted cancers, we can give the body's immune cells a boost in detecting where the cancer cells are and help them destroy their tumor targets more effectively.

So, while it may seem like I made a change from deep space research, shifted into working in mobile communications, and then into a completely unrelated field of pharmaceuticals — I have actually built my career around finding and interpreting signals. I just started at the biggest scale in our universe, from between solar systems, and have been working my way down ever since, now focusing on the sub-microscopic space in and around cells. As Richard Feynman once observed at Caltech: “There's plenty of room at the bottom!”

This all feeds into the mindset of an engineer. Most people in my position may wake up each morning feeling like a scientist, but most days I still feel like an engineer. The difference, from my perspective, is that a scientist will look at a phenomenon and wonder what's going on and try to understand it, while an engineer will look at it and wonder how that same phenomenon can be used to achieve an outcome. I love science and the pursuit of knowledge, but at the end of the day if I can't come up with something useful, it doesn't feel like I'm doing this right.

This isn't to say that the industry doesn't need basic research and traditional academic contributors, it certainly does, but there's also a significant opportunity for the unconventional. The path taken may not look like the usual one on paper, but it's one that can lead to real-world results, and I think any industry can use more of that type of thinking.

Sometimes all it takes to make a breakthrough in research, in any field, is to look at the problem differently than anybody has before. Naturally, that's easier said than done, but a good start can be coming from outside the traditional route. Coming from an engineering and deep-space background has given me a different perspective from many of my peers, and it is one that I'm excited to share in the name of creating a meaningful change in the lives of people living with cancer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Alien+Encounters","Horror Beat: Color Little Green Men any other color you want with THE ALIEN ENCOUNTERS COLORING BOOK","https://www.comicsbeat.com/alien-encounters-coloring-book/","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 19:00:39 GMT","

Abducted by aliens? Then your coloring should be spot on.

There's a certain color palette that springs to mind whenever talk of UFOs, aliens, or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) comes up. It owes a lot to the 1947 Roswell Incident in New Mexico. Silver-colored saucers and little grey humanoid creatures dominated the landscape of the unexplained. Early sci-fi movies added to this with their black & white aesthetic, which leaned on grey tones to portray their aliens. As color films reached the mainstream in the Fifties and Sixties, little grey men became little green men. And then all bets were off.

Now, you can give this paranormal world of conspiracies, sightings, and abductions your own color palette with Andy Price's The Alien Encounters Coloring Book, set for a July 1st release date courtesy of Adams Media (an imprint of Simon and Schuster). Price is the illustrator behind the Extreme Horror Sticker Book and The Cryptid Creatures Coloring Book, both of which showcase a deep knowledge of both topics with drawings that homage classic movies and monster designs.



The Alien Encounters Coloring Book features thirty extraterrestrial mysteries to color in, ranging from Roswell to the Belgium UFO Wave of 1989-90 and up to 2011's Jerusalem UFO sightings. Each case is portrayed with a sense of grandiosity that captures the spectacular nature of these events. Some are reminiscent of movie posters for old sci-fi flicks (like The UFO Attack on Washington, DC in 1952) while others come across as classified case files with top secret pictures of aliens and spaceships spread out over someone's desk (as in illustration for The McMinnville UFO case in 1950). Then you have a few that take the form of newspaper front pages, which how is the 1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO Sighting appears in the book.

One very clever detail that makes the coloring book stand out is its decision to offer brief narratives of each encounter on the back of every page. It's not unlike the small paragraphs you'd find in museums next to art pieces, providing information on context and method. They're bite-sized, but they do a lot to give meaning to the images. It's essentially a crash course in extraterrestrial phenomena.

Adding to this is Price's smart selection of encounters for the book. While the many testimonies surrounding these cases tend to share in some very similar details between them (i.e. big heads, silvery oval eyes, and long arms), there's an aim to emphasize the things that differentiate them. Some aliens have long hair and suits, while others are smaller but with bulging eyes. The same extends to spaceships, which is where Price really stretches his ability to create unique variations of a core design.

Ever since Roswell, movies and TV series have largely stuck to the flying saucer as the standard for alien spaceships. Nineties kids, for instance, grew up with them thanks to The X-Files and the many docuseries that cropped up around that time with a focus on seeking answers to unexplained phenomena. Even Jordan Poole's 2022 Nope resorts to the visual for its sci-fi horror tale, albeit with a special twist on the flying object that opens up new avenues for experimentation. Price takes a like-minded approach, clearly relying on extensive research to give each spaceship its own identity. The 1977 Petrozavodsk Sightings page is a great example of this. It shows a classic saucer-shaped craft with jellyfish-like tentacles coming out from underneath it. Initial reactions to it suggest the ship might be the alien itself, a living creature fused with high tech. Coloring this one is a reward unto itself, and it can spark enough curiosity to learn more about the sighting.



The Alien Encounters Coloring Book is as much an education as it is a coloring book. It's the kind of work that can make people go down the rabbit hole in search of the truth previous generations already started on. If it had existed in the world of The X-Files, Mulder would be the proud owner of one. Simply put, Andy Price's illustration will make you want to believe in aliens. And you'll do so one color at a time.

This week's ceasefire follows one of the largest air campaigns in Middle Eastern history.Leo Correa/The Associated Press

Eliot Pence is the founder of Tofino Capital and the former head of international growth for Anduril Industries.

Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday committed to the biggest defence-spending increase in generations: a bump to 5 per cent of the economy by 2035. We have not seen such a number since the Second World War. 

How exactly should we go about this spending? The newly paused war between Israel and Iran offers some lessons. 

The ceasefire this week follows one of the largest air campaigns in Middle Eastern history. Over a span of just 10 days, Iran launched roughly 1,000 drones and more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel – the largest direct strike ever by Tehran. 

In response, Israel conducted a sweeping counteroffensive: it pre-emptively destroyed nearly 950 drones before launch, struck over 120 missile launchers, and reportedly intercepted 90 per cent of incoming missiles. 

Carney commits Canada to biggest increase in military spending since Second World War, doubling budget by 2035

Lawrence Martin: Carney's inner circle of aging white guys has the experience the Trudeau team lacked

This exchange didn't escalate into a broader regional war, but it could have. Its brevity masked its intensity. More importantly, it exposes two parallel – and increasingly divergent – modes of modern conflict.

The first is rapid, high-volume escalation. The Iran–Israel exchange resembled a “flash war” –short in duration but extreme in demands. Defence required more than just advanced systems; it required volume. Israel's layered defence, from its Iron Dome and David's Sling systems to its Arrow-3 anti-ballistic missiles, performed impressively. But it also required deep stockpiles and industrial resilience. The pace and scale of intercepts raised uncomfortable questions: how long could such a defence be sustained if the barrage had continued for another week? Or a month?

The second type of warfare is the one Iran has relied on for decades: long-term, attritional, and proxy-driven. Houthi drone attacks on shipping in the Red Sea launched from Yemen, rocket fire from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and years of militia activity in Syria and Iraq all represent this slow-burning form of conflict. It doesn't seek rapid escalation but instead applies continuous pressure – stretching logistics, fraying political cohesion, and forcing costly deployments over years, not days. Modern militaries must now contend with both. 

Canada on Wednesday joined 31 other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in committing to the new target: core military spending of 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product and another 1.5 per cent of GDP for infrastructure that is defence-related. As Mr. Carney looks to upgrade Canada's Armed Forces, this duality of modern warfare we recently saw in the Middle East should be instructive. 

What the war in Ukraine began to prove – that attritable systems such as loitering munitions, quadcopters, and off-the-shelf electronic-warfare kits are not auxiliary but essential –the Iran–Israel conflict has now reinforced: even technologically advanced countries are constrained by their ability to produce and replenish at speed.

This means rethinking procurement and production. Exquisite systems like the F-35 or submarines take years, billions, and vertically integrated supply chains. But attritable systems require speed, iteration, and commercial adaptability. These two production models are not interchangeable. They demand different industrial bases, different cultures, and different capital structures.

Canada's defence posture must therefore evolve to accommodate both. We need a force that can deter state-level threats and respond to proxy engagements; one that can deploy the $50-million jet and the $5,000 drone in complementary fashion. 

That means empowering small manufacturers as much as large traditional defence contractors, funding five-week engineering and design sprint cycles alongside five-year acquisition programs, and adjusting military doctrine and strategy to account for both attrition and escalation.

If we fail to adapt, we risk being caught in the middle – too slow to deploy the scalable, too overstretched to modernize expensive equipment and capabilities. But if we succeed, we can combine speed with precision, resilience with sophistication, and field a force ready not just for one kind of war – but for both.

Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to jets that cost $5-million. Jets cost approximately $50-million. This version has been updated.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Microsoft pushes staff to use internal AI tools more, and may consider this in reviews. 'Using AI is no longer optional.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-internal-memo-using-ai-no-longer-optional-github-copilot-2025-6","Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:40:00 GMT","

Microsoft is asking some managers to evaluate employees based on how much they use AI internally, and the software giant is considering adding a metric related to this in its review process, Business Insider has learned.

Julia Liuson, president of the Microsoft division responsible for developer tools such as AI coding service GitHub Copilot, recently sent an email instructing managers to evaluate employee performance based on their use of internal AI tools like this.

""AI is now a fundamental part of how we work,"" Liuson wrote. ""Just like collaboration, data-driven thinking, and effective communication, using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level.""

Liuson told managers that AI ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact.""

Microsoft's performance requirements vary from team to team, and some are considering including a more formal metric about the use of internal AI tools in performance reviews for its next fiscal year, according to a person familiar with the situation. This person asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

These changes are meant to address what Microsoft sees as lagging internal adoption of its Copilot AI services, according to another two people with knowledge of the plans. The company wants to increase usage broadly, but also wants the employees building these products have a better understanding of the tools.

In Liuson's organization, GitHub Copilot is facing increasing competition from AI coding services including Cursor. Microsoft lets employees use some external AI tools that meet certain security requirements. Staff are currently allowed to use coding assistant Replit, for example, one of the people said.

A recent note from Barclays cited data suggesting that Cursor recently surpassed GitHub Copilot in a key part of the developer market.

Competition among coding tools is even becoming a sticking point in Microsoft's renegotiation of its most important partnership with OpenAI. OpenAI is considering acquiring Cursor competitor Windsurf, but Microsoft's current deal with OpenAI would give it access to Windsurf's intellectual property and neither Windsurf nor OpenAI wants that, a person with knowledge of the talks said.

While the Supreme Court limited judges' power to block Trump's executive orders, it left them some options to achieve the same outcomes. 

A fight for another day. 

In a 6-3 decision split along ideological lines, the Supreme Court has ended the practice of universal injunctions. The ruling, which did not address President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, eliminated a tool used by lower federal courts to block the executive branch from implementing unconstitutional laws or policies nationwide.

In the short term, the decision is a win for the Trump administration, which has faced multiple such orders issued by lower courts blocking a range of unprecedented and illegal actions. But the opinion, by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, left room for those courts to use other legal techniques to achieve the same end. And the Supreme Court will continue to be able to block executive actions nationwide with precedent-based rulings. The real-world outcome, therefore, may not be as bad as it appears on the surface.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled the very first ""mega"" images of the cosmos obtained thanks to the extraordinary features and wide-field view of its LSST camera -- the largest in the world. The camera took nearly two decades to build and involved hundreds of scientists across the globe, including a number of CNRS teams. The world-wide First Look unveiling event is held on June 23 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.

The impressive, car-sized Legacy Survey of Space and Time camera is like nothing seen before: thanks to its 3200-megapixel resolution and the wide field of view of the telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory1, the LSST camera can photograph 45 times the area of the full moon in the sky with each exposure. The high-definition images, which use six different colour filters, capture the entire southern night-sky in just three nights of shooting. One year after its journey from the United States to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, the first ""mega"" images will be unveiled on June 23 at a press conference held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. This worldwide premiere is the culmination of 25 years of research and construction by international teams, including several research teams from CNRS2.

The exceptional quality of these initial images show that the telescope is ready to start its mission: to scan the entire southern hemisphere sky by taking 1,000 high-definition photographs using six colour filters, every three nights for the next ten years. Studied end-to-end, these scans will provide a high-definition, four-dimensional film of the evolving processes of the Universe. The ten-year project will also generate unprecedentedly rich and profound views of the southern sky and reveal the faintest and furthest-away objects of the cosmos. For the first time on a large scale, this vast survey will reveal the slightest changes in the Universe, from nearby celestial phenomena, such as asteroids and comets, to very distant ones, like supernovae. The project paves the way for major advances in cosmology in dark matter and dark energy, as well as our understanding of our solar system.

CNRS: a key component of this international project The project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory built the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera. As historic partners, SLAC called on CNRS scientists to help build the focal plane of the camera and help design and build its robotic filter exchange system, which will automatically change the camera's colour filters -- each weighing 24-38 kgs -- 5-15 times per night. By measuring the quantity of light emitted by night-sky objects, and by converging the images taken through the different filters, it will make it possible to precisely determine their position and distance in relation to the Earth. Other CNRS scientists helped develop the computing infrastructure for the quantitative and qualitative data analysis of the gigantic trove of images that will be collected from the 17 billion observable stars and 20 billion observable galaxies. The goal of this painstaking effort is to create the most comprehensive catalogue of data on the universe.

Twenty terabytes of collected data will be stored every night. In France, the France Data Facility (IN2P3) (CNRS) in Lyon will store and process 40% of the collected raw image data. This data will be released to scientists around the world at regular intervals to foster groundbreaking discoveries and breakthroughs over the coming decades.

Why develop a ground-based telescope? Even with 25 space telescopes currently in use, ground-based observation remains essential in documenting the Universe in its entirety. Larger and more sensitive, ground-based instruments produce higher-precision exposures as a result. These instruments also record larger volumes of data than space-based ones, as the remote downloading of data from the latter remains a complex process. Last but not least, ground-based telescopes can also be repaired and improved with increasingly efficient tools. With this state-of-the-art camera, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is the latest addition to the fifty or so structures operating equipment and infrastructure to observe the universe from Earth and space.

While the fate of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket hangs in the balance, the agency is pushing ahead with tests of new components needed to launch the vehicle toward the Moon. The latest test included the firing of a solid booster meant to replace NASA's shuttle-era rocket parts. Although the new booster started off strong, its nozzle appeared to get blown off around two minutes after it began firing its motor.

On Thursday in Utah, Northrop Grumman conducted the first full-scale static fire test of the newly built solid rocket booster. NASA's Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) is the “world's largest and most powerful segmented solid rocket motor,” according to Northrop Grumman. The test lasted for a little over two minutes, burning more than 1.4 million pounds of propellant. Toward the end, however, an unusually bright plume appeared to suddenly burn through parts of the booster, resulting in a large fireball and flying debris. In the video (shown below), the anomaly appears at the 22:15 mark.

“Today's test pushed the boundaries of large solid rocket motor design to meet rigorous performance requirements,” Jim Kalberer, vice president of propulsion systems at Northrop Grumman, said in a statement. “While the motor appeared to perform well through the most harsh environments of the test, we observed an anomaly near the end of the two-plus minute burn.”

The anomaly was likely caused by a faulty nozzle on the booster. “The nozzle liberated energetically from the motor around 10 seconds before the burn ended, and there appeared to be some debris leaving the nozzle just before the main disintegration of the nozzle happened,” NASA Spaceflight reports.

Northrop Grumman developed the new booster under a $3.2 billion contract with NASA. The booster features carbon-fiber composite cases, which are meant to be lighter and stronger than the shuttle-era steel cases currently on SLS. Instead of the SLS booster's current hydraulic thrust vector control steering system, BOLE uses an electronic system. It also uses a different propellant formula that's meant to increase performance by around 10% and adds another five metric tons of payload.

NASA's massive, fully expendable Moon rocket is under heavy scrutiny. The 5.75-million-pound SLS was built using components from NASA's Space Shuttle program, which ran from 1981 to 2011. SLS is outfitted with four RS-25 engines originally built by Aerojet Rocketdyne for the shuttle project. NASA has a total of four contracts with Aerojet Rocketdyne for the RS-25 engines and Northrop Grumman for the boosters, which were also used during the Shuttle era, before the space agency switches to the newly designed BOLE. The new booster is intended for use on SLS beginning with Artemis 9, which is currently scheduled for 2034.

SLS is a capable heavy-lift rocket, but it's ultimately unaffordable. The launch vehicle has already gone $6 billion over budget, with the projected cost of each SLS rocket being $144 million more than anticipated. That would increase the overall cost of a single Artemis launch to at least $4.2 billion, according to a report released in 2024 by the office of NASA's inspector general. In its budget proposal for 2026, the U.S. administration laid out a plan to phase out SLS and its Orion capsule, replacing them with commercial substitutes. To be clear, SLS is not officially dead, but it doesn't look good.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding SLS, NASA carried out another test of the rocket's components last week. On June 20, the agency tested an RS-25 engine at the Fred Haise Test Stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. This was the first hot fire test of the new RS-25 engines, and it lasted around eight and a half minutes or “the same amount of time RS-25 engines fire during a launch of an SLS rocket on Artemis missions to the Moon,” according to NASA.

NASA seems to be making progress with the new designs for its SLS rocket, but it's not clear whether these new parts will get to launch a mission to the Moon.

Ireland goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan, left, collides with United States national team midfielder Rose Lavelle in the first half of Thursday's international women's friendly soccer match in Commerce City, Colo.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Rose Lavelle scored in her first national team match of the year after ankle surgery and the United States defeated Ireland 4-0 on Thursday night.

Avery Patterson, Sam Coffey and Alyssa Thompson also scored for the United States. Lavelle last played for the national team in December against the Netherlands.

Patterson, making her third start for the national team, scored on a header off a short corner from Lavelle in the 18th minute. It was her first international goal.

""It's surreal. I think at halftime someone asked me what was going through my head, and I don't think I fully came down and realized what had happened until two water breaks afterward,"" Patterson laughed. ""I need to watch it again because I kind of blacked out.""

Coffey added a goal before halftime, with a shot that cut across to the far post. It was her third national team goal and second in the last three games.

Lavelle made it 3-0 in the 53rd , scoring handily off a well-placed pass from Ally Sentnor. Thompson ran the ball from the center line, danced around a defender and finished with a blast from atop the box in the 63rd.

""I felt that pressure was coming so I took a touch around her, I've been in that situation a lot of times in this game, and I was like `I need to score this one,'"" Thompson said. ""So I did my usual move and then hit it to the far side.""

Coach Emma Hayes gave her Europe-based players — including Lindsey Heaps, Catarina Macario, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox — time off after their seasons. The exception was defender Naomi Girma, who is working her way back from a calf injury.

Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, who plays for the Seattle Reign, and Lilly Reale, a defender for Gotham, started for the United States in their national team debuts. The youngest player on the squad, 18-year-old Jordyn Bugg, made her debut as a second-half substitute. Six of the 11 starters had less than 10 appearances with the national team.

Lavelle, with 111 appearances on the team, was one of the veterans in the lineup, along with defender Emily Sonnett.

The United States has faced Ireland 16 times and never dropped a match. The Irish have scored just one goal against the United States.

The United States plays Ireland again on Sunday in Cincinnati, Lavelle's hometown. The team plays Canada on July 2 in Washington, D.C.

FORT LAUDERDALE, FL — Will we see a happy Lionel Messi or a vengeful one when he leads Inter Miami against his former team, Paris Saint-Germain, in their FIFA Club World Cup round of 16 match Sunday in Atlanta?

It's been two years since Messi unceremoniously left Paris to join Inter Miami in the twilight of his legendary career, but it's unclear if any residual feelings remain for the Argentine World Cup champion.

Messi's two-year spell at PSG was complicated, particularly upon his return to Paris from the 2022 World Cup triumph – having led Argentina to victory over France in the final. Imagine having to live and work in the same country you just delivered heartbreak to. Fans voiced their displeasure with Messi, who was also suspended by the club in May 2023 for taking an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia the day after a match.

“It's clear that for us it's better if he plays angry, because he's one of those players who, when he has something on his mind, gives an extra effort,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said to ESPN about Messi, after the club's 2-2 draw against Brazilian side Palmeiras that placed them into this knockout match against the reigning UEFA Champions League winners.

Messi was all business and locked in during Friday's training session – two days before he'll take center stage inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium at noon ET in perhaps most enticing matchup in this summer's tournament.

Messi smiled widely in photos he and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, shared on social media from his 38th birthday party this week. Messi's parents, Jorge Messi and Celia Cuccittini, hugging him closely. A massive cake with five No. 10 jerseys for him, his wife, and their sons Thiago, Mateo and Ciro.

Thiago, the oldest at 12, missed out on the celebration. He's with Inter Miami's Under-13 team playing in the MIC Football Punta Cana tournament in the Dominican Republic — the same tournament his father played in with Barcelona when he was 16 in 2003.

Inter Miami is hopeful Messi, who is under contract through the rest of this MLS season, will re-sign for at least next year – when they open their new stadium at Miami Freedom Park. His adoring fans globally are also hopeful he plays with Argentina again in next year's FIFA World Cup, hosted in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But those decisions are for another day.

“I chose to come here. I wanted to come here. And it's a decision we made with time. It wasn't something we decided one day to the next. We are where we want to be. … That makes everything much easier and simpler,” Messi said during his only press conference with Inter Miami in August 2023.

“When I went to Paris, it wasn't something I wanted. I didn't want to leave Barcelona. In some ways, it was one day to the next. I had to adapt to somewhere completely different from where I lived all my life. But that's totally different from my experience here.”

Messi joined his old Barcelona teammate Neymar, and French 2018 World Cup champion Kylian Mbappe at PSG from 2021-23, forming one of the best attacking trios soccer fans could ever dream about playing together.

The group won two French league titles, but couldn't deliver in the Champions League, suffering back-to-back exits in the round of 16. Messi and Neymar left in 2023, and Mbappe left last year to join Real Madrid.

“At the end of the day, Leo wants to win every game like all the great players do,” Messi's longtime teammate Jordi Alba said. “I know the feelings he has towards Barca, where we played together. I was not there with him at PSG, he was there for two years and only he knows what happened.”

The Club World Cup showdown comes weeks after PSG won the Champions League for the first time – dominating Inter Milan 5-0 in the May 31 final – led by a new cast of characters.

Désiré Doué scored twice in the final – the 19-year-old soon be a household name like 17-year-old Barcelona phenom Lamine Yamal. Ousmane Dembélé, one of the frontrunners for this year's Ballon d'Or as the world's best player, had two assists in the Champions League final but hasn't played in the Club World Cup due to a quad injury.

""It will be nice to meet Messi again. We spent two years together. There were many beautiful moments,” PSG defender Achraf Hakimi told reporters after a win against the Seattle Sounders. “But then, on the field, there are no friends. He will try to win and we will also try to win. We will give everything to try to pass to the next round.”

Another storyline: PSG is led by Luis Enrique, who coached Inter Miami's former Barcelona tandem of Messi, Alba, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Mascherano from 2014-17. They won the Champions League in 2015 together.

Alba considered Enrique “the best coach in the world,” while Mascherano considers the Inter Miami-PSG match as a great test and honor against his former coach.

Inter Miami is the biggest underdog of any team in the Club World Cup round of 16: They have +1150 odds to beat PSG, the heavy favorite at -450, according to BETMGM.

It's not entirely out of the realm: PSG did lose 1-0 to Brazilian club Botafogo in the biggest upset at the Club World Cup so far. 

“This is not over for us yet. Beyond the face that we are going to face possibly the best team in Europe – the Champions League champions – we will try to go with the same seriousness and try to play a great game, and see what possibilities we have,” Mascherano said.

“If there is one thing this sport has shown us, in one game anything can happen. And who's to say Sunday is not our day? Sometimes, it happens.”

			British No 1 has struggled to return to heights of 2021 but is determined not to put too much pressure on herself at Wimbledon

Sitting on the ground floor of an Eastbourne art gallery doubling as a makeshift press area, Emma Raducanu is refreshingly honest about a recent change in her outlook.

It is almost four years since she stunned the tennis world by winning the US Open aged just 18 – the first qualifier to do so, and without dropping a set – but she is now focused on the future rather than looking back.

With Wimbledon just a few days away, she acknowledges she has to draw a line under that momentous victory and focus on “consistency over perfection”.

It is an approach that echoes the sentiments of her coach Mark Petchey, who has been encouraging Raducanu to think of 2025 as a new start – and asked people to judge her two years from now, when she will be 24.

“I can't compare every result to winning a grand slam,” she says after contemplating the question on her part-time coach's remarks.

“Once you've reached the top of winning a grand slam and every result you have, you're like, ‘Well, it's not the same level as that'. So it's difficult to get my own head around and bring my expectations of myself a bit down, because I'm like, ‘Well, I've achieved that. Why can't I achieve this?' That's the hardest internal debate that I have in my mind.”

🏆 EMMA RADUCANU IS THE 2021 #USOPEN CHAMPION 🏆THE FIRST BRITISH WOMAN TO WIN A GRAND SLAM SINCE 1977! 👏🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/LXagq9Lcpr

It is undoubtedly a challenge to balance her own expectations – and those of the public – with the realities of her recent form, especially given the extensive injuries that have hampered her progress since that 2021 triumph. Yet she wants to retain the youthful energy seen when she first burst onto the scene and was known for always having a smile on her face on court.

“I want to embody just having a good time and joy,” she says. “I've recently realised that what we do, it's for such a short amount of time and it will go before we know it.

“I was actually listening to Ana Ivanovic say the same thing, she said she wished she had enjoyed it more. I don't want to have any regrets to look back on. I want to bring joy to what I do and enjoy this time, because it's going to go by really fast.”

Raducanu is undoubtedly the highest-profile female tennis player, if not athlete in general, in the country. Fans on the opening day at Queen's were left “outraged” that her impromptu “Boultercanu” doubles partnership with Katie Boulter was scheduled on a smaller court rather than the main Andy Murray Arena and her matches there had notably higher attendances than those before or afterwards, just as in Eastbourne this week.

It is a weight of expectation that will only increase now she has regained her British No 1 ranking for the first time in two years, taking the spot from Boulter.

Given all the external pressure, Raducanu is keen to carve out time away from the sport. Last year, she and fellow British tennis player Francesca Jones visited Oxford University in the days before Wimbledon, and she has recently started an art history course to expand her creativity and knowledge. It is about balance and enjoying life off the court, with visits to cafes and restaurants, allowing Raducanu to appreciate her time on it.

Next on the agenda is Wimbledon, an iconic venue for British tennis players, especially one who grew up in Bromley. It is the venue where she first gained widespread public awareness, delighting the crowd in reaching the fourth round at 18-years-old.

Preparations for this year's home slam have not been straightforward. Raducanu has had to contend with an ongoing back problem that forced her to withdraw from the Berlin Open, not to mention the news that her stalker had been blocked from buying Wimbledon tickets having put his name in the ballot.

Yet she cannot hide her excitement about another chance to play at SW19. “Not much beats the buzz of winning at Wimbledon so I'm really looking forward to it,” she says. “At the same time, you do feel a bit of pressure, you do feel nervous, but in a good way.

“I think if you're able to channel that and use it to focus yourself in the matches, then it is helpful, because sometimes if you're too loose, too relaxed, then you're not as locked in on the court.”

In the first round, Raducanu will take on one of the other 23 home-grown talents in the main draw – the highest number of Britons since 1984 – in 17-year-old Mimi Xu.

When it comes to home expectation, none will be higher than on Raducanu and men's fourth seed and British No 1 Jack Draper, with the pair just over a year apart in age and a history that stretches back into the juniors.

“It's amazing,” she says. “I've known him for so long. We were both pretty promising juniors and now to be British No 1 on both men's and women's side in the real thing, it's pretty cool.”

Team Principals Toto Wolff, Jonathan Wheatley and Laurent Mekies face the press ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix weekend.

TEAM REPRESENTATIVES Toto WOLFF (Mercedes), Jonathan WHEATLEY (Kick Sauber), Laurent MEKIES (Racing Bulls)

Q: Why don't we start with the man whose car was fastest in FP1. So, Toto, it's early days here in Austria, but how confident are you of a repeat of last time out in Montreal?

Toto WOLFF: Good afternoon, everybody. We start with a civilised question. Never confident. You know, this track hasn't treated us very well in the past. Rough asphalt is not where our car has the sweet spot. And yeah, we've been fastest today with George, but it's also low on temperatures with the cloud cover. So, we need to really keep feet on the ground, see what happens if it's getting hotter, and that's the forecast for tomorrow and after tomorrow, and see whether we can maintain those levels of performance. But definitely, I wouldn't extrapolate from FP1 that we're going to drive home in the sunset and collect some trophies.

Q: Let's talk drivers now. We'll start with Kimi. How do you think his podium in Canada will help him going forward? He said yesterday that now is the time to make a step. Do you agree with him?

TW: Most important is that the development trajectory continues to be positive. I think when we look at last year, it wasn't our most intelligent call to put him in the car in Monza, give him all the pressure, and then obviously with the incident, that's something that's in the back of your mind. And I think with the podium now, you can shake that off and say, “I've proven that I can be fast.” And also, throughout the year, we gave him lots of space to explore, to develop, to under-hit, or also push hard when he felt confident in the car. And in that respect, I think that is what you can expect from a driver that can be a champion one day.

Q: What about George Russell then? Five podiums so far this year, including the win. What else has he got to do to get this contract for '26?

TW: Nothing. He has been part of our program since ten years or so. He's always performed to the expectations that we have set, and he's continuing to do so. We haven't given him a car to win a world championship in the last three years, so that's completely on us. And the times the car has been good, he has been winning races. And you can see today, he's always there. You know that when he's getting in the car, he's going to extract what is in the car. Having said that, for whatever reason, in early summer, those kinds of contract discussions start to end up being accelerated in the media or accelerated because of a lack of information. What I have been doing the last 30 years in a normal business, contract discussions are not being held as town halls. So, everything is normal. Everything goes to plan.

Q: Is he top of your list for next year?

TW: Well, he needs to be top of the list because he's a race winner with us. He's a Mercedes junior. He's been with the team for a long time.

Q: So, when he says, as he did yesterday, that discussions with Max Verstappen are delaying things, would you expect him to be talking to other teams as well?

TW: Again, we are going into territory that I don't want to discuss out here. But people talk, people explore, and most important is that in our organisation, we are transparent. But it doesn't change a millimetre of my opinion of George, his abilities, or anything else.

Q: Okay. Toto, thank you for that. Jonathan, let's come to you now. Two points finishes in the last two races on very different racetracks. Just what has been the most pleasing aspect for you of those performances?

Jonathan WHEATLEY: I think it's a total team performance. What's encouraging is that the work that Mattia started nearly a year ago now is starting to bear fruit. The tools are starting to correlate with each other. The pieces we're putting on the car so far seem to have been going in the right direction. The drivers have more confidence. We understand C45 better than we did five, ten races ago. And there's a momentum building in the team, and it's a great energy.

Q: New parts this weekend, I believe, some floor edges, rear wing, things like that. What is the data telling you after FP1?

JW: It is a little too soon to say. We need to look at the data, we need to analyse it. It was an interesting session in terms of the way the temperature changed throughout, I think as Toto just talked about there. So, you know, the long runs were carried out. I don't think it will be like that on Sunday. So we've got a little bit more to analyse, but certainly at the moment, the feeling's positive.

Q: As I did with Toto, can we talk about drivers now? Let's start with Nico Hülkenberg. He's been bringing home the points. What has impressed you the most about him so far this year?

JW: Well, you know, I've watched his career for a long time now. Working with him has been a pleasure, I have to say. Professionalism, the way he approaches a Grand Prix weekend, he's measured. He's the whole package as far as I can see. He's clearly enjoying the upgrades on the car. He's enjoying his time at Sauber at the moment, and he's delivering. Canada wasn't a circuit that we expected to perform that well on, yet we were able to deliver with both drivers a really solid performance and, as you said, points two races in a row.

Q: How far away is Gabi from Nico?

JW: Well, it's interesting to listen to Toto's comments about Kimi. Each one of these milestones, be that points, podiums, whatever, I've seen it so many times with drivers gaining in confidence. Gabi is so close. The confidence is building. Today, again, another really clean performance, really good feedback through the engineers through P1. He's learning, developing. Really, really pleased with his progress.

Q: Okay. Thank you for that. Should be more questions for you later. Laurent, let's come on to you now. After three consecutive points finishes, Canada was a bit disappointing for the team. What have you learned since then about the problem in Canada? And how confident are you of getting back in the points this weekend?

Laurent MEKIES: It's fair to say we were probably missing a tenth or two compared to our ultimate performance in Canada. And that's the difference between being happy at the top of the midfield and getting the points and feeling quite far away from them. I think it's a good reflection of how incredibly tight the midfield is now. We know that if we nail every aspect of the race weekend, we can be on top of that group, which is basically everyone behind the top four teams. So, it's 12 cars fighting for that spot. As soon as you don't get everything perfect, you move back. And yes, we would probably do quite a few things differently if we were going back to Canada. Isack still had a great quali there, the fourth Q3 in a row. But it's fair to say that in terms of race pace, we were missing something. So lots of learning. If I look back at all the steps forward we have been making in the last twelve months, they have all been starting from difficult moments, difficult races, difficult qualis, difficult updates. And it is in this sort of moment that you make a step forward. So obviously, this weekend is a completely different equation, but we are hopeful that we'll be back in the fight.

Q: You mentioned Isack in qualifying. He's nailing Saturdays this year, isn't he? He was the least experienced of the rookies in terms of F1 testing coming into this season. Just how do you assess his progress so far this year?

LM: I think the starting point for Isack has been sensational. Nothing less than that. He came to us in January. He had done one day of testing in his life in Formula 1. And then we did one wet day of testing, and then here we are. Let's go to Bahrain and let's go to Melbourne. If you look at the natural speed, how quickly he blended with the engineers, with all the team members, with the whole Formula 1 crews, and all the pressure that comes with it, it's just something that none of us were expecting him to be at that level. Now we believe, as Toto and Jonathan said, we strongly believe in driver development. So regardless of how incredible his starting point is, we expect him to grow. We expect him to develop. He has already developed a lot from January, and it's our responsibility to make sure we create the environment around him so that he can make these steps as often as possible and be as strong as possible.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) It's a question to all three of you. I know we're in the final phases of trying to wrap up the last bits of changes to the 2026 rules. We're starting to hear some more concerned remarks again from drivers who have tried the car in the sim and don't find it particularly enjoyable at the moment. Where are you at with that? Have your drivers tried the '26 car in the sim? What was their feedback? And how important do you think it is that the drivers do end up enjoying this new formula rather than the concerns that they're speaking about at the moment?

TW: Yeah. I think the fans need to enjoy watching Formula 1, and Formula 1 needs to stay true to itself that it's a high-performance sport. Best man and best machine wins. So, this is what we need to deliver: good racing. Some cars have been good fun for the drivers to drive. Some tyres have been good fun, others not. So, in a way, everybody will get used to it. Looking at simulations of today, it's very difficult to exactly know how it's going to be next year. It's a super challenging new regulation in making those energy levels last throughout the lap on some of the tracks clearly at the moment it's still challenging. But the pace of innovation is huge, and it's always been the case in Formula 1. I believe that we are on the right trajectory. At the moment, yes, driving these cars, there will be outliers of tracks that are clearly very, very different to what it is today. But you ask a driver for a good car, give him the strongest, grippiest, less degrading tyres, 1000 horsepower, naturally aspirated V12, and that's what they're going love. We're just in a different era now.

JW: Hard to add much more than Toto said, to be honest. What I would say is it's important we put on a show. I think all of these concerns were raised at the start of this set of technical regulations, and the energy management was a big story back then as well. But then look where we are now with the closest championship in the history of the sport, I think. So, we have to look at the journey through this new set of technical regulations, and we have to make sure that at all times, we've got the best interests of the sport at heart.
LM: Our drivers haven't tried yet, so I hope they're not complaining already. No, seriously, I think it's a bit early to be pessimistic. The challenge is huge, probably the biggest for the teams. I'm sure the teams will need their drivers to help them develop in the right direction to help them grasp these regulations. The guys will be jumping into that competitiveness, into that war of competitiveness, and I'm sure it will take precedence over whatever they feel when driving the car.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Question for Toto. What do you remember about the times when you were a driving instructor here at Spielberg and now living on a farm nearby? Any farming experience?

TW: Well, you know, I had this moment in 2014 where we won the race here, and I drove the car back to Vienna. And I had to pinch myself because 20 years prior, I could barely make a living. I was working here for a racing school, and I was living in the farmhouse. There were lovely people, an egg and bread in the morning, a glass of milk. And then I was teaching people to drive Formula Ford cars around the old Österreichring here. The highlight of the day was shaking those cars down in the evening and making them ready for the next day. If you would have told me back in the day what would happen 20 years later, I would have been disappointed because I thought I was going to win championships driving these cars, not in running the team. But everything happens for a reason. It was a very, very tough part of my life, but I was still doing what I love the most, and that was racing cars.

Q: (Ian Parkes – Racing News 365) Question for you, Toto. I hear your comment earlier about Max and George. But just getting onto George's comments about the discussions with Max, he has now put it out there in the public domain, whether you like it or not. Max was here yesterday in this forum in the press conference, he turned around and refused to nail his colours to the Red Bull mast for 2026. So, can you confirm: are discussions ongoing with Max, or have they taken place? Is he under serious consideration for a race seat with Mercedes for 2026?

TW: Ian, whether I like it or not, I like what George says, and I'm always supportive of the driver. There's no such thing as saying things I wouldn't want him to say. I think we are very transparent in the team for what we do, what we plan, and we've been like that since I was put in charge. So that's not the issue. At the moment, clearly, you need to explore what's happening in the future, but it doesn't change anything of what I said before about George or about Kimi, about the line-up that I'm extremely happy to have.

Q: (Adam Cooper – Adam Copper F1) Question for Toto. How frustrating were the Red Bull protests in Canada, especially coming soon after Miami? And do you think to avoid frivolous protests, the fee should be 20, 30, 40,000 – something that would make people think and put a dent in the cost cap? Maybe the other guys can answer the second part as well.

TW: Well, I think it's absolutely legitimate to protest. We are fighting for race wins and championships. And if you have the opinion that what you've seen is not right, then you should protest. But some of these actions are just really not real. You know, protesting something that you call unsportsmanlike behaviour, a long shot, or you're protesting a car not leaving ten car lengths between himself and the Safety Car – well, he still needs to respect the delta. So, there are things that, from my perspective, are legit to protest and others that are just a little bit of a too long shot. And then you're waiting two hours until you actually protest because you need to figure out on what to base it. You take one protest back suddenly, and then we're all there five hours. Everybody misses planes going home, and we end up with a result that was a little bit predictable. That's something that I thought was not necessary. Coming back to your question on higher fines, no one is a fan of higher fines. It's a lot of money, and in Formula 1 we need to be careful that we are still being perceived as not over the top in relation to the normal world. But in that instance, absolutely put in a fine, and I think the President of the FIA is working on that. Put in a fine that, at least if you lose it, is a little bit of an embarrassment that you lost so much money, and you're going to think twice whether you do it. I think this is along the lines the FIA are thinking.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Question for Toto. I'm just going back to George, Toto. Is there any way in which George and Max could drive together at Mercedes? Is that an option at all or not given their history? And secondly, in your eyes, is making George wait for his contract actually helping improve his performance?

TW: Well, I can imagine every lineup. I had Rosberg and Hamilton fighting for a world championship, so everything else afterwards is easy. There's pros and cons of having two drivers fighting each other hard. We've seen examples where that functioned and other examples where it didn't. When it comes to the contract situation, our sport is pressure, constant pressure. Whether you're in the car, outside of the car, you just need to cope with that, and George knows that, like any other driver knows it. I feel that when you're being put in a comfort zone, sometimes that is actually more detrimental to performance than having a certain pressure point in the system.

Q: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it). Question for Jonathan Wheatley. Considering how many upgrades have you introduced since the start of the season, why does it make sense for the team to develop this year's car considering your position in the standings and what's coming for next year?

JW: I think there's everything to play for. This championship isn't over. We haven't given up on it. We're not here to mess around and just make up the numbers. We're ambitious, and we've got targets we want to hit. We don't feel at the moment it's making any impact – well, Mattia tells me it's not making any impact – on our 2026 car. Mattia and the team back at the factory, there's an energy about the progressive development of the car and going in the right steps. I'm not saying it's going to keep going until Abu Dhabi, but at the moment, it's encouraging.

Q: (Diletta Colombo – Automoto.it) A question for Toto. You mentioned before Kimi's podium in Canada being a relief from the stress of delivering a good result. But with that comes an increased interest, especially in his native Italy. How do you manage to protect him from the outside noise?

TW: That is a really important question because Italy has been starved of drivers that are in race or championship-winning cars. So, the enthusiasm is huge. Top media outlets writing headlines that Kimi is a legend aren't helpful, because in a country so passionate, lifting an 18-year-old to the status of legend after a podium is dangerous. It's dangerous in that respect that we need to increasingly shield him from everybody wanting something from him. It starts in a trivial environment with lots of fans wanting selfies, and it's great – better this than the other way around. There have been many people that were involved in his racing career which expect something back. I believe that a young driver of 18, when there is too much pressure from every side, it can harm his development. There's enough pressure being in the car, having George Russell as your teammate, driving a Mercedes car that can win races. If everything around it starts to continue to put pressure on him, I think it's something we really need to protect him from. And that's what we are trying.

Q: (Ludo van Denderen – GPBlog.com) Toto, I was wondering what is the deadline for you for Max to let you know if he's going come to Mercedes? And if he says yes, is it then Antonelli or Russell that's the number one to go further?

TW: Well, you make it sound like we have been asking when do you want to join and here are the terms. That's not how it is and how it works. I come back to my previous answer. I just want to have the conversations behind closed doors, not town halls. We have two drivers that have been in our program since a long time, drivers that I'm perfectly happy to have, drivers that will do great in the future of the team. So it's a bit different, the situation.

Q: (Nigel Chiu – Sky Sports) Question for Toto. Earlier this year, Toto, you said, I think it was in March, that you were not going to flirt with the idea of signing Max. Has something changed in the last few months either from your side or Red Bull's side?

TW: Define flirting. No, nothing's changed. There is no ‘flirt' in that sense. Depends how you act. You can flirt, or you have conversations.

Q: (Shanna Lutgert – F1Maximaal.nl). Now I have a question for Jonathan. Can I just get your thoughts on Toto's comments about the Red Bull protest, and how you are looking back at it as a former Red Bull sporting director?

JW: I think I'm just looking at the situation. I'm not looking at the teams involved. I know that teams agonise over protests, but it's so important that teams have a right to do that. I think if you take away that right or make it too prohibitive, you'll end up with more problems. I like the transparency. I like the conversation that's going on around it at the moment. I know people are talking about the amount of the fine and the amount of the protest fee and what have you. But in Formula 1, that would have to be quite significant. I think it's a healthy conversation going on about it at the moment.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Another one for Toto. You've been through some of these sliding doors moments with drivers in the past when you decided between Valtteri and Esteban and Valtteri and George in previous years. Does this year feel similar at all, or is it a bit different given where the team is now and the fact you've got two drivers already very well established?

TW: You know, it is in the nature of the sport that you talk about people, whether they're in the car, in the factory, or at the racetrack. Most important is to stay true to your values. For me, that is having integrity and being humble about the situation, respectful of the people, and that's what I and what we are trying to do in the team. But as you say, yes, I've been in situations like this before. Also, before I was doing Formula 1. Some of the conversations are more difficult than others.

Q: (Martin Moravec – DPA) A question to Jonathan, please. Since you know Sebastian Vettel very well, he's in talks with Helmut Marko about a possible future advisory role at Red Bull. Do you think such a role could suit him?

JW: Well, I think first of all trying to replace Helmut is quite a challenge in itself. I can't quite imagine how any one individual could do that. I haven't seen Sebastian for a while. He's a seriously impressive person, as you all know. I believe the conversations have been confirmed between the two parties, but whether that comes to anything, I don't know. But I'm hoping I see Helmut in that role for a much, much longer period of time.

Lando Norris and McLaren topped Friday practice in Austria, but are they favourites for the rest of the weekend? Or will one of their rivals step forward?

The sound of 20 Formula 1 cars once again reverberated around the Styrian hills on Friday as practice for the Austrian Grand Prix got under way. George Russell clinched victory last year, after Max Verstappen and Lando Norris collided when fighting for the lead, but is the Mercedes racer on course to repeat the feat and back up his Canada win last time out – or are championship leaders McLaren back on song?

The Mercedes of Russell set the pace in morning practice at Spielberg, but as the day progressed, it was McLaren who emerged as the ones to beat with both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri looking quick around the Red Bull Ring.

The British team brought more upgrades to Austria, including revised shrouds that suit the new front wing that was introduced but not raced in Canada. Norris stuck with the revised geometry – also introduced in Canada – with Piastri sticking with the older spec as it's a set-up option and he prefers it.

A bill realizing Gov. Gavin Newsom's ambitions to enlarge the state's cap on its incentives program from $330 million a year easily passed the state Assembly and Senate.



		By Katie Kilkenny, Winston Cho 

	June 27, 2025 1:17pm	




	California Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to woo Hollywood productions back to their cultural home got the green light on Friday, with a budget bill that significantly auguments the state's entertainment tax credit program passing both houses in the state's legislature.


	The bill realized Newsom's ambitions to increase the cap on California's film and television tax incentives from $330 million to $750 million a year, making the state the most generous outside of New York and Georgia, whose program is uncapped. Though Newsom's proposal, first announced in the fall of 2024, was initially met with skepticism, it grew in popularity, with the State Assembly voting for the increase 64 to one and the Senate voting 31 to three.

					Hollywood South? Texas Makes Its Bid With Major Film Incentive Expansion		
			









	The Entertainment Union Coalition, whose members were among the most active lobbyists in favor of the legislation in Sacramento, said on Friday that the decision “underscores just how vital our industry is to the economic health of our state, and the power of our members' voices.” 




			Related Video		







	The group also called on the studios to take advantage of the increased incentives program, saying it was time for major firms to “recommit to the communities and workers across the state that built this industry and built their companies.”


	Hollywood production advocates aren't breathing a sigh of relief yet, though: They are currently racing to implement programmatic changes to the tax credit program — which would bump the base credit to 35 percent — before a July 7 deadline. That's the date when the latest application window for productions seeking California tax credits closes.

	











	Other changes the legislation will realize include expanding the category of productions that qualify to include shorter TV shows, sitcoms, animated titles and “large-scale competition” shows, excluding reality, documentary programming and game or talk shows. It also ends a requirement for a separate incentive for the construction of soundstages requiring the recipient to own more than half of the stages or enter into a lease of at least 10 years.


	If passed, the legislation would bring the most significant changes to the program since its inception in 2009. The state has steadily been losing production as other regions beef up their incentive programs for the entertainment industry. One example: Earlier this month, Texas passed a law that increases by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years. 


	With the funding approved through 2035, the expansion will shower as much as $1.5 billion in subsidies to Hollywood over the next decade. Currently, California is the only major production hub that bars any portion of above-the-line costs, like salaries for actors, directors and producers from qualifying for incentives.


	The three-month period from January to March saw losses in every category of production compared to the same period last year, according to the latest report from FilmLA, the nonprofit group that handles film permits for the city and county. Shooting in L.A. decreased over 22 percent over that span.


	“The program not only pays for itself but generates economic activity,” said Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to Newsom, at the UCLA Entertainment Symposium on Friday. “It's a good deal for taxpayers.”

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: When you have directed three of the four all-time top global grossing films as has James Cameron, you take his vow to try and stay on budget with a wink and a nod, because his cutting edge films always push the envelope and never miss. But there is one promise Cameron made on a movie that you can take to heart.


	That was the deathbed vow he made to one of the last survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb blasts, to direct a film based on the upcoming Charles Pellegrino book Ghosts of Hiroshima. The book comes August 5 from Blackstone Publishing and The Story Factory, timed to the 80th anniversary of the moment the world entered the perilous nuclear age. Martin Sheen just signed up to narrate the audiobook.

	











	Here, Cameron explains his passion for a dark project he'll balance with his continuing Avatar franchise. That has resulted in two billion-dollar grossing entries, and which he says he will continue until the audience tells him they've had enough of the blue folks from Pandora. “We drop the next one December 19th, and we'll take it from there,” Cameron tells Deadline. “I've got the scripts and we've done preliminary designs on four and five and we're ready to roll into it. But audiences tastes shift, and maybe the movie won't exactly be what they want it to be. Who knows? We'll find out. We always find out the hard way.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cinematic interest in the atomic and nuclear age has also been sky high as evidenced by the Christopher Nolan-directed Oppenheimer, which grossed $975 million and won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Nolan and Best Actor prizes for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Ghosts of Hiroshima tells the story from those on the business end of the unimaginably destructive blasts that turned Japan into a hell-scape and killed over 250,000, much more over time as the radiation ravaged the bodies of survivors. That's the story Cameron has promised to tell. Here, he explains why.

	











DEADLINE: Ghosts of Hiroshima is the first book I've read in awhile where you had to put it down here and there to absorb the enormity of what author Charles Pellegrino happened to those unfortunate enough to be within the blast radius. Like the observation that those wandering around and trying to come to grips to what they'd just been through were likely breathing in the vaporized remains of their neighbors. Or radiation manifesting itself by turning some colors the author can only try to describe based on testimony from survivors. You created an indelible image in 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day of a normal day in a playground, wiped out by a nuclear blast. That was a dream sequence, but the images you have at your disposal when you make this movie are truly the stuff of nightmares.


JAMES CAMERON: That was Linda Hamilton's character Sarah Connor at the playground, watching the bomb flash and the blast effects. I had made myself a bit of a lay expert on thermonuclear weapons. I'd become fascinated by it since high school when I read the John Hersey book Hiroshima. It was a slight book where he literally just reports what he saw and what was seen by those he interviewed. I don't quite remember how he got there to do that, but it was about the only thing you could find on Hiroshima at the time. It just left such a deep impression on me as a kid, and from there I started to study the nuclear weapons. How do they work? What do they do? I really understood that you've got a blast effect and you've got a flash effect and you've got a prompt radiation effect. And then you've got obviously the fallout, the residual radiation that lingers for years. The half-life of the various nucleotide particles.


	But they didn't know any of that, when it happened. Even medical authorities and top engineering people in Japan, they didn't know what they'd been hit with. They didn't know how to triage people, medically, and they were completely overwhelmed. I made a decision around this. Charlie's book explores a subject with tendrils that run in all directions and he sometimes finds the most amazing connections throughout society and throughout history. I want to keep it very focused on the day of the two bombs and the immediate aftermath. It's two bombs,  multiple witnesses and survivors.


DEADLINE: Pellegrino does get into the brutality of the Japanese forces. The treatment of neighboring Chinese, the beheading of American POWs…


CAMERON: I don't want to get into the politics of, should it have been dropped, should they have done it, and all the bad things Japan did to warrant it, or any of that kind of moralizing and politicizing. I just want to deal in a sense with what happened, almost as if you could somehow be there and survive and see it.


DEADLINE: Why?


CAMERON: Because I just think it's so important right now for people to remember what these weapons do. This is the only case where they've been used against a human target. Setting aside all the politics and the fact that I'm going to make a film about Japanese people…I don't even speak Japanese, although I have a lot of friends there. I've been there a million times, and I may need to work with a Japanese writer, a Japanese producer, so that I am not a complete outsider to their cultural perspective. I want to keep it as a kind of neutral witness to an event that actually happened to human beings, so that we can keep that flame alive, that memory. They've only died in vain if we forget what that was like and we incur that a thousand fold upon ourselves and future generations.

	











DEADLINE: You and Pellegrino are photographed with Tsutomo Yamaguchi on his deathbed just before he passed away at nearly a century old. He survived both blasts…


CAMERON: He was in his mid-90s when he died, within a week of our visit. He was dying of stomach cancer. The vast majority of the survivors died of cancer, the long-term legacy of the radiation exposure. But he made it to his mid-nineties. He is probably the most improbable statistic in history, having survived two nuclear bomb explosions at close range. He was flash burned and had blast effects and was injured in both of them, and he survived the radiation effects. Charlie was able to track him down with the help of some investigators in Japan and some people who worked to commemorate the survivors in Japan. He was able to track down a number of still living survivors and interview them, starting about 15 or 20 years ago. So he has a unique kind of treasure trove of living history, of personal accounts that he weaves together in this book and in his precursor book that I bought many years ago. I've had my eye on doing this project for a very long time.


DEADLINE: It must be difficult for you to make plans…


CAMERON: Avatar has taken over my life as a filmmaker and I'm now starting to dig my way through that and figure out a future that embraces not only completing the Avatar saga, but also being able to do some of these other projects that are near and dear to me.


DEADLINE: When you were at Yamaguchi's bedside, how emotional was that for you?


CAMERON: In that picture is my good friend Charlie Pellegrino, and a painting Yamaguchi gifted me. He became an artist later in life and it's something I hold dear. I think he had been led to believe that we were already basically making this film, and it moved him to essentially bless us with the task of continuing to tell the story. He wasn't a literary guy, even though he became an artist later. He was an engineer by training.


	But they kept their heads down, the survivors, the Hibakusha as they were called. There was almost a shame associated with Japan's defeat and the abdication of the emperor, and the nuclear weapons were pivotal in that. People didn't tell for years and years afterwards that they were survivors. To be a double survivor? Well, these guys didn't put their hand up. They weren't famous in Japan. It took a lot of investigation to find them.


	 Only later on when did he realize that he had a box he could stand on to get people's attention. He traveled often at his own expense all over the world to say one simple thing. He wasn't a great orator but he would speak and his message was very simple. He said, I was bombed twice by nuclear weapons and I survived. Maybe I survived for a reason, to do this. I'm able to forgive the people that dropped those bombs. And I'm able to forgive it happening to me and to my family and to my city and to my nation. If I can forgive that, you can forgive anything. Peace starts with forgiveness, with breaking the cycle of outrage and grief, and setting aside blame and moving forward to be peaceful humans and look at what's going on around us


DEADLINE: The 80th anniversary is fast approaching, and the whole world is on pins and needles with the U.S. and Israel attacking Iran to destroy its progress toward being able to launch a nuclear bomb…


CAMERON: Right now, look at the lingering enmity that's gone on for half a century between Israel and Palestine. Look at the enmity that's gone on between the US and Iran over time. Look at what's happening in the world with Russia. The doomsday clock just keeps ticking closer and closer and closer to midnight. Nuclear war is not on our display screen right now, it's not on our dashboard. We tend to not be able to grasp it, we tend to be in denial about it. I want to make a film that just reminds people what these weapons do to people, and how absolutely unacceptable it is to even contemplate using them. I think Trump is the first president who has bandied around the idea of, ‘My button's bigger than your button.' That's something he says to Kim Jong Un. I'm like, what? Are you nuts?

	











	You can't say that! You can't say that. There's been this delicate equipoise between Russia and the US for the majority of the Cold War, even though the number of weapons has come down a lot from its peak in the eighties. The instability factor around there being multiple players now…it's not just two monoliths in opposition that could talk to each other, study each other and live in that equipoise of mutual assured destruction. We've got rogue states; you've got Korea, you've got Iran coming up. I want to get down that rabbit hole. I do think it's going to take the outrage of the citizens of the world to get the attention of their governments, to do what's necessary to deescalate wherever possible, and not escalate. And not say, my dick's bigger than your dick. You know what I mean? Not do all the stupid human chimp tricks that we do.


DEADLINE: That is a tall order for a narrative film…


CAMERON: You're dealing with something that's on a whole other level. Look, this may be a movie that I make that makes the least of any movie I've ever made, because I'm not going to be sparing, I'm not going to be circumspect. I want to do for what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what Steven Spielberg did with the Holocaust and D-Day with Saving Private Ryan. He showed it the way it happened. He and I talked about this, and he shared this with me. When he was making that film, notwithstanding whatever the studio wanted from it, he said, I'm going to make it as intense as I can make it, because my limitation as any filmmaker — and he's the best out there — is that I can't make it as intense as it really was. That was an object lesson. You've got to use everything at your cinematic disposal to show people what happened. We all love our horror movies, and horror movies love to outdo each other. This is true horror, because it happened.


DEADLINE: You said you are determined to make an uncompromising movie. In Titanic, you showed exactly the horrific way that unsinkable ship went down…


CAMERON: Technology horror, but there was always a majesty, a majestic quality to the tragedy of that event. We sort of look at it through that lens. I'll try to find those points of human connection that give it some poetry and in a crazy way, even some beauty.


DEADLINE: Beauty?


CAMERON: Within the bomb events, there was some beauty about the human experience, about us all sharing the same planet. We're all sharing the same human experience. The individual's experiences vary, but there are certain things we have in common. We all want love. We all breathe the air. We all need something to eat. There's certain things that are absolutely universal human experiences. As filmmakers, that's the only qualification ultimately I think that we need. Charlie Pellegrino is a detail guy, and I've got all the detail I need here.


	I'll have him there as an advisor. As I get into the production on the film, I'll be dealing with true experts on the Japanese side, the families of some of the survivors that Charlie has interviewed, because the survivors themselves are all gone now. That chapter of living history has closed. I'll try to be accurate and again, utterly apolitical. I want to follow these two disparate events that happen three days apart. What do they have in common? Both involved nuclear weapons launched against human targets. There's this guy who was there for both explosions, who rigged the altimeter on the two bombs and had to be in both planes. I think it's interesting to follow his story as well because he went through an evolution as well. His name was Jacob Beser, an engineer from Los Alamos who actually rigged the altimeter that armed and detonated the weapons. He was on both flights. So there's a slightly American perspective on this as well. Once again, I'm not going to politicize it. He was just there to do a job, but he was a witness and these other people were witnesses. I don't want to do a follow 50 stories; I want to follow a few handful of stories that you can invest in.

	











DEADLINE: When Robert Oppenheimer met with President Truman, the president who authorized dropping the bombs Oppenheimer created greeted his misgivings with a callous attitude that amounted to, “man up.” Oppenheimer had all these misgivings and guilt about what he had been wrought. You mention Beser being there to ensure both bombs detonated. Was he wracked with that guilt, flying away from that unprecedented destruction?


CAMERON: I think he was. But if you read the book — and I just throw in a quick plug here that the book's going to drop August 5, which is the 80th anniversary in the US – I think some people will get their backs all up and they're going to say, hey, what about all the Japanese atrocities in the prison camps and in Nanking, and all that stuff? But that's not what the book's about.


	The book puts you there a kind of a time window. Charlie has reconstructed the event. I think everybody should read it, whether you're American, European, whatever. And I strongly believe in the importance of it. If there are other books out there on the subject, people should read those as well. But this one I think is kind of unique. It's a 15-year journey for Charlie, taking everything that he learned, even from writing an earlier book on the subject, and putting it together and making it a very, very human telling of a very complex event.


DEADLINE: You grounded the technical sinking of the Titanic with a fictional love story between Kate Winslet's Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack characters. Is there a requirement, because there is quite a story in Kenshi Hirano, a newlywed who has a premonition from his wife of 10 days to take cover. When he returns to their Hiroshima home, he finds only fragments of her bones and feels duty bound to carry them to her parents. So he boards a train to Nagasaki to be walloped by the second A-bomb.  


CAMERON: And becomes another survivor of double blasts. He finds her still hot bones, they were newlyweds. I don't know how much of that story I'm going to tell, but I definitely want to tell that story. Her parents had given them a ceramic bowl, which somehow survived, and he picked up her still warm bones from the burned ruins of their house. These neighborhoods were just obliterated and I don't even know how he found his house. He goes to an aid station, gets his injuries patched up, and he gets on a train to take the bowl with his wife's remains to her parents in Nagasaki, just in time for the second blast. I want to tell that story. I want to go on his journey, what that must have meant to him and the loss that he was already feeling. There are things that are so touching and so heart wrenching about the way Charlie frames it.


	Charlie's met with real headwinds in the past around acceptance of some of his writing on this subject. There are so many negative forces, mostly in the U.S., trying to dismantle this same way that the people are trying to dismantle memory of the Holocaust and other bits of history.


	If we're not going to be living in a 1984 world where the past can be vaporized, we've got to fight this stuff. And so I've been a strong ally for Charlie over the last 15 years since he's been met with this. He's just a humble guy trying to seek the truth. We knew there'd be pushback because people either ignore the idea or they fight back against the idea that these weapons were used and what they did. If you're a reader, and you want to know what happened, this is your book. It's not a political book. It's historical obviously, but it's not political. It doesn't try to find the place in history for what Hiroshima and Nagasaki were. It just says, guys, this is what happened.

	











DEADLINE: You say this could be your lowest-grossing film because of the subject matter. How surprised were you that Christopher Nolan's movie Oppenheimer grossed almost $1 billion and won seven Oscars? Clearly people are interested in that whole splitting of the atom.


CAMERON: Yeah…it's interesting what he stayed away from. Look, I love the filmmaking, but I did feel that it was a bit of a moral cop out.


	Because it's not like Oppenheimer didn't know the effects. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see — and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film – but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I'm just stupid that way.


DEADLINE: Nolan answered that criticism by basically saying, “I hope somebody tells that story, but to me, this wasn't that story.” It might take another heavyweight like James Cameron to do that…


CAMERON: Okay, I'll put up my hand. I'll do it, Chris. No problem. You come to my premiere and say nice things…I can't tell you today what's going to be in the movie. I've been making notes for 15 years and I haven't written a word of the script yet because there's a point where it's all there and then you start to write. That's how I always work. I explore around, I remember the things that impact me. I start to assemble 'em into a narrative. And then there's a moment where you're ready to write. And I'm not in that head space right now.


DEADLINE: The imagery of the carnage is unforgettable. People who turned exotic colors as radiation ravaged their bodies; what the sky looked like after the bombs blew up. One victim whose fingers fused together.


CAMERON: Those were people who survived initially. They didn't know that they were about to die within a few days from radiation effects. They were flash burnt, they were blinded by grievous injuries. You wonder what could possibly be beautiful about that, and it is the fact that they helped each other. That was their first impulse, even though they were wounded; to help other people. It was just…everybody wasn't fighting for themselves. They were trying to help each other. You take the human animal and reduce it down to almost the most primal survival moment…those people cared more about other people than about themselves. I think that that's an amazing thing, if I could capture that.


DEADLINE: The chaos is almost unimaginable…


CAMERON: It was just too overwhelming. When these people flooded into what was left of the hospitals, they promptly set up aid stations, but they had no pain relievers. They had nothing left, and they also didn't know what they were treating. How much hell can an audience absorb and go on to absorb more? I think you've got to do it in glimpses, and you've got to contextualize it with people that you care about. There are a lot of challenges in telling this story. You can say, be uncompromising, but I don't want to be so uncompromising that people walk out of the theater after 15 minutes. You've got to maintain a narrative flow that keeps it in a context. But like I said, I'm following Steven's lead, which is to show what happened.


DEADLINE: There you are, by the bedside of the survivor Yamaguchi. And then he dies. Why do I feel you might've made some promise to him about this movie that has steeled your resolve here?












CAMERON: You're absolutely right. I think Charlie and I both felt in that moment that we were being challenged to accept a duty, to take a baton. I don't think I went there with that in mind, although I did go there to pay my respects, thank him for the work that he had done, and tell him that we were planning to make a film about all this. He knew who I was as a filmmaker, but it became personal, I think, and that stayed with me since that meeting. Somehow, I have to make this happen. I don't see it as a massively budgeted film. I don't think it'll be one that'll be quick to make, but I don't see it as a massively budgeted film. It will have to involve some VFX because the scope of the destruction is not something you can do practically in any way, I don't think.


DEADLINE: Your two Terminator films were very prescient in the areas the dangers of nuclear weapons, and ceding control to the AI technology that could become sentient. Avatar is very much a look at environmentalism, and ravaging natural resources for greed and corruption. This fixation took root in you as a boy observing the tense moments of the Cuban Missile crisis. What do you recall?


CAMERON: I was 8 years old, and we lived in Niagara Falls, Canada. Big power station right there that served all of Southern Ontario and much of upstate New York. The Falls was a hydro generating site, and the thinking was, okay, they're going to take out the power sites. And so there were pamphlets for how you put sandbags up against you, make a lean to shelter in your basement, and all this stuff. And I'm like, what the hell is going on? It was my first glimpse that the world was much more complex and much less safe than the little happy family nest I had grown up in. That was a revelation for me, and it stayed with me through my teens and my twenties. And I read the Hersey book, and then I just happened to be in a film class at the time, at the junior college in Fullerton/ There was a teacher there who showed us all different types of films.


	He said, films can be about anything. And he showed us a short documentary that was made by a French film crew that went into Hiroshima. I don't remember the title of the film that went into Hiroshima right after the blast. I guess because they were French and that was how they got access. I remember a trolley, a burned out trolley, its floor was filled with a pile of skulls. So you can imagine a Japanese trolley, as crowded as that was, it burned and there were just skulls and bones just filling the floor. That image became a primal image in Terminator. It's actually one of the first images of the movie, and then again later in Kyle Reese [Michael Biehn]'s memory. So this idea that there is this trauma that you cannot escape, that was the Reese character in the Terminator. And then of course, we played it all out in Terminator 2, and we actually showed the effects of the nuclear weapons in progress.


	I got a letter from a number of researchers at Sandia Labs, one of the foremost nuclear laboratories in the U.S. They had a group that studied effects flash and blast effects, and they formally called them the blast gurus. I got a letter from those men and women. They said, we want to congratulate you for getting it right. This is what actually happens. And I thought, man, do I frame that or do I burn it? It's a compliment, but man, I don't want to be that. You see when Sarah bursts into flame, turns to ash. The blast effects which are sequential, they arrive later, seconds later, and blows the ashy tissue right off her skeleton. That's what happens. And they said, okay, the way you show the shockwave propagating, knocking buildings down, knocking trees over, et cetera, et cetera, everything bursts into flame. You've got the radiant effect of the bomb, and then you've got the blast effects, which follow it. The bigger the bomb, the longer that interregnum In Hiroshima…it was probably two seconds..but a big thermonuclear bomb like we have now, the big hydrogen bombs are anywhere from a thousand to 10,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. It could be 10, 15 seconds that you're sitting there on fire before you get essentially blasted into smithereens.

	











	I think it's important for people to be aware. I want to make the movie so that people in a movie theater feel they've just been through this experience. And then I think the film, I don't want to give away the ending, but I think the film ends with a card that says The weapons currently deployed in the world today are from a thousand to 10,000 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb and the Nagasaki bomb. Get your mind around that for a second. Everybody thought it was a great idea in the late forties and early fifties to build the thermonuclear bomb. Well, if they're going to do it, we've got to do it.


DEADLINE: We mentioned AI; how does that danger compare to a rogue nation like Iran securing a nuke and following an extreme ideology?


CAMERON: Look, Terminator actually sat at this weird nexus between artificial general intelligence, which was I think first done well in movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Colossus: The Forbin Project. Let's not forget that. And in The Terminator, it's all backstory. You never actually see the machine or the nuclear weapons. At the time, I had made the cognitive leap that at some point when you're fighting a nuclear war, because it all takes place in minutes, it's too complex. The theater of battle is too complex and too rapidly evolving to be able to be managed by humans. At some point, when you get artificial intelligence, you're going to put that in charge to fight the battle for you, whether it's firing interceptors, whether it's deciding what the counterstrike would be, whatever it is. I actually think that could happen, and that we're on the verge of something like that beginning to happen.


	One of the strengths of the nuclear response forces is that they have humans in the loop, and it's largely analog in a digital age. It just struck me as, hey, if nuclear weapons were the existential threat and a AI was some distant thing…but right now, we're sitting in a world that I confess this, I've got a deal to make more Terminator films. I'm having a hard time getting the exact story I want to tell because I don't want to be obsolete in a year but we're actually sitting in a world where your two greatest existential threats are artificial general intelligence and nuclear weapons. Now, personally, I don't believe that it's going to happen the way I showed in Terminator.


DEADLINE: How would you see doomsday unfolding?


CAMERON: I think if you've got a good sense of the world and your place in it, last thing you want to do is unleash nuclear hell. Because of the effects are going to be too disruptive to any kind of electronic infrastructure, which is where you live. You destroy yourself first in a way, but it would be dead easy for an AI. They're already figuring out how proteins fold, hypothetically at rates that are 10 a thousand times faster than humans can do it. It's going to be that easy for an AI that really wants to take us out to create a biological weapon to do it. So now this goes back to this theme of alignment that exists amongst the researchers and the developers of AI. Well, we have to make sure that it's aligned to human purpose and human good, and that's a whole thorny subject in and of itself. But to me, the weaponization of AI is the biggest danger, just like the weaponization of nuclear power. Back in the thirties, people thought nuclear power was going to revolutionize the world in a good way.


	Unlimited energy, to grow crops, to pump water to the deserts. It was just going to be a utopian world. Of course, that's not what happened. We weaponized it. And so the optimism of those atomic scientists in the thirties, I now hear the same kind of rationalization from these proponents of how artificial intelligence is going to usher in this utopian age for humanity. It's like, no.

Does he want to include the unreal torture and live experiments they did on American POWs… at least the nazis just killed they didn't do live human organ harvesting and central nervous testing

Ever hear of Dr. Mengele?

ironically, the selling point here is all the gruesome carnage and destruction the bomb would unleash.  People buying tickets are paying to see the destruction of two cities, not some tract on how bad nukes are.  Sorry, but that's the truth.  Cameron is a master of spectacle.

give him 1b

Can't wait for Cameron's vision of A-bomb carnage.

A lone woman is shopping in a crafts store, pushing her half-filled cart lackadaisically down an aisle lined with wooden birdhouses and wicker baskets, when she sniffs the air and stops. Looking up, she sees a curtain of smoke rising toward the rafters. There's a fire. It's right in front of her. Then there's another and another. Suddenly, people are screaming. They rush toward the exit, but this one unfortunate shopper is trapped by the proliferating blaze. Everything in the store is kindling, and the metal shelving hems in what's becoming a human fire-pit. She runs, she covers her mouth, she crawls, but the smoke is too thick to see through and the heat — my god, the heat — is searing.

When the woman escapes, stumbling into a door that explodes the second she pushes through it, there's a sense of relief. She's out. She's alive. She's even able to stand up. But then, as she looks down at her arm, a strip of flesh peels off and falls to the ground like a lump of ham from a deli slicer. As she stands there staring at it, too horrified to move another inch, the smoke now rises from her.

 










This scene, from the premiere episode of Dennis Lehane's new Apple series, “Smoke,” is one of the most upsetting in recent memory. The grounded set-up turns into a living nightmare with such harrowing speed that it almost feels cruel when her shocking survival plays out like a bait and switch: She survived the fire, sure, but her anguish is just beginning. The body horror aspect is disgusting enough by itself — I have not, nor will I ever see “The Substance” — but it's the blink-of-an-eye contrast between carrying out a boring daily chore and having the rest of your life ruined that really sticks.

But when I looked back on the scene after seeing all nine wild episodes of “Smoke,” it's clear this moment is designed for more than shock value. Yes, it's a potent illustration that fire is very, very dangerous. But it's also another kind of warning — a meta warning. Not that “Smoke” is about to flip into a full-on horror show (it doesn't), but that the series is operating in a pulpier, more sensationalized mode than Lehane's previous collaboration with Taron Egerton, “Black Bird.” While examining similar issues through a similar dual-portrait dynamic, “Smoke” isn't the solemn, serious drama series it first presents itself to be. It's straight-up sicko shit, and it drops just enough clues to signal the turn before shedding its refined, respectable skin.

 










Inspired by true events but very much its own thing, “Smoke” starts with a self-edit. Dave Gudsen (Taron Egerton) is trying to describe his infatuation with fire, and he can't get it right. “Every fire starts small,” he narrates, before cutting himself off and starting over. Eventually, he settles on a simple question: “Who would you be in a fire?” When it comes to Dave, the answer is simple: He sees himself as a the hero. A former firefighter who's now an arson investigator, Dave strides through his life like the cock of the walk — despite ample evidence to the contrary.

Chief of which is the fact that he's been chasing not one, but two serial fire-starters for over a year with zero leads. All they have to go on is how each arsonist goes about burning things down. The one they call “Divide and Conquer,” or “D&C,” likes to start a small fire in one location while setting another fire on a time delay at a second location in order to spread the firefighters thin, making it harder to control the second, bigger blaze. The second arsonist has a simpler approach: “Milk Jug” sets milk jugs filled with flammable liquid under people's porches in the wee hours of the morning. The location of the blaze traps the sleeping victims inside, while the speed of its spread makes it difficult to contain. 

 










To help out, the police send over a troubled (or troublesome?) detective, Michelle Calderone (Jurnee Smollett). Calderone is a Marine who trains hard every morning and renovates her house with a sledgehammer most nights. She can go drink for drink with anyone, and she has no problem meeting Dave's early challenges, whether he's pushing her to give up details about her personal life or questioning her ability to tail a suspect. 

The two form a familiar partnership, and for its two-part premiere, “Smoke” wants you to think it's going to be a fairly routine mystery-thriller where Dave and Michelle run through fire to catch the uncatchable bad guys. But, well, there are these nagging curiosities that don't seem to fit. There's Freddie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine), a fast-food worker at a chicken shack whose scenes don't seem to connect with the others. There's the book Dave's writing (you know, because he has so much free time while these fire-starters are on the loose) and the fact that his otherwise loving wife (Hannah Emily Anderson) hates the first draft for being too “dude-centric.” 

And then there's the little embarrassing details about Dave that don't fit with the heroic image he paints for himself. He wears fake glasses when he writes to look more like an author. He can't keep up with Calderon, a true badass, while on the clock, and he can't get it up with his wife while off of it. When we find out he doesn't show up for department-wide celebrations — the kind of bar-closing nights out he loves to conduct on his own terms — it's clear there's more to Dave than the vision he has for himself, and once “Smoke” kicks down the trap door he's hiding behind, the explosions just keep coming.

 










Not all of them burn with equal brightness, and there are a number of moments where the series feels like it takes things too far, whether it's in the minor details or major plot twists. But if you can accept “Smoke” as a gonzo piece of sensationalism, it's a thoroughly entertaining ride. Egerton chews up the scenery in ways he's rarely been allowed to do. Smollett is, once again, pure dynamite, Mwine handles a tricky part with grace and vibrance, and the supporting cast — which comes to include John Leguizamo as a sleazebag with a heart of gold, Greg Kinnear as the kind but conflicted captain, and Rafe Spall as the exact opposite role from his other Apple show, “Trying” — is uniformly strong. 

Premiere director Kari Skogland (“The Handmaid's Tale”) sets a visual template that's crystal clear, never allowing the dark subject matter or environments cloud what's going on, and Thom Yorke's original song over the opening credits sets an eerie tone that becomes a sturdy backbone amid the madness. Best of all, as Lehane is wont to do, the roaring excitement carrying episodes forward is laced with an unmistakable critique of misguided masculinity, especially as it applies to a world becoming more and more accepting of self-delusion. As horrifying as the unexpected can be, our truest atrocities are often staring us right in the face — so long as we have the conviction to look.

 










“Smoke” premieres Friday, June 27 with two episodes on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale (Episode 9) on Friday, August 15.
