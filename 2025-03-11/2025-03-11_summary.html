A court in Dhaka has ordered the seizure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi residence, 'Sudasadhan', and some other properties owned by her family members, who are in exile in India.

At the same time, the court ordered the seizure of 124 bank accounts belonging to her family, an official said.

Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Zakir Hossain Ghalib issued the order on Tuesday following an application by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

Sheikh Hasina's husband, the late nuclear scientist MA Wazed Miah, was nicknamed Sudha Miah. The house, 'Sudhasadan, was named after him.

In addition to Sheikh Hasina, some other properties have been seized, owned by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, and her daughters, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique.

On February 6, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Indian Government over the "false and fabricated" comments and statements continuously being made in different platforms, including social media, by the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina aimed at instigating instability.

Through a protest note handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh has requested the Government of India to immediately take appropriate measures, in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, to stop Hasina from making such "false, fabricated and incendiary statements" using social media and other communications while she is in India, the statement said.

On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, after weeks of protests and clashes that killed over 600 people. Hasina, 77, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned what it described as a “barbaric” and “cowardly” attack by Kiev on multiple Russian regions, including Moscow, in the early hours of Tuesday, just ahead of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia.

The assault, involving a record-large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some reportedly loaded with shrapnel to maximize casualties, resulted in three civilian deaths and multiple injuries in the Moscow Region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a total of 337 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight, including 91 near Moscow and 126 over Kursk Region.

“The neo-Nazi Kiev junta has once again proven its terrorist nature,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening, suggesting the attack was deliberately timed to coincide with diplomatic discussions in Saudi Arabia and a visit by the OSCE Secretary General to Moscow.

“Without a doubt, this drone attack was planned in advance and timed to coincide with today's US-Ukraine contacts on conflict resolution held in Saudi Arabia. It was also a message to new OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu,” Moscow said, accusing the “Kiev clique, which is suffering daily defeats on the battlefield,” of attempting to show its ability to negotiate “from a position of strength.”

Following the talks in Saudi Arabia, Kiev agreed to a US-proposed “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire” with Russia, while Washington lifted restrictions on military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine. Russia has yet to issue an official response to the developments in Jeddah.

“The Zelensky regime, which has lost its grip on reality, has clearly shown a glaring lack of political will for achieving peace and a negotiated settlement of the conflict. It remains obsessed with the idea of defeating Russia, widely using cynical methods of terror and seeking to draw its backers into its aggressive actions,” the ministry stated before the Jeddah talks concluded.

US President Donald Trump indicated on Tuesday that he would likely hold phone talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin soon, expressing hope that Moscow would agree to the proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.

Moscow has previously indicated that any temporary ceasefire deal is unacceptable, arguing it would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm, insisting on a permanent, legally binding solution that addresses the core causes of the conflict. Putin stated in January that Russia is seeking a long-term peace based on respect and the legitimate interests of all people living in the region.

 QUETTA, Pakistan - Separatist militants blew up a railway track and opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, taking dozens of hostages and battling security forces conducting a rescue operation, police and the insurgents said. 

 Police have not specified how many passengers were taken hostage in the remote mountainous area but the insurgents said they were holding 214 people, and have threatened to start executing them. 

 "The affected train is still on the spot and the armed men are holding passengers," senior district police officer Rana Dilawar said. 

 "Security forces launched a massive operation," he said, adding that helicopters and special forces had been deployed. 

 The train was trapped in a tunnel and the driver was killed after sustaining serious injuries, local authorities, police and railway officials said. 

 The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist militant group, said it blew up the tracks and "swiftly took control of the train". The group said it would execute 10 people in response to the ongoing military operation. 

 The BLA has demanded the release within 48 hours of Baloch political prisoners, activists and missing persons it said had been abducted by the military. 

 "BLA is prepared for a prisoner exchange," the group said. 

 "If our demands are not met within the stipulated period or if the occupying state attempts any military action during this time all prisoners of war will be neutralized and the train will be completely destroyed." 

 The group, which seeks independence for Balochistan province bordering both Afghanistan and Iran, said the hostages included Pakistan Army members and other security officials travelling on leave. 

 Dilawar said some of the militants had taken a group of around 35 hostages into the mountains while others were still holding the locomotive. He had previously said that over 300 hostages were safe but security officials have since announced that 104 people have been rescued so far. 

 Security forces said an explosion had been heard near the tunnel and that they were exchanging fire with the militants in a mountainous area. 

 A security source who asked not to be identified said many people had lost their lives in the attack, adding that 80 military personnel were among the 425 passengers aboard the train. 

 Another security source said 104 passengers had been rescued, 17 wounded taken to hospital and 16 militants had been killed, adding the rest were surrounded. 

 "The operation will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated," they said. 

 The BLA said it has not suffered any casualties. It said it had killed 30 soldiers and shot down a drone. There was no confirmation of that from Pakistani authorities. 

 Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack, saying security officials were "repelling" the militants. 

 EXECUTIONS THREATENED 

 "Civilian passengers, particularly women, children, the elderly, and Baloch citizens, have been released safely and given a secure route," the BLA said in a statement emailed to journalists and posted on Telegram. 

 "The BLA further warns that if military intervention continues, all hostages will be executed." 

 The Jaffar Express had been on its way from Balochistan's capital, Quetta, to the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when it was fired on. 

 Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and praised the military for rescuing more than 100 passengers. 

 "Those who attack innocent passengers are enemies of the country," he said. 

 "Enemy forces are conspiring to create instability in the country through terrorism in Balochistan." 

 The Balochistan government has imposed emergency measures to deal with the situation, spokesperson Shahid Rind said, without giving any more details. 

 The BLA is the biggest of several groups that have been battling the government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources. 

 The conflict has seen frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region.

A British couple is challenging the nearly $2,000 fine they received after reporting that a stowaway had hitched a ride home with them from their French vacation.

LONDON — Adrian Fenton and his wife, Joanne, had just returned home from vacation in France when they were startled to discover they had company. A teenager had somehow climbed into the bike rack on their motor home and returned with them all the way back home to Essex, in southern England.

Their next surprise: They were fined almost $2,000 for it.

Four months after the couple reported the stowaway to police, the pair received a 1,500-pound ($1,943) fine in the mail from Britain's Home Office. It said they had failed to properly inspect their vehicle for stowaways upon their return from the Champagne region in October.

“I lifted the cover up, and — lo and behold — I saw a pair of white trainers,” said Fenton, 57, a retired firefighter. “My wife gave him a bottle of water and asked if he was okay.”

The person was detained by police and taken away, Fenton said. The young man told police he was 16 and from Sudan.

The Fentons are in the process of challenging the fine, which they believe was issued unfairly, punishing them for contacting law enforcement and serving only to disincentivize others from doing the same.

“Our fine should be quashed,” Fenton said. “Who in their right mind now would call the police?” he asked. “Now, every single holidaymaker and tourist who hears this story is never going to call the police.”

In 2023, Britain's Conservative government increased the onus on drivers entering the country to inspect their vehicles for stowaways, levying fines of up to 10,000 pounds ($12,956) on those who fail to comply with basic checks for each clandestine traveler found in their vehicle. The legislation was introduced amid a slew of efforts to curb unlawful migration, including an extreme plan — since abandoned — to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.

The Fentons believe that the Sudanese teen climbed aboard their vehicle while it was stationary in northern France, and spent about six hours crammed into their tightly packed canvas bike carrier as they sped under the Channel Tunnel by train and drove to their home in Heybridge, Essex.

Last year, more than 700 Sudanese nationals were found to have arrived in Britain unlawfully, excluding those who arrived by small boat or stopped at a regular port of entry — the most of any nationality. The country has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023, displacing almost 9 million people within Sudan and leading an additional 3.4 million to flee elsewhere. Britain does not specify in regularly published data the number of people found to have unlawfully entered the country as stowaways.

“We gave him water to make sure he was hydrated, we gave him food,” Fenton said. “He'd obviously gone through a little bit of trauma traveling back, but other than that he was fit and well.” Britain's Home Office declined to provide any details on the stowaway's immigration status, citing a policy against commenting on individual cases.

The strict onus on drivers to check their vehicles is unreasonable, Fenton said. “You can't check your vehicle at every set of traffic lights. … It's impossible and not safe.”

Călin Georgescu, a Russia-friendly populist, won first round of election before result was annulled

Romania's top court has upheld a decision to ban presidential election frontrunner Călin Georgescu from standing in a rerun of the vote in May, sparking protest in Bucharest and leaving the country's far-right parties four days to find a candidate.

Georgescu, an anti-EU, Moscow-friendly populist, surged from almost nowhere to win the first round of the country's presidential election last year, but the result was annulled by Romania's top court because of suspected Russian interference.

Amid claims of “massive” social media manipulation, he was placed under criminal investigation last month on six charges including false statements about his campaign financing, fraudulent use of digital technologies and promoting fascist organisations.

He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Romania's central election bureau said on Sunday it had decided to bar Georgescu's candidacy for the rerun of the first-round vote, due on 4 May, ruling it “unacceptable” that he should stand after the constitutional court's annulment of the November vote.

After deliberating for two hours, the constitutional court rejected Georgescu's appeal against that decision on Tuesday in a unanimous ruling that cannot be challenged. It would publish its reasoning at a later date, the court added.

Several hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving Romanian flags and chanting “freedom” and “thieves”. Ana Florescu, 57, said Romania was “not a democracy any more … There is no justice. They have stolen it.”

Florescu, an economist, said the mainstream political parties that have run the country since the collapse of communism in 1989 had “made so many mistakes. No one trusts them any more. And now they have just cancelled a candidate.”

Gabriel Feraru, 63, an engineer, said the entire political class was “afraid of Georgescu because he is anti-system, and they will lose all their corrupt privileges”. He said he would boycott the rerun unless Georgescu endorsed a new far-right candidate.

The deadline for candidacies is 15 March, giving Romania's far-right parties, including the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR) and the party of Young People (POT), which had united behind Georgescu's run, little time to agree on a replacement.

The former government official told his supporters after the ruling to “follow your conscience” when casting their ballot. “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no freedom, no fraternity for Romanians,” Georgescu posted on social media.

“Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania,” he added in English and French. “While America is becoming great again, Europe and Romania have become petty, corrupt, and under dictatorship.”

George Simion, chairman of the AUR and of the far-right bloc that holds about a third of seats in parliament, said the court's decision was “a disgrace … Once again, it is mocking the Romanian people, is attacking our democracy and our essential rights.”

Many protesters said they would either boycott the new ballot or vote for an anti-establishment candidate. “I'll vote for anyone new who isn't a part of this system. People are fed up with these same politicians,” said Ionel Popa, a 52-year-old taxi driver.

The decisions to annul the elections and disqualify Georgescu have drawn sharp criticism from Washington. Billionaire Elon Musk posted on social media on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”

The US vice-president, JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, was leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.

Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the November election and had declared zero campaign spending. He has lauded Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania's 1930s fascist leaders.

He has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared Jesus Christ to be “the only true science”, claimed Nato would never help Romania and said Bucharest was not very good at foreign affairs and should rely on “Russian wisdom”.

Moscow has denied any link with Georgescu but said on Tuesday any presidential election without him would be “illegitimate”. Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Romanian authorities' decisions as a “violation of all democratic norms”.

Elizabeth Oyer claims justice department senior ‘bullied' her due to Trump's relationship with actor sentenced for domestic violence in 2011

The pardon attorney of the US justice department was recently fired after refusing to recommend that Mel Gibson be allowed to own guns again, a right denied since the actor, director and prominent ally of Donald Trump was sentenced to probation for domestic violence in 2011, the New York Times reported.

The pardon attorney is a non-political role, supervising matters of clemency and recommendations for presidential pardons. Elizabeth Oyer was appointed under Joe Biden's presidency in 2022. She told the Times she had been working on a project to restore gun ownership rights to some people convicted of crimes and misdemeanors, a power held by the justice department but not often used.

A list of 95 candidates was whittled down to nine by senior figures, Oler said, then “sent … back to me saying: ‘We would like you to add Mel Gibson to this memo.'”

According to the Times, Oyer was also sent a January letter from Gibson's lawyer addressed to two senior justice department officials, James McHenry and Emil Bove, “arguing for [Gibson's] gun rights to be restored, saying that he had been tapped for a special appointment by the president and that he had made a number of big, successful movies”.

On 16 January, four days before starting his second presidency, Trump said the 69-year-old star of Mad Max, Braveheart and other blockbusters had been named, alongside two other veteran actors, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, “special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California”.

Oyer told the Times: “Giving guns back to domestic abusers is a serious matter that, in my view, is not something that I could recommend lightly, because there are real consequences that flow from people who have a history of domestic violence being in possession of firearms.”

She said she was “vaguely aware” of a 2006 episode in which Gibson was stopped by a police officer on suspicion of drunk driving and responded with antisemitic abuse.

As described by Oyer, after she made clear her opposition to restoring Gibson's gun rights, a senior official under the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, asked if she was “flexible”. Told she was not, the official “shifted from friendly to condescending to bullying”, and “essentially explained to me that Mel Gibson has a personal relationship with President Trump and that should be sufficient basis for me to make a recommendation and that I would be wise to make the recommendation”, Oyer said.

Like Bove, Blanche was an attorney for Trump in criminal cases, including one in New York which resulted in 34 felony convictions arising from hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who claimed an affair.

After the conversation, Oyer said, she “literally did not sleep a wink, because I understood that the position I was in was one that was going to either require me to compromise my strongly held views and ethics or would likely result in me losing my ability to participate in these conversations going forward”.

According to the Times, Oyer told a colleague: “I can't believe this, but I really think Mel Gibson is going to be my downfall.”

On Friday, Oyer was among high-profile figures fired from the justice department. She told the Times the termination happened suddenly.

The Times said two anonymous sources confirmed Oyer's version of events. Speaking to NBC News, an unnamed senior justice department official said: “The fact that this was the No 1 thing they wanted to address was bizarre.”

Unnamed justice department officials told the Times and NBC Oyer's account was not accurate. A representative for Gibson did not respond to a Times comment request.

On Saturday, Gibson was seen at a Las Vegas Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in the company of Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, an agency of the justice department.

At that event, the UFC president, Dana White, made headlines by saying Patel was “dead serious” about partnering with the promotion company to train FBI agents.

Oyer told the Times that senior officials wanted to make a quick announcement about people having gun rights restored, a group that would presumably include Gibson – though by Tuesday no such announcement had been made.

Ukraine has accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States, following critical peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio now says the proposal will head to Russia where the US hopes the Kremlin will agree to it.

Dozens of prominent rabbis with extensive diplomatic backgrounds sent letters to US President Donald Trump in recent days regarding the possible inclusion of the Muslim-majority country in the Abraham Accords framework. The group is led by Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and Rabbi Eli Abadi, a senior rabbi in the UAE and personal friend of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and architect of the Abraham Accords.  Among the high-profile signatories is Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, head of the rabbinical court of the Rabbinical Alliance of America and Canada, which includes approximately two hundred ultra-Orthodox rabbis and the organization of Zionist rabbis. In their letters, the rabbis emphasized a significant point: Countries that joined the Abraham Accords received extensive incentives and political backing from the United States.

"Countries that joined the Abraham Accords received positive incentives and benefits in return for making peace with Israel. In contrast, Azerbaijan became a particularly reliable partner and true friend of Israel three decades ago, without any external influence," the rabbis write. "Repealing Section 907 would be a very good gesture of recognition." Rabbi Marvin Hier, who spoke at Trump's inauguration ceremony in 2017, was selected by Newsweek magazine as America's most influential rabbi. He served as a mediator in talks between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan, and notes that including Azerbaijan in the agreements "will strengthen the importance of the Accords and demonstrate that alliances based on mutual respect and cooperation can flourish, regardless of religious or political differences."

"This country became a particularly reliable partner and true friend of Israel, a key strategic ally of the United States, three decades ago without any external influence, and has supported Israel in every situation – even in the face of ongoing opposition and pressure from the Muslim world," the letter read.

'A significant turning point'The Jewish community in the country "lives and thrives because respect and brotherhood toward Jews are an integral part of the local tradition," as emphasized by Azerbaijan's President, Ilham Aliyev. In their letter, the rabbis note that "Your policy and vision, Mr. President, are leading to revolutionary changes in the Middle East, while protecting the State of Israel, a key US ally, and promoting stability, peace and economic prosperity. During your first term, you made the Abraham Accords a reality, and now you intend to expand and strengthen them by adding more countries. We strongly believe that including Azerbaijan — a pillar in Israel's regional security and a proven loyal ally — will strengthen the importance of the Accords and help establish a more stable regional peace in the broader Middle East." "International relations experts and senior figures in the Jewish community assess that approval of the request could mark a significant turning point in strategic relations in the Middle East and expand the circle of peace partners in the region. Discussions surrounding Azerbaijan's inclusion in the Abraham Accords are concerning Tehran. The newspaper "Iran Daily," the official mouthpiece of the Iranian regime, published a front-page article this week under the headline "Growing Israeli Presence in Azerbaijan Raises Alarm" — evidence of the strategic importance of such a move in the region.

        US President Donald Trump faces increased pressure to stimulate economic growth after a brutal market selloff on Monday indicated rising recession risks.
    

US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he intends to double planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.

In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he said the tariffs are set to take effect on Wednesday, calling the decision a response to the price increases that the provincial government of Ontario put on electricity sold to the United States.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.

After a brutal stock market selloff on Monday and further jitters Tuesday, Trump faces increased pressure to show he has a legitimate plan to grow the economy instead of pushing it into a recession. 

The US President has said his separate 25% tariffs are about fentanyl smuggling and voicing objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalise US farmers. But he also called again for Canada to become part of the United States as its "51st state," saying "this would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear."

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, after responding to Trump by raising electricity prices, said Tuesday on MSNBC that the U.S. people and its business leaders needed to speak up against the “chaos” caused by Trump's launching of a trade war.

“If we go into a recession it's self made by one person. It's called President Trump's recession,” Ford said. “It shouldn't be this way. We should be booming, both countries.”

Trump condemned the use of electricity “as a bargaining chip and threat,” saying in a separate social media post on Tuesday that Canada "will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!”

Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota, New York and Michigan and Trump pledged to declare a national emergency in those states.

Mexico has also been targeted with 25% tariffs because of the president's dissatisfaction over drug trafficking and illegal immigration, though he suspended the taxes on imports that are compliant with the 2020 USMCA trade pact for one month.

Asked if Mexico feared it could face the same 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium as Canada, President Claudia Sheinbaum, said “No, we are respectful.”

The investment bank Goldman Sachs revised down its growth forecast for this year to 1.7% from 2.2% previously. It modestly increased its recession probability to 20% “because the White House has the option to pull back policy changes if downside risks begin to look more serious.”

Trump has tried to assure the public that his tariffs would cause some “transition” to the economy, with the taxes prodding more companies to begin the years-long process of relocating factories to the United States to avoid the tariffs. But he set off alarms in an interview broadcast on Sunday in which he didn't rule out a possible recession.

“I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said on Fox News. "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of — it takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I don't — I think it should be great for us. I mean, I think it should be great."

The promise of great things ahead did not eliminate anxiety, with the S&P 500 stock index tumbling 2.7% on Monday in an unmistakable "Trump slump" that has erased the market gains that greeted his victory in November 2024. The S&P 500 index fell roughly 1% in Tuesday afternoon trading.

Ukraine has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russian forces, contingent on Russia's acceptance, according to a statement released Tuesday.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss steps toward ending the war, which began with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

"Our hope is that the Russians will say yes, that they will also agree so the shooting will stop, the killing will stop, the dying will stop and the talks can begin about how to end this war permanently in a way that's acceptable and enduring for both sides," said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

As part of the talks, the U.S. agreed to "immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine."

"Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security," a joint statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said.

The pause in U.S. support was implemented after a contentious meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Ukraine carried out one of its largest attacks since Russia's invasion in 2022, firing around 300 drones, with at least 70 of them targeting the Moscow region, according to Ukrainian officials.

Officials in Moscow claimed that Ukraine was targeting civilian buildings, but the attacks were mostly averted. However, Ukraine said it managed to hit oil facilities not just in the Moscow region but across the country.

White House officials say the US will impose 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, rather than the 50% Donald Trump announced earlier

The rollback comes after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would temporarily suspend its plan to charge a 25% tariff on electricity it sends to northern US states

That reversal came after US President Trump had said he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50% in retaliation to the Ontario threat 

According to the province's Premier Doug Ford, negotiations between his province and the Trump administration are ongoing, with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick inviting Ford to Washington

As a reminder: Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The companies that bring the goods into the country pay the tax to the government

Trump said the tariffs will begin on Wednesday, adding that he'll declare "a national emergency on electricity" in those states

Meanwhile, Trump is meeting a group of business CEOs in Washington DC

Tuesday's tariff back-and-forth comes after the worst day of 2025 for US markets, fuelled by fears of President Trump's aggressive tariffs on America's biggest trading partners

Doug Ford suspends electricity surcharge until meeting with US

Edited by Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies

Alex LedermanUS reporter

It seems the day will end as it began on the tariffs front - with the US planning to impose a 25% surcharge on steel and aluminium imported from Canada, as well from everywhere else in the world, starting at midnight. 

But in the intervening hours, economic threats and then rollbacks have flown back and forth across the US-Canadian border all day.

Just a few days ago, I was in the room as Canada's Liberal Party gathered to elect its next leader on Sunday. With the US president's warnings from across the border, the anti-Trump feeling in the room was palpable.

The red maple leaf Canadian flag hung everywhere in sight. 

Canadians - usually stereotyped for being so polite - were ready for a fight. 

 A once-dejected Liberal Party felt rejuvenated. With a trade war looming and a widespread feeling that Canadian sovereignty could be under threat, the party had a newfound sense of purpose. 

"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win," the newly selected party leader Mark Carney told a roaring crowd.

Polls showed a huge bounce back from near-certain defeat to the Conservatives in the coming general election. 

 Just hours before, hundreds of ordinary Canadians made their voices heard outside Parliament.

“We are not for sale!" one sign read. "Not a 51st anything," another poster said, held high.

"If there's anybody out there threatening my home, I want to be a part of the fight against that," one woman told us. 

The entire political landscape has changed in Canada. With Donald Trump's tariffs and threats, Canadians have rallied around their flag.



It's been a hectic Tuesday for North American trade, with threats of fees on imported goods flying back and forth between the US and Canada like a ping pong ball.  

Yesterday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity sent from the province to the US, threatening to "shut off electricity completely" if the US were to further escalate the ongoing trade war. Trump retaliated by doubling the US's upcoming 25% global steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% for Canada. 

But then by this afternoon, both parties had stepped back from these vows.

Head spun? Here's an approximate timeline of how it all went down, in Eastern Daylight Time: 

10:30 am Trump announces an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium in retaliation to Doug Ford's Monday electricity surcharge threat, bringing the import fee to 50%

12:25 pm When asked why Mexico wasn't facing the same fees, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded: "We're respectful" 

12:40 pm Ford says he will meet with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that shutting off electricity to various northern US states is the “last thing” he wants to do 

13:45 pm White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Ontario's threat to shut down electricity imports to the US "egregious and insulting". When asked if the US still considers Canada a close ally, she says they "might be a competitor now"

13:55 pm Canada's next Prime Minister Mark Carney posts on social media, calling the new tariff hike "an attack”, saying his government will "ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada" 

14.05 pm The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that without its country's exports, "the US won't have enough of either metal to satisfy the needs of its demanding economy", suggesting Trump's promised "golden era" would therefore not be possible 

14:50 pm Ford says he will suspend the electricity surcharge after Lutnick reached out to him in a phone call with an "olive branch", adding that he will be headed to Washington on Thursday to negotiate with the US trade secretary and is "pretty confident" Trump will back down on the additional tariff hikes 

15:35 pm Trump says he's "looking at" walking back the additional hikes and "could make a different decision" 

16:50 pm White House officials Lutnick and Peter Navarro confirm Trump has reversed his plans to double the steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada to 50%, and say the 25% tariff will go into effect as scheduled at midnight for Ottawa and the rest of the world

Much of today's tariff discussion was centred around Canadian energy imports to the United States.

President Donald Trump blamed the province of Ontario's now-rescinded move to place a 25% surcharge on electricity heading into the US as the reason for his now-cancelled decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs.

But how much electricity does the US import from Canada ?

When Ontario's leader Doug Ford announced the 25% surcharge on electricity exports, he suggested that the measure would impact 1.5 million homes and businesses across the northern states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York. 

Canadian Minister Stephen Lecce has also claimed that Canada sells 12,000 megawatts of power into the US market each day, and is a “30 times net exporter” to the US - “they need our power”, he says.

According to Electricity Canada, external, a trade association for Canadian energy suppliers, the US imports electricity from its neighbour because it makes sense for affordability.

The trade association says that cross-border trade in electricity works by allowing regions to coordinate with neighbours to draw on each other's surplus supplies when excess electricity isn't being used, therefore keeping costs down and avoiding overbuilding. 

For instance, it says, Canadians tend to use more electricity during winter for heating, while demand in the US is higher during the summer, when it is needed for cooling.

The White House says Donald Trump has delivered "a win for the American people", after Ontario Premier Doug Ford dropped his threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the US.

In response, Trump had also threatened to double the rate of aluminium and steel tariffs on Canada from 25% to 50%. He has also since walked back on this threat.

"President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world," the statement says.

The White House says Trump's plans for a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will still take effect on Wednesday - "with no exceptions or exemptions".

Marty Warren, the national director for the union representing steelworkers in Canada, tells the BBC the on-again-off-again threats of tariffs from the US on his industry are "reckless" and have been a cause of major anxiety for workers.

"Our members are scared," Warren of the United Steelworkers tells the BBC. Earlier on Tuesday, the union said the tariffs would be an "industry killer" that would lead to job losses.

Warren says that his union has been in discussions with its US counterpart to send a message that these tariffs stand to hurt both American and Canadian workers.

"We're relying on allies. Some won't speak up," he acknowledges. "Some will, but we're trying to work closely and lobby the people that we think we can get a message through."

He adds his union members are not only concerned about tariffs, but also the sovereignty of Canada as US President Donald Trump repeats his desire to make Canada "the 51st state."

Warren notes that this second Trump administration is different from his first, which also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium back in 2018. They were rolled back the following year.

"Trump said he would take Canada through economic means," he says. "This constant threat, this constant disrespect for Canadians and Canada's sovereignty is what makes it different."

Charging some of its closest allies and trade partners more to import goods might seem counterintuitive for the US.  

But by making imports more expensive, Trump is hoping to stoke demand for US-made goods, helping to boost domestic manufacturing.  

Trump has also said he wants to raise money for the government through the fees. 

Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News the president's “goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the out outsiders pay” - a proposal the president has dubbed the “External Revenue Service”. 

If trade dries up though, it's not clear how much revenue tariffs will raise. 

Before the media left the room, Trump made some wide-ranging opening remarks at the business roundtable event, covering everything from ceasefire negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine to the success of Doge.

He spoke briefly about tariffs, saying they're having a "tremendously positive impact".

He claimed car companies have relocated their manufacturing from Mexico to the US. He also accused China of owning the plants being built in Mexico, adding that tariffs had put a stop to that now. 

The relocation of industry to the US is a "bigger win" than the money being brought in by the tariffs, he said.

After President Trump entered the roundtable event and made his opening remarks, the media present appear to have been asked to leave shortly after he began answering questions.

Our feed has been cut. Online feeds run by other outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Fox, have also been turned off.

President Trump is now meeting the CEOs of America's largest companies for a roundtable discussion, where the current economic situation is sure to be top of the agenda.

Around 100 business leaders are expected to be in attendance at the regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, DC. Those in the room will include the CEOs of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.

The meeting comes as US stock markets plummeted in response to Trump's threats of tariffs on neighbouring Canada and Mexico, as well as other nations.

The market drop signals anxiety on the part of investors, who worry that the tariffs could trigger an economic slowdown or cause a recession. 

Trump himself declined to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News last week, saying: "I hate to predict things like that" after acknowledging that his policies will bring about a period of transition. 

In addition to senior US trade adviser Peter Navarro, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has now also confirmed that the White House will no longer impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, according to the BBC's US media partner, CBS news. 

Trump had earlier suggested a reversion to 25% tariffs could happen today. 

The original 25% tariffs will still go into effect on Wednesday, Lutnick says.

Senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has confirmed that the administration has reversed plans to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Navarro says the change happened after Ontario's Premier Doug Ford backed down from his electricity surcharge, which Navarro described as "sounding ominous".

"I think he [Doug Ford] kind of understood that this was not going to be a fight," Navarro says. "I've encouraged our friends in Canada to keep the rhetoric down." 

The 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel will still be enforced. 

Earlier, Navarro said Ford was a "politician in Canada" rather than an economist. 

Additionally, while Navarro said the transition to "Trumponomics" could be a "little bumpy", he said the administration was confident. 

"If you're a stock market investor and you understand Trumponomics, you will be bullish, and you won't fall prey to daily volatility and get fleeced by day traders," Navarro added. 

While President Donald Trump has hinted he might consider cutting back on the 50% tariffs he's announced on Canadian steel and aluminium, plans are currently still in place to bring in 25% tariffs on these materials from midnight on Wednesday for several countries.

US steel and aluminium imports from a number of countries, including Canada, its biggest steel supplier, will be taxed at a minimum of 25%.

The other countries listed in his executive order, external signed in February include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, EU countries, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the UK. 

The order revokes exemptions for tariffs Trump had made for those countries during his first term, in 2018. It also increases aluminium tariffs from 10% to 25%.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

It's rare to see a White House news conference in any administration where a US ally is spoken about in the tone used today with regard to Canada, even in periods when officials in Washington have clearly been exasperated with their partners abroad.

At one point, Leavitt recited statistics on the cost of living in major Canadian cities, saying their residents would be “better served” if, as Trump has suggested, Canada becomes the 51st state of the US.

The White House posture towards Canada is starkly different to the stance on Mexico, which has also faced the threat of tariffs. 

Just recently, for example, Trump said he had a “great relationship” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom the Washington Post this week dubbed “the world's greatest Trump whisperer”.

Nadine YousifReporting from Toronto

We just heard from Ontario's leader Doug Ford, who announced at the top of his news conference that he has agreed to temporarily pause a 25% surcharge to electricity his province sends to 1.5 million American homes, after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick extended an "olive branch".

Earlier today, President Trump threatened to double tariffs he planned to impose tomorrow on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Ontario's electricity hike. This afternoon, after Ford spoke, Trump said he could cut back on import duties.

All eyes will now be on a meeting that is set to take place between Ford and Lutnick. That will happen on Thursday in Washington, according to Lutnick. Among those in attendance will be Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.

Ford cautioned that Ontario still has electricity as a bargaining chip. But he said that he would not deny an opportunity to sit down with the Americans and let "cooler heads prevail".

Trump to 'probably' cut Canada tariffs after Doug Ford's reversal

We've just heard a response from Donald Trump following Doug Ford's reversal on imposing a 25% tariff on electricity flowing from his province to northern US states. 

The president tells reporters at the White House that he's now considering cutting back on the 50% tariffs he announced earlier on Tuesday.

Trump said he's "looking at it" and could "make a different decision".

Trump then confirmed that the "strong man in Canada" - referring to Ford, who also earlier threatened to cut off electricity exports to the US - has suspended his own tariff plans.

"I respect that," Trump said. 

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "I'm glad they listened" in a post on social media, after Canada's Doug Ford announced a pause on plans to end his territory's energy exports to some US states. 

Tensions quickly flared between Ford and Trump on Tuesday, after Ford said he would "not hesitate" to stop supplying the US with electricity in response to Trump's tariffs, and Trump in turn said Canada would pay a price "so big it will be read about in history books for years to come".

Lutnick announced that he and Ford have agreed to meet in Washington on Thursday ahead of Trump's 2 April deadline for reciprocal tariffs.

In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota, Lutnick said. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has just finished speaking to the press in Toronto after a back and forth over tariffs between the US and Canada.  

Here's what you need to know:  

One other notable soundbite from that news conference with Ontario Premier Ford.

He told reporters: "You can't attack your number one customer, Canada, and not expect a response."

He said the country had responded to US tariffs and the next step was to negotiate.  

Calling himself a “businessperson”, he said he wanted to find a solution to “stop the bleeding”. 

Ford added that China was sitting back and laughing at the US and Canada's trade spat. 

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

As President Trump escalated his trade war with
Canada and US stocks rode a rollercoaster, White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt painted an upbeat picture earlier today.

Setbacks are only “temporary”. 

Economic warning
signs are just a “snapshot in time”. 

Manufacturing job numbers are strong, and
foreign investments are up. 

And to whatever extent there are problems with the
US economy, it is because of Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.

American voters tend to have short memories,
however, and blaming current conditions on a president who left office in
January is unlikely to fly for long – particularly when economic uncertainty
has been exacerbated by Trump's own actions.

That short memory ultimately may end up helping
Trump and his team, however, if their trade and government-slashing plans do
eventually lead to the kind of growth they have promised. 

Congressional
elections aren't until November 2026, and this is still early in Trump's second
term.

There is plenty of time to bounce back. But
every day on this current trajectory means the political hole the president is
digging gets deeper, whether Leavitt acknowledges that from the White House
podium or not.

Ford says that when someone extends an "olive branch", he would thank them for the opporutnity.

"All you folks have seen how President Trump has changed things on a daily basis," Ford said. "I don't want to wait until April 2," when Trump said reciprocal tariffs would kick in, Ford said.

"God only knows" what would happen between now and that deadline, he said.

Tuesday 11 March 2025 14:04, UK

In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and complex global challenges, City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) has established itself as a key institution driving innovation across multiple fields.

Recent developments at the university show a focus on fostering an environment that turns research into real-world benefits, while preparing students for careers of the future.

This page was produced by Sky Media, the advertising department of Sky, in collaboration with CityUHK

Digital medicine: bridging traditional healthcare and technology

One field in which this is most apparent is medical technology.

The establishment of the Institute of Digital Medicine (IDM) marks an important step in CityUHK's cross-disciplinary approach.

Through partnerships with academic, clinical and industry organisations, the university is using its research strengths in engineering, data science and life sciences to develop healthcare technologies that doctors can use immediately.

Asia's rapidly aging population presents significant healthcare challenges throughout the region.

                  What's in the US-proposed Russia and Ukraine ceasefire deal?
                


                  'Calling Moscow's bluff': Sky News correspondents' views as Ukraine accepts ceasefire deal
                

The integration of digital solutions with traditional medical approaches has become increasingly vital, with market analysts projecting the Asia-Pacific digital health market to exceed £55bn by 2026.

This convergence of medical expertise and technological innovation provides a good example of CityUHK's commitment to addressing societal challenges through academia-industry collaboration.

Entrepreneurial development framework

Elsewhere, the HK Tech 300 programme shows CityUHK's commitment to developing entrepreneurs beyond classroom learning.

This initiative supports aspiring business founders within the University community and beyond, encouraging them to put innovative ideas into practice.

Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem has grown substantially in recent years, with over 3,000 start-ups reported in 2023, representing a 60% increase from those in 2017.

This growth coincides with government initiatives providing approximately £500m in innovation and technology funding, creating a supportive environment for university-led entrepreneurship programmes.

The overlapping area between institutional support and governmental policy creates fertile ground for CityUHK's entrepreneurial initiatives to flourish within Hong Kong's evolving innovation landscape.

Comprehensive innovation education

To strengthen this space, the CityUHK Academy of Innovation was established to bolster the university's approach through specialised academic programmes at all levels.

From undergraduate to postdoctoral studies, these programmes are designed to nurture young entrepreneurs with a focus on deep-tech venture creation and to promote university-industry collaboration.

The programmes on offer include a PhD by Innovation, MSc in Venture Creation, Graduate Research and Innovation Trek Programme (GRIT), and the Overseas Start-up Technology Entrepreneur Programme (STEP).

In developing these courses, the academy collaborated closely with university colleges, departments, the School of Graduate Studies, and relevant administrative offices.

Teaching is delivered by a carefully selected blend of CityUHK faculty members alongside external experts bringing valuable industrial and investment experience.

The initiative aims to build a leading international ecosystem that nurtures young entrepreneurs, supports deep-tech start-up incubation, and enhances university-industry collaboration.

Artificial intelligence research with practical applications

In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), CityUHK has recruited excellent AI talent to focus on developing practical applications.

HONG KONG — Six of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in India, while California has the worst air pollution in North America, a new report shows.

New Delhi was the most polluted capital city globally, followed by N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, a country in central Africa with the world's worst air pollution, according to the 2024 World Air Quality Report published Tuesday by IQAir, a Swiss air monitoring company.

Ten of the 15 most polluted cities in North America, including Ontario and Bloomington, are in California as the United States reclaimed the top spot as the most polluted country in the region in 2024, the report said.

India, the world's most populous country, with more than 1.4 billion people, had a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentration last year, but air pollution remains a “significant health burden” that reduces life expectancy there by an estimated 5.2 years, the report said. The country's major pollution sources include industrial discharge, construction dust and the burning of crop residues.

PM2.5 refers to tiny particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less that can go deep into lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Deriving from emission sources such as the combustion of gasoline and oil, it is linked to premature death, heart attacks and breathing difficulties.

Though the World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter, only 17% of cities worldwide meet its air quality standard, the report said.

Chad's PM2.5 levels were more than 18 times higher than the WHO guideline, with mineral dust in the Sahara Desert as the primary source of air pollutants. Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island nations, is the world's cleanest region, with 57% of cities meeting the WHO standard.

Bangladesh and Pakistan, both of which neighbor India, ranked as the second and third most polluted countries. In November, air quality in Pakistan reached “hazardous” levels because of a combination of festival celebrations, brick kiln emissions and adverse weather.

China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, recorded lower air pollution levels in more than 300 cities last year, the report said.

While noting Chinese authorities' “ambitious” goal to reduce the country's annual average PM2.5 concentration levels to below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the report said that is still “significantly” above the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms.

A senior Chinese environmental official said last month that China aimed to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of this year. China announced its “war against pollution” in 2014.

The report also noted the “considerable” gaps in air quality that still exist in many parts of the world. Only 21% of the world population has access to hyperlocal, real-time air quality information, according to IQAir estimates.

Cambodia had no official government monitoring, while many critical regions in Africa and West Asia lack sufficient monitoring. In comparison, North America has a “robust” air quality monitoring infrastructure that accounts for 56% of ground-based stations.

“Air pollution remains a critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, yet vast populations remain unaware of their exposure levels,” Frank Hammes, IQAir's global chief executive, said in a statement.

“Air quality data saves lives,” Hammes said. “It creates much needed awareness, informs policy decisions, guiding public health interventions, and empowers communities to take action to reduce air pollution and protect future generations.”

Last week, U.S. embassies and consulates said they had stopped monitoring air quality abroad, ending a program that had provided essential public health data for more than a decade.

Data the United States provided in dozens of countries had led to noticeable improvements in local air quality in China and elsewhere, reducing premature deaths and generating cost savings associated with lower mortality, studies found.

Air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the WHO. Children under age 5 are considered especially vulnerable, with health effects including premature birth, low birth weight, asthma and lung disease.

The Trump administration is working toward its promise of eliminating the U.S. Department of Education: On Tuesday evening, the department released a statement saying it would cut nearly 50% of the department's workforce. Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave beginning March 21, according to the announcement.

The statement confirms "all divisions" within the agency will be hit by cuts, but also says it will continue to deliver programs protected by law "including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking."

"Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers," U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the statement. "I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department. This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system."

According to the announcement, more than 1,300 positions will be cut as a result of this reduction in force. Roughly another 600 employees accepted voluntary resignations or retired over the last two months.

AFGE Local 252, a union that represents Education Department employees, released a statement in which its president, Sheria Smith, said, "We will fight these draconian cuts and urge all Americans to stand up and contact their Members of Congress…to protect the Department of Education's vital work, working people, and our Nation by rejecting these political games."

Minutes later, AFGE Local 252 told NPR that Smith was laid off, along with all five of the chapter's other union officers.

Earlier on Tuesday, department employees received an email advising them to vacate all department offices by 6:00 pm. Staff were instructed by the department's Office of Security, Facilities and Logistics to plan to work from home on Wednesday. Employees of the department shared the email with NPR. We are not naming them because they feared retribution.

Department employees have spent the past several weeks anticipating sweeping staff cuts by the Trump administration.

This Thursday, agency heads are expected to turn in their "reorganization" plans to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A guidance memo from OMB and OPM sent in late February instructed agency heads to achieve "large-scale reductions in force (RIFs)" through attrition and "by eliminating positions that are not required."

Already, at least 75 Education Department staff have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to a tally by AFGE Local 252. This count does not include managers and supervisors. Many of those workers on paid leave attended a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion workshop the department has offered for many years, including during the first Trump administration.

The union also says at least 75 probationary department staff, who were hired more recently and are legally easier to lay off, have also had their jobs terminated.

WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump reversed course and will no longer double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Peter Navarro, the White House's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said Tuesday.

The abrupt shift was a response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford saying he would suspend a 25% electricity surcharge on about 1.5 million U.S. energy users in New York, Michigan and Minnesota.

Trump had hinted at the reversal Tuesday afternoon, and Navarro confirmed it, saying Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick "had a cordial discussion, and Mr. Ford, in his wisdom, decided to back away from his electricity surcharge of 25%.”

Navarro added that Ford “understood that this was not going to be a fight that he could win.”

Trump's turnabout came after he said Tuesday morning that he would be doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, set to go in effect Wednesday, from 25% to 50%. With Trump backtracking, the steel and aluminum tariff rate for Canadian imports will remain at 25%.

Trump downplayed the impact of his tariff threats on the plunging stock market. He has argued the tariffs are needed to help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector.

"Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down. But you know what? We have to rebuild our country," Trump told reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn as he promoted Tesla vehicles alongside Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and a senior White House adviser.

Trump defended his use of tariffs in remarks Tuesday to business leaders in Washington following another day of tariff threats and a sudden reversal – and suggested higher fees could be on the way.

Speaking before The Business Roundtable, Trump touted a “renewed spirit” in the U.S. manufacturing sector because of his tariffs on imports, even as the new duties have seen the stock market plunge.

“They don't want to pay 25% or whatever it may be,” Trump said of companies, referring to the rate he wants to set on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as all steel and aluminum imports. “It may go up higher. Look, the higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build (in the United States).”

Last week, Trump agreed to postpone until early April tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that fall under the USCMA, a free trade deal he signed in 2019. They make up 50% of Mexican goods coming into the U.S. and 38% of those from Canada.

In a wild day of trading, U.S. stocks reversed course late Tuesday after Ford said he would suspend the electricity surcharge. Stocks closed lower but cut their steep early losses, which were initially prompted by Ford's threat of adding a 25% fee to U.S. electricity users in three border states, followed by Trump saying he would retaliate by doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.

The S&P 500 index ended down 0.76%, or 42.49 points, to 5,572.07. The blue-chip Dow shed 1.14%, or 478.23 points, to 41,433.48. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.18%, or 32.23 points, to 17,436.10 after posting its worst day since September 2022 on Monday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.284%.

The stock market convulsions amid a series of escalating trade moves, including tariffs on Mexico and China, have some economists fearing a recession and the return of higher inflation, which has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.

Trump would not rule out an economic slowdown in an interview that aired over the weekend. “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big," Trump said in an interview that aired on "Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo."

Several companies − from retail giants Walmart, Kohl's and Dick's to airlines such as Delta and Southwest – said they're bracing for a possible slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers account for about 70% of the economy. Recent surveys show consumers growing less optimistic.

Small business sentiment has also been dented. The National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index showed sentiment declining and uncertainty over the outlook rising. The Uncertainty Index rose to the second-highest reading in the survey's history, which dates to 1973.

Wednesday's closely watched report on inflation in February should bring modest relief, but the reprieve may be brief, with Trump's escalating trade war set to drive prices higher later this year.

The overall consumer price index likely increased 0.3% last month, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a relatively large bump, but it's less than January's 0.5% rise and it would lower the annual inflation reading from 3% to 2.9% − still above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.

A core inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy items likely also rose 0.3%, economists predict, down from 0.4% the previous month. That would nudge the yearly increase from 3.3% to 3.2%. The price increases will likely be fueled by familiar culprits such as used cars, auto insurance and eggs, forecasters say.

Although most of Trump's tariffs have yet to take effect, they're already affecting businesses' pricing decisions and pushing some costs higher, Wells Fargo wrote in a note to clients.

Ford said Tuesday that Trump launched an “unprovoked attack” on Canada when he increased the steel and aluminum tariffs.

“We will not back down. We will be relentless. I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs. And it's unacceptable,” Ford said on MSNBC.

Ford said CEOs should try to change Trump's mind. 

“You see the market tumbling. Consumer confidence is down,'' he said. "And if he continues on with this, assembly plants in Michigan will shut down, and around the country, whoever makes autos, and as well as businesses, they're going to hurt.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the plunging stock market as “a snapshot in a moment in time” and blamed former President Joe Biden for the ongoing economic turbulence – even though it is Trump's tariffs that have rattled Wall Street.

“We are in a period of economic transition,” Leavitt said at a Tuesday briefing with reporters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 3.6% since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have erased its post-election gains as well. Like Trump, Leavitt did not rule out a recession but pointed to Trump's first term in office as reason for economic optimism today.

“Look at President Trump's results in his first term. If people are looking for certainty, they should look at the record of this president,” Leavitt said.

Tariffs are likely to disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of transportation, which will lead to a rise in price for almost everything, Truist head of U.S. economics Mike Skordeles previously told USA TODAY. 

"Broadly speaking, higher tariffs will increase import costs, forcing companies to choose between absorbing the hit to their margins or passing it on to consumers," said Madhav Durbha, a supply chain expert and group vice president of consumer-packaged goods and manufacturing at RELEX. "Either way, this creates inflationary pressure and dampens consumer spending, impacting not only individual companies but the broader market." 

As previously reported, the U.S. auto industry and a broad array of common imports from Canada to the U.S. could be affected by the tariffs, according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics. For consumers, that could mean higher prices for appliances, cereal, milk products, alcoholic beverages and more.  

Not everybody's upset about Trump's tariffs. Those imposed on steel are “absolutely good” for American steel makers, said Philip K. Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.

The U.S. produced 90 million tons of steel in 2023, ranking fourth in the world after China, India and Japan, according to worldsteel.org. But Bell said American manufacturers are tired of imported steel undercutting their profits because of previous tariffs and exemptions, and Trump wants to “level the playing field.” 

“The president understands the enormous power of tariffs and how they can fundamentally reshape our trade relations that have unfairly cost America in terms of value,” Bell said.

He said Mexican companies were importing cheap steel from China, making some alterations and exporting it to the U.S. like it was produced in Mexico. He added the Biden administration tried stopping that last year and applied a 25% tariff on Mexican steel that was melted or poured outside North America before it was a completed product. But it wasn't enough, Bell argues. 

“For far too long, those Mexican companies were allowed to use loopholes allowing other countries to dump their steel into our market,” Bell said. “It's time to stop that.”

Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called the U.S. announcement of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum "incredibly destructive."

"This series of escalations is quickly hitting a ceiling where Americans and Canadians are set to feel the hurt," Laing said in a statement. "The stock market volatility is a glaring signal that this economic chaos must end."

She said similar tariffs on steel and aluminum during Trump's first term led to a net loss of tens of thousands of American blue-collar jobs.

"Steel and aluminum are about strength; these tariffs do nothing but weaken us both,'' Laing said. "President Trump may as well hand over North America's steel and aluminum leadership to China."

For a nation facing a housing affordability crisis, a deepening trade war comes at the wrong time. As USA TODAY previously reported, an initial round of tariffs proposed for Canada, Mexico and China would have added about 5%, or $21,000, to the cost of the median-priced newly built home.

Nearly three-quarters of imported sawmill wood products come from Canada, according to an analysis from an industry consultant. Canada also supplies about 11% of the hardware used in residential construction.

With the stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a recession amid Trump's widening global trade war and federal job cuts.

It isn't – yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape and the nation's businesses generally remain optimistic despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say.

A recession is informally considered at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. But the technical definition is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.

The measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria. An economic tailspin is typically accompanied by hundreds of thousands or millions of net job losses.

More U.S. airlines cut their earnings estimates on Tuesday, following Delta Air Lines and citing mounting economic uncertainty triggering a pullback in corporate and consumer spending. United Airlines said its first-quarter earnings are now expected to come in at the lower end of its forecast because of a 50% drop in government-related travel bookings.

"Economic uncertainty is a big deal," American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said at a J.P. Morgan industry conference.

Negative consumer sentiment among Canadians about U.S. products has erupted, and American liquor, wine and spirits are the first targets.

Many Canadian stores have been pulling American alcohol brands off shelves as part of retaliatory measures to Trump's tariffs on Canadian products, which is temporarily on hold until April 2. The maker of Jack Daniel's called the removal of his company's whiskey from Canadian shelves “worse than a tariff.”

Asked at a media briefing Tuesday if Canada is still a close ally, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the country as a neighbor and a partner. "They have always been an ally,'' she said. "Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now."

She also reiterated Trump's far-fetched desire for Canada to join the U.S. as a state, which Canadian leaders oppose. “He believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America,” she said.

Leavitt said Trump has not yet spoken with Mark Carney, who is set to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister after Carney won Sunday's Liberal Party election.

Trump on Tuesday once again expressed his desire to see the U.S. absorb its northern neighbor. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly suggested he wants to annex Canada and has referred to its outgoing prime minister as "Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada" − much to the aggravation of Trudeau and many Canadians.

“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's overtures were panned by Carney on Sunday in his first speech after winning the leadership of the governing Labor Party.

Canada “never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form,” said Carney, adding that people “are worried about Canada's future, in the face of President Trump's threats and a more divided and dangerous world.”

Unfazed, Trump wrote Tuesday on his social media post that by Canada joining the U.S., the “greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever − And Canada will be a big part of that.”

“The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World,” he wrote.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to turbocharge the economy, declaring he'd work a "miracle" that would bring about "extraordinary" boom times. Rallying in Grand Rapids, Mich., the day before the election, Trump predicted his promised victory would swiftly improve the job market and fatten wallets.

"We're just one day... a half a day... away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen," the former and future Republican president declared as the crowd held up signs reading "Dream big. Again!" and "Trump will fix it."

Now − nearly two months into a second Trump term − his administration is bracing Americans for economic turbulence as last year'scampaign rhetoric collides with the reality of an increasingly uncertain economy. Read more here.

Groups that represent generic drug manufacturers and hospital pharmacists have warned tariffs on Chinese imports could impact both drug prices and supplies.

China is among the largest suppliers of ingredients used in generic drugs. Generic drugs are less expensive than brand name drugs and manufacturers buy drug ingredients from large factories in China and India that can make these ingredients more cheaply than in the United States. About 90% of U.S. prescriptions are generics.

The Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic drug manufacturers, has warned the tariffs could increase drug shortages. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists warned the extra costs from tariffs, combined with Biden-era inflation penalties levied on drug companies that raise prices more than the rate of inflation, could exacerbate drug shortages.

Against the backdrop of recession concerns, Americans are yet again bracing for a possible government shutdown. Congress has until 11:59 p.m. on Friday to pass legislation to keep the government funded. Otherwise, a majority of federal employees will go without pay or be forced to stop working while most government services pause.

House Republicans unveiled a spending bill, supported by Trump, that keeps the government running until Sept. 30. The vote on the bill, known as a continuing resolution, is expected later Tuesday. But it's unclear whether the bill has enough support to pass the House. Some Democrats have already spoken out against it.

• “Urgent safety recommendations”: Helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a briefing as the NTSB unveiled “urgent safety recommendations” after the deadly mid-air collision in January.
    


• Thousands of near-miss events: The warning signs leading up to the disaster over the Potomac River were there, NTSB investigators said in their preliminary report, citing data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over years.
    


• About the crash: All 67 people on the aircraft — 64 on the American Airlines plane and three in the Blackhawk helicopter — died in the January 29 collision. It was the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.



Our live coverage of today's briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board has concluded. Please scroll through the posts below or read the main takeaways here.



            The National Transportation Safety Board today recommended that helicopter traffic be banned from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, hours later, agreed to adopt the recommendation and continue with flight restrictions put in place after a deadly midair collision in January, saying the nation was “threading the needle” in allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft.
    


            The “urgent safety recommendation” is part of the NTSB's preliminary report on the midair collision between a passenger jet and a US Army helicopter in which 67 people were killed in the deadliest crash in the US in nearly two decades. The report did not identify the probable cause of the crash — which is expected to take more than a year.
    


Here are some key takeaways from the NTSB's preliminary report:



            The Federal Aviation Administration will adopt certain restrictions on helicopter routes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, following a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board Tuesday, according to Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.
    


            On Tuesday, the NTSB unveiled the preliminary report for the deadly midair collision that killed 67 people in January. In the report, the agency called for helicopters to be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33.
    


            ”We're in a situation where we're threading the needle allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft,” Duffy told reporters. “And why this information wasn't studied and known before January 29 is an important question.”
    


            By tomorrow, he said there will be notice for pilots details on the route changes.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that while reviewing 944,179 operations between October 2021 and December 2024, investigators uncovered 15,214 occurrences of “near-miss events” where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            CNN's Pete Muntean asked the secretary how upsetting the data was for the close calls at the DC airport.
    


        “The data was there, it wasn't effectively analyzed to see that we had this kind of risk at DCA,” Duffy said. “It makes me angry. Maybe there was too much data coming in, and it's easy, maybe, to look back and say, ‘you should have seen it.' Looking forward, it can be more challenging, but it seems pretty clear someone should have seen because pilots were talking about it. We've heard news stories, social media posts of pilots talk about these near misses, it's not like it was hidden in the data somewhere, if someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this.”
    





            Duffy said he spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Tuesday about giving the military and Department of Defense a route around the restricted airspace. Duffy said there still will be exclusions for presidential air travel, vice presidential air travel, life-saving missions or law enforcement.
    


            American Airlines and the largest pilot union in the world are expressing their support for the National Transportation Safety Board's new safety recommendation issued after the start of an investigation into the deadly collision earlier this year.
    


            The NTSB released a preliminary report on its investigation Tuesday, detailing much of its fact-finding efforts, but stopping short of offering analysis on the cause of the collision. The collision happened between an American Airlines plane and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport near Washington, DC.
    


        “We continue to mourn the lives lost in the tragic accident involving Flight 5342. We're grateful for the National Transportation Safety Board's urgent safety recommendations to restrict helicopter traffic near DCA and for its thorough investigation,” American Airlines said in a statement.
    





            NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the board recommends that helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33.
    


        “We are grateful to the NTSB for this preliminary report of their already extensive investigative work, which we were proud to support,” Capt. Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a statement. “Our efforts to advance aviation safety never stops, and as our industry processes recent events, it's more important than ever for all operators in our national airspace to remain vigilant and return to fundamentals.”
    





            All 64 people on the American Airlines plane and three people in the Blackhawk helicopter died in the crash, which is the deadliest aviation accident in the United States in almost two decades.
    


            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy, in a message for people flying in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, said “aviation is incredibly safe.”
    


        “I just flew with my daughter out of DCA,” she said in a press conference on Tuesday. “Aviation is incredibly safe. DCA is where I always fly out of. I say often that your biggest risk is in your personal vehicle when you're going to and from the aircraft at the airport. Aviation is safe.”
    





            “However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero. And so, that is the role of the NTSB in investigating. This is why we issue urgent safety recommendations,” she added.
    


            Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, dodged a question from reporters about if the deadly mid-air collision between a plane and an Army helicopter could have been prevented with more staffing.
    


            The crash that happened at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport outside Washington, DC, killed a total of 67 people.
    


        “I assume you mean on air traffic control,” Homendy said in response to the question. “That is part of our investigation and is part of the analysis phase of our investigation. Right now, we are collecting facts on air traffic control. In our preliminary report today, we will mention that there were five controllers on position.”
    





            She said there were nine controllers total in the tower, some were in the break room.
    


            At the time of the collision, one controller was working two positions in the tower, investigators previously said.
    


            “We are taking a look at that. We do not have any evidence that anybody left. In fact, the controller came back into rotation around 4:27 p.m.,” she said, adding that two other positions were also combined for the entire day, “which is not abnormal.”
    


            The preliminary report also outlines that the American Airlines flight was communicating with the control tower on one frequency, and the helicopter pilots were using another. Because of this, the crews of each flight “were not able to hear each other's transmissions to the controller, but the controller's transmissions to each aircraft would be audible to both flight crews,” the report said.
    


This post has been updated with additional details from the report.



            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said she is devastated for the families who lost loved ones in the mid-air collision in January.
    


        “It's an intolerable risk to aviation safety, and we have called on DOT, FAA to take action” she said. “… It does make me angry, but it also makes me feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. It shouldn't take tragedy like this to occur. Unfortunately, one did.”
    





            “It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action” when there were clear indicators where safety trending could have occurred, she added.
    


Some context: Homendy cited data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over a few years. The NTSB said Tuesday investigators uncovered 15,214 “near-miss events” between October 2021 and December 2024, where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            “That data from October 2021 through December 2024, (the FAA) could have used that information any time to determine that we have a trend here and a problem here, and looked at that route; that didn't occur, which is why we're taking action today. But unfortunately, people lost lives, and loved ones are grieving,” she later added.
    


            The warning signs leading up to the deadly disaster over the Potomac River were there, investigators said, citing data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over years.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that while reviewing 944,179 operations between October 2021 and December 2024, investigators uncovered 15,214 occurrences of “near-miss events” where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            There were also 85 cases where two aircraft were laterally separated by less than 1,500 feet and a vertical separation of less than 200 feet.
    


        “We remain concerned about the significant potential for a future mid-air collision at DCA, which is why we are recommending a permanent solution today,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said.
    





            The National Transportation Safety Board is concerned about more collisions involving helicopters near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in the future, the board's chair, Jennifer Homendy, said Tuesday.
    


            It comes after the NTSB released an preliminary report on the collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines plane earlier this year. A total of 67 people were killed in the crash, which is the deadliest aviation accident in the United States in almost two decades.
    


            Homendy said that following the collision, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy moved to restrict helicopter traffic around the airport and over the Potomac River until the end of March.
    


        With that restriction soon lifting, “We remain concerned about the significant potential for future mid-air collision at DCA,” Homendy said.
    





            The National Transportation Safety Board found that a majority of encounters between commercial aircrafts and helicopters happened on the plane's approach to landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
    


        “RAs indicate a collision threat and require immediate action. In over half of the encounters we reviewed, again from 2011 thru 2024, the helicopter may have been above the route altitude restriction. Two-thirds of the events occurred at night,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, referring to Resolution Advisories, which are messages from the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) to a pilot to avoid a potential collision.
    





            In the preliminary report released by NTSB, the board reviewed information gathered from voluntary safety reporting programs along with Federal Aviation Administration data “regarding encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near DCA from 2011 through 2024 indicated that a vast majority of the reported events occurred on approach to landing.”
    


            According to the report, the “Initial analysis found that at least one TCAS resolution advisory (RA) was triggered per month due to proximity to a helicopter. In over half of these instances, the helicopter may have been above the route altitude restriction.”
    


            Helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a briefing Tuesday.
    


            The helicopter route a US Army Black Hawk was following when it collided with an American Airlines regional jet on January 29 should be closed under certain conditions, according to a new recommendation from the NTSB.
    


        “Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,” Homendy told reporters. “We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.”
    





            The recommendation reads, “Prohibit operations on helicopter Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when runways 15 and 33 are being used for departures and arrivals, respectively, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport,” and also calls for the designation of “an alternative helicopter route that can be used to facilitate travel between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when that segment of Route 4 is closed.”
    


            The investigative agency's “urgent safety recommendations” comes as part of its preliminary report on the mid-air collision that killed 67 people nearly six weeks ago.
    


            Right now, planes at the airport are stopped for necessary helicopter flights — like when President Donald Trump leaves the White House on Marine One — which has led to flight delays and diversions.
    


            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy started Tuesday's news conference by previewing what is in the board's preliminary report releasing today.
    


            Here's a broad list of things in the report, according to Homendy:
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is still in “the fact-finding phase” of its investigation into the collision between a helicopter and American Airlines plane near Washington, DC, in late January, the board's chair said Tuesday.
    


        “I often say that the easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference.
    





            She reiterated that the information included in the preliminary report, which the board released today, contains “only the facts that we're able to validate and release at this time.”
    


            These facts, Homendy said, will serve “as the foundation” for the NTSB's analysis of what happened and subsequent safety recommendations.
    


            “If we still have questions on something, or there's an area that we need to do more investigative work on, we're going to do that work, and that takes time,” she said.
    


This post has been updated with more comments from Homendy.



            The National Transportation Safety Board issued a preliminary report Tuesday on a collision between a passenger plane and US Army helicopter, the deadliest accident in the US in nearly 20 years.
    


            American Eagle flight 5342 was moments away from landing on that runway when the military helicopter struck the jet's right side at an altitude of roughly 300 feet, investigators said.
    


            Tuesday's report did not identify the “probable cause” of the accident, which is expected to take more than a year. The incident killed 67 people involved.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will hold a news conference after the National Transportation Safety Board issues its preliminary report on January's mid-air collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
    


            Duffy's news conference is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET.
    


            Before American Eagle Flight 5342 took to the air from Wichita, Kansas, on the evening of January 29, on its way to the nation's capital, figure skater Spencer Lane snapped a photo of the plane's wing stretched out over the tarmac toward the horizon.
    


            A grayish-blue overcast sky formed a shimmery curtain over the setting sun in the image the teenager posted to his Instagram Stories. The up-and-coming skater wrote “ICT->DCA,” referencing the airport codes for the departure and destination cities.
    


            Lane, his mother, as well as other budding skating stars, their families and coaches from the US and Russia awaited their departure after attending the US Figure Skating Championships and a development camp for young athletes.
    


            At Reagan National Airport, Hamaad Raza received a text message from his wife: The flight was about 20 minutes from touching down. He later showed the message to a reporter for CNN affiliate WUSA.
    


            Tragically, all 67 people on board the American Airlines regional jet and US Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair in late January lost their lives in the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.
    


            Among the victims were three soldiers aboard the helicopter, four members of the jet's flight crew, 28 skaters and family members affiliated with US Figure Skating, seven friends on a hunting trip and other passengers who are mourned by their family and friends.
    


These are some of the victims of the tragedy and how loved ones remember them: 



A family of four from Virginia: Everly Livingston, 14, and her sister Alydia, 11, were promising young figure skaters, dad Peter Livingston played hockey and mom Donna was very active in the girls' lives, family friend Kim Urban previously told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The family was on their way home from Wichita, where they participated in events surrounding the US Figure Skating Championships. “The Livingstons were just — they were just a big personality family. They were loving, they were thoughtful. Donna and Peter were extraordinarily supportive parents. They were loving parents. They were doing anything for their children,” Urban said. “Alydia and Everly were … bright children, very talented skaters and super bubbly.”
    


A female Black Hawk pilot: The pilot who was co-piloting the aircraft when it collided with the passenger plane was a “driven and hardworking” officer who “was made for” Army aviation, those who knew her recalled to CNN. The Army officially identified the pilot as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, one of the three-person crew inside the UH-60 Black Hawk. A statement released by the Lobach family called her a “bright star” who was “kind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious and strong.”
    


Asra Hussain Raza: A daughter of Indian immigrants, she graduated with honors in 2020 from Indiana University and married her college sweetheart in August 2023, her father-in-law, Dr. Hashim Raza, told CNN. “She went out of her way for everybody,” he said.

            The collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter on January 29 over the Potomac River left no survivors.
    


            The passenger jet was carrying 64 people, while the Army helicopter was operated by three personnel. Among the dead were American Airlines pilots Jonathan Campos and Samuel Lilley, two flight attendants, and several members of the US figure skating community, according to friends, family and sports groups.
    


            Data shows that while some years in the 1990s saw hundreds of flight fatalities, total fatalities since 2002 have amounted to fewer than 200.
    


CNN's Rebekah Riess and Lex Harvey contributed to this report. 



            Authorities will give an update today on the January mid-air collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash — which killed all 64 people on the plane and all three people in the helicopter — became the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.
    


            Here is what we know about the crash:
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board will provide an update today on their investigation of the January 29 mid-air collision between a US Army helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet landing near Washington DC.
    


            NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and Brice Banning, the investigator-in-charge, will provide the update at 2 p.m. ET.
    


            The briefing will focus on factual information, but it will not identify a probable cause of the crash. A final conclusion on that usually takes more than a year.
    


            A total of 67 people were killed in the crash, which is the deadliest aviation accident in the United States in almost two decades.

The Transportation Department quickly agreed to the NTSB's recommendations.

The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday called for immediate changes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, saying the current helicopter routes around the busy airport "pose an intolerable risk to aviation safety" in the wake of January's collision that killed 67 people.

The NTSB is recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration permanently ban helicopter operations near Reagan when runways 15 and 33 are in use and designate an alternative helicopter route for pilots, Chairman Jennifer Homendy said during a news conference.

After Homendy's announcement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy quickly said the Department of Transportation will immediately follow the NTSB's recommendations and keep helicopter restrictions in place, noting that some modifications might be made to the current restrictions. (Duffy put a temporary ban in place after the crash; that ban was set to expire at the end of March.)

On Tuesday, families of the victims of the deadly collision said in a statement that the report highlights how "serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety."

"This was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of broader failures in our aviation safety system," the statement read. "If the necessary reforms had been implemented sooner, Flight 5342 likely would have landed safely and our family members would be home with us."

During the new conference, Homendy outlined a history of close calls at Reagan and said the NTSB continues to investigate the devastating crash between an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter that killed everyone on board both aircraft.

The crash happened on the night of Jan. 29 when the PSA Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, with 64 people on board, was about to land at Reagan (DCA). The three soldiers in the helicopter were conducting an annual training flight and night vision goggle check at the time of the collision.

Between October 2021 and December 2024, there were 944,179 commercial operations at Reagan, Homendy said. During that time, there were 15,214 close proximity events between commercial airplanes and helicopters with a lateral separation of less than 1 nautical mile and a vertical separation of less than 400 feet, she said. There were 85 events where the lateral separation was less than 1,500 feet and the vertical separation was less than 200 feet, she said.

Helicopters on "the Route 4 helicopter corridor at the maximum authorized altitude of 200 feet could have only about 75 feet of vertical separation from an airplane on landing approach to Runway 33," the NTSB said in a statement. "Vertical separation could potentially be even less than 75 feet depending on the helicopter's lateral distance from the Potomac River shoreline or if an approaching airplane was below the designated visual glidepath to Runway 33."

Homendy said 75 feet is an "intolerable risk to aviation safety."

"It does make me angry. But it also makes me feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones," Homendy said. "It shouldn't take tragedy like this to occur. Unfortunately, one did, and so we are calling on action, but there clearly were indicators where safety trending could have occurred."

American Airlines said in a statement, "We continue to mourn the lives lost in the tragic accident involving Flight 5342. We're grateful for the National Transportation Safety Board's urgent safety recommendations to restrict helicopter traffic near DCA and for its thorough investigation."

Encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near Reagan show that, from 2011 through 2024, a vast majority of reported events occurred on approach to landing, Homendy said.

At least one Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) resolution advisory -- the most serious warning that tells the pilots to take immediate evasive action to avoid a collision -- was triggered per month at Reagan due to proximity to a helicopter from 2011 to 2024, Homendy said.

In more than half of the encounters the NTSB reviewed, the helicopter may have been flying above the altitude restriction, Homendy said. Two-thirds of the encounters occurred at night.

The NTSB's investigation is ongoing. Homendy said the NTSB will conduct a number of simulations, conduct additional interviews, and continue to examine radio altimeters, barometric altimeters and additional electronics.

After Homendy's news conference, Duffy also addressed the media on Tuesday, and he criticized the FAA and the previous administration for not identifying the hot spots earlier.

The FAA has deployed artificial intelligence tools to look through the data and identify potential hot spots in the airspace at other airports, Duffy said. The AI technology is currently in place at 12 airports, and he said the FAA plans to incorporate it across the country.

"If there's another DCA-esque situation out there, our AI tools will help us identify those and take corrective actions preemptively, as opposed to retroactively," he said.

Duffy also further discussed upgrades that he said will be made to runway safety and technology. To expedite the process, Duffy said he will ask Congress for money up front.

Homendy said last month there was no indication the helicopter crew was aware of the impending situation.

The soldiers may have had "bad data" on the altitude from their altimeter, as the pilots had differing altitudes in the seconds before the crash, Homendy said. One helicopter pilot thought they were at 400 feet and the other thought they were at 300 feet, she noted.

The transmission from the tower that instructed the helicopter to go behind the plane may not have been heard by the crew because the pilot may have keyed her radio at the same second and stepped on the transmission from air traffic control, or ATC, the NTSB added.

The Black Hawk crew was likely wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight, Homendy said.

Federal investigators looking for the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday to improve safety, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal investigators looking into the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy laid out frightening statistics about near misses to underscore the danger that has existed for years near Ronald Reagan National Airport and expressed anger that it took a midair collision for it to come to light.

In just over three years, she said, there were 85 close calls when a few feet (meters) in the wrong direction could have resulted in the same kind of accident that happened Jan. 29 when the military helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching the airport.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he'll adopt the NTSB's recommendations for the route where the midair collision occurred. He noted there will be some modifications in the guidelines to be released Wednesday, including allowing presidential flights and lifesaving missions.

Helicopters no longer will be “threading the needle” flying under landing planes, he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending a ban on some helicopter flights in the area where a military chopper and a passenger jet collided near Washington, D.C. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The Federal Aviation Administration also will use artificial intelligence to analyze data from every airport to make sure there aren't similar dangers elsewhere, he said, adding that there are other airports with cross-traffic.




Homendy and Duffy both said the hazards at Reagan airport should have been recognized earlier by the FAA.

“The data was there. It wasn't effectively analyzed to see we had this risk,” Duffy said.

The NTSB determined that the existing separation distance between planes and helicopters at Reagan airport is “insufficient and poses an intolerable risk to aviation safety,” Homendy said. 

She said she was devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. Among the victims were 28 members of the figure skating community.

“It shouldn't take tragedy to require immediate action,” she said.

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident.

“It also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety,” the statement said.

Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems.

“Those charged in transportation with the highest duty of care can't run yellow lights, and they've been running flashing red lights for years, it sounds like, and it's just pathetic,” he said.

Under current practice helicopters and planes can be as close as 75 feet (23 meters) apart from each other during landing, Homendy said. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said.

Investigators determined that planes got serious alerts to take evasive action because they were too close to a helicopter at least once a month between October 2011 and December 2024, Homendy said. In over half those instances, the helicopter may have been above its established altitude restriction for the route.

Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General of the U.S. Transportation Department, called it a “shocking dereliction of duty” for the FAA to have failed to act on data the NTSB gathered in just a few weeks since the crash. She noted that the FAA had pledged to warn pilots about places with higher collision risk.

“They were going to really be proactive to warn pilots about these hotspots. I mean, this is beyond a hotspot,” Schiavo said. “This is absolutely radioactive, to have 15,214 close proximity events in three years, it's unbelievable.”

Following the midair collision, the FAA took steps to restrict helicopter flights around the airport to ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace. Now flights are put on hold temporarily when helicopters need to pass by.

The NTSB's proposal would close a vital route for law enforcement, Coast Guard patrols and government operations flights at times, but only when the runways in question are in use, and they account for only about 5% of flights at Reagan.

Homendy said the NTSB is recommending that the FAA find a “permanent solution” for alternate routes farther away for helicopter traffic.

Investigators have said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters), which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for the location. 

The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was turning toward a different runway, Homendy said last month. And the crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.

The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 and a crew chief with nearly 1,150. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.

The NTSB in its ongoing investigation will look at the amount of traffic at Reagan and the staffing in the control tower to determine if either of those factors played a role. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report.

Aviation safety expert John Cox said he piloted in and out of Reagan in all different kinds of planes since the late 1970s and sometimes received collision alerts about helicopters, but it was usually easy to see that they were going to pass behind him.

“That's just something that occurred going in and out of there, and it worked successfully for decades,” said Cox, who is CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Multiple things had to go wrong for this collision to happen, he added.

Within just a month's time earlier this year, there were four major aviation disasters in North America, most recently in mid-February when a Delta flight flipped and landed on its roof at Toronto's Pearson Airport, injuring 21 people. 

Those accidents and close calls left some worried about the safety of flying, though fatal crashes are rare and U.S. airlines' track record is remarkably sound.

President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. He also faulted the helicopter for flying too high. 

Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports. 

Doug Lane, whose wife Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son Spencer, died in the crash, said Tuesday he hopes the way the near-misses are reported gets a closer look and that NTSB recommendations will be implemented.

“If we're going to invest in an organization like this, it needs to be outfitted with state of the art technology and given staffing at a level that's going to set them up for success,” Lane said.

Duffy said Tuesday that he will present an expensive plan to Congress within the next few weeks to overhaul the system with new technology. He hopes to complete it within four years.

Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate. 

The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check. 

But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations — and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid. 

"People generally do not know they are overpaid — you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount," Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. "People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have."

The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.

Here's what to know. 

Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as "improper," which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars. 

From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time. 

The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:

Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.  

And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.

However, there are cases where seniors receive "strategic overpayments," said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit. 

In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.

Some seniors decide, "'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over" that limit, Weir said.

But seniors who now opt for a "strategic overpayment" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added. 

The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. 

The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.

Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks. 

The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue. 

It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said. 

"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare," Weir said. "It's a trickle down effect."

Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023. 

Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through SSA form 632, Weir noted. 

"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay," he said.

You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561. 

Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.

"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it," Weir said on his webcast. "Always appeal everything."

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday he had agreed to suspend a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the United States after having conversed with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to hike steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada to 50%. 

In a statement issued with Lutnick and posted on X, Ford said he and Lutnick would meet Thursday alongside the U.S. trade representative to discuss renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade act before Trump's self-imposed April 2 "reciprocal tariff deadline."

"In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota," Ford said.

In subsequent remarks at the White House, Trump said Tuesday afternoon he was now looking at reducing tariffs on Canada. Asked whether he would lower them, he said, “Probably so.”

"I'll let you know" whether 50% tariffs on Canada are going into effect, he said.

Major stock indexes, which had plunged on Trump's earlier tariffs threat, rallied into the green upon the suspension announcement.

Trump had posted on Truth Social Tuesday that steel and aluminum tariffs would go from 25% to 50% starting Wednesday in response to Ontario's placing a 25% tariff on electricity exported to the United States.

Trump added that he would declare a "national emergency" for the three states Ontario has targeted so the tariffs could go into effect.

Trump also called on Canada to drop its duties on U.S. dairy products and threatened to "substantially increase" tariffs on cars imported into the United States if Canada did not drop "other egregious, long time tariffs."The auto tariffs, Trump warned, without citing evidence, “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.”

Trump then doubled down on some of his recent rhetoric about making Canada part of the United States, though he added it would get to keep its national anthem.

"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State," Trump wrote. "This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear."

Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second presidential term, putting the United States' closest ally on rockier footing. Earlier this month, Trump instituted, then pulled back, tariffs on a variety of Canadian goods as he goaded its leaders and blamed them for a lack of action on fentanyl trafficking. (Relatively little of the drug is seized at the northern border compared with the U.S. border with Mexico).

In another Truth Social post late Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser.” 

“The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” he warned, adding: “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.”

While Mexico has faced similar tariff threats and rhetoric, its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has succeeded in assuaging Trump.

The strategy has not worked for Canadian officials, who have more aggressively retaliated with tariffs and public comments.

“I'm not too sure why he continues to attack his closest friends and allies, but we need the American people to speak up,” Ford said Tuesday in an appearance on CNBC. “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of them and tell them this is going to be a disaster. It's mass chaos right now.”

CNBC had reported that Trump had not yet signed formal paperwork to officially increase the tariffs to 50%, citing a senior administration official who added it was “in the works” and remained “a threat” rather than an action, until the paperwork was prepared and signed.

Newly appointed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney subsequently called Trump's threats "an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses."

"My government will ensure our response has maximum impact in the U.S. and minimal impact here in Canada, while supporting the workers impacted," Carney said.

He said Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods would remain "until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade."

Morgan Stanley analysts warned that because the United States is a net importer of steel and aluminum from Canada, the tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices. As an example, although steelmaker Alcoa's stateside facilities would benefit from higher tariffs, it has an even larger presence north of the border.

“We expect a net negative impact to the company as a whole,” the analysts wrote.

Some investors disagreed, sending shares of the Pennsylvania-based firm more 2% higher Tuesday.

The New York Independent System Operator, which manages the state's grid, had said there was enough generating capacity to transition away from Canadian sources. A spokesperson for Michigan's Public Service Commission told The Associated Press on Monday that the impact on the state's residents was likely to be “small.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate — likewise expected minimal impact for his state.

The U.S. federal agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents is calling for immediate changes at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. following a deadly mid-air collision involving an American Airlines flight and a U.S. Army helicopter earlier this year.

The National Transportation Safety Board issued an "urgent recommendation report" Tuesday, pressing for the Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit helicopters from flying on "Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when runways 15 and 33 are being used for departures and arrivals."

The NTSB also urged the FAA to designate an alternative helicopter route that can be used when those runways are in use.

The recommended changes are in response to the crash that occurred on Jan. 29, when an American Airlines regional jet traveling from Wichita, Kansas, was preparing to land at Reagan National Airport. The jet collided with a Black Hawk helicopter conducting a training flight.

Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard.

NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy has cautioned that the radio altitudes captured by flight recorders and the altitudes the flight crews saw from their main instruments may have conflicted. Officials said the collision likely occurred just under 300 feet — well above the helicopters 200-foot limit in that area.

The NTSB has not yet issued a final report about the crash, maintaining that all of its investigative findings are preliminary. Homendy reiterated to reporters Tuesday that it will take time to completely analyze all of the data and variables involved in the incident.

The United States will immediately lift a pause on intelligence sharing and resume providing security assistance to Ukraine after delegates from Kyiv agreed to accept the Trump administration's proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire with Russia.

"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties," according to a joint statement issued Tuesday after meetings in Saudi Arabia. 

"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace," the statement added.

The Kremlin did not immediately comment. 

The future of U.S. support for Kyiv has been in grave doubt since an extraordinary on-camera spat between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. In the wake of that confrontation, Trump's administration paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made a series of policy moves heralding a more cooperative stance toward Russia, traditionally considered a key geopolitical foe of the West. Trump, for his part, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy — not Vladimir Putin — a dictator.

Trump briefly addressed the 30-day ceasefire announcement outside the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters: "Ukraine has agreed to it and hopefully Russia will agree to it." Asked whether Zelenskyy would be invited back to the White House, Trump responded: "Sure, absolutely."

Zelenskyy welcomed the ceasefire proposal as a "positive step," saying in his nightly address to the nation that Ukraine wants to "do everything to achieve peace as quickly and reliably as possible — so that war never returns."

In Tuesday's joint statement, the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations said Trump and Zelenskyy had "agreed to conclude as soon as possible" a deal to develop Ukraine's critical mineral resources, a pact designed to "expand" Ukraine's economy and "guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security."

The minerals deal was halted after the Trump-Zelenskyy clash.

"The delegations also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the above-mentioned ceasefire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children," the joint statement said.

The announcement came hours after Russia said it had shot down more than 330 Ukrainian drones. Two people were killed and 18 were injured in the offensive, which Russian authorities said was the largest attack on Moscow and the surrounding area since Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.

Kyiv said its targets included oil production and pipeline control facilities.

The talks in Saudi Arabia were anchored by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Andriy Yermak, the chief of Zelenskyy's presidential office.

"Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace," the joint statement said.

"The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace," the statement added.

At one point during Tuesday's talks in the coastal city of Jeddah, journalists were ushered in for a briefing with Rubio and Waltz, only to be ushered out when the conversation kept going. 

Kyiv's delegation had promised a news conference but scaled down to a briefing with only Ukrainian journalists, highlighting the fraught nature of the discussions.

                On Feb. 6, salvage crews work on recovering wreckage in the Potomac River near where an American Airlines jet and a Black Hawk helicopter collided in midair as the jet was about to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29.

The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board says that "there's a serious safety issue" in the airspace surrounding Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 

The NTSB's Jennifer Homendy called on the Federal Aviation Administration to implement several "urgent safety recommendations" during a Tuesday news conference. Her comments followed the release of a preliminary investigation report into the Jan. 29 midair collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet, which was attempting to land at DCA airport. Both aircraft plunged into the icy Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.

Homendy described the flight patterns around DCA as "an intolerable risk" as helicopters and commercial planes operate in close proximity to each other in the busy airspace over the U.S. capital. She says an NTSB analysis found that in a 13-year period from 2011 to 2024, there was at least one "close call" each month between a commercial plane operating at DCA and a helicopter. 

In over half those encounters, Homendy said, the helicopter was operating higher than it should have been, and two-thirds of the instances were at night.

The January crash happened at night, and the collision occurred at 278 feet. The helicopter was supposed to be flying no higher than 200 feet. The NTSB said previously that it's unclear whether the altimeters in the helicopter were showing the pilots the proper altitude.

The new NTSB analysis further determined that between October 2021 and December 2024, there were a total of 944,179 commercial operations at DCA. During that time, there were 15,214 "close-proximity events" between commercial airplanes and helicopters. Of those, 85 had a horizontal separation of less than 1,500 feet and were less than 200 feet apart vertically.


                The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jennifer Homendy, speaks during a news conference at the headquarters of NTSB on Tuesday in Washington, DC. The NTSB released a report urging the FAA to take immediate action on the safety recommendations concerning the potential for midair collisions near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

"This was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of broader failures in our aviation safety system," said 18 family members of those killed on the jet in a statement. "While the NTSB's report sheds light on key factors of this event, it also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety."

"It does make me angry. I feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones," said Homendy. She told reporters the FAA could have used the same publicly accessible data that the NTSB did in its analysis. "It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action." 

Congress has taken note. "The NTSB report provides ample data that this helicopter route and the commercial aviation landing route never should have been allowed to coexist," said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. "The data also raises serious questions as to how such a route was allowed to continue when alarm bells were literally going off."

Homendy called on the FAA to make several "urgent safety recommendations." She said the FAA needs to "permanently prohibit helicopter operations" near DCA when certain runways are in use for arrivals or departures. She applauded Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who put these restrictions in place temporarily after the collision until March 31. 

Homendy says the NTSB is also examining other factors, including what the pilots of each aircraft might have seen or heard in the minutes before the accident. The NTSB will also investigate the possible role of air traffic controllers.

The FAA has been under scrutiny for a yearslong shortage of air traffic controllers. In the last month, the Trump administration began laying off hundreds of FAA employees as part of a federal effort to cut back on workers. Duffy said none of the layoffs were of existing controllers or "critical safety personnel." Still, Elon Musk of the Department of Government Efficiency pleaded last month with air traffic controllers who have recently retired to return to work.

The midair collision was the deadliest aviation accident in the U.S. since 2001. The full NTSB investigation is expected to take about a year.

Nearly two months after American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a helicopter, leading to 67 fatalities, the National Transportation Safety Board has provided an update on the investigation.  

The National Transportation Safety Board is still looking for answers. 

Nearly two months after American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a Black Hawk Army Helicopter amid its descent into Washington D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the NTSB is continuing its investigation. 

In a March 11 press conference, the safety board chair Jennifer Homendy said that army helicopters' flight patterns around the airport currently pose an "intolerable risk" for commercial flights, as there is only a definitive 75 feet of space between the flight pattern of helicopters and some descending airplanes. Therefore, the NTSB is recommending the FAA permanently suspend helicopter flights within that area of the airport. 

Indeed, Homendy detailed that out of 944,179 flights at the D.C. airport, there were 15,214 "close proximity events," or situations where there was less than one nautical mile and a vertical distance of less than 400 feet. What's more, 85 instances had a distance of less than 1500 feet horizontally and 200 feet vertically. 

"There clearly were indicators," Homendy said of a potential crash. "It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action."

She added of the American Airlines crash, "It's stronger than an oversight."

As the NTSB previously told NBC News Jan. 30, the full investigation of some evidence from the flight—which includes voice and flight data recorders from the American Airlines plane's cockpit—could take up to a year to complete. 

Updates on the Jan. 29 collision come amid a time of grieving the passengers aboard the American Airlines flight—which was traveling into D.C. from Wichita, Kansas—and the helicopter. The crash killed all 67 people aboard both aircrafts, 28 of whom were elite figure skaters on the American Airlines flight who were traveling back home after a development camp in Kansas. 

“This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions as one nation,” President Donald Trump said in a press briefing Jan. 30, shortly after confirming there were no survivors. “We grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. Figure Skating organization, who shared a tribute video Feb. 5 honoring the victims of the crash, also shared, “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts.”

In the months since the crash, loved ones to others on board have also opened up about their loss. NPR Host Adrian Ma recently detailed the loss of his girlfriend Kiah Duggins, who was set to begin teaching at Howard University School of Law shortly after the crash occurred. 

“There are reminders of Kiah everywhere,” Adrian told NPR. “Her glasses are on the nightstand. Her clothes are in the closet. Little curls of her hair are scattered around. I hear echoes of her voice sometimes, especially when I see something and I want to turn to her and say, like 'Hey, check this out' then I realize I can't do that anymore.”

As he put it, “It's just been a new level of pain that I didn't know I could experience.”

What Happened to the Passengers on American Airlines Flight 5342?

On the evening of Jan. 29, American Airlines flight 5342 traveling from Witchita, Kan., to Washington, D.C. collided with a United States Army Black Hawk helicopter near the Reagan Washington National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed on X, formerly known as Twitter. The plane carrying 60 passengers and four crew members and the helicopter, which had three people aboard, crashed into the Potomac River. 

The passenger jet, a Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-700 series twin-engine jet, was operated by American Airlines' subsidiary airline, PSA Airlines.

What was first a rescue mission became a recovery operation, with all 67 passengers in both aircraft being confirmed dead.

"Our hearts are with the victims' families as they navigate this tragic loss," Washington, D.C., officials shared in a statement Feb. 4. “We extend our deepest condolences and remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time."

The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, is still putting the pieces together but said in an update that data from air traffic control showed the helicopter appeared to be higher than the 200-foot ceiling allowed for its route.

"This data showed the Black Hawk was at 300 feet on the air traffic control display at the time of the collision. the NTSB said in a Feb. 4 investigation update. "This data is rounded to the nearest 100 feet.”

Who Was Onboard American Airlines Flight 5342?

Among the 60 passengers were 28 American figure skaters, coaches and family members who were at a camp in Wichita, Kan., according to U.S. Figure Skating.

"These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home from the National Development Camp held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships," the governing body shared in a statement obtained by NBC News. "We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts."

World champion Russian figure skating duo Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who wed in 1995, were also onboard, the sport's governing body confirmed.

Hamaad Raza, whose wife was also on the American Airlines flight, was waiting for her at the international airport.

"I'm just praying that somebody's pulling her out of the river right now as we speak," he told CBS affiliate WUSA9. "That's all I can pray for. I'm just praying to God."

Soon-to-be Howard University School of Law professor Kiah Duggins was also a passenger on the flight. The university shared that the civil rights attorney, who earned her J.D. from Havard Law School, was set to join Howard's faculty this fall.

Who Was Onboard the U.S. Army Helicopter Involved in the Collision?

The helicopter was from Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion out of Davison Army Airfield in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Public Affairs Deputy Director for Joint Task Force-National Capital Region/Military District of Washington Ron McLendon II confirmed to NBC News.

The official shared that the aircraft was in the middle of a training mission at the time of the collision. 

The passengers onboard were identified as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, Chief Warrant Officer Andrew Eaves, 39, and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28.

What Happens Next After Recover Efforts for American Airlines Flight 5342?

The FAA, U.S. Army and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the collision, with the latter taking the lead. The Pentagon has also initiated its own investigation.

While there are still more questions than answers, former NTSB and FAA investigator Jeff Guzzetti told Today that the air traffic control communications that night are "going to be scrutinized by the NTSB, that controller will be interviewed and the radar data will be looked at by the NTSB."

As of Feb. 4, NTSB investigators are continuing to transcribe the cockpit voice recorders for both aircraft, they confirmed in an update. The NTSB, in collaboration with the Naval Sea Systems Command Supervisor of Salvage and Diving , are continuing to recover the wreckage from the Potomac River. 

Who Has Spoken Out After American Airlines Flight 5342 Crashed Into the Potomac River?

President Donald J. Trump shared his condolences about the tragedy.

"I have been fully briefed on the terrible accident which just took place at Reagan National Airport," the White House statement said. "May God Bless their souls. Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders. I am monitoring the situation and will provide more details as they arise."

Ilia Malinin, the men's figure skater who won his third consecutive U.S. figure skating title in Witchita Jan. 26, confirmed he was not onboard the flight. He wrote on his Instagram Stories, "I hope and pray for everyone who was on that flight is OK." 

Wichita Mayor Lily Wu also expressed her grief, saying at a press conference that their "hearts are heavy as a city."

"We mourn with all those who have been impacted," she said. "This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Wichita, Kansas, forever."

Two-time Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan shared an emotional message to reporters about the crash that claimed the lives of six skaters from Skating Club of Boston, where the athlete also formerly trained.

"I just wanted to be here and be part of our community," Kerrigan said through tears. "When you find out you know some of the people on the plane, it's an even bigger blow.”

Konanki traveled to Punta Cana with friends for spring break.

Missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki's clothes were found on the Dominican Republic beach where authorities believe she was last seen going for a swim, two police sources with knowledge of the investigation told ABC News.

The 20-year-old Konanki, a legal permanent U.S. resident and an Indian citizen, vanished early Thursday while she and a group of students were on a spring break trip to a resort in Punta Cana, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, Sheriff's office.

Konanki and one of her traveling companions were Loudoun County residents, the sheriff's office said.

The search for Konaki continued on Tuesday, authorities said.

Konanki's clothes were discovered on a portable beach bed close to the beach where she went missing, the sources told ABC News. Police have found no evidence of violence, according to the sources.

After going to a nightclub on Wednesday night, Konanki and a group of people went to the beach about 4 a.m. local time on Thursday, the sources said. The other women traveling with Konanki went back to their hotel about 5:55 a.m. and were captured on security camera returning to their rooms, the sources noted.

A man stayed behind with Konanki on the beach, according to a Dominican Republic investigative police report. The man, whose name was not released, told police that he and Konanki went for a swim and got caught by a big wave, the police report said.

The man, according to sources, told police that when he got back to the beach he threw up and went to sleep on a beach bed. When he woke up, Konanki was nowhere to be seen, the sources said.

Security video showed the man coming back to his hotel room at 8:55 a.m., according to the sources.

The man is cooperating with authorities, National Police spokesman Diego Pesqueira told ABC News.

Earlier, the chief of the Civil Defense in the Dominican Republic told ABC News on Monday the man was not considered a suspect in Konanki's death.

Right now, the investigation is being treated as an accident, the chief said.

Law enforcement authorities are increasing the perimeter of the search area of beaches and water in the ongoing operation to find Konanki, according to the chief.

Three Dominican officials involved in the investigation told ABC News over the weekend that Konanki is believed to have drowned in the ocean.

The last time Konanki was seen on the beach on security camera footage was around 4:15 a.m. Thursday, the Dominican Republic Public Ministry told ABC News.

The Public Ministry was first contacted by the U.S. embassy in the Dominican Republic on Friday, the Ministry said.

Officials said Konanki's friends who were with her around the time of her disappearance were questioned by police and have not been charged with crimes.

A joint investigation into Konanki's disappearance is being conducted by the FBI, the US Embassy in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican National Police and the Dominican Prosecutor's office, sources close to the investigation told ABC News.

The investigators will question everyone involved in the incident again, including hotel employees and the man Konanki's friends say she was with before she disappeared, the sources said.

All security camera footage since the day Konanki and her five friends arrived on the island is now being analyzed, sources said.

Israel said Tuesday it killed a senior Hezbollah militant responsible for drones and missiles, even as it freed Lebanese prisoners as a "goodwill" gesture to the country's new president.

Despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel has continued to carry out air strikes in Lebanon, claiming they are necessary to prevent the Iran-backed militant group from rearming or re-establishing a presence along its northern border.

"Earlier today, the IAF (air force) conducted a precise intelligence-based strike in the area of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hassan Abbas Ezzedine, the head of Hezbollah's aerial array in the Bader regional unit," the military said in a statement.

It said it carried out a second strike on Tuesday in the Froun area, targeting several militants.

"Several terrorists were identified in a site used by Hezbollah in the area of Froun in southern Lebanon," the military said. "An IAF aircraft struck the suspects."

Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that two people were killed in the Israeli strikes.

"An enemy Israeli drone strike targeting a car on the Deir El-Zahrani road resulted in one fatality," the news agency said, citing the health ministry.

It later reported that a second person was killed in an Israeli air strike on a vehicle in the Froun area.

Although a truce reached on November 27 largely ended more than a year of hostilities — including two months of full-scale war in which Israeli ground troops crossed the border — Israel has continued to launch periodic strikes in Lebanese territory.

Israel was initially expected to withdraw from Lebanon by February 18, after missing a January deadline, but it has maintained a presence in five strategic locations.

The ceasefire also required Hezbollah to pull back north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border, and to dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

- Border disputes -

In a separate development on Tuesday, Israel announced it had agreed to release five Lebanese citizens detained during its war with Hezbollah.

"In coordination with the United States and as a gesture to Lebanon's new president, Israel has agreed to release five Lebanese detainees," a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun's office said four of the prisoners had been freed on Tuesday and the fifth would follow on Wednesday.

Their release followed a meeting earlier Tuesday in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura, attended by representatives of Israel, Lebanon and mediators France and the United States.

"During the meeting, it was agreed to establish three joint working groups aimed at stabilising the region," the prime minister's statement said.

"These groups will focus on the five points controlled by Israel in southern Lebanon, discussions on the Blue Line and remaining disputed areas, and the issue of Lebanese detainees held by Israel."

The Blue Line is the UN-patrolled demarcation line that has served as de facto border since 2000.

In an interview with Lebanese news channel Al Jadeed, US Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus emphasised Washington's efforts to resolve the border issue.

"We want to get a political resolution, finally, to the border disputes," Ortagus said.

"When it comes to the border agreement, the land border agreement, there are 13 points -- I think that six are still problematic," she said.

Ortagus said Israel had "withdrawn from over 99 percent of the territory".

"I feel fairly confident that... we can have final resolution on the five points and ultimately on the remaining issues related to the Blue Line".

Pope Francis remains stable after almost four weeks in hospital with pneumonia, the Vatican said on Tuesday, declining to speculate on when he might go home, the day after doctors indicated he was no longer in danger."It is clear that the situation remains stable... and with these slight improvements within a framework for doctors that remains complex," the Vatican said.

CAIRO (Reuters) -Israel said on Tuesday it had agreed to hold talks to demarcate its border with Lebanon, adding it would release five Lebanese held by the Israeli military in what it called a "gesture to the Lebanese president".  A statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed with Lebanon, the U.S. and France to establish working groups to discuss the demarcation line between the two countries.  Lebanon said it had received the four Lebanese hostages from Israel, with a fifth to be handed over on Wednesday, according to a statement by the Lebanese president's office on X.

Even in Lebanese villages that incurred heavy losses during Hezbollah's war with Israel, support for the militant group remains strong despite some dissent.

The Trump administration has urged Republicans to back the measure, which would avert a government shutdown on Friday night.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is likely subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a federal judge ruled late Monday, rejecting the Trump administration's position that the group does not have to respond to public records requests. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found DOGE exercises substantial authority independently of the president, which makes…

The EU's foreign affairs chief on Tuesday told the UN Security Council that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was just one of a rising number of cases where the "rule of force" has replaced international law.We see attempts to replace the rule of law by the rule of force," the former Estonian prime minister said.

A judge appeared convinced that the best medicine for DOGE may be a bit of sunlight on its records.

While White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sounded sure that tariffs wouldn't hurt Americans, most economists believe they'll end up costing consumers more.

STORY: Sheep are stolen in the dead of night from a Bedouin community in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Activists and local residents said armed Israeli settlers took hundreds of them in one of the biggest incidents they'd seen of settler harassment of the Bedouin.The incident was filmed by Israeli activist group Mistaclim, whose name means Looking the Occupation in the Eye. "I'm shocked, poor things," they can be heard saying. One told Reuters it happened fast - they saw settlers break into homes then herd the sheep from their pens.Residents said about 1,500 sheep and goats were herded away under the eyes of police and soldiers.Hani Zayed said he lost 70 sheep in Friday's attack."The kids told us that they saw two men carrying lights coming from the settlement. When we went to check on them, they shone the light towards us. His idea was to distract us, because we found out that he mixed his sheep with our sheep."An Israeli police statement denied the incident took place as described. Israel's military did not comment, nor did a group representing settlers in the area.Mistaclim set up a monitoring point following previous attacks, which have increased since the Gaza war broke out. For Bedouin herders, the loss of a flock usually means the loss of their livelihood.And like many Palestinians, the semi-nomadic herders in Ein al-Auja believe the larger goal is to force them from the land and allow a full takeover by Israel.:: July 2023Two years ago, Palestinians enjoyed swimming in Ein al-Auja's spring.Now it's reserved for use by settlers.The Bedouin encampment, which locals say was established around 40 years ago, has to bring in water by tanker. Local resident Tareq Obaiat says settlers covet the area for its terrain and climate and that Israel has been trying to displace people here for years.U.S. President Donald Trump has lifted sanctions on violent settlers.Fueled by speculation that he'll give Israel the green light to annex the West Bank, Israeli ministers have spoken openly about taking over the territory......which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war and has occupied ever since.For mother of five Nayfeh Salameh, the situation means her family "sleeps with fear."She described the Friday attack as "terrifying" and said closing your door won't keep you safe.They broke through the doors and entered people's homes, she says, beating women and children while they slept.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready to accept a ceasefire deal - as the US says it has immediately resumed intelligence sharing and military aid with Ukraine.  In a post on Telegram after US and Ukrainian officials met in Saudi Arabia, Mr Zelenskyy said "the American side understands our arguments" and "accepts our proposals" - and that Kyiv "accepts" the US proposal of a full 30-day ceasefire with Russia.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -An Indian appeals authority ruled that the city of New Delhi must reconsider its refusal of a liquor license request by France's Pernod Ricard, rejecting its justification the company had a criminal background, the order seen by Reuters showed.  India accounts for a tenth of Pernod's group sales, and its business in New Delhi - an urban tourist hub considered a showcase market for premium brands - had previously contributed around 5% of its sales in the country.  Retail sales of Pernod's brands, which include Chivas Regal, have been prohibited in the Indian capital since 2022, however, with authorities repeatedly denying it a license citing ongoing investigations into suspected violations of liquor regulations.

The United States and Canada traded angry tariff warnings Tuesday, as trade tensions soared and President Donald Trump doubled down on provocative plans to annex his country's northern neighbor.Early Tuesday, Trump threatened to double the rate on imports of both metals from Canada, after its province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states.

Colombia's newly appointed defense minister said Tuesday that he will focus on taking back territory lost to rebel groups that have forced thousands to flee their homes this year.  In an address to the nation's troops, Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez said that it was time for Colombia's military to “strengthen national sovereignty and protect” the nation's population.  The retired general hinted that Colombia's military, which had been recently asked to refrain from attacking rebel groups by the nation's government, will now take a more offensive role.

Romanian far-right politician Calin Georgescu on Tuesday stopped short of endorsing any other potential candidate after being definitively barred from standing in May's presidential election rerun, adding to uncertainty over who would replace him.  Whether another far right candidate succeeds in swaying Georgescu's voters will determine whether another central European country swings closer to Moscow beside Hungary and Slovakia in the election scheduled on May 4 and May 18.  The 62-year-old pro-Russian contender ran as an independent in last year's presidential election which was annulled in December by the country's top court due to undeclared funding and suspicion of Russian meddling in his favour, denied by Moscow and Georgescu.

Ukrainian and US officials met behind closed doors for hours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to find a path towards ending the war with Russia, with Kyiv pushing for partial ceasefire in the sky and at sea. Ukraine said talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia were progressing "constructively" on Tuesday, with a partial ceasefire with Russia on the table hours after Kyiv conducted its largest drone attack on Moscow in three years of war.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine's For

Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that they had taken hostages during an attack on a train carrying hundreds of people, including paramilitary troops, in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday and threatened to kill them.  The BLA is the strongest of a number of insurgent groups long operating in the area bordering Afghanistan and Iran, a mineral-rich region that is home to Beijing's investment in Gwadar deep water port and other projects.

Pakistani insurgents attacked a passenger train carrying several hundred people as it passed through a tunnel on Tuesday and claimed to have taken more than 100 hostages, though officials later said at least 104 were rescued.  The fate of the other passengers wasn't immediately known.  Security officials said the attackers blew up the railroad track in southwestern Balochistan province, and exchanged fire with security guards aboard the train while using women and children as human shields.

Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia, pending Moscow's agreement.

Three people were killed and around a hundred hostages freed by Pakistani troops on Tuesday after armed militants attacked a train carrying over 450 passengers in the country's southwestern Balochistan province.Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway government official in Quetta, the capital of the province, earlier told AFP that "over 450 passengers onboard" had been taken hostage. 

Romanian far-right politician Calin Georgescu on Tuesday lost an appeal against a decision barring him from standing in the country's presidential election re-run, spelling the end of his meteoric rise, as hundreds of his supporters protested outside the court.Outside the constitutional court, several hundred Georgescu supporters shouted "thieves" after news of its decision spread.

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to declare a 'National Emergency on Electricity' in response to Ontario's imposition of a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity exports to the United States, amid threats to halt exports entirely. This move is part of an escalating trade dispute between the two nations, with Trump vowing to impose retaliatory measures.

The emergency declaration will allow the US to alleviate the "abusive threat" from losing electricity imports from Canada, Donald Trump wrote in a post on social media.

US President Trump said in response to the surcharge imposed by Ontario, he would double existing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, and warned Canada that it would pay a high cost if Ontario cuts off the flow of electricity to the US.

"Can you imagine Canada stooping so low as to use ELECTRICITY, that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat?" Trump wrote. “They will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!”

On Monday, Ontario put a 25 per cent fee on its electricity exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota in response to Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on Canada.

Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was applying "maximum pressure" on the US over its tariff war, and threatened to cut off exports entirely if Donald Trump increased tariffs further.

Ontario remains the largest exporter of electricity to the US in 2023, sending 15.2 TWh to the US.

Notably, Donald Trump already declared a national energy emergency on 20 January, unlocking emergency authorities to fast-track permitting and seek to retain production of baseload power plants.

President Trump has yet to offer more details on the electricity emergency, but the US Department of Energy (DOE) can issue emergency orders that would allow power plants to run at maximum capacity or waive some environmental regulations.

US President Donald Trump announced doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminium from Canada to 50%. Soon, Canada imposed a 25% surcharge on electricity it supplies to a region in US.

Soon, by Tuesday afternoon, Trump made a U-turn and called off the imposition of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, just hours after announcing the higher tariffs. 

The switch came after a Canadian official also backed off his own plans for a 25% surcharge on electricity, reported Reuters.

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo predicts a 'momentous battle' in the courts over President Donald Trump's pause on funding for USAID and discusses the DOJ's request to the Supreme Court to allow Trump's desired firings.

One of the newest federal judges in the U.S. has found himself squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's battle over foreign aid spending after the Supreme Court tasked him with determining how, and when, the government must pay nearly $2 billion owed to foreign aid groups and contractors.

Judge Amir H. Ali, a Biden appointee, has served on the court for less than four months and is among the 25 newest federal judges confirmed by the Senate to serve on a federal district court.

Despite his short tenure, Ali, a U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., is already at the center of some of the most high-profile court cases to date, presiding most recently over the lawsuit seeking billions in unpaid invoices for USAID-funded projects. 

The case is the first significant case of President Donald Trump's term to be heard by the Supreme Court – and Amir's handling of it has brought renewed scrutiny from conservatives over his previous work as a litigator, including for progressive legal groups.

SCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS

Far from being a wallflower, Ali has had a prolific and high-profile career as both a professor and litigator, including arguing civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, and serving as the director of Harvard Law's Criminal Justice Appellate Clinic. His work has earned awards or recognition from groups such as the NAACP, the American Constitution Society – where he was a finalist for the David Carliner Public Interest Award – and Bloomberg, among others. 

Much of Ali's work prior to his confirmation to the bench focused closely on police and prosecutorial misconduct and civil rights protections, some of which made headlines during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.

In 2017, Ali helped open the Washington, D.C., branch of the MacArthur Justice Center, where he represented dozens of plaintiffs, including before the Supreme Court, where he argued and won two separate civil rights cases. The MacArthur Justice Center was formed in 1985 to challenge the death penalty in Illinois, and it has since expanded to support reductions in over-incarceration and the elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, among other reforms, with offices in four states and Washington, D.C. 

Ali's first case, Garza v. Idaho, expanded the constitutional right to counsel for defendants under the Sixth Amendment. His second, Thompson v. Clark, made it slightly easier for individuals who claim they were wrongfully arrested to sue police for malicious prosecution. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, authored the 6-3 majority opinion.)

He was later appointed executive director of the Washington, D.C., branch, a role he held through 2024, when he was appointed to the federal bench.

During his Senate confirmation hearing last February, Ali was grilled by Republicans over remarks made by his MacArthur Justice Center colleague, Cliff Johnson – who suggested during a podcast interview in 2020 that defunding the police is the first step in a "movement toward making police departments obsolete."

Ali stressed in response that he did not share those views, and that the views were not endorsed by the MacArthur Justice Center. 

"Let me be very clear about this," Ali said. "I have never advocated for taking away police funding. I would not take that position, and the MacArthur Justice Center has not taken that position."

US JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMIN TO PAY PORTION OF $2B IN FOREIGN AID BY MONDAY

Now, as a judge, Ali has been tasked with presiding over some of the most consequential cases to come up during Trump's second term. 

Last month, he sided with foreign aid groups and contractors who sued the Trump administration for roughly $1.9 billion owed for previously completed projects that were funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. 

Ali gave the Trump administration just two weeks to pay the outstanding funds, prompting Justice Department lawyers to file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. 

The Supreme Court ultimately rejected the Trump administration's request to extend the freeze in 5-4 vote, remanding it back to D.C. federal court, and Ali, to hash out the specifics of what must be paid, and when – a role Ali stressed that he takes "very seriously."

Plaintiffs sued over the Trump administration's executive action earlier this year that froze nearly all foreign aid spending, changes made in the name of government "efficiency" and eliminating waste, according to administration officials. 

President Donald Trump has stated plans to cut some 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts and to slash an additional $60 billion in foreign aid spending and at issue in the case is how quickly the Trump administration must pay the outstanding invoices from completed projects. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Monday that roughly 83% of USAID programs are slated to be canceled following a six-week review process led by DOGE.

The canceled contracts, Rubio wrote, amount to "tens of billions of dollars" that were being spent in ways he alleged "did not serve" U.S. national interests. He added that the rest of the USAID programs and contracts will be transferred to the State Department to be managed. 

LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS

Most recently, Ali ordered the Trump administration Monday evening to pay by March 14 all owed funds to USAID contractors and other international groups for previously completed projects. Ali said the Trump administration's withholding of the funds, which had already been appropriated by Congress, was likely "unlawful" and a violation of the separation of powers doctrine under the Constitution.

It is unclear whether the Trump administration will move to challenge that ruling in court.

Last week, Ali moved expeditiously on the Supreme Court directive, ordering both parties back to court last week for an hours-long hearing to weigh plausible repayment options. He heard from both plaintiffs in the case, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, who argued that the Trump administration "never took steps towards compliance" with Ali's order requiring the administration to unfreeze the federal funds to pay the $1.9 billion in owed project payments.

During the hearing, which stretched on for nearly five hours, Ali also focused heavily on other issues, including the government's role in reviewing all foreign aid contracts and grants. 

Lawyers for the Trump administration told Ali they had already completed and made final decisions for these contracts. Stephen Wirth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, objected to the administration's "breakneck" review of the contracts and grants, arguing that they "had one objective – to terminate as many contracts as possible."

Lawyers were also pressed by Ali over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress. This could eventually kick the issue back up to the Supreme Court.

At the end of the hearing, Ali ordered the government to pay at least a portion of the owed funds by Monday at 6 p.m. – taking what he described as a "concrete step" forward in resolving some of the confusion surrounding the Trump administration's freeze on most foreign spending.

"I think it's reasonable to get the plaintiffs' invoices paid by 6 p.m. on Monday," Ali said.  

It is unclear what payments the government has made since last week.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shopped for a new Tesla on the White House driveway on Tuesday, selecting a shiny red sedan to show his support for Elon Musk ‘s electric vehicle company as it faces blowback because of his work to advance the president's political agenda and downsize the federal government. 

“Wow,” Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model S. “That's beautiful.”

Musk got in on the passenger side and joked about “giving the Secret Service a heart attack” as they talked about how to start a vehicle that can reach 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour in a few seconds. 

Trump told reporters that he would write a check for the car, which retails for roughly $80,000, and leave it at the White House so his staff can drive it. The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which is struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices. 

When asked by FOX Business Network's Larry Kudlow, Elon Musk has this response on how he was able to run his other businesses while overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency.

“It's a great product,” he said. Referring to Musk, Trump said “we have to celebrate him.”

It was the latest — and most unusual — example of how Trump has demonstrated loyalty to Musk, who spent heavily on his comeback campaign last year and has been a key figure in his second administration. Tesla's stock price increased nearly 4% on Tuesday after dropping almost 48% since Trump took office in January.

The Republican president announced on social media overnight that he was going to buy a new Tesla as “a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”




Musk continues to run Tesla — as well as the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump's adviser.

“Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote. “But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's ‘baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.”

Speaking later Tuesday at a business roundtable event, Trump said that Musk, the world's richest man, “shouldn't be scarified or have to suffer because he wants to help the government.”

Others have also rallied to Musk's defense. Alex Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist, said that he bought a customized version of a Cybertruck that he'll give away to a customer of his online store next month. 

In addition to Tesla's struggles, Musk has faced other challenges too. He said X was targeted by a “massive cyberattack” that disrupted the social media platform on Monday, and the last two test launches of his Starship rocket ended in explosions.

Presidents almost never drive for security reasons. Joe Biden got behind the wheel of an electric truck while promoting domestic manufacturing, and Barack Obama took a spin with Jerry Seinfeld in the White House driveway for a comedy show. 

But regardless of the practicality of Trump's purchase, his overnight announcement about buying a Tesla represented another step in how the president has blurred lines between private and public interests.

During his first term, top adviser Kellyanne Conway urged people to show their support for Trump's daughter Ivanka by purchasing her retail products. 

“Go buy Ivanka's stuff,” she said. “I'm going to give it a free commercial here.”

Trump's wealth and business savvy is core to his political appeal. The president promoted his products while running for office last year, and he attached his name to a cryptocurrency meme coin that launched shortly before he took office. 

However, it's rare to see Trump use his own money to support an ally, no matter how important they are. 

Musk is the world's richest person, with billions of dollars in government contracts. He's also exerting sweeping influence over Trump's administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and traveling frequently with the president. 

During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk “how are you running your other businesses” while also advising Trump.

“With great difficulty,” he said. 

“But there's no turning back, you say?” Kudlow responded.

“I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk said. 

Tesla has recently faced protests and vandalism. Police are investigating gunshots fired at a dealership in Oregon, and fire officials are examining a blaze that destroyed four Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle. 

At times, the White House has needed to play cleanup for Musk, who had never worked in public service before and has admitted that he'll make mistakes along the way.

For example, Musk presented inflated estimates of fraud in government benefits like Social Security on Monday, leading Democrats to argue that he was planning cuts to the popular programs. 

“Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” Musk said in the interview. “That's the big one to eliminate.”

The next morning, a White House account on X criticized news organizations as “lying hacks” and told Democrats to “spare us the fake outrage” about reducing benefits. 

“He was clearly talking about the WASTE in the programs,” the White House posted.

                    The News Journal Names Dr. Janice Nevin Among Delaware's Most Influential Business Leaders                

ChristianaCare President and CEO Janice E. Nevin, M.D., MPH, has been recognized as a top business leader by Delaware Online/The News Journal.

For the fifth year in a row, Delaware Online/The News Journal recognized “the folks who continue to shape Delaware's future … those who have a big impact in the First State — from leaders in health care, law and business, as well as movers and shakers in the arenas of dining, entertainment, social media and more.”

Since 2014, Nevin has overseen ChristianaCare's ascension as a national health care leader in the areas of quality and safety, health equity, virtual health and value-based care. At the same time, she has guided ChristianaCare's expansion of services and programs throughout the region including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

“I am particularly proud of our focus on quality and safety, health equity, improving access and driving down health care costs while increasing the value of our care,” Nevin said.

“We are doing that through programs like Hospital Care at Home, which provides virtual and in-person care by a team of physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and other providers. And our Medicaid accountable care organization has shown great reductions in spending — $6.2 million in 2023 alone — while improving the quality of care for nearly 30,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Delaware.

“Our quality and patient safety metrics have been nationally recognized by U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek, the American College of Surgeons and many more. We couldn't do any of this without our great staff, who inspire me every day. Our talented caregivers are truly ChristianaCare's greatest asset.”

A visionary and collaborative health care leader, Nevin has led ChristianaCare's transformation from a health care system to a system that truly impacts health. She is nationally recognized as a pioneer and thought leader in value-based care and population health, including her belief that truly great health care is built on the values of love and excellence. These values are exemplified in her commitment to health equity and making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for everyone in the communities that ChristianaCare serves.

FALL RIVER — This weekend marks the end of an era for another Fall River restaurant staple.

Just one week after the closure of a famous North End eatery, O Gil Restaurant will be bidding a bittersweet goodbye at the beloved family restaurant, a go-to for Portuguese cuisine in the city's South End for 34 years. 

Looking to get a taste of their authentic no-frills, all-flavor fare before it's too late? Better head to 915 County St. soon.

On Tuesday, longtime employee Debbie Esposito confirmed that Saturday, March 15, will be their last day of business.

"It's very sad, I've been here 32 years," said Esposito, a long time waitress and bartender who started there in 1993. "But everything good comes to an end."

The Tiverton resident is a veteran among the O Gil staff whose tenure at the small neighborhood spot goes back almost as far as its inception. 

Current owner Victor Fagundo opened O Gil in 1991, along with his brother-in-law Felisberto Sousa, who died in September 2024.

O Gil Restaurant — named after Fagundo's father, Gil Fagundo, who is credited with bringing Portuguese steak to Fall River — garnered a reputation over the years for serving one of the best Portuguese steaks — and more — in a city packed with Luso options. 

According to Esposito, among the things that made O Gil special was the family atmosphere and the love and care they poured into their cooking.

"Everything is homemade, our sandwiches are huge, our french fries are hand-cut, the soups are the best in the city, homemade chicken and kale," she said. "They put a lot of heart and soul into it ... it was always a family restaurant."

Since Fagundo and Sousa announced their desire to retire and put the restaurant up for sale in late 2023, locals have been anxiously counting down O Gil's final days.

And while the closure doesn't come as a shock for patrons, it's still a blow for the many who've long frequented the casual, homestyle spot tucked away on a Fall River side street. 

"Everybody's bummed out and upset," Esposito said.

The sale of the County Street property is not yet official but is expected to change hands this month, according to new owner Kristin Teves.

Teves, co-owner of North South Property Management along with her husband, is no stranger to the Fall River restaurant fixture, having managed the South End property for over 20 years.

Her plans include leasing the County Street location and renovations to the restaurant space are also expected.

While her hope is that the O Gil spot will continue to operate as a restaurant, Teves indicated that is no guarantee and the future of the building remains uncertain at this time.

"It's definitely a legacy here in Fall River," Teves said in a late February interview. "Whenever you're in a group of Portuguese people, everyone has their opinion on their favorite steak and favorite meal in the city, and O Gil's is always in the top three. I'd like to keep it there for people that love it and for people that have grown up with it. It's truly a part of the city and I'd like to see it stay a part of the city."

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's latest threat of 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum upended markets Tuesday, but his plan for an increase of any level could be heartily welcomed by American manufacturers of those products.

"We stand fully behind your leadership," nine US steel industry executives said in a recent letter to the president about a set of 25% duties planned on all steel and aluminum imports from all countries set to come into force tomorrow.

Trump surprised markets on Tuesday by announcing that he would by going higher and imposing "an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%," on steel and aluminum from Canada on top of the previously announced 25% duties that start Wednesday.

He then suggested later in the day that those tariffs may not happen after Ontario's premier said it would suspend a surcharge on exports of electricity.

"I'll let you know," Trump told reporters as Philip Bell, the Steel Manufacturers Association president, added in a live Yahoo Finance interview Tuesday afternoon that he hopes at least the 25% duties stay in place.

Stocks quickly sold off Tuesday morning as the president also elevated his war of words with Canada but then whipsawed up and down on the competing headlines.

"It's more uncertainty, it's more chaos, he changes his mind on a whim," Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari said in another Yahoo Finance live appearance at one point.

But Tuesday morning's fresh round of agita belies a more nuanced view of Trump's 25% duties within the steel and aluminum industry after years of executives expressing concern about things like "steel dumping" from China.

And there is now bipartisan ire about subsidized Chinese steel undercutting world markets, leading many CEOs in the sector to actively cheer on Trump's most protectionist impulses.

Executives also have a familiar legal and political playbook for this week's steel and aluminum tariffs after Trump undertook similar actions during his first term — even though the duties do represent a mixed bag for some with closer economic ties to Canada.

One example of the industry support for Trump has come in the form of the recent letter sent to the president from the heads of US Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), and Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), among others, touting the plan for 25% blanket duties.

"We urge you to resist any requests for exceptions or exclusions and to continue standing strong on behalf of American steel," the letter said, according to a copy reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

"We stand fully behind your leadership," it added.

The letter also touted Trump's similar 2018 action on steel and aluminum that imposed 25% duties but mostly focused on China. The letter said it allowed American producers to reinvest and drive up capacity by nearly 80%.

Some in the aluminum industry have also spoken favorably about Trump's plans, with White House aides also touting the support of the industry in remarks this week about why the duties would be going forward.

But the reaction has been somewhat more mixed among some CEOs in a reflection of greater interrelationships between the US and Canada.

Alcoa (AA) CEO William Oplinger recently said that his aluminum-manufacturing company would be hurt by the tariffs, given both increased prices and because of the company's extensive operations in Canada.

"This is bad for the aluminum industry in the US," Oplinger said at a conference, adding that the bottom line is that 100,000 US jobs were at stake even before Trump's latest threat this week doubled the tariffs on Canadian aluminum.

The final consumers of steel and aluminum products are also likely to be less enamored with Trump's move as evidence mounts that it could raise an array of prices.

Domestic steel prices jumped in February when Trump announced his plan, with the price of a ton of domestic steel now nearly $1,000 a ton from around $700 previously.

A recent Bloomberg report found that consumer products from aluminum baseball bats to stainless steel pans to fishing reels could see higher prices as a result.

Still, the language from many of these pro-tariff executives is also very similar to Trump's own reasoning for his focus on steel and aluminum.

Trump has described this week's action as a sort of unfinished business after he imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum in his first term but with exceptions that, in his view, allowed cheap Chinese products to continue undercutting the market by moving through third-party countries.

"It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions and that's all countries, no matter where it comes from," the president said when announcing his plan in February.

Increased steel tariffs were also often advocated by then-President Biden, who talked about tripling them and told a Pittsburgh crowd in 2024 of China, "They're not competing. They're cheating."

The bulk of this week's move is also being made using presidential tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, making it a formal continuation of the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump launched during his first term.

These "Section 232" tariffs are much more familiar to business leaders than the tariffs Trump has imposed so far using emergency authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

Trump also announced Tuesday he would be declaring a national emergency on electricity in response to Canadian moves to impose an additional fee on US electricity consumers.

Trump promised that "this will allow the US to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada."

Oops, something went wrong

This year's stock market sell-off has been dramatic, but it also contains almost all of the same characters that have featured in the biggest market disruptions we've seen over the last two years.

Both on the way up and now, the way down.

During Monday's market rout, shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) all fell, with Tesla falling a whopping 15% to lead losses.

It marked the latest sign that the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks that drove the S&P 500 to back-to-back 20% gains over the past two years have now become the "lag seven," according to T. Rowe Price science and technology portfolio manager Tony Wang.

Whether stocks are going up or down these days, it seems, it's all one big AI trade.

And right now, it doesn't appear like a market in which investors are looking to bet big on future AI growth, particularly with the overall earnings story for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) coming into question.

"The S&P 500's forward earnings estimates, a key pillar of this bull market, have flatlined over the past month," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner wrote in a note to clients on March 4, explaining why he'd downgraded equities to a neutral portfolio weighting.

Through this bull market run, Big Tech has served as a key earnings driver, helping support overall profit growth for the S&P 500 while non-technology companies have struggled. At times, that's helped the sector play as a flight to safety to trade amid market uncertainty.

But now, as Wang notes, not only are these companies' spending plans facing some investor skepticism, but also "[earnings] results are becoming more in line."

"And if we look forward, they're likely going to be not accelerating," Wang added.

The macro backdrop, with concerns about Trump's tariff policy pushing both interest rates and the dollar around, is also a challenge for these stocks.

"The lagged impact of higher rates and a stronger dollar, as well as the debate around AI capex have come together to pressure earnings revisions," Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.

"As a result, we've seen very choppy index performance with the S&P 500."

The sectors that host all the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Information Technology (XLK), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), and Communication Services (XLC) — were the worst-performing sectors on Monday.

Over the past month, the equal-weighted S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't as overly influenced by significant swings in large stocks — has outperformed the market cap-weighted index (^GSPC) by about 3 percentage points, also reflecting that much of the recent selling action has come in the market's largest names.

That's not to say the AI trade is over, but its predominance has certainly hit a speed bump.

"In [the] bigger picture, AI-driven outperformance of the US not done yet, but that is for the long term, not for the next few months," Citi strategists led by Dirk Willer wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Still, the firm downgraded its view on US equities to Neutral from Overweight as weak economic growth data continues to weigh down the stock market.

And in this environment, the drop we're seeing in these Big Tech leaders doesn't necessarily make the stocks cheap, even with their earnings firepower.

"So when you think about the setup here," T. Rowe Price's Wang said, "there are suggestions that perhaps these valuations are a lot more attractive, [but] I think that you have to know what kind of market you're in."

FIRST ON FOX: A government accountability nonprofit is calling on the House to launch a probe into whether Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., misappropriated her taxpayer-funded member allowance.

Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, sent a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) on Tuesday, questioning "several troubling expenses" from AOC's disbursements, which they claim are "in contravention of federal law and the standards of the House of Representatives."

Each member of Congess receives a Member Representational Allowance ("MRA"), a budget for official duties that "may not be used for personal or campaign purposes," according to the Congressional Research Service. However, the "Squad" member is being accused of using these funds for "campaign purposes."

AOC reportedly made a payment of $3,700 to a "Juan D Gonzalez" and another for $850 to "Bombazo Dance Co Inc.," with both expenditures described as being used for "training."

The progressive congresswoman has addressed the issue on social media, claiming in a post on X responding to a claim she is "wasting tax dollars."

"100% wrong," Ocasio-Cortez wrote. "None of this is taxpayer money, this is an FEC filing. Be loud and wrong about something else. Try again next time."

The filing states that Ocasio-Cortez's "assertion that these expenses are ‘an FEC filing,' and not reflective of her MRA – as well as her claim that '[n]one of this is taxpayer money' – is both troubling and obviously incorrect."

"Either she does not know the difference between her campaign funds and MRA, or, more likely, she knows the highlighted expenses were not for official business and should have been paid by her campaign and reported to the FEC."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, said, "Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated."

"Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated. In the era of reining in government spending, the American people deserve to know lawmakers are being good stewards of their tax dollars."

Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment.

The congresswoman has faced ethics complaints in the past, including from the Heritage Foundation in 2023 accusing her of "falsely accusing" and "defaming" the creator of the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, Chaya Raichik.

Ocasio-Cortez also faced an ethics probe in 2023 after being accused of accepting "impermissible gifts associated with her attendance at the Met Gala in 2021," which may have violated House rules, standards of conduct and federal law.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump's Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was "significant" and "very justified," said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

It "may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China," added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for "general search" and "general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn't do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

"Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point," the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google's monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google's AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

"They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it," he said.

"I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background."

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

"What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

"It seems ill-timed to do that."

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple's revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ's request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

"Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome," McCareins said.

It's happening: Southwest Airlines will start charging passengers to check bags for the first time.

It's a stunning reversal that shows the low-cost pioneer is willing to part with a customer perk executives have said set it apart from rivals for more than half a century of flying in hopes of increasing revenue.

Southwest's changes come after months of pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for quick changes at the company, which held on for decades — until now — to perks like free checked bags, changeable tickets and open seating.

For tickets purchased on or after May 28, Southwest customers in all but the top-tier fare class will have to pay to check bags, though there will be exceptions. Elite frequent flyers who hold A-List Preferred status will still get two bags, and A-List level members will get one free checked bag. Southwest credit card holders will also get one free checked bag.

"Two bags fly free" is a registered trademark on Southwest's website. But its decision to about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk brings the largest U.S. domestic carrier in line with its rivals, which together generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data.

Southwest didn't say how much it plans to charge to check bags, but a single bag costs $35 to check on Delta, American and United.

Southwest shares rose 8% Tuesday after its baggage fee announcement and investor update, while other large carriers' shares and the broader market fell.





Southwest executives have long said they didn't plan to charge for bags, telling Wall Street analysts that it was a major reason why customers chose the airline.

At an investor day in September, Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags but lose $1.8 billion of market share. Southwest said its "rigorous research" found that "our 'bags fly free' policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from bag fees."

Some airline executives see an opportunity.

"I think, clearly, there are some customers who [chose Southwest] because of that, and now those customers are up for grabs," Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at an investor conference on Tuesday, after Southwest's announcement. "We'll see how that plays out over the next period of time as they continue to implement multiple changes to their products."

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, speaking at the same conference, likened Southwest's baggage policy change to "the slaying of a sacred cow" and said lower-paying customers will be most affected.

"I view it as a big deal because it's more — it feels more financially driven — a results-driven airline than it's ever been before," he said.

Southwest CEO Bob Jordan had cited the company's long-standing bag policy in an earnings call last July.

"After fare and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the No. 1 issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest," Jordan said.

But Southwest has changed its tune.

"What's changed is that we've come to realize that we need more revenue to cover our costs," COO Andrew Watterson said in an interview with CNBC about the baggage fee changes. "We think that these changes that we're announcing today will lead to less of that share shift than would have been the case otherwise."

Jordan said Tuesday that the new baggage policy will likely help drive sign-ups for its co-branded credit card and that it made sense because of its commercial reach, listing its tickets through outside platforms like Google Flights and Expedia.

"In contrast to our previous analysis, actual customer booking behavior through our new booking channels such as metasearch, did not show that we are getting the same benefit from our bundled offering with free bags, which has led us to update the assumptions," he said.

Jordan said the carrier has new executives with "direct experience implementing bag fees at multiple airlines and that's also helped further validate the new assumptions."

Southwest said the changes it announced Tuesday will add $800 million in earnings before interest and taxes this year and $1.7 billion in 2026, bringing 2026 total increases, including other initiatives, to $4.3 billion, up from a $2.6 billion target it shared at its investor day in September.

During those presentations in September, Southwest's then chief transformation officer, Ryan Green, told analysts that an analysis showed Southwest would lose more money from passengers defecting to rivals if it started charging for bags than it would make from the fees.

"The fact that free bags is a key driver of choice creates the risk that customers may choose the competition if we change the policy," he said.

Southwest said last month that it had parted ways with Green.

The airline also said Tuesday that it will launch a new, basic economy fare, something rivals have offered for years.

Southwest, in addition, will change the way customers earn Rapid Rewards: Customers will earn more of the frequent flyer miles depending on how much they pay. Redemption rates will vary depending on flight demand, a dynamic pricing model competitors use.

And flight credits for tickets purchased on or after May 28 will expire in one year, or earlier, depending on the type of fare purchased.

It's the latest in a string of massive strategy changes at Southwest as its performance has fallen behind rivals.

Last July, Southwest shocked passengers when it announced it would ditch its open seating model for assigned seats and add "premium" extra legroom options, ending decades of an single-class cabin.

The airline is also looking to slash its costs. Higher expenses coming out of the pandemic have taken a bite out of airline margins.

Last month, Southwest announced its first mass layoff, cutting about 1,750 jobs roughly 15% of its corporate staff, many of them at its headquarters, a decision CEO Jordan called "unprecedented" in the carrier's more than 53 years of flying.

"We are at a pivotal moment as we transform Southwest Airlines into a leaner, faster, and more agile organization," he said last month.

Earlier this year, Southwest announced the retirement of its longtime finance chief, Tammy Romo, who was replaced by Breeze executive Tom Doxey, and its chief administrative officer, Linda Rutherford. Both executives worked at Southwest for more than 30 years.

Southwest has also cut unprofitable routes, summer internships and employee team-building events its held for decades.

It may be a coincidence, but the recent decline in the Nasdaq and bitcoin (BTC) coincides with a sharp rise in Japanese government bond yields and the strengthening of the safe-haven Japanese yen (JPY), reminiscent of the market dynamics seen in early August.

There could be a causation here, as, for decades, the low-yielding yen propped up global asset prices. The ongoing rise in the Japanese yen may have had a hand in the recent risk aversion on Wall Street and in the crypto market.

That said, the bullish positioning in the Japanese yen looks overstretched, with speculators holding record longs last week, according to the CFTC data tracked by MacroMicro. Such extreme bullish positioning, representing a collective belief in a continued move higher in the asset, sets the stage for disappointment, following which, a mass unwinding of longs unfolds, leading to a quick bearish reversal.

In other words, the yen's rise could stall for now, offering relief to risk assets, including Nasdaq and bitcoin.

"We are now cautious on chasing further JPY strength, given stretched speculative positioning as well as strong dip-buying appetite from the domestic community," Morgan Stanley's G10 FX Strategy team said in a note to clients late Friday.
		



Strategists explained that many Japanese investors use the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) scheme to snap up foreign assets during risk-off, inadvertently slowing the pace of JPY appreciation. Additionally, the public pension system tends to go against the trend, rebalancing out of JPY assets.

"Indeed, such scenario happened in last August after a sharp appreciation of the JPY and the pronounced sell-off in equities," strategists noted.

Let's see if history repeats itself, triggering a renewed risk-on sentiment for Nasdaq and bitcoin. The USD/JPY pair turned up following the July and early August slide to 140, eventually rising to 158.50 by January. BTC turned up as well from the early August crash to $50,000, rising to new record highs above $108,000 in January. 

At press time, bitcoin traded near $80,300, representing a month-to-date decline of nearly 5%, extending February's 17.6% slide. At one point early Tuesday, prices dipped to $76,800, according to CoinDesk data.

Meanwhile, USD/JPY traded at 147.23, having put in a five-month low of 145.53 early Tuesday, TradingView data show.
		



While the stretched bull positioning and institutional flows suggest relief ahead, these factors may do little to alter the broader bullish outlook for JPY, which is backed by a narrowing U.S.-Japanese bond yield differential.

So, risk asset bulls need to be vigilant for signs of volatility in the yen and the broader financial markets.

The chart shows the spread between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese government bonds.

The spread has narrowed to 2.68% in a JPY-positive manner, reaching the lowest since August 2022. Plus, it has dived out of a macro uptrend, suggesting a major bullish shift in the JPY outlook.

The recent discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino has left scientists scratching their heads. New research suggests it could be evidence that Stephen Hawking was right about the nature of black holes and the early universe.

Five decades ago, famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking theorized that the Big Bang may have flooded the universe with tiny black holes. Now, researchers believe they may have seen one explode.

In Feb. 2025, the European collaboration KM3NeT — which consists of underwater detectors off the coasts of France, Italy and Greece — announced the discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino. This ghostly particle had an energy of around 100 PeV — over 25 times more energetic than the particles accelerated in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful atom smasher.

Physicists have struggled to come up with an explanation for such an energetic neutrino. But now, a team of researchers who were not involved in the original detection have proposed a surprising hypothesis: The neutrino is the signature of an evaporating black hole. The team described their proposal in a paper that was uploaded to the arXiv database and has not been peer-reviewed yet.

In the 1970s, Hawking realized that black holes aren't entirely black. Instead, through complex interactions between the black hole event horizon and the quantum fields of space-time, they can emit a slow-but-steady stream of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This means black holes evaporate and eventually disappear. In fact, as the black hole gets smaller, it emits even more radiation, until it essentially explodes in a firestorm of high-energy particles and radiation — like the neutrino spotted by the KM3Net collaboration.

But all known black holes are very large — at least a few times the mass of the sun, and often significantly larger. It will take well over 10^100 years for even the smallest known black holes to die. If the KM3NeT neutrino is due to an exploding black hole, it has to be much smaller — somewhere around 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms). That's about as heavy as two fully grown African elephants, compressed into a black hole smaller than an atom.

The only known potential way to produce such tiny black holes is in the chaotic events of the early Big Bang, which may have flooded the cosmos with "primordial" black holes. The smallest primordial black holes produced in the Big Bang would have exploded long ago, while larger ones might persist to the present day.

Unfortunately, a 22,000-pound black hole should not survive all the way from the Big Bang to the present day. But the authors pointed out that there might be an additional quantum mechanism — known as "memory burden" — that allows black holes to resist decay. This would allow a 22,000-pound black hole to survive for billions of years before it finally exploded, sending a high-energy neutrino toward Earth in the process.

—'Cosmic Horseshoe' may contain black hole the size of 36 billion suns — one of the largest ever detected

—Scientists may have just discovered 300 of the rarest black holes in the universe

Primordial black holes might be an explanation for dark matter — the invisible substance that accounts for most of the matter in the universe — but so far, searches for them have turned up empty. This new insight may provide an intriguing clue. The researchers found that if primordial black holes of this mass range are abundant enough to account for all the dark matter, they should be exploding somewhat regularly. They estimated that if this hypothesis is correct, the KM3NeT collaboration should see another showstopping neutrino in the next few years.

If that detection happens, then we may just have to radically rethink the way we approach dark matter, high-energy neutrinos and even the physics of the early universe.

A tornado has torn through central Florida, destroying homes and sending broadcasters ducking for cover live on air. And experts have warned more tornadoes may hit the southwest in the coming days, with severe storms forecast.

The twister hit Seminole County in the Orlando metropolitan region on Monday (March 10) with peak wind speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h), weather website AccuWeather reported.

The tornado raced over a distance of around 4 miles (6 kilometers) in 15 minutes, destroying two homes, uprooting trees and damaging vehicles. There weren't any serious injuries reported as a result of the tornado, according to FOX 35 Orlando.

FOX 35 Orlando staff confirmed the tornado's location live on air when it hit their studio. Brooks Garner, a meteorologist at the TV station, was tracking the storm when a camera showed a gray mass of wind and rain approaching the FOX building.

"Take shelter!" Garner said as the tornado hit. "Everybody in the FOX 35 building, get to your safe space, under your desk if you're not in a designated area. We're catching debris right now on the roof."

FOX 35 Orlando staff said they felt the building shake and heard debris hit the roof as the tornado passed over them, FOX Weather reported. Nobody in the building was hurt, according to the report.

Scientists categorize a tornado's strength using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which ranges from EF0 to EF5. The Florida tornado was EF2, meaning winds of 111 to 135 mph (179 to 217 km/h). For context, the most powerful EF5 tornadoes have winds of more than 200 mph (322 km/h). The last twister to reach EF5 was the 2013 Moore tornado, which killed 24 people and devastated the city of Moore in Oklahoma.

More tornadoes could hit the central and southeastern U.S. later this week. A powerful storm is expected to sweep across the country from west to east, with a risk of severe thunderstorms that could spawn tornadoes in 12 states, including Florida, on Friday and Saturday (March 14 to 15), according to a statement released by AccuWeather.

"All of the ingredients are coming together for a significant severe weather outbreak," Bernie Rayno, chief on-air meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in the statement. "We could end up with two dozen tornadoes or more by the end of the weekend."

	Testing for AGI may not be the best measure of AI's abilities and impacts

When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek burst onto the scene in January, it sparked intense chatter about its efficient and cost-effective approach to generative AI. But like its U.S. competitors, DeepSeek's main goal is murkier than just efficiency: The company aims to create the first true artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

For years, AI developers — from small startups to big tech companies — have been racing toward this elusive endpoint. AGI, they say, would mark a critical turning point, enabling computer systems to replace human workers, making AI more trustworthy than human expertise and positioning artificial intelligence as the ultimate tool for societal advancement.

Yet, years into the AI race, AGI remains a poorly defined and contentious concept. Some computer scientists and companies frame it as a threshold for AI's potential to transform society. Tech advocates suggest that once we have superintelligent computers, day-to-day life could fundamentally change, affecting work, governance and the pace of scientific discovery.

But many experts are skeptical about how close we are to an AI-powered utopia and the practical utility of AGI. There's limited agreement about what AGI means, and no clear way to measure it. Some argue that AGI functions as little more than a marketing term, offering no concrete guidance on how to best use AI models or their societal impact.

In tech companies' quest for AGI, the public is tasked with navigating a landscape filled with marketing hype, science fiction and actual science, says Ben Recht, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It becomes very tricky. That's where we get stuck.” Continuing to focus on claims of imminent AGI, he says, could muddle our understanding of the technology at hand and obscure AI's current societal effects.

The term “artificial general intelligence” was coined in the mid-20th century. Initially, it denoted an autonomous computer capable of performing any task a human could, including physical activities like making a cup of coffee or fixing a car.

But as advancements in robotics lagged behind the rapid progress of computing, most in the AI field shifted to narrower definitions of AGI: Initially, this included AI systems that could autonomously perform tasks a human could at a computer, and more recently, machines capable of executing most of only the “economically valuable” tasks a human could handle at a computer, such as coding and writing accurate prose. Others think AGI should encompass flexible reasoning ability and autonomy when tackling a number of unspecified tasks.

“The problem is that we don't know what we want,” says Arseny Moskvichev, a machine learning engineer at Advanced Micro Devices and computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute. “Because the goal is so poorly defined, there's also no roadmap for reaching it, nor reliable way to identify it.”

To address this uncertainty, researchers have been developing benchmark tests, similar to student exams, to evaluate how close systems are to achieving AGI. 

For example, in 2019, French computer scientist and former Google engineer Francois Chollet released the Abstract Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence, or ARC-AGI. In this test, an AI model is repeatedly given some examples of colored squares arranged in different patterns on a grid. For each example set, the model is then asked to generate a new grid to complete the visual pattern, a task intended to assess flexible reasoning and the model's ability to acquire new skills outside of its training. This setup is similar to Raven's Progressive Matrices, a test of human reasoning.

The test results are part of what OpenAI and other tech companies use to guide model development and assessment. Recently, OpenAI's soon-to-be released o3 model achieved vast improvement on ARC-AGI compared to previous AI models, leading some researchers to view it as a breakthrough in AGI. Others disagree.

“There's nothing about ARC that's general. It's so specific and weird,” Recht says.

Computer scientist José Hernández-Orallo of the Universitat Politécnica de València in Spain says that it's possible ARC-AGI just assesses a model's ability to recognize images. Previous generations of language models could solve similar problems with high accuracy if the visual grids were described using text, he says. That context makes o3's results seem less novel. 

Plus, there's a limited number of grid configurations, and some AI models with tons of computing power at their disposal can “brute force” their way to correct responses simply by generating all possible answers and selecting the one that fits best — effectively reducing the task to a multiple-choice problem rather than one of novel reasoning.

To tackle each ARC-AGI task, o3 uses an enormous amount of computing power (and money) at test time. Operating in an efficient mode, it costs about $30 per task, Chollet says. In a less-efficient setting, one task can cost about $3,000. Just because the model can solve the problem doesn't mean it's practical or feasible to routinely use it on similarly challenging tasks.

It's not just ARC-AGI that's contentious. Determining whether an AI model counts as AGI is complicated by the fact that every available test of AI ability is flawed. Just as Raven's Progressive Matrices and other IQ tests are imperfect measures of human intelligence and face constant criticism for their biases, so too do AGI evaluations, says Amelia Hardy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. “It's really hard to know that we're measuring [what] we care about.”

Open AI's o3, for example, correctly responded to more than a quarter of the questions in a collection of exceptionally difficult problems called the Frontier Math benchmark, says company spokesperson Lindsay McCallum. These problems take professional mathematicians hours to solve, according to the benchmark's creators. On its face, o3 seems successful. But this success may be partly due to OpenAI funding the benchmark's development and having access to the testing dataset while developing o3. Such data contamination is a continual difficulty in assessing AI models, especially for AGI, where the ability to generalize and abstract beyond training data is considered crucial.

AI models can also seem to perform very well on complex tasks, like accurately responding to Ph.D.-level science questions, while failing on more basic ones, like counting the number of r's in “strawberry.” This discrepancy indicates a fundamental misalignment in how these computer systems process queries and understand problems.

Yet, AI developers aren't collecting and sharing the sort of information that might help researchers better gauge why, Hernández-Orallo says. Many developers provide only a single accuracy value for each benchmark, as opposed to a detailed breakdown of which types of questions a model answered correctly and incorrectly. Without additional detail, it's impossible to determine where a model is struggling, why it's succeeding, or if any single test result demonstrates a breakthrough in machine intelligence, experts say.Even if a model passes a specific, quantifiable test with flying colors, such as the bar exam or medical boards, there are few guarantees that those results will translate to expert-level human performance in messy, real-world conditions, says David Rein, a computer scientist at the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research based in Berkeley, Calif.

For instance, when asked to write legal briefs, generative AI models still routinely fabricate information. Although one study of GPT-4 suggested that the chatbot could outperform human physicians in diagnosing patients, more detailed research has found that comparable AI models perform far worse than actual doctors when faced with tests that mimic real-world conditions. And no study or benchmark result indicates that current AI models should be making major governance decisions over expert humans.

The benchmarks that OpenAI, DeepSeek and other companies report results from “do not tell us much about capabilities in the real world,” Rein says, although they can provide reasonable information for comparing models to one another.

So far, researchers have tested AI models largely by providing them with discrete problems that have known answers. However, humans don't always have the luxury of knowing what the problem before them is, whether it's solvable or in what time frame. People can identify key problems, prioritize tasks and, crucially, know when to give up. It's not yet clear that machines can or do. The most advanced “autonomous” agents struggle to navigate ordering pizza or groceries online.

Large language models and neural networks have improved dramatically in recent months and years. “They're definitely useful in a lot of different ways,” Recht says, pointing to the ability of newer models to summarize and digest data or produce serviceable computer code with few mistakes. But attempts like ARC-AGI to measure general ability don't necessarily clarify what AI models can and can't be used for. “I don't think it matters whether or not they're artificially generally intelligent,” he says.What might matter far more, based on the recent DeepSeek news, is traditional metrics of cost per task. Utility is determined by both the quality of a tool and whether that tool is affordable enough to scale. Intelligence is only part of the equation.

AGI is supposed to serve as a guiding light for AI developers. If achieved, it's meant to herald a major turning point for society, beyond which machines will function independently on equal or higher footing than humans. But so far, AI has had major societal impacts, both good and bad, without any consensus on whether we're nearing (or have already surpassed) this turning point, Recht, Hernández-Orallo and Hardy say.

For example, scientists are using AI tools to create new, potentially lifesaving molecules. Yet in classrooms worldwide, generative chatbots have disrupted assessments. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more and more U.S. teens are outsourcing assignments to ChatGPT. And a 2023 study in Nature reported that growing AI assistance in university courses has made cheating harder to detect.

To say that AI will become transformative once we reach AGI ignores all the trees for the forest.

Scientists in China have created a satellite with laser-imaging technology powerful enough to capture human facial details from more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) away.

This breakthrough represents a performance increase of 100 times or more compared to leading spy cameras and traditional telescopes, according to a report on the new technology in the South China Morning Post.

Amongst a broad gamut of potential applications, the technology could allow operators to surveil foreign satellites to a previously impossible level of detail. The researchers at China's Academy of Sciences' Aerospace Information Research Institute outlined their findings in a new study published in the Chinese Journal of Lasers (Issue 52, Volume 3).

According to the South China Morning Post, the scientists conducted a test across Qinghai Lake in the northwest of the country with a new system based on synthetic aperture lidar (SAL), a type of laser radar capable of constructing two-dimensional or three-dimensional images.

SAL relies on the motion of an object (like a satellite) to provide finer resolution images than other, beam-scanning radar imagery systems. Previous SAR systems have relied on microwave radiation, which has longer wavelengths, which results in lower resolution images.

However, this new system operates at optical wavelengths, which have much shorter wavelengths than microwaves and produce clearer images (though microwaves are better for penetrating into materials, because their longer wavelengths aren't scattered or absorbed as easily).

During the test, which targeted arrays of reflective prisms placed 63.3 miles (101.8 km) away from the lidar system, the device detected details as small as 0.07 inches (1.7 millimeters) and measured distances to within 0.61 inches (15.6 mm).

This is a huge leap forward from previous milestones, like a 2011 test conducted by defense firm Lockheed Martin that was able to achieve an azimuth resolution of 0.79 inches (2 centimeters) from only 1 mile (1.6 km) away, or a Chinese test where scientists achieved a then-best 1.97 inch (5 cm) resolution at a distance of 4.3 miles (6.9 km).

To achieve this latest breakthrough, the Chinese team split the laser-beam driving the lidar system across a 4x4 micro-lens array, which in turn expanded the system's optical aperture — the opening that controls the amount of light entering a camera system — from 0.68 to 2.71 inches (17.2 mm to 68.8 mm). In this way, researchers could bypass the tradeoff of field of vision versus size of aperture, which has historically restricted such camera systems.

It's important to note that testing took place during near perfect weather and atmospheric conditions with steady wind and limited cloud cover. Inclement weather or other impairments to visibility could significantly impact the system's precision and reliability.

Perovskite cells are much cheaper and more flexible than their silicon alternatives, but they have major durability problems. A new breakthrough could be about to change that.

Scientists have made a cheap and flexible solar cell that lasts nearly 10 times longer than others of its type, an advance that could one day help to revolutionize solar energy production.

Often referred to as the "holy grail" of solar power, perovskite cells offer a lightweight alternative to traditional silicon-based solar technology. Their flexible structure enables them to be applied to cars and phones in the form of a printable layer so they can charge on the go.

Sounds too good to be true? So far, you're right. Perovskites come with some major flaws. Notably, they degrade quickly due to chemical reactions with moisture in the air that make them leak iodine.

But now, a team of researchers has found a solution to this problem. By embedding nanoparticles within the perovskites, they produced a new cell that lasts for 1,530 hours, a near-tenfold increase on previous perovskite solar cell designs. The researchers published their findings Feb. 20 in the journal EES Solar.

"By addressing these common challenges we see with perovskite solar technology, our research blows the doors wide open for cheaper, more efficient and more widely accessible solar power," study co-author Imalka Jayawardena, an engineering researcher at the University of Surrey's Advanced Technology Institute in the U.K., said in a statement. "What we've achieved here is a critical step toward developing high-performance solar cells that can withstand real-world conditions — bringing us closer to their commercial use at a global scale."

As the fastest-growing and cheapest form of renewable energy, solar power is key to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But the technology's growth is hampered by its reliance on silicon, a finite and non-renewable resource that, in its purest form, is costly to produce.

To get around this bottleneck, scientists have looked to develop perovskite alternatives — synthetic versions of naturally occurring calcium titanium oxide crystals that can be made at a fraction of the cost. But unlike pure silicon cells, which can last for decades, solar cells made from perovskite only last for 100 or so hours, drastically limiting their utility.

In the new study, the scientists looked for a way to trap the iodine that leaks from perovskites. Their solution was to embed tiny nanoparticles of aluminum oxide within the cells as they were manufactured. This not only prevented the iodine from leaking but also created a more uniform and electrically conductive structure.

—Solar power generated enough heat to power a steel furnace

—New solar cell technology could ditch batteries in gadgets for good by harvesting ambient room light

After testing these cells under extreme heat and humidity, the researchers found that the modified cells maintained a high performance for more than two months (1,530 hours), a significant improvement on the 160-hour lifespan of unenhanced perovskite cells.

The researchers plan to continue investigating their new technique to see if these gains can be built upon further.

"A decade ago, the idea of perovskite solar cells lasting this long under real-world conditions seemed out of reach," study lead author Hashini Perera, a researcher at the Advanced Technology Institute, said in the statement. "With these improvements, we're breaking new ground in stability and performance, bringing perovskite technology closer to becoming a mainstream energy solution."

A 2022 satellite photo shows a large plume of discolored water rising from the undersea Kavachi volcano, during an eruption that likely scattered the sharks that normally dwell there.

Where is it? Kavachi volcano, Solomon Islands [-8.992492984, 157.96863838]

What's in the photo? A plume of discolored water rising up from an undersea eruption

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? May 14, 2022

This unusual image shows a large plume of discolored water rising toward the Pacific Ocean's surface from the Kavachi volcano, also known as "sharkcano," during an undersea eruption.

Kavachi is a submarine volcano that is part of the Solomon Islands, around 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Vangunu Island. Its peak stands roughly 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above the seafloor and lies just 65 feet (20 m) below the waves. The volcano is named after the sea god of the Vangunu people and is also referred to as "Rejo te Kvachi," or "Kavachi's Oven," according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

In 2015, a research expedition discovered multiple scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) living within the volcano's central crater. The surprising presence of the oceanic predators at the volcano raised "new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals exist," the researchers wrote.

It is unclear whether any of the sharks at Kavachi were hurt by the outburst that triggered the plume in the image or if they were able to sense the incoming eruption and evacuate the crater.

The image was first released in May 2022 by NASA Goddard on the social media platform X along with the caption: "You've heard of sharknado, now get ready for sharkcano."

The plume in the photo is part of an eruption that began in October 2021 and lasted for just a few weeks after the aerial image was taken. Similar plumes occurred during subsequent eruptions in August 2023 and April 2024, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Before then, the volcano's most recent major eruptions were in 2016, 2014, 2007 and 2003. In the past, researchers also sighted ephemeral islands up to half a mile (1 km) wide being birthed by the eruptions and then sinking. A similar ghostly landmass recently emerged after an undersea volcano in Japan blew its top in 2023.

Kavachi experiences "phreatomagmatic eruptions," which occur when magma meets water and ejects steam, ash, volcanic rock fragments and chunks of magma known as "incandescent bombs," according to the Earth Observatory.

A study conducted in the wake of the 2007 eruption found that the volcanic plumes are made of warm, acidic water that also contains particulate matter and sulfur, which "attracts microbial communities that thrive on [the chemicals]," the researchers wrote.

The volcano can also launch jets of heated water without any visible plumes or other signs of erupting.

Residents of neighboring islands have frequently reported that they regularly see steam and ash on the water's surface between eruptions, further confirming that the so-called sharkcano is percolating beneath the surface.

The disparities between men and women in prevalence, risk factors and symptoms of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) have a profound impact on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for women, according to a new American Heart Association scientific statement published today in the Association's flagship, peer-reviewed journal Circulation.

"Peripheral vascular disease is often under-recognized and understudied in women," said Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement. Dr. Kim is the Izard Family Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine, a professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and director of the Center for Women's Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. "While differences in heart disease between men and women are increasingly recognized, equivalent focus on vascular diseases affecting blood vessels outside the heart remains lacking. In order to improve the quality of life and prolong the lives of women with PVD, more research is needed to identify and address these disparities."

The scientific statement, "Sex Differences in Peripheral Vascular Disease," summarizes current knowledge of the differences between men and women with PVD; highlights disparities in risk factors, screening, treatment and outcomes; and outlines key research priorities to mitigate these disparities and promote health equity.

The statement highlights numerous disparities in risk factors, symptoms, screening, treatment and outcomes for various types of PVD.

PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies."

Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement

According to the statement, there is a need to prioritize research to help define differences in PVD between men and women. Future research, from research at the cellular level to clinical trials, should include sex in their design and reporting. Suggestions include:

In addition, the statement also includes suggestions that may help improve diagnosis and long-term prognosis for women with PVD:

This scientific statement was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association's Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; the Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research; and the Stroke Council. American Heart Association scientific statements promote greater awareness about cardiovascular diseases and stroke issues and help facilitate informed health care decisions. Scientific statements outline what is currently known about a topic and what areas need additional research. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. American Heart Association guidelines provide the Association's official clinical practice recommendations.

A year ago, a new head of Social Security set out to stop the agency from financially devastating many of the people it was meant to help.

The agency had long made it a practice to reduce or halt benefit checks to recoup billions of dollars in payments it sent recipients but later said they never should have received.

Martin O'Malley, then the Social Security Administration commissioner, announced in March 2024 the agency would no longer cut off people's monthly old-age, survivors, and disability checks to recoup money they had allegedly been overpaid — a pattern he called "clawback cruelty." Instead, it would default to withholding 10% of monthly benefits. The new policy allowed people who already live on little to pay their rent and keep food on the table.

Last Friday, the Trump administration reversed that policy.

Beginning March 27, to recover new overpayments, the Social Security Administration will automatically withhold 100% of recipients' monthly benefits, the agency announced.

The agency said it was acting in the interest of fiscal responsibility and that the reversal would save the government about $7 billion over a decade.

"It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds," acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said in a news release.

Advocates for Social Security beneficiaries described the action as cruel and harmful.

"The results are predictable: more unnecessary suffering," said Kathleen Romig, who worked at the Social Security Administration under O'Malley and is now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Kate Lang of the advocacy group Justice in Aging said she was heartbroken.

"Those who are most vulnerable, with the fewest resources, are the ones who will feel the harsh impacts of this change," she said. Many "are going to be unable to buy food or keep the roof over their head," she said.

In 2023, after an investigation by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group cast a spotlight on overpayments and clawbacks, lawmakers from both parties called on the Social Security Administration to change its approach.

The policy change a year ago was inspired in part by the plight of people such as Denise Woods, who was sleeping in her Chevy in Savannah, Georgia, in December 2023 while contending with lupus and congestive heart failure after the government cut off her disability benefits. The government was demanding she repay almost $58,000.

Many overpayments are the result of government error. It can take the government years to figure out it has been paying someone too much, and by then, the amount the government says it is owed can grow far beyond a beneficiary's ability to repay. And it has often demanded that recipients repay the full amount within 30 days.

As of October, the SSA was withholding at least a portion of monthly benefit payments from hundreds of thousands of people, according to data the SSA provided last fall to KFF Health News and Cox Media Group. The agency said it was withholding up to 10% from 669,903 people to recoup an overpayment. Asked whether those numbers covered all types of benefits administered by the SSA, the agency's press office didn't say.

“Under Trump's leadership, Social Security has reinstated a cruel policy of clawing back Social Security overpayments with no regard for an American's ability to pay or whether the overpayment was an error by the agency," said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.

The new plan to completely withhold monthly benefits from recipients who were allegedly overpaid does not extend to the Supplemental Security Income program, one of two Social Security programs for people with disabilities. SSI, as the agency explains, covers "people with disabilities and older adults who have little or no income or resources."

The government's estimate that cutting people off completely will save $7 billion over a decade implies it expects many more overpayments in the years ahead.

The SSA's March 7 announcement was part of a broader dismantling of Biden-era policies under President Donald Trump. It was also part of a broader upheaval at the Social Security Administration, which announced In February that it would cut its staff from about 57,000 to 50,000.

In an interview Monday, O'Malley predicted that the public will experience much longer wait times trying to get through to the agency by phone and longer waits for disability determinations.

Social Security runs on a very old computer system, he said, and driving people out of the agency who understand it "can only result in system collapse."

"The risk of totally shutting down the agency is greatly increased by people mucking around that don't know what they're doing," O'Malley said.

On the PBS NewsHour last week, he advised recipients to save money to prepare for an interruption of benefits.

Trump deputy Elon Musk has boasted of taking a chainsaw to the federal government and has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. In a signed declaration filed in federal court last week, a recently retired SSA official, Tiffany Flick, said she "witnessed a disregard for critical processes" as members of DOGE — the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump established by executive order — demanded access to sensitive Social Security systems, including files that contain beneficiaries' banking information.

New management at the SSA called its workforce "bloated." But, under the previous administration, the agency was telling a starkly different story.

A year ago, O'Malley told lawmakers that, as the number of people receiving benefits increased, "historic underfunding and understaffing" at the agency had created a "service delivery crisis."

Late last year, the agency provided data to KFF Health News showing that in September its workforce was near a 50-year low. As of last month, applicants for disability benefits were waiting an average of more than seven months for a decision, according to the SSA website.

The staffing cuts will lead to more overpayments than ever and will make it harder for the people affected to clear up mistakes, said Jen Burdick, an attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia.

As KFF Health News and Cox Media Group revealed in 2023, about 2 million people a year were receiving notices from the SSA that they were overpaid and owed money back.

People can appeal overpayment notices, request a lower withholding rate, or ask the SSA to waive collection altogether, the agency said. The SSA does not pursue recoveries while an initial appeal or waiver request is pending, it said.

Shortly before O'Malley left the SSA in November, the agency implemented changes that made it easier for beneficiaries to get overpayments waived. The agency spelled out grounds for determining the beneficiary was not at fault — for instance, if the agency continued to issue overpayments after the beneficiary reported a change in their financial circumstances that should have led to a reduction in benefits. Those policy changes remain intact.

Several Republicans who expressed concern about clawbacks in the aftermath of 2023 news coverage did not respond to inquiries for this article or declined to comment. One of them was Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is now chair of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging.

"Hardworking American taxpayers pay into Social Security all of their lives so that they can depend on it in the time they need it most," Scott said in a 2023 letter to the agency. "The fact that the SSA's actions are leaving some of them worse off, through no fault of their own, is absolutely unacceptable."

Kirk Vartan pays more than $2,000 a month for a high-deductible health insurance plan from Blue Shield on Covered California, the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace. He could have selected a cheaper plan from a different provider, but he wanted one that includes his wife's doctor.

"It's for the two of us, and we're not sick," said Vartan, general manager at A Slice of New York pizza shops in the Bay Area cities of San Jose and Sunnyvale. "It's ridiculous."

Vartan, who is in his late 50s, is one of millions of Californians struggling to keep up with health insurance premiums ballooning faster than inflation.

Average monthly premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage in California's private sector nearly doubled over the last 15 years, from just over $1,000 in 2008 to almost $2,000 in 2023, a KFF Health News analysis of federal data shows. That's more than twice the rate of inflation. Also, employees have had to absorb a growing share of the cost.

The spike is not confined to California. Average premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage grew as fast nationwide as they did in California from 2008 through 2023, federal data shows. Premiums continued to grow rapidly in 2024, according to KFF.

Small-business groups warn that, for workers whose employers don't provide coverage, the problem could get worse if Congress does not extend enhanced federal subsidies that make health insurance more affordable on individual markets such as Covered California, the public marketplace that insures more than 1.9 million Californians.

Premiums on Covered California have grown about 25% since 2022, roughly double the pace of inflation. But the exchange helps nearly 90% of enrollees mitigate high costs by offering state and federal subsidies based on income, with many families paying little or nothing.



Rising premiums also have hit government workers — and taxpayers. Premiums at CalPERS, which provides insurance to more than 1.5 million of California's active and retired public employees and family members, have risen about 31% since 2022. Public employers pay part of the cost of premiums as negotiated with labor unions; workers pay the rest.

"Insurance premiums have been going up faster than wages over the last 20 years," said Miranda Dietz, a researcher at the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center who focuses on health insurance. "Especially in the last couple of years, those premium increases have been pretty dramatic."

Dietz said rising hospital prices are largely to blame. Consumer costs for hospitals and nursing homes rose about 88% from 2009 through 2024, roughly double the overall inflation rate, according to data from the Department of Labor. The rising cost of administering America's massive health care system has also pushed premiums higher, she said.

Insurance companies remain highly profitable, but their gross margins — the amount by which premium income exceeds claims costs — were fairly steady during the last few years, KFF research shows. Under federal rules, insurers must spend a minimum percentage of premiums on medical care.



Rising insurance costs are cutting deeper into family incomes and squeezing small businesses.

The average annual cost of family health insurance offered by private sector companies was about $24,000, or roughly $2,000 a month, in California during 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Employers paid, on average, about two-thirds of the bill, with workers paying the remaining third, about $650 a month. Workers' share of premiums has grown faster in California than in the rest of the nation.

Many small-business workers whose employers don't offer health care turn to Covered California. During the last three decades, the percentage of businesses nationwide with 10 to 24 workers offering health insurance fell from 65% to 52%, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Coverage fell from 34% to 23% among businesses with fewer than 10 employees.

"When an employee of a small business isn't able to access health insurance with their employer, they're more likely to leave that employer," said Bianca Blomquist, California director for Small Business Majority, an advocacy group representing more than 85,000 small businesses across America.

Kirk Vartan said his pizza shop employs about 25 people and operates as a worker cooperative — a business owned by its workers. The small business lacks negotiating power to demand discounts from insurance companies to cover its workers. The best the shop could do, he said, were expensive plans that would make it hard for the cooperative to operate. And those plans would not offer as much coverage as workers could find for themselves through Covered California.

"It was a lose-lose all the way around," he said.

Mark Seelig, a spokesperson for Blue Shield of California, said rising costs for hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescription drugs put upward pressure on premiums. Blue Shield has created a new initiative that he said is designed to lower drug prices and pass on savings to consumers.

Even at California companies offering insurance, the percentage of employees enrolled in plans with a deductible has roughly doubled in 20 years, rising to 77%, federal data shows. Deductibles are the amount a worker must pay for most types of care before their insurance company starts paying part of the bill. The average annual deductible for an employer-provided family health insurance plan was about $3,200 in 2023.

During the last two decades, the cost of health insurance premiums and deductibles in California rose from about 4% of median household income to about 12%, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, which conducts research on labor and employment issues.

As a result, the center found, many Californians are choosing to delay or forgo health care, including some preventive care.



California is trying to lower health care costs by setting statewide spending growth caps, which state officials hope will curb premium increases. The state recently established the Office of Health Care Affordability, which set a five-year target for annual spending growth at 3.5%, dropping to 3% by 2029. Failure to hit targets could result in hefty fines for health care organizations, though that likely wouldn't happen until 2030 or later.

Other states that imposed similar caps saw health care costs rise more slowly than states that did not, Dietz said.

"Does that mean that health care becomes affordable for people?" she asked. "No. It means it doesn't get worse as quickly."

When congressional Republicans in 2017 pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and slash Medicaid, dozens of physician groups, patient advocates, hospitals, and others rallied to defend the law and the safety-net program.

Eight years later, two industry groups have been notably restrained as GOP lawmakers consider sweeping new Medicaid cuts: the American Medical Association and the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes.

At the same time, the two groups are lobbying Republicans, seeking support on other priorities.

The AMA is lobbying lawmakers to reverse a nearly 3% cut in Medicare's fees for physicians. And the AHCA has pushed Congress to roll back regulations enacted under President Joe Biden that mandate better staffing ratios at nursing homes.

Representatives of the two groups declined to comment on the record about any connections between the Medicaid fight and their other legislative priorities.

But AHCA spokesperson Rachel Reeves said the nursing home group, which has issued a statement defending Medicaid, is communicating with lawmakers about the importance of the program for people with low incomes and disabilities. "We will make sure that the voices of our community are heard and that the message is loud and clear: Congress must protect our seniors who rely on Medicaid," she said. Medicaid is the primary payer for nursing home care, covering more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents.

Nevertheless, other advocates and congressional Democrats said they're frustrated by the two groups. "The time to speak out is now," Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told KFF Health News. "Americans will know which organizations stood up against harmful cuts to Medicaid when this fight is over."

Medicaid, a state-federal insurance plan that together with the related Children's Health Insurance Program covers about 80 million Americans, is in the crosshairs as congressional Republicans seek to trim several trillion dollars in federal spending to offset the $4.5 trillion cost of extending tax cuts enacted in President Donald Trump's first term.

Medicaid cuts on the scale being contemplated would put coverage for millions of Americans at risk. That has alarmed advocates who work with people covered by the program, including children, Americans with disabilities, and low-income older adults. Other advocacy organizations who work with these patients have been much more active.

Last week, more than 400 pediatricians traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak to members of Congress about the importance of Medicaid. More than 100 leaders of safety-net hospitals that serve low-income patients around the country did the same.

Patients' advocates such as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network have defended Medicaid. Last month, state medical societies sent a letter to congressional leaders warning of dire consequences if Medicaid cuts are enacted. And this week, more than 750 members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are expected in Washington, where the group says they'll be lobbying to preserve Medicaid funding.

"Slicing hundreds of billions of dollars from federal funding will force states to cut the care children and families depend on or raise taxes on hard-working Americans," said Chip Kahn, chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals, another trade group fighting to defend Medicaid.

Building coalitions was critical in previous health care debates, said Ron Pollack, the former head of patient advocacy group Families USA. Pollack helped lead the push for the 2010 Affordable Care Act. "We succeeded in the past because we stuck together," he said.

Eight years ago, the AMA and AHCA were key members of the coalition that turned back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.

The AMA, the nation's largest physician group, sent multiple letters to Congress throughout 2017, warning lawmakers in a March 17, 2017, letter that they should "keep upmost in your mind the potentially life altering impact your decisions will have on millions of Americans."

And the AHCA's president was a leading voice opposing repeal, which at one point he called "the biggest threat that the sector has faced in at least 20 to 25 years."

This year, the AMA hasn't sent a single letter or issued any news releases opposing Medicaid cuts. By contrast, the group has issued seven news releases since January on the lack of congressional action on physician fees.

The AHCA issued its first public defense of Medicaid in this year's debate — a document it called a fact sheet — only the day after House Republicans adopted a budget resolution that threatens the program's funding. When the group issued its 2025 policy priorities last week, "Priority #1" focused on staffing, including repealing the Biden-era staffing mandate. "Protecting Medicaid" was "Priority #2."

The Medicaid debate will likely drag on for months as GOP leaders in the House and Senate try to cobble together a bill to extend tax cuts.

Medicaid's defenders say they're still looking for more voices to speak up.

"Republicans have said outright that silence is consent," Wyden said. "If health care organizations don't speak out against the GOP's plans to cut health care, Republican lawmakers are going to assume those organizations are on board with their agenda."

The pope rested peacefully overnight after his prognosis was "lifted" on Monday as he begins his 26th straight day in the hospital, the Vatican said.

Vatican sources told ABC News that Francis' prognosis being lifted means he's no longer in imminent danger, but the clinical picture still remains complex.

The 88-year-old pontiff will continue "for additional days, the pharmacological medical therapy in a hospital environment" due to the "complexity of the clinical picture and the significant infectious picture presented at hospitalization," the Vatican said.

"The improvements recorded in previous days have further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical objectivity and the good response to pharmacological therapy. For these reasons, the doctors decided to lift the prognosis," the Holy See, the Vatican's press office, said in a statement Monday.

The pope will move back to noninvasive mechanical ventilation and will continue an antibiotic treatment, the Vatican sources said.

Francis' doctors said there are positive signs of the pontiff's recovery, but caution remains, according to the Vatican sources.

Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia.

Thursday will mark the 12th anniversary of when Pope Francis was voted to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who previously resigned.

ABC News' Megan Forrester contributed to this report.

Australian mother Clementine Joyce is celebrating an important milestone in her latest pregnancy journey — reaching 25 weeks. The 31-year-old, from Sydney's Northern Beaches, has been pregnant a total of four times, each through in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

She's part of a rapidly growing group of Australian women turning to IVF to conceive, with some projections suggesting that within the next century, a third of all babies in the country could be born in this way.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports that women are having children much later in life, with the highest fertility rates now seen in those aged 30 to 34. While overall fertility is steadily declining, the data also showed that pregnancy rates among women in their 40s are doubling, while those in their 20s are seeing a huge drop.

For Clementine, these figures come as no surprise. For her, IVF has resulted in her daughter, Val, and her current pregnancy. Speaking to Yahoo, the Sydneysider, a nurse, said the majority of her female friends have also struggled with conception. "I would say more of my friends who have tried for babies have struggled compared to those who haven't," she told Yahoo News Australia.

Clementine said that, eventually, many "ended up pregnant", either after trying "for over a year naturally" or from receiving some form of fertility help. She said "in comparison to most" her "IVF journey has actually gone smoothly". But it's not been without its difficulties.

"With IVF and infertility, you're always pending results or significant health news that puts you in a state of distress," she said. "Fertility and making babies feels like a competition. You feel like everyone around you is announcing a pregnancy while you're being left behind with an empty bank account, a barren uterus, guilt for not being able to provide, and no baby.

"There is this loud ticking clock where you know every second you're not pregnant, your chances are getting worse and worse. And even when, or if you get that phone call telling you you're pregnant, the hurdles you go through to maintain that pregnancy are so complicated and debilitating."

As young Australians delay starting a family, it's an increasingly common plight. "Women are starting to try to have babies basically at the end of their fertility window," she said.

Associate Professor Alex Polyakov, medical director at Genea Melbourne, is all too familiar with the struggles facing women like Clementine. He explained that Australia's declining fertility is driven solely by the fact that couples are delaying having kids.

More women are choosing to have children later in life, due to various factors including career advancement, financial stability and personal aspirations. The trend has been particularly noticeable in developed countries like Australia, where the average age of first-time mothers has steadily increased.

"Women are as healthy as they used to be. It's just that in the past – 30 to 40 years ago – the average age of the first motherhood was early 20s," he told Yahoo News.

"At the moment in Australia, the average age of first motherhood is 32 and the average age of IVF patients who come to see us for fertility treatment is 38 — but the best eggs are available in their mid-20s. By the time the woman is 38, the quality of eggs, and the number, drastically decreases.

"So that's the problem. It's a social problem, not a medical problem. And if it wasn't for migration, our population would actually be shrinking right now."

This week, NaturoBest, a prenatal vitamin brand, released data that suggested that within the next century, as many as one in three babies in Australia could be conceived via IVF.

Polyakov suggested that while it's within the realm of possibility, many variable factors will influence how women conceive in the future. He pointed out that just as scientific advancements in recent decades have significantly improved older women's chances of conceiving, similar breakthroughs are likely to continue, making it challenging to forecast future fertility and IVF rates.

He did predict however that within the next 100 years, there "will be technologies available" that will "allow all women to have babies" and "preserve their fertility much better" than what is available today.

"If you think about the progress in the last 50 years, it's been spectacular, but it's only accelerating, and so in the next 100 years, there will be technologies available where a woman at any age would be able to have a baby. And in the NaturoBest paper, they actually talk about this, creating eggs from peripheral or skin cells, or pluripotent cells — various stem cells."

But despite these potential future advancements, there are still significant emotional and personal challenges many continue to face in the journey to parenthood.

Clementine is determined to break the stigma surrounding IVF. She wants to empower women to openly discuss their struggles and share their experiences, in a bid to normalise the conversation and reduce the shame often associated with fertility challenges.

"I have a good friend who was doing IVF treatments at the same time, and she had eight failed transfers in a row. It's heartbreaking," she said. "To those going through the heartache of not falling pregnant or losing pregnancies. I feel it so hard. Try to be kind to yourself. It's cruel and unfair.

"With all the fertility treatments I've done, I have a higher chance of getting both ovarian and breast cancer. Children born via IVF are slightly more likely to have hepatic tumours. Women are more likely to develop postnatal depression (PND) after giving birth, and women with IVF pregnancies have a slightly increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage compared to those who conceive naturally.

"But, I've successfully gotten pregnant and been able to carry one pregnancy to full term, and hopefully this pregnancy as well. Getting pregnant naturally and easily would be ideal, but the reality is that it is going to be less and less common, and we need to accept that."

An extensive tumor genomic analysis of individuals with ovarian cancer, led by researchers from Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah (the U) and Emory University, revealed that Black women have nearly identical mutations to other previously studied populations. But researchers also found a few notable differences that may be clinically relevant.

Our analysis shows the importance of researching different types of populations. The molecular features that we discover in one patient group will allow us to find potential targets for drug therapies that will work for all patients and improve ovarian cancer health care for everyone."

Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed in its later stages due to a lack of clear symptoms or an effective screening approach, according to the National Cancer Institute. Over 12,000 women are estimated to have died from the disease in 2024. Extensive federal and private research has been devoted to understanding the causes and optimal treatment regimens for this deadly type of disease.

The study included individuals between 20 to 79 years of age who had been diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common ovarian cancer. State-of-the-art tumor sequencing technology was used to discern tumor characteristics.

Molecular epidemiologist Kayleigh Lawson-Michod, MPH, PhD, a recent graduate from the U's Population Health Sciences doctoral program, is the first author of the study.

"Prior characterizations, or analyses, of mutations in ovarian cancers were done in predominantly white populations," says Lawson-Michod. "This project was unique in that it was the first large study to characterize tumor mutations in Black individuals with high-grade serous ovarian cancer."

The team compared the results of their research to those of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a National Cancer Institute-initiated landmark genomics database that characterized the genetic makeup of 33 cancer types. Most of the high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples analyzed in TCGA were from white individuals.

The researchers wanted to understand if there were distinctions in the tumors of certain populations given differences in survival.

"The characterizations between these groups showed similar mutations. But Black individuals have a 43% five-year overall survival rate for ovarian cancer, compared to 51% for all American women," says Doherty. "Our research shows that this discrepancy is unlikely to be explained by the genetic makeup of the tumors themselves."

Still, the research team did note a few key differences.

In the analysis of Black individuals, KRAS mutations were more prevalent than in white individuals. KRAS is a mutated gene that causes cancer.

"KRAS did not show up as a significant mutation in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients from TCGA," says Lawson-Michod. "However, just because KRAS may be more prevalent in Black individuals does not mean it is not present in all populations with this cancer type. If validated, this could be a missed treatment opportunity."

Researchers also noted that Black women in the study had a higher prevalence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). HRD prevents damaged cells from repairing themselves. HRD tumors are sensitive to PARP inhibitors, a type of targeted therapy.

"HRD status is associated with better survival, but Black women have higher mortality rates from this disease than other women," says Joellen Schildkraut, PhD, MPH, co-principal investigator of the study, member of the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, and professor of epidemiology at Emory University. "This characterization of ovarian cancer in an understudied population such as this can hopefully impact clinical decision-making for all women with ovarian cancer and inform targeted treatment for this disease."

The results of this study have been published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

The research described in this release is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, including P30 CA042014, and Huntsman Cancer Foundation.

The Trump administration issued its first major set of proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act on Monday that federal officials said are intended to crack down on fraud in the program. Policy experts said they will make it harder for consumers to sign up for coverage, potentially reducing enrollment.

Details were released Monday after a draft press release was inadvertently posted earlier.

About 24 million Americans signed up for insurance plans sold under the ACA, known popularly as Obamacare, for 2025. The Biden administration achieved record enrollment levels after increasing premium subsidies for many lower-income people, which resulted in reducing the monthly cost of some plans to $0. It also made it easier for some very low-income people to sign up at any time of year, instead of waiting for an enrollment period each fall. But the program became plagued by fraudulent enrollment last year, generating about 274,000 consumer complaints through August, most focused on rogue insurance agents and other bad actors, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The Trump administration said in a statement Monday that the new regulations include "critical and necessary steps to protect people from being enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their knowledge or consent, promote stable and affordable health insurance markets, and ensure taxpayer dollars fund financial assistance only for the people the ACA set out to support."

Policy experts said the changes, though, will impose new paperwork burdens likely to hamper enrollment.

"Under this banner of trying to crack down on the bad actions of some insurance brokers, they are penalizing consumers, particularly low-income consumers, with more burdensome requirements and more limits on their access to coverage," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and the co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

Among other new requirements, consumers would have to provide more information proving their eligibility for special enrollment periods and for premium subsidies when they enroll. The regulation would also shorten the annual enrollment period by a month. And it touches on social issues, limiting eligibility for "Dreamers" — a nickname for immigrants in the country illegally who were brought here as children, based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.

The proposal would eliminate the year-round opportunity for a special enrollment period for people with very low incomes. But it would also set new requirements for the remaining special enrollment periods, which allow people to sign up after major life events, such as when their income changes, they lose their job-based coverage, or they get divorced, marry, or move. They would now have to provide evidence of their eligibility when applying under those special situations.

People auto-reenrolled into zero-premium plans during the regular enrollment period would be charged a small monthly payment until they confirm or update their information.

The ACA marketplaces, according to the proposal, would have to seek additional data from consumers, including the self-employed or gig workers, who estimate their income for the coming year but don't have tax return data filed with the IRS for previous years.

The Biden administration made changes to reduce fraudulent enrollment last year including requiring three-way calls among insurance brokers, their clients, and the federal insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, when certain sign-ups or coverage changes were made.

Some of the Trump administration's proposed changes could help warn certain consumers that they've been unknowingly enrolled in an ACA plan, such as a requirement that some customers on even the least expensive plans receive a small, monthly premium bill.

However, the additional paperwork and other eligibility requirements "will probably have a downward effect on enrollment," said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. "Some of that could be protecting enrollees who were fraudulently signed up or don't realize they're still signed up."

Still, it could prove difficult for some people if they're not able to document an expected change in income. "They might have a legitimate claim but have a hard time demonstrating it," Cox said.

The annual open enrollment period would end Dec. 15, a month earlier than this year. The designated period is when most people sign up and is intended to prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll, a move that helps slow premium growth.

The Trump proposal also touches on social issues.

It would reverse the Biden administration policy that allows Dreamers to qualify for subsidized ACA coverage. That decision is already the subject of a court challenge brought by 19 states seeking to overturn it.

Also under the Trump proposal, gender-affirming care would not be considered part of the "essential health benefits" that all plans must cover.

According to an FAQ that accompanied the initial press release of the proposed regulations, the provision could "lead to increased out-of-pocket costs for individuals requiring sex-trait modification services, as they may need to seek plans that offer this coverage as a non-EHB or pay for services out-of-pocket."

As a proposed rule, the measures now face a public comment period and potential revision before being finalized.

"None of it will go into effect right away," said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. "The question is how much will apply in 2025 versus 2026."

The FAQ acknowledged that some of the proposed changes, including ending year-round enrollment for very low-income people, "may increase the administrative burden for consumers associated with enrollment and verification processes or could deter some eligible low-income individuals from enrolling."

But, it continued, "we believe that enhancing program integrity and reducing improper enrollments outweighs these potential impacts on access to coverage."

Some lawmakers and conservative groups have pointed to the concerns about unauthorized enrollment and the role, if any, that ACA subsidies or enrollment periods have in fueling the problem.

The right-leaning Paragon Health Institute, for example, released a report in June that, among other things, called for the Biden administration's expansion of the special enrollment period for low-income people to be reversed.

"There is substantial amounts of fraud and waste in the ACA exchanges and the Biden administration pursued the enrollment-at-all costs strategy, and was tolerant of the waste, fraud and abuse," said Brian Blase, a former health aide during Trump's first presidency who is president of the Paragon Health Institute and influential within the current Trump administration. "Clearly a different approach to protect legitimate enrollees and taxpayers is needed."

Madison Keys' parents initially thought she would become a dancer, but the moment she saw “Venus Williams on TV in a pretty dress” things changed and her parents Rick and Christine Keys did everything they could to help her achieve her dreams.

Keys – who has one older sister named Sydney and two younger sisters named Montana and Hunter – was only four years old when she saw the great Williams donning a white dress at Wimbledon and she immediately fell in love with the game of tennis.

The American eventually turned professional on her 14th birthday in 2009 and not long after she won her maiden WTA Tour match, aged just 14 years and 48 days.

In 2014 she went on to win her first-ever WTA Tour title when she lifted the Eastbourne International trophy and three years later she reached her maiden Grand Slam final, but lost against good friend Sloane Stephens in the final of the US Open.

Several up and down years followed and Keys must've thought that big Grand Slam title moment had come and gone with her defeat at Flushing Meadows.

But with age comes maturity and Keys finally “got to the point where I was okay” with not winning a major trophy.

With that pressure off, she flourished and that Grand Slam winning moment did eventually arrive at the 2025 Australian Open when she produced an astonishing run as she beat world No 2 Iga Swiatek in the semi-final and reigning champion and world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final to lift the title.

It was a richly deserved Grand Slam moment, not just for Madison, but for her parents Rick and Christine, who sacrificed a lot over the years to help her to get to the top.

Rick and Christine hail from Rock Island in northwestern Illinois in the United States and they welcomed a girl, whom they named Madison, into the world on 17 February 1995.

Rick is an attorney and former college basketball player and Christine was also into the law as she was an attorney specialising in personal injury and workers' compensation.

Madison was only four when she found her passion for tennis and Rick told Vavel back in 2015: “It all started when Madison came to us out of nowhere and said she wanted to play tennis. She had seen Venus Williams on TV in a pretty dress and decided that's what she wanted to do.

“Madison was a dancer but we wanted to support her so we got her a racquetball racket and she started to hit on the wall. She would hit all day long. Her passion was evident so we got her into local clinics. Soon she was beating everyone in sight so we needed to look for a more challenging environment.”

The family moved to Florida as the young Madison was signed up at the Evert academy and she told her father: “‘Dad, I feel so normal and happy here'” with Rick adding “this obviously was a big moment because she knew she belonged with these talented young stars”.

The family knew “if we stayed in Illinois the dream would die. There was no looking back”.

Rick added: “I called many other top pros and they all agreed if you were going pro these years are the most important. Well ! we were now all in. We had to get a place near Evert academy, made arrangements to move kids there and still maintain a place in Rock Island to take care of business. It was a whirlwind and a monumental investment that we knew nothing about.”

Christine quit the legal profession for a decade as she took on several roles to support her daughters with Rick saying she was “mother, chauffeur, cook, support team, school etc. Mostly on her own”. He continued: “We both had to make sacrifices and take on significant roles to make it work.”

And work it did as Madison performed on and off court with Christine revealing in 2018 on a United States Tennis Association video: “The best part about being a mom is watching your child figure out a problem.

“When they can figure something out based on the skills that you've helped them develop and they actually are successful at making a good decision, that's the best part.”

Christine eventually returned to law in 2015, but in 2022 she took on a new rewarding role as she became the president of her daughter's charity, Kindness Wins.

“No one knows me better than my mom. So when I had to hire someone to run my charity @kindnesswinsfoundation, I couldn't think of a better person,” Keys wrote.

“My mom is the President of Kindness Wins, handling all of the fundraising and charitable outreach we do, and she knows exactly what I'm passionate about when it comes to helping others!”

And Kindness Wins has gone from strength to strength, just like Madison Keys on and off the court thanks to the help of Rick and Christine.

Jack Quaid is still going strong with his girlfriend, The Boys co-star Claudia Doumit!

The longtime couple stepped out on the red carpet together at the premiere of Jack's new movie Novocaine on Monday night (March 10) at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles.

Jack was joined at the event by co-stars Amber Midthunder, Jacob Batalon, Ray Nicholson, and Matt Walsh.

Here's the synopsis of Novocaine: When the girl of his dreams (Midthunder) is kidnapped, everyman Nate (Quaid) turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected strength in his fight to get her back. 

Watch the final trailer below and catch the movie in theaters on March 14.

Elizabeth Gillies was overjoyed seeing familiar faces while celebrating her most recent production. 

The 31-year-old actress and singer is currently playing Audrey in an off-Broadway production of Little Shop of Horrors. March 5 marked opening night, and there to support her were former Victorious co-stars Avan Jogia, Daniella Monet, and Lane Napper.  

In a new interview, Elizabeth opened up about getting to reunite with the group.  

"Oh my god, it meant so much to me. I love them so much, it meant the world to me that they were there," she told Paper. 

She then gave details about how the costars spent their time together.

"We spent the whole next day walking through Central Park and getting coffee at different places because we couldn't stop talking and hanging out and reminiscing. It's always so exciting to hear about how everyone has grown and evolved and to hear about everyone's success now," she added. 

The red carpet photos of opening night of Little Shop of Horrors showed Elizabeth, Avan, and Daniella smiling while embracing.

CBS is shaking up the FBI franchise in a big way. 

The network just announced that FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted will both be canceled after their current seasons, leaving fans wondering what happened.

Keep reading to find out more…

While CBS hasn't officially stated a reason, all signs point to a major franchise overhaul. 

The network is currently making room in the programming schedule for a brand-new spin-off, FBI: CIA, currently in development with creator Dick Wolf. 

The move suggests CBS is shifting their focus to fresh projects, rather than maintaining long-running spin-offs.

The cancellations still come as a surprise, especially given the success of both series. FBI: Most Wanted premiered in 2020 and will end after its sixth season, while FBI: International, which debuted in 2021, will end with Season 4.

However, there may have been signs of this series shake-up happening as early as last year: Back in May 2024, CBS announced cost-cutting measures, reducing minimum episode guarantees for the cast of FBI and FBI: Most Wanted. The budget trims potentially hinted at a shift in priorities for the network.

CBS has also used this strategy before: NCIS: Hawai'i was canceled just months before the debut of NCIS: Origins, a prequel to the long-running crime drama. 

As a result, it would not come as a surprise if the network was once again replacing established spin-offs with newer ones to keep audiences engaged.

As for FBI: CIA, details are still under wraps, but the show will reportedly follow a dedicated FBI agent and a street-smart CIA agent as they join forces to combat domestic terrorism in New York City. 

The series is now casting for three series regular roles. The pilot will air as a springtime episode of FBI. If ordered to series, FBI: CIA would premiere during the 2025-26 TV season. Get more details.

Gabi Elnicki knew on The Bachelor that Zach Shallcross was not The One for her — and now she can see why he and Kaity Biggar made the perfect match.

“I actually realized when I was there that he was not my person,” Gabi, 27, admitted on the Monday, March 10, episode of the “Almost Famous” podcast. “But when I got back, I was like, ‘Thank god.' No offense to him. Him and Kaity are perfect together.”

Gabi said that she “totally” understands Zach, 28, and Kaity, 30 — who ultimately got engaged in the 2023 season 27 finale — as a couple.

“Being so close with Kaity, I get it much more now,” Gabi said. “Just me, to be honest with you, I'm, like, not probably nice enough. I don't think he could have handled me because I'm sassy. Kaity is very sweet and she's just a nurse. I know myself, I'm a little feisty. I don't think that we would have been compatible in the long run. Like, I'm really kind and really sweet but I pick at people as a joke. Like, I'm very sarcastic and I just don't know if that would have landed well.”



Gabi gushed that she's “so happy” for Kaity and her relationship with Zach — who she thinks has “changed” since his stint as the lead of the ABC reality show.

“We honestly see Zach the Bachelor as a totally different person than her Zac that she has now. I see Kaity a lot, and just hearing about their relationship, it's totally different and I really think it's for the best. They're very happy,” Gabi said. “I think he's changed as a person since the show, or at least from what Kaity and I's conversation have been. I think everyone has. I mean, you're in this bubble and he was having to be the Bachelor so I'm sure that comes with so much pressure. Everything has worked out the way that it was supposed to.”

Since her split from Zach, Gabi has moved on with Zach Espinosa — her friend from Houston that encouraged her to find love on The Bachelor.

“He was like, ‘This is going to be really good for you. You really can't lose anything. If you come back, you could possibly find someone. And if not, think about all of the people that will see you, and then you will find someone,'” she recalled, adding that he was “really just such a supportive friend through it.”

After The Bachelor, the pair went out for dinner and Gabi realized she had feelings for Espinosa and “one thing led to another.” The couple have now been together for nearly two years.

As for whether she thinks she's now found The One in Espinosa, Gabi gushed, “Definitely. I don't really see myself with anyone else. I feel like this is just a really good, healthy relationship.”

Aimee Lou Wood portrays the role of Chelsea on season three of HBO's The White Lotus and fans are absolutely loving her performance.

The 30-year-old actress' teeth have been part of the conversation on social media the last few weeks, and she's now speaking out about her natural smile.

About filming with a largely American cast, she told THR, “These people live in Holly­wood. I live in my little flat in South East London, and I'm so British in my sensibility that I wasn't sure how to handle being around so many people who are so front-footed and confident. All I ever do is take the piss out of myself." 

About her teeth, she added, "Even the way [White Lotus fans] are talking about me and my teeth — that I don't have veneers or Botox — it feels a bit rebellious," she shared.

She said some of the American culture she experienced while hanging out with The White Lotus cast did have an impact.

“I would be more confident now to talk to a director about an idea I have, or just to make shit happen. The first thing I did out of drama school was a play, and I remember thinking it was so cool that I was getting paid for it. Then I got Sex Education and thought it was just a fluke; even when it erupted, I figured my success would pass. It was basically just last week that I woke up and went, ‘What the hell is my life?'” she shared.

Natalie Portman is enjoying public nights out with her new boyfriend, French musician Tanguy Destable!

The 43-year-old Oscar-winning actress was seen supporting Tanguy, 44, while joining him at the Louis Vuitton after party during Paris Fashion Week on Monday (March 10) in Paris, France.

Tanguy produces music for Louis Vuitton shows and while Natalie was not at the show, she did help him celebrate at the after party.

It was reported last week that Natalie and Tanguy are in a new relationship and while they were first linked this month, it's unclear how long they've actually been together.

Natalie and ex-husband Benjamin Millepied finalized their divorce in early 2024. At the time, we learned that they had quietly separated the previous year. The pair got married in August 2012 and share two children - son Aleph, 13, and daughter Amalia, eight.

After the split, some romance rumors briefly linked her to Paul Mescal. However, sources were quick to clarify that they were just friends. 

Benjamin debuted a new relationship in November 2024.

As a member of Rent‘s original Broadway cast, Anthony Rapp got to witness Jonathan Larson‘s genius firsthand.

“He was so prolific,” Rapp, 53, told Us Weekly exclusively on Monday, March 10, while celebrating opening night of the new Off-Broadway musical, The Jonathan Larson Project, in New York City. “And he was so young, but so prolific.”

Now a legend in the musical theater world, Larson died unexpectedly at age 35 shortly before the first preview performance of Rent in January 1996. Rapp starred as Mark Cohen in the original cast alongside Adam Pascal, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs and more.

Rent became a career-defining success, earning Larson multiple posthumous awards, including the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. While it may be his most beloved work, Larson's archive of music is expansive — and The Jonathan Larson Project finally gives fans access to the songwriter's previously unheard work.



“I really went into this not knowing,” Rapp told Us. “I didn't want to know how they structured it. I didn't want to know what songs were in it. I wanted to come to it totally open to whatever it was going to be, and I was very moved.”

Rapp recognized “four or five” of the numbers chosen for the sung-through showcase, which stars Adam Chanler-Berat, Taylor Iman Jones, Andy Mientus, Jason Tam and Lauren Marcus.

“[‘Valentine's Day'] was a song that was in an early version of Rent that got cut and changed and, you know, became something else. … We from the company did a version of ‘Love Heals,' so that was a song I was very familiar with,” Rapp told Us, also citing “Pura Vida” and “Hosing the Furniture” as deep cuts he had a knowledge of.

Along with being introduced to songs he hadn't heard before, Rapp pointed out how special it was to see Larson's inner circle get bigger.

“The family extends,” he gushed, detailing his own personal history with Chanler-Berat and Tam. “It's not Rent-direct, but it's all [connected]. So it feels like being home.”

Despite his familiarity with the new show's cast, Rapp was hands-off during the rehearsal process. “This is theirs. I just feel grateful as a member of the family that they're doing this beautiful work to keep him alive,” he explained. “You know, both things are true — he lives on in his work and he's also gone forever. His legacy lives on, and his legacy is so pure. That's remarkable.”

Speaking to Larson's passion, Rapp told Us, “I know he had moments of doubt and he had moments where he almost gave up, but … he really did always believe in himself. And he always believed in the possibility and the power of what art and theater could be, of what song and music could do, and he was profoundly driven by that. So that's also up and through all of this [show].”

Larson's family was also on hand to celebrate the emotional opening night. “It's very hard to process it and to articulate it right away,” his sister, Julie Larson, told Us after the performance. “But this has been a long time coming and [conceiver] Jen Teffer has had this in her heart and in her sights for years. To see it come to fruition with such a talented, passionate group of people and to hear some of these songs that very few people have ever heard except our family, you know, on cassette tapes, is lovely.”

Julie continued, “It's wonderful. And it's always complicated emotionally, but I'm very happy at the moment.”

The project “shows a lot more colors of where he came from [and] where he started,” Julie said, praising the “wide range of styles” seen on stage. Mientus agreed, telling Us that he was struck by the “curiosity and playfulness” in Jonathan's writing.

“Jonathan Larson is the whole reason that I do this … and I thought we'd seen all the work we had of his,” the actor continued. “So to not only have new work playing in New York City right now, but to be a part of it — to be in Jonathan Larson's third-ever original cast in New York City — is a dream I didn't even know I could have, and it's somehow come true.”

The Jonathan Larson Project is now in performances for a 16-week limited engagement, ending June 1, at the Orpheum Theatre in New York City.

Molly Ringwald reflected on being a muse for late writer-director John Hughes in his 1980s comedies while she was a teenager.

“It's peculiar,” Ringwald, 57, admitted to long-time friend Monica Lewinsky during the Tuesday, March 11 episode of the “Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky” podcast.

Ringwald became an icon of the 1980s thanks in large part to her work with Hughes, who cast her as romantic leads in 1984's Sixteen Candles, 195's The Breakfast Club and 1986's Pretty in Pink.

In her latest interview, Ringwald delved into the complexities of Hughes — who died in 2009 at age 59 — writing Sixteen Candles for her based solely off seeing her headshot when she was only 15 years old.



“In terms of, did I know that I was a ‘muse,' he told me that but when you're that age, I had nothing really to compare it to,” she recalled.

Ringwald added that despite her age disparity with Hughes, who was in his 30s at the time, she actually had “done more movies” than the filmmaker before Sixteen Candles because she worked as a child actress.

“Sixteen Candles was his directorial debut,” she noted. “I had done a few movies … I had actually had more experience but I was still only 15 years old so I didn't have a lot of life experience. It didn't seem that strange to me [that I was Hughes's muse]. Now, it does.”

Ringwald hedged slightly when Lewinsky, 51, asked if she felt her working relationship with Hughes was “weird [or] creepy,” before answering with a laugh: “It's peculiar. It's complimentary. I always felt it was incredibly complimentary.”

“Looking back on it, there is something a little peculiar,” she continued.

Lewinsky asked what it was like for Ringwald to reexamine her relationship with Hughes as an adult, since it all started with the filmmaker “staring” at her teenage head shot.

“It's complex. It's definitely complex,” Ringwald acknowledged. “It's something that I turn over in my head a lot and try to figure out, how that all affected me. I feel like I'm still processing all of that and I probably will until the day I die.”

Ringwald previously examined the complexities of working with Hughes in a 2018 essay for The New Yorker, where she discussed the power-imbalance in their relationship.

“John believed in me, and in my gifts as an actress, more than anyone else I've known, and he was the first person to tell me that I had to write and direct one day,” she wrote at the time. “He was also a phenomenal grudge-keeper, and he could respond to perceived rejection in much the same way the character of Bender did in The Breakfast Club. But I'm not thinking about the man right now but of the films that he left behind. Films that I am proud of in so many ways.”

In her new podcast interview, Ringwald looked back on what it meant to be internationally famous as a teenager, telling Lewinsky that it may have been easier for her than most since she'd had “varying degrees of fame” as a child.

“I've been a performer since I was 3. Literally, since I was 3 years old on stage,” she pointed out.

Since Ringwald acted in community theater from such a young age, she often felt like a “celebrity” to the people who came to watch her perform.

“I was written about. It was a sort of fame, a degree of fame,” she remembered. “Then, everything I did, I sort of became a little bit more well-known. You move to Los Angeles and, of course, nobody knew who I was until I started to do [movies].”

She went on: “I feel like I've never known a world where I haven't been a little famous … At a certain point, then I became really, really famous. I feel like, when you're on the cover of Time magazine … when it gets to that point, it becomes a level of fame that I don't personally feel that comfortable with.”

Ringwald was initially “happy” with the projects she was making as a teen superstar, but slowly began to feel “all the fame and notoriety” was “really overwhelming and scary.”

“[The fame] changed me a bit,” she said. “Maybe this is just who I am but there's a part of it where I felt like I became very closed and very self-protective.”

In recent years, Ringwald has publicly grappled with the legacy of her films with Hughes, which have been criticized for outdated depictions of sexism and racism.

The '80s icon told Andy Cohen in a 2021 interview that, while rewatching her classic films with daughter Mathilda, it was important to put them in the context of the time in which they were made.

“I feel like that's what makes the movies really wonderful, and it's also something I wanted to go on record talking about — the elements that I find troubling and that I want to change for the future,” she argued. “But that doesn't mean at all that I want them to be erased. I'm proud of those movies, and I have a lot of affection for them. They're so much a part of me.”

Wendy Williams says she passed her competency tests with "flying colors."

One day after being rushed to a New York hospital, the former daytime television host spoke with Rosanna Scotto on a live segment of "Good Day New York" on Tuesday to discuss the outcome of her competency tests.

Williams said she is currently in the hospital and passed her tests with "flying colors."

"Everybody knows factually that Wendy is not incapacitated," Ginalisa Monterrosa, a caretaker for Williams, told Scotto.

Wendy Williams Hospitalized For 'Evaluation' After Receiving Welfare Check

During an appearance on "The Breakfast Club" that same morning, Williams further explained why she pleaded to go to a medical facility and get evaluated by an independent doctor.

"The police showed up. I'm exhausted. I wanted to go to the hospital to talk to the doctor," Williams, who has been under a court-appointed guardianship since May 2022, told the hosts.

Monterroso said that they have been laser-focused on trying to get "some kind of motion" into the TV personality's guardianship case.

"We were pretty stuck at one point waiting for the lawyers to break through and get some type of trial," Monterroso said while on "The Breakfast Club." "I did two things. I wrote a letter to the Adult Protective Services and explained to them Wendy's situation. She was isolated and needed an investigation."

"Yesterday morning, during our morning calls, I told Wendy, 'We will be calling the police and telling them that you're isolated.' I pleaded with the police as if Wendy was my child. ‘Please you need to get her off this floor. She is confined.'"

Williams said during her chat with law enforcement, she told them "I am not incapacitated as I've been accused [of]."

"This floor that I live on is the memory unit," Williams explained. "The people who live there don't remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on? It's a cry for help."

When officers visited Williams at the current facility she is residing in, Monterrosa said the TV host began to feel "a little bit of anxiety."

Monterrosa explained that she advised Williams to ask police officers to take her to a hospital and ask for an independent doctor to conduct a medical evaluation. Monterrosa said the facility was giving them a "hard time," but they were eventually able to get Williams to a local hospital.

"When I got to the hospital, I got checked in," Williams said. "They checked me for the heart palpitations, they did all kinds of scans."

Moterrosa explained that both Williams' guardian and attorney were both present at the hospital, but shared a "difference in opinion" about how to proceed with the evaluations.

After the doctor cleared her evaluations through the hospital's legal department, Williams took two competency evaluations, said Monterrosa.

"She passed both tests," she said.

"On Monday, the NYPD responded to a welfare check at 505 West 35 Street," the New York Police Department said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

"EMS responded and transported a 60-year-old female to an area hospital for evaluation."

According to the New York Post, Williams had thrown a handwritten note that read "Help! Wendy!!" out the window.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Williams and Monterrosa for further comment.

Earlier this year, Williams denied she was cognitively impaired and admitted during an interview with "The Breakfast Club" that her guardianship felt like a "prison."

"I am not cognitively impaired but I feel like I am in prison," Williams said in January. "I'm in this place with people who are in their 90s and their 80s and their 70s. .... These people, there's something wrong with these people here on this floor. I am clearly not."

"Where I am… you have to get keys to unlock the door to press the elevator to go downstairs, first of all. Second of all, these people here, everybody here is like nursemaids, so to speak," she said. Williams admitted she isn't privy to what medication she's given. "Excuse me, doctor, can you tell me what this pill is for?"

In February 2024, Williams' team announced she had been diagnosed with both progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia.

Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright certainly aren't the only couple struggling in The Valley.

In the first trailer for season 2 of Bravo's hit reality show released Tuesday, March 11, the cast continues to deal with the fallout of both long-term relationships dissolving and the rumor mill continuing to run wild.

“Jax has been seeing people,” Brittany shares in one scene. “He had a girl staying here in the house again last night. There is a thong on my bathroom sink. Why was there a baby wipe on top of it?”

Later, Jax is seemingly served with divorce papers as Brittany shares what she wants from him and their relationship going forward.



“I already told him — filing, restraining order and custody,” she explains before accusing her estranged husband of having “people watching me.”

In August 2024, Brittany filed for divorce from Jax after five years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple share 3-year-old son Cruz. One month earlier, Us Weekly confirmed that Jax entered a 30-day treatment program to address his ongoing mental health struggles.

Most recently, the former Vanderpump Rules star admitted in the March 4 episode of Alex Baskin's “Hot Mic” podcast that he was an addict and had been sober for 83 days.

“I'm at the point where I'm so in love with the man I want to become,” Jax tearfully shares in one scene, “that I'm just not satisfied with who I am anymore.”

While Jax and Brittany try to coparent, Jesse Lally and Michelle Saniei are struggling to keep the peace as they move forward with their divorce while raising daughter Isabella, 4.

“You're a f—ing drunk,” Michelle claims in an explosive argument with her ex. Jesse responds, “Well she's a hooker so it's fine.”



Michelle, however, has the last word when she reminds Jesse, “I'm the mother of your f—ing child.”

Even couples who appeared stronger than ever in season 1 now find themselves facing rumors and wild accusations.

Kristen Doute accuses Janet Caperna's husband Jason of taking his wedding ring off when he goes out. As for Nia Sanchez's husband Danny Booko, rumors spread that he gets “wasted and handsy and inappropriate.”

Thirty years after her name was linked to the orchestrated assault of Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding trended all over social media after a wild high school track attack. 

The bizarre incident happened at the Virginia High School League Class 3 State Indoor Championships at Liberty University last week, when a runner named Alaia Everett appeared to hit another runner over the head with a baton during the 4x200m relay.

Kaelen Tucker, the athlete who was hit, reportedly suffered a concussion and a potential skull fracture. 

Video of the alleged attack went viral, which caused Harding's name to be invoked by some individuals drawing a line between the incident in Virginia and the 1994 attack of Kerrigan, during which Kerrigan was struck in the knee with a baton by a hitman hired by Harding's then-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and Harding's then-bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.



“This is Tonya Harding 2.0, imo,” one person wrote via X. “She should, at a minimum, be charged with assault and the intent to injure!”

Another person called Everett the “Tonya Harding of track and field!”

“I hope they ban her for life,” the individual added.

In an interview with WAVY TV 10 (an ABC affiliate in Norfolk, Virginia) on Sunday, March 9, alleged assailant Everett attempted to explain that the entire ordeal was one big misunderstanding. 

“After a couple times of hitting her with my baton, I got stuck behind her back and (the baton) rolled up her back,” Everett said. “I lost my balance, and when I pumped my arms again, she got hit.”

Everett added, “I know my intentions and I would never hit somebody on purpose.”

The aftermath and social media backlash has taken a toll on Everett, a senior at I.C. Norcom High School in Portsmouth, Virginia.

“They're assaulting my character, calling me ghetto, racist slurs, death threats, all of this, just because of a nine second video,” she said. 

The Everett family has been served court papers saying Tucker and her family are seeking a protective order against them.

“It doesn't seem right that this would happen and now we have to go to a city three hours away that everyone hates our guts already,” Everett's father, Genoa, told WAVY TV 10. 

As for Harding, now 54, she pleaded guilty in March 1994 to a charge of “conspiracy to hinder prosecution” in relation to the assault on Kerrigan. She received three years probation and was issued a $160,000 fine. 

Three months later, Harding was banned from U.S. Figure Skating for life. She has yet to comment on the recent incident.

FBI star Zeeko Zaki is responding to CBS canceling two of the show's spinoffs: FBI: Most Wanted and FBI: International.

In a new interview, he shared what he's "a little sad" about.

TV Line asked, "Is there anybody on either of those shows you wish you'd gotten a chance to work with more?"

Zeeko shared, "I would've loved to do a few more crossovers and get to work with the entirety of the cast and stuff like that, so I'm a little sad about that. I've always been jealous of our International cast and crew that get to film over in Europe. But we'll see. Who knows? Maybe there will be opportunities for me to work with all of them in the future. Their worlds will stay alive regardless of the shows."

Ben Affleck will make sure his children know the value of a dollar.

When speaking with Access Hollywood at the premiere of "The Accountant 2" at the SXSW film festival, the 52-year-old actor humorously addressed a video that went viral recently, featuring his teenage son admiring a $6,000 pair of Dior Air Force 1s.

"That's what happens when you tell a motherf---er they have to mow a lawn," he told the outlet. "All of a sudden they don't want those shoes, and he was like, ‘But I always said they were tough.'"

He asked the reporter if she had any children, then explained, "It's always some grift why I need to be … I'm like, 'Man, you do not need thousand-dollar shoes!' He's like, 'We have the money.' I'm like, 'I have the money, you're broke!'"

Ben Affleck Relishes Jennifer Garner Family Time, Stark Turnaround From Red Carpet Life

In the original video, Affleck and his son Samuel, 13, could be seen browsing various pairs of shoes at a sneaker convention, where Samuel spotted the Dior shoes. Upon seeing the hefty price tag, Affleck told his son, "That's a lot of lawns you gotta mow there."

The "Gone Girl" actor shares Samuel with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, along with two older daughters; Violet, 19, and Seraphina, 16.

Their eldest daughter, Violet, graduated from high school in May 2024 and has spent the past school year studying at Yale. Garner shared her reaction to her daughter's graduation on Instagram at the time, posting a series of photos, including a teary-eyed photo of her cheering on Violet during a graduation event.

"Tell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate," she wrote in the caption. "(Bless our hearts)." The remaining photos featured her crying while on a plane and another one of her wearing "2024" glasses.

Affleck and Garner first announced their split to the public in 2015, after 10 years of marriage, and later finalized their divorce in 2018. Although they have both moved on and have dated, and in his case, married other people, they remain close as co-parents.

"When you have children with somebody you're connected to them forever," he told "Good Morning America" in February 2020. "And I'm very lucky she is the mother of my children. I'm very grateful and respectful of her. Our marriage didn't work, and that's difficult. Both of us really believe that it's important for kids to see their parents respect one another and get along, whether they're together or not."

The couple have been spotted together many times over the years, most recently on a paintball outing with one of their children. While the internet is swirling with reconciliation rumors, a source told Fox News Digital they had "a bunch of good energy around them," and that "you can just tell they were mainly there for their kid."

Video footage from the paintball event shows Affleck hugging Garner from the side as she points her paintball gun at a target off-screen. He later picks up his own paintball gun, after Garner does not return the hug.

"Many couples who are divorced and co-parenting stand with distance between their bodies as a way to maintain emotional distance," body language expert, Nicole Moore, told Fox News Digital. "However, Ben and Jen's bodies appear to be actively leaning in toward one another, indicating that they still share emotional intimacy."

Following their divorce, Affleck rekindled his romance with Jennifer Lopez. The two were married for roughly two years, before finalizing their divorce in February 2025. Garner has been linked to John Miller, chairman of CaliGroup, since 2018, and although they took a break at one point, People reports they have been together since 2023.

Hulu's new Rust documentary interviewed several actors who worked on the movie the day of the shooting — but not every cast member spoke out about Halyna Hutchins‘ death.

Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna, which premiered on Tuesday, March 11, featured first-hand accounts from several stars of the movie, including Josh Hopkins and Devon Werkheiser. Director Joel Souza appeared in the doc as well after getting injured on set.

The Western film is set in Kansas during the 1880s, where an aging outlaw comes out of hiding to rescue his nephew, who is sentenced to hang for an accidental killing. The duo become fugitives who are determined to outrun a vicious bounty hunter.

Filming on Rust began in October 2021, at Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Production was suspended that same month when Hutchins was fatally shot from a prop gun fired by Rust star — and producer — Alec Baldwin while they were in preparation for a scene. Souza was injured by the same round.



Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter in January 2023 and he has continued to deny pulling the trigger on the gun. Baldwin pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped in April 2023, but he was indicted again in connection with the death of Hutchins. The second case was ultimately dismissed by the judge and Baldwin has since filed a lawsuit accusing the prosecution team of malicious prosecution and civil rights violations.

Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was also charged and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter but not guilty of the additional charge of tampering with evidence. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison while Rust first assistant director David Halls pled guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon, and received a suspended sentence and six months of probation. (Halls pleaded no contest in March 2023 to an additional misdemeanor charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, for which he received a sentence of six months of unsupervised probation, a $500 fine and 24 hours of community service.)

Halls participated in Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna along with other crew members who shed light on the challenges that plagued the Rust set. The A-camera first assistant Lane Luper, who quit before the Rust shooting took place, recalled three “negligent discharges” taking place in the weeks before Hutchins' death.

In February 2022, the Hutchins family filed a lawsuit against Rust productions and other responsible parties including Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed. After extended negotiations, the parties reached a confidential settlement that provided for Rust to be completed. Production resumed in April 2023 and concluded the next month.

“I can never be around a weapon that will fire again — in any circumstance. I don't want to be around it and I want nothing to do with it. I can't be near it,” Souza mentioned in Hulu's doc. “There will be nothing that is capable of any discharge — you may as well be holding a paperweight.”

Andy Wert, who was brought in to replace Gutierrez-Reed, addressed his decision to join the production, saying, “I got the call and I thought someone has to do it and it might as well be me. Whenever you are on a film set, they are all treated like real weapons. That way everyone has a heightened sense of safety. I wanted to do it because of Halyna and so this gets done safely so everyone is comfortable. That is what the goal is and everyone goes home.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of which actors took part — and which didn't — in Hulu's doc about the Rust shooting and aftermath:


Baldwin's perspective was featured in the documentary through footage from his trial, body cam videos from the day of Hutchins' death and audio provided during an OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) investigation.

While Baldwin didn't speak out in the doc, he did return to finish filming Rust. He also elaborated on the incident in his TLC reality series with wife Hilaria Baldwin.

“This has been just surreal,” Alec told Hilaria during the season 1 premiere, which aired in February. “I can't even believe that we're going through this, and I always feel more in pain about you than I do. I think to myself that I'm going to try to my best to just get through it, and I think about what it's done to you and how much it's hurt you and everything.”

Alec elaborated in a confessional, saying, “This past year was just terrible. There were times I'd lay in bed. I'd go, ‘Wow, my kids. I can't get up.' That's not like me. I'm not like that at all, not in any way am I like that. Never.”

“My first day [on set], this girl [Hannah] comes over and interrupts our conversation. She has an arm full of guns — she just barreled her way in — and I thought that was so unsafe to be walking around with a bunch of guns in your hand,” Fisher recalled in the Hulu doc. “Alec seemed a little [confused] as well and then I found out she was the armorer.”

Later in the special, Fisher said it felt “a little emotional” to return. “I wish I said something to [Halyna] and Alec [at the time],” she noted about the interaction. Fisher admitted she “didn't want to make waves” but also wasn't sure her speaking out would have “changed anything.”

Fimmel was cast as bounty hunter Fenton “Preacher” Lang when Rust originally went into production. He wasn't featured in Hulu's doc and hasn't previously spoken out about the shooting. Multiple publications name Fimmel as one of the cast members who returned to finish filming the movie.

The role of Sheriff Wood Helm was originally played by Ackles but he was ultimately replaced by Josh Hopkins after the delayed production caused scheduling conflicts. Ackles didn't appear in the doc but he issued a statement after Hutchins' death.

“This has been a tragedy of epic proportions that we are all still processing,” he wrote via Instagram at the time. “Earlier last week I felt compelled to tell Halyna just how awesome I thought she was. I told her how incredible I thought her camera shots were and just how exciting it was to watch her and her team work. Truly. She laughed and said thank you and gave me a hug. I'll forever be thankful we had that moment. She had a spunk and passion that infected the entire crew from the top down.”

He continued: “She was an inspiration. My heart and prayers go out to Halyna's husband, son and the rest of her family. There just aren't enough words to express what an immense loss this is. She will be incredibly missed by all of us who knew and admired her.”

Hopkins was seemingly cast in a different role on Rust before taking over as Wood Helm after Ackles' exit.

“They said, ‘[Halyna's husband] Matt [Hutchins] wants it done.' I am not coming back for anything until I hear it from his mouth. And they put me on a Zoom with him and he said he wanted it finished and she would want it finished and for people to see her work,” Hopkins explained in the doc. “I am glad there is a different ending for the experience but this experience will never be over for anyone associated with it.”

Earlier in the doc, Hopkins slammed those who criticized their decision to finish Rust. “But the internet is going to [the] internet because it is the land of cowards and that can be enraging,” he noted. “They don't know anything about a movie set or the hearts of the people involved.”

The Nickelodeon star played Boone LaFontaine before — and after — the shooting halted production.

“On a set where we are shooting guns every day, the danger of that is horrifying. I could have been the person who shot someone or I could have been the person that was shot,” Werkheiser shared, while admitting it was “painful” watching Gutierrez-Reed go through the trial.

“Coming back and picking up where we left off, it felt like being alone in a sea of people. I guess that is how trauma and grief goes,” Werkheiser said in the doc. “Finishing this movie feels like some step toward healing.”

Busey portrayed Drum Parker but didn't appear in the doc.

“We finished Rust at the end of May, in Montana. The experience was amazing and I can't wait to see the film, as a lot of emotions went into this one. I didn't know Halyna but I know a lot of her friends, and this film was finished with the utmost effort to pay homage and respect to her while exhibiting and sharing her last work with the world,” he wrote via Instagram in 2024. “She was an amazing woman from those I've spoken to. I'm so sorry to have not met her and though it is tragic, her memory is forever preserved in this film. We finished it in her honor. In somber mind, with loving hearts. It was a close and dedicated crew.”

Noon was originally cast as Lucas but his other commitments made him unavailable when production picked back up. He was replaced in the role by McDermott and neither appeared in Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna.

Some of Bachelor Nation's newest members may be headed to the beach for season 10 of Bachelor in Paradise.

The women of The Bachelor season 29 exclusively told Us Weekly whether they're interested in continuing their journey for love on Bachelor in Paradise. “I am still looking for love. I am single, if anyone is out there,” Sarafiena Watkins told Us after the Women Tell All taping. “I feel like there has to be people that would entice me to go, I am really serious about finding someone.”

Sarafiena, 29, was sent home ahead of this season's hometown dates. Even though Grant Ellis wasn't The One for her, Sarafiena told Us she'd be down to date another member of Bachelor Nation.

“I am just so open,” she shared. “I feel like if there is a good match for me, let me know.”



Alexe Godin, who was also eliminated ahead of Grant's hometown dates, told Us that “it would be fun” to join Paradise, even though she's never watched a “full season” of the Bachelor spinoff. “I have watched a couple of episodes, and it is more my speed,” she stated. “It is a little more lighthearted, more fun, more goofy, and I think that is me. I would have a good time and have [the] potential to meet my future husband there.”

Calling herself a “broken record,” Alexe, 27 admitted that she's not familiar enough with the men of Bachelor Nation to have her sights set on someone specific in Paradise. Luckily, the fans have a pick in mind for her.

“I keep hearing from people that Jonathon [Johnson] and I would make a cute couple,” she told Us of Jenn Tran's third place contestant from The Bachelorette season 21. “I went to hug him tonight and he said, ‘Don't hug too tight, people are going to scream.' I have heard really good feedback from people that he is a really good guy, so who knows? I keep saying, him and Tanner [Courtad] [are] cute, I think we can all agree.”

Another member of Grant's Bachelor cast interested in joining the season 10 cast of Paradise is Alli Jo Hinkes, who went home during the third rose ceremony of the season. “If I got asked to do Paradise and I was single at that point of my life … possibly,” she told Us. “We will see.”

Dina Lupancu, however, is “not sure” whether Paradise is in the cards for her after a drama-filled season. “Being in the experience again and seeing the girls, it made me miss it,” she said of the Women Tell All taping. “But I don't know. I also haven't stalked any of the guys, so I have to do that.”

Dina, 31, was sent home following her hometown date during the show's March 3 episode, while Juliana Pasquarosa, Litia Garr and Zoe McGrady all advanced to the fantasy suite dates. At the Women Tell All taping, Dina told Us she knew she wasn't going to make it to Grant's final three during her hometown date, which her family declined to participate in.

“Something that was hard for me, and I didn't realize until I lived it, was that when you are waiting for your hometown — and mine was last, there is, like, 7 days [of waiting],” she explained. “Before that was a travel day and then the date in Scotland, we barely got to talk. So you are talking [about] nine days when we didn't see each other, we didn't talk, we don't have our phones, so you don't have anything to continue to foster that connection.”

She went on to note that it took her “a few weeks” to get over her breakup with Grant.

SANTA FE, N.M. — Gene Hackman didn't want to slow down, according to friends in the Santa Fe community he spent almost 40 years in with his wife, Betsy Arakawa Hackman, by his side.

Stephen Marshall, a retired FBI agent who trained them through a community outreach program, recalled the Oscar-winner was "bothered" by aging.

"Gene was concerned about the fact that he was getting older. He didn't like being old, and seeing himself on film bothered him because he knew he didn't look like that anymore," Marshall, who later became a friend of the Hackmans, told Fox News Digital.

He recalled inviting Gene and Betsy to a screening of one of Gene's films, "Night Moves," but the invitation was declined.

"She said Gene broke into a cold sweat when she brought it up, but he just ... didn't want to be any part of it. And so I tried to respect that."

He continued, "When we went out, he didn't want to advertise who he was. I remember the first time we went out, we're walking down the street in Santa Fe, and I noticed people noticing him. And I said, ‘Do you get used to the idea of people going, "Hey, that's Gene Hackman"'? And he said, "Yeah, but now they add, ‘And he got so old.'" So I thought he looked much younger. I thought he looked great, but he was concerned that he had aged and that bothered him."

Marshall first met Gene and Betsy at a picnic event celebrating the 100th anniversary of the FBI, and he later trained them through a citizens' academy, a program to help people learn about the bureau.

"I got to talk to them a little bit more as we took him to the range one day. We shot all the bureau guns, and I had a business card with my cellphone number I was going to give Betsy at the end of the academy and tell her, ‘If you guys ever need anything, just give me a call.' And as I was walking up to give it to her, she turned around and handed me a Post-it note that she had already filled out with her phone number and email and said, ‘Gene and I would like [to] take you to dinner if you have time.' And I'm thinking, ‘I think I can squeeze it in!' And so we went to dinner a couple of weeks later, and after that we just became friends."

Gene Hackman Told Friend He Would Have Died 'Long Ago' Without Wife Betsy

Marshall hadn't seen them for a while before their deaths, recalling Gene was "starting to have some issues with age. And so I was seeing them less and less often. They were going out less."

Gene died around Feb. 18 due to hypertensive and atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributing factor, New Mexico officials confirmed last week. He was likely alone in their home for about a week after Betsy died due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is transmitted from animals to humans and is commonly found in rodents.

While many friends remarked upon the couple's private behavior, all were impressed by how active and engaged they were, particularly Gene.

Mike Anaya, a sports medicine specialist with Santa Fe Spa, told Fox News Digital, "Gene, at 84, he had a background in the Marines. He used to box in the Marines. So he was a tough guy. And he knew what he was doing."

Anaya first worked with Gene after Betsy reached out along with a referral from a doctor to address a shoulder injury.

After rehabbing the shoulder injury, Anaya said Gene's training regimen was "scapular stability, of course, to build hip stability and proprioception, that's balance. He was getting a little bit older, so we had to address that."

Anaya said Gene "had a boxing background in the military. So he knew how to stand. He knew how to throw punches, he knew how to move. So I was very impressed," adding that they never exchanged punches, just worked with practice mitts.

He also recalled getting to know them well, saying, "After a while working with Gene, he insisted that I call him Gene instead of Mr. Hackman. So, you know, they're really nice people. He wasn't stuck up. He was a good man … and she was a good lady."

Gene also gifted the trainer a few of his paintings, a beloved hobby of the late actor.

Mike Putnam, a golf instructor who worked with them, also noted that the Oscar-winner insisted that he be called Gene instead of "Mr. Hackman."

The "French Connection" star left a note on Putnam's desk requesting lessons.

"[He was a] terrific person. And it just developed from there and several golf lessons. We enjoyed time together, and eventually Betsy, his wife, joined us, and she started taking lessons as well. "So it just became a nice, fun relationship to have," Putnam told Fox News Digital.

He shared that Gene was "determined" to learn the game, noting that golf is more difficult than might be expected.

"I think he kind of knew that. But I think he always probably expected to do a little better than he was doing, you know?" Putnam said with a laugh. "But I was able to talk him through that and set the right expectations to help him enjoy it and not have such high expectations."

He continued, "And Betsy, when she started playing, it frustrated him a little more, because she was a little more athletic, actually, and she kind of took to the game quicker and maybe probably just didn't get in her own way. You could just see Gene grinding in his head. But gosh, what a delight both of them were."

Putnam was one of several people in Gene's orbit to receive a painting from the actor. Putnam's came with a simple note that read, "Thanks for our time" after working on lessons together.

Stuart Ashman, a friend of Gene and Betsy's, also received a painting from the actor after routinely delivering him a dozen eggs from his small farm.

"One day he brought me a painting, and I said, ‘You can't give me this painting.' He says, ‘Yeah, you've been giving me eggs for months.' So I traded a painting for eggs, which is pretty nice. So now I have this wonderful treasure," he told Fox News Digital.

Ashman and Gene met when they served on a committee together at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and they bonded further through a shared Pilates teacher.

"He was the class after me, and it was a one-on-one class, and we would sit and talk for long enough that the teacher said, ‘Gene, are you going to take a class today or are you just going to talk to Stuart?' And that's really kind of how it was. It was a strong connection. Although, you know, now that he's passed, I lament the fact that we didn't spend more time together."

Gene Hackman's Friends Say He Was ‘Slowing Down' And ‘Reclusive' Ahead Of Mysterious Death

Ashman also recalled, "He was very fit, you know, and he was 6-foot-2 plus an ex-Marine. He did Pilates like three times a week. And then on the days that he didn't do Pilates, he would load his bicycle up to his SUV and drive to Albuquerque, which is 70 miles, and ride this trail down there, which is along the river and it's paved and level. So he didn't want to do mountain biking, but he did that. So he was in great shape."

Daniel and Barbara Lenihan and their son, Aaron, recently spoke with People magazine about Gene and Betsy, saying Gene had been "essentially kind of home-bound" in "recent times" and "quit riding his bike through the neighborhood."

Aaron told the outlet, "Betsy tried to keep him kind of active and engaged," adding that the "Mississippi Burning" star did puzzles and yoga via Zoom daily.

"She was still trying to keep him as active and engaged and healthy as possible," Aaron said.

Gene and Betsy also shared some active hobbies, like fly-fishing and learning to fly planes.

Ivan Valdez, the owner of The Reel Life, told Fox News Digital that Betsy called his shop eight years ago and got everything set up for Gene and former NFL star and coach Jack Del Rio to go up to the Pecos Wilderness for a relaxing day.

"A few years ago, Gene's wife, Betsy, gave us a call at the fly shop wanting to get a trip set up for her husband and Jack Del Rio, who is a former NFL coach. So I ended up taking them to Cal Creek Ranch in the Pecos Wilderness, and it was just a spectacular day out there with them," Valdez said.

Valdez said he was "pretty nervous" to go fly-fishing with someone of Gene's caliber, but the movie star made "the day so comfortable and easy to be around him."

"We got into a lot of deep conversations about family," Valdez said.

Andy Wells, a retired military pilot and flight instructor, first met the couple in 1987 and worked with Gene to get his pilot's license up to date and train Betsy in flying, partially as a backup in case of emergencies.

Wells said both Gene and Betsy were good pilots, and Gene, who had years of experience, "had the moves."

After the couple's successful lessons with Wells, they would occasionally meet for other activities in the Santa Fe area.

"I would bump into him around town, and eventually I think he joined the El Gancho swim and tennis club. And then he and I became tennis buddies. And that was an experience."

As many friends noted, Gene became "reclusive," and Wells didn't see him or Betsy for years.

"The two of them were joined at the hip, practically. So, if he became reclusive, I think she did, too. And she was very quiet. Anyway, if she went out on her own and was in the same grocery store [as] me, it would be easy to not see her. She was small and quiet and very, very focused. I thought she was great."

Gene was also generally active in the Santa Fe community.

Jennifer LaBar-Tapia, the Santa Fe Film Commissioner, shared that the "Superman" star didn't lead a Hollywood life in town.

"Gene Hackman is an icon, as all film fans know. But having Gene Hackman the neighbor here, he was just a man about town. He was very approachable. He and his wife were woven deep into our community. She was a business owner. He sat on the board of directors for our Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. He invested in a handful of restaurants here in Santa Fe, so he was very much a foodie. He was an artist. He was an author. So really, his time in Santa Fe was really toward the end of his career as Gene Hackman, the actor that we already knew him as. But we got the privilege of getting to know him as the author, the artist and the foodie," she told Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital's Tracy Wright, Lauryn Overhultz, Janelle Ash, and Stephanie Giang-Paunon contributed to this report.

Stephen Colbert began his monologue Monday by addressing President Donald Trump's economy. Not only has the Dow Jones dropped significantly, Colbert pointed out, but so has the nation's projected GDP growth.

“According to the Atlanta Fed, so far growth in the current quarter was a stunning negative 2.8 percent," Colbert said.

He noted that this means that “the GDP is shrinking at the fastest pace since the pandemic lockdown.”

Colbert joked, “In the first Trump term, it took a disease to destroy the economy. This time, he is the disease.”

But although Colbert has taken plenty of shots at Trump over the past few weeks for his handling of the economy, tonight he took aim at Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino for his spin on the crisis.

“Who cares if we take the Dow down to 35,000, if that's what happens? Nobody will care,” Gasparino said in the clip Colbert showed. “We avoided a recession. We reoriented the economy to the private sector. It's going to go up, because [Trump's] plan is to unleash this sort of animal spirit.”

“He's what? He's going to unleash the animal spirit?” Colbert joked. “That's not the advice you get from your financial guy. That's what the shaman says as he's pouring the ayahuasca down your throat.”

The term “animal spirit” is a fairly common one among Wall Street experts. It was first coined in 1936, and is often used to describe how herd mentality can affect market trends. For Colbert, however, it didn't seem to be a convincing argument in Trump's favor.

“Trump's twitchy tariff hand is bumming out everybody on Wall Street,” Colbert noted. He quoted a TIME magazine article reporting that Wall Street investors are “exhausted” by Trump's behavior.

“Do you know how hard it is to exhaust Wall Street?” said Colbert. “They wake up every morning to a hot cup of cocaine, and then, just to take the edge off, more cocaine.”

Nadya Suleman is reflecting on the controversial actions she made days after welcoming eight babies.

In the Monday, March 10, episode of Lifetime's Confessions of Octomom, Suleman, 49, looked back on her decision to sit down with NBC News journalist Ann Curry for her first sit-down interview.

“[The hospital] let me pick what interviewer so I opted [for] a news anchor and I didn't know who she was. I never watched anything she did,” Suleman said. “So I picked Ann Curry. She was one of the only women. I thought I'd feel comfortable talking to a woman.”

When sitting down with Curry, 68, for an interview that would air on Today and Dateline in 2009, Suleman said she was stressed for a variety of reasons including the way she looked.



“I felt horrible about myself,” she said. “I gained 150 pounds during the whole pregnancy so at that point, I was still about 100 pounds heavier than normal. … I had no idea what she was going to ask me. I had never done an interview before.”

As recapped in Confessions of Octomom, Curry asked questions many Americans wanted answered at the time. At one point, the journalist asked Suleman to respond to people who thought she was being “irresponsible and selfish” for having so many children. (Before welcoming octuplets, Suleman was already a mom to six kids.)

“I was foggy in my head. I really wasn't lucid. I was also ripped open and I was on Vicodin for pain,” Suleman explained to Lifetime cameras. “Can you imagine being interrogated and interrogated while you have just given birth, all those hormones? You're very, very depressed. You're in a state of shock. I was not there.”

Suleman went on to claim she was in “survival mode” and not ready to take accountability for her actions.

“I felt under attack. I was under attack,” she said. “When a human is under attack psychologically, they're not in the frame of mind to be transparent or honest. They are going to protect themselves and I utilized every coping mechanism.”

According to Sulman, who went on to appear on the Today show again for another chat with Curry in 2011, the hospital where she gave birth wanted to set up an interview to “set the record straight” about her journey. But for the Orange County, California, resident, she simply wanted to go home and see her kids.

“It's a blur to me,” she said about the interview. “I just don't even remember. I just know I was in constant defense.”
