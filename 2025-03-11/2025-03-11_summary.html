In addition to Sheikh Hasina, some other properties have been seized, owned by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, and her daughters, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique. Bangladesh has requested the Government of India to immediately take appropriate measures, in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, to stop Hasina from making such "false, fabricated and incendiary statements" using social media and other communications while she is in India, the statement said. On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, after weeks of protests and clashes that killed over 600 people. Hasina, 77, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.

Displaced Palestinians lives in a school run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, west of Gaza City, Sunday, March 9, 2025. The Iran-backed rebels' secretive leader had warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn't let aid into Gaza. Hamas had said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators — without changes to its position. The Educational Bookshop is a hub of intellectual life in east Jerusalem that's popular among researchers, journalists and foreign diplomats. It said its forces eliminated a third militant who had fired at them during the operation and destroyed two vehicles loaded with weapons.</p>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.rt.com/russia/614053-ukraine-barbaric-attack-moscow/'>Kiev planned ‘barbaric attack' on Russian civilians to coincide with ceasefire talks</a></h2><b>Source:</b> rt.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-11 22:54:00 <p>
The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned what it described as a “barbaric” and “cowardly” attack by Kiev on multiple Russian regions, including Moscow, in the early hours of Tuesday, just ahead of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia. The assault, involving a record-large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some reportedly loaded with shrapnel to maximize casualties, resulted in three civilian deaths and multiple injuries in the Moscow Region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a total of 337 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight, including 91 near Moscow and 126 over Kursk Region. US President Donald Trump indicated on Tuesday that he would likely hold phone talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin soon, expressing hope that Moscow would agree to the proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine. Moscow has previously indicated that any temporary ceasefire deal is unacceptable, arguing it would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm, insisting on a permanent, legally binding solution that addresses the core causes of the conflict.</p>

The group, which seeks independence for Balochistan province bordering both Afghanistan and Iran, said the hostages included Pakistan Army members and other security officials travelling on leave. "The BLA further warns that if military intervention continues, all hostages will be executed." "Those who attack innocent passengers are enemies of the country," he said.

According to the Times, Oyer was also sent a January letter from Gibson's lawyer addressed to two senior justice department officials, James McHenry and Emil Bove, “arguing for [Gibson's] gun rights to be restored, saying that he had been tapped for a special appointment by the president and that he had made a number of big, successful movies”.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, center, speaks with European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, right, during a round table meeting at an EU Summit in Brussels, Thursday, March 6, 2025. Following talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was lifting its suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine, and Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. That's why it has supported Ukraine's right to self-defense and stands with Kyiv “for a just and lasting peace in line with the Charter,” she said, stressing that Russia must lose its “colonial war.” “This sensible club aimed at integration, which used to promote cooperation with Russia, has today definitively turned into a fossilized, aggressive Russophobia bloc, which has staked its energy, economic, social and financial wellbeing on a pointless confrontation with its eastern neighbor,” Vassily Nebenzia said. “Today, more than ever, it's clear that the EU is seriously losing in this confrontation,” he said.</p>

Romania's Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal by presidential hopeful Calin Georgescu against the Central Electoral Bureau's (BEC) decision to bar him from taking part in a new election in May, according to the Associated Press. The electoral body had dismissed his bid on Sunday, citing over 1,000 challenges. According to media reports, a crowd of supporters gathered outside the court in Bucharest, shouting “traitors” and “we are going nowhere.” They also chanted “Calin Georgescu is president” and “freedom,” with one woman holding a sign that read ‘Stop dictatorship.' Georgescu scored an unexpected win in November's presidential election first round, receiving 23% of the vote. The firm presumably tried to derail another candidate, but inadvertently boosted Georgescu instead.</p>

Eyewitness testimonies and video verified by CNN showed government loyalists carrying out field executions, with some speaking of “purifying” the country. On Thursday, Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported deadly clashes erupting between Syrian government forces and pro-Assad groups in the coastal Latakia province. In an interview with Reuters Monday, Sharaa said that “Syria is a state of law.” Meanwhile, some people appear to be seeking protection from Russia, with satellite imagery captured on March 10 and shared by Maxar Technologies showing throngs of people crowding an entrance to the Russian-run Khmeimim Air Base, less than 20 kilometers from central Latakia. “Addressing what's happening through security measures alone will not be enough, even if they are able to stop those attacks in the near future,” he said.</p>

Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Berlin, will reportedly join Lucas Sielaff, 25, from Bad Bibra in Saxony-Anhalt, who is reported to have returned to Germany on 6 March, after being arrested at the Mexican border on 18 February before being detained for almost two weeks. Both Germans were held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a prison in San Diego, California. Not only has there a crackdown on entries into the US, but the increase in cases has reportedly meant a bureaucratic backlog leading to delays in decisions on cases of those who have been detained. Lofving, who had been in constant contact with her friend, said: “[Brösche] says it was like a horror movie. Germany's foreign ministry confirmed it had worked together with its consulate general in LA to resolve the issue.</p>

As US President Donald Trump doubled his planned tariffs on Canadian metals, Ontario's prime minister-elect Mark Carney said that his government will ensure 'maximum impact in the US' and will keep the retaliatory tariffs in place until Americans show respect and commit to fair trade. He will replace Justin Trudeau at Canada's top office in the coming days. "My government will ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada, while supporting the workers impacted," he said. He said that the tariff increase would take effect on March 12. The US president also asked Canada to "immediately drop" their "anti-American farmer tariff" of "250% to 390%" on various US dairy products, adding that they have for long been considered outrageous.</p>

Leavitt further mentioned the tariffs imposed by India and Japan on different US products. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that tariffs against neighbouring countries Mexico and Canada could go higher in the future, Fox News reported. However, he also revealed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs significantly, allegedly because "somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done." In his remarks at the White House, Trump stated, "India charges us massive tariffs.

A failure to comply will result in further action, namely the targeting of Canadian car production using measures set to “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business,” Trump warned. Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada early in February, but delayed them for a month, until last Tuesday. Exemptions were granted to Canadian automakers and goods covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) until April. Starting in December 2024, Trump and his close circle repeatedly expressed support for the idea of taking over Canada. Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has vowed to fight and win the trade war with Washington, admitting however, that “this victory will not be easy.” Carney also rejected ceding sovereignty to the US, stating on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape, or form.”</p>

US President Donald Trump has announced that an American delegation will meet with their Russian counterparts “today or tomorrow” (March 11-12), Reuters reported on Tuesday. But neither US nor Russian officials have publicly confirmed the trip or its exact date so far. “We're going to meet with them [the Russians] later on today and tomorrow and hopefully we'll be able to [work] out a deal,” Trump continued. If we can get Russia to do it, that'll be great. Moscow has previously indicated that any temporary ceasefire deal is unacceptable, arguing it would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm.</p>

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would likely hold phone talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, expressing hope Moscow would agree to a proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine. Trump made the remarks to reporters shortly after Ukrainian and American delegations met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Kiev agreed to Washington's proposal for a ceasefire with Moscow. Shortly after Trump delivered his remarks, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that contacts between Moscow and Washington in the coming days could not be ruled out. Previously, top Russian officials have stated that a temporary truce is not a solution to the Ukrainian conflict, and that the root problems must be addressed instead. A pause in the hostilities will be only used by Kiev and its backers to rearm and get ready for a new round of fighting, Moscow has suggested.</p>

Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked with 337 drones, 91 of which were aimed at Moscow and the surrounding region. Fragments of a drone hit the ground, setting fire to cars shortly after 5am, Andrei Vorobyov wrote on his Telegram channel. Moscow's airports, for example, cannot move and it is easy to force their closure with simply the threat of a drone attack.</p>

LONDON (AP) — British police on Tuesday arrested the captain of a cargo ship on suspicion of manslaughter as they searched for answers about why it hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor was presumed dead in the collision, which sparked fears of significant environmental damage. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and a 1 kilometer (around a ½ mile) exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships. “Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with cleanup teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,” the company said in a statement. “This particular incident is troubling because it appears to involve persistent oil, which breaks up slowly in water,” he said.</p>

The former Democratic House member Katie Porter announced on Tuesday that she is entering California's 2026 gubernatorial contest, joining a crowded field of candidates that could be upended if former vice-president Kamala Harris joins the race. As governor, I won't ever back down when Trump hurts Californians – whether he's holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights or our communities, or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” Porter said. If Harris enters the race, “there are very few politicians who would want to take her on”, said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. Porter, a progressive favorite, created an online backlash after losing the 2024 Senate race, when she faulted “billionaires spending millions to rig this election”. She became known in Congress for her unsparing interrogations of business leaders and other committee witnesses, often using her whiteboard to break down complex figures while using plainspoken language to assail corporate greed.</p>

Sarah Celiz among tens of thousands feeling relief that ex-Philippines president will finally face the courts Sarah Celiz wept as she sat at home watching footage from Manila's main airport on her phone. Six months after Almon's killing, Dicklie, his 31-year-old younger brother, a father of seven, was also killed. Duterte and his supporters have argued that allegations of wrongdoing should be dealt with by the Philippine justice system. Yet in the years that have passed since Celiz's sons were killed, there has never been any investigation.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Top military officials from across Europe and beyond joined talks in Paris on Tuesday on the possible contours of an international security force for Ukraine — an idea that France and Britain are pushing to deter any future Russian aggression on its neighbor if Moscow and Kyiv agree to stop fighting. Western and Ukrainian officials said there is no definitive plan for military options yet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the proposal but expressed skepticism, telling The AP in an interview in February that foreign troops alone would not be a sufficient guarantee of security for his country, and that such a plan should be backed up by weapons from the U.S. and Europe, and support for Kyiv to develop its own defense industry. Allied navies could also play a role in the Black Sea clearing mines and patrolling to keep international waters safe. “If they lose this opportunity, we will be in a very difficult situation,” he added.</p>

Amid aggressive interest from US president Trump and growing calls for independence ahead of polls, outcome will have far-reaching repercussions But amid aggressive interest from the US president, Donald Trump, and growing calls at home for independence from Greenland's former colonial ruler Denmark, which retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, the election outcome will have wide-reaching repercussions from Copenhagen to Washington DC and beyond. Before that, IA was in coalition with Naleraq, which brings us on to another of the key players. As the world order realigns to a second Trump term and as the Arctic becomes an increasing battleground between global superpowers, Greenland's geographical positioning and wealth of raw materials are making it increasingly important. Since Trump's recent advances, Greenlandic politicians say that Copenhagen has been dramatically more willing to appease Nuuk.</p>

GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Caribbean leaders are pushing back against a new U.S. policy that aims to crack down on Cuban medical missions, saying that the work of hundreds of Cuban medical staff across the region is essential. “Their presence here is of importance to our health care system,” Kamina Johnson Smith, Jamaica's foreign minister, said at a press briefing last week, noting the island has more than 400 Cuban doctors, nurses, biomedical engineers and technicians. He said Cuban doctors are providing critical care to patients including 60 who receive dialysis treatment. Meanwhile, Trinidad Prime Minister Keith Rowley told reporters Monday that he wouldn't mind losing his U.S. visa either. “I just came back from California, and if I never go back there again in my life, I will ensure that the sovereignty of Trinidad and Tobago is known to its people and respected by all,” he said at a recent public event where the crowd clapped, according to the Daily Express, a local newspaper.</p>

Kiev has agreed to work on a critical resources deal with the US and pledged to sign it “as soon as possible.” “The goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January.</p>

President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while being threatened, telling President Donald Trump to "do whatever the hell you want", Iranian state media reported on Tuesday. "It is unacceptable for us that they (the U.S.) give orders and make threats. Do whatever the hell you want", state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying. While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Donald Trump has reinstated the "maximum pressure" campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports down towards zero.

Myanmar, also known as Burma, is embroiled in a civil war where the country's military rulers are fighting pro-democracy and other forces. Chinese-backed mining and construction projects are also a major source of revenue for Myanmar's military government. Australia's Foreign Ministry directed questions to the U.N., noting that Bishop is not a government employee. The Australian National University stressed that Bishop's role as chancellor was part-time and non-executive. ETM is currently involved in a lawsuit against Greenland and Denmark, seeking billions in compensation over Greenland's ban on uranium mining that came after the company had already started developing a project there.</p>

The plans for a European returns system published on Tuesday came after EU leaders demanded “innovative solutions” to deal with undocumented migrants, in response to gains made by the far-right in last year's European elections. The commission said it was proposing “effective and modern procedures” that would increase returns of people denied asylum or who had overstayed their visa. Unaccompanied minors and families with children would also be excluded from such arrangements. “While it's unclear exactly what form the EU's proposed return hubs would take, we do know that its existing migration deals with non-EU countries have resulted in thousands of refugees and other migrants being exposed to violence, abuse, exploitation and death,” said Marta Welander, the EU advocacy director at IRC. Brunner said: “Whether we find the third countries as well, that is a question of agreements and negotiations.”</p>

There's also lingering concern that it risks permanently eliminating evidence needed for ongoing Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests and future oversight investigations. Democratic members of the Senate foreign relations committee sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in February demanding answers about Doge's access to USAid headquarters and agency records, though they did not specifically address potential document destruction.

After 24 terrifying hours, a friend helped Samir Haydar, his wife and two sons escape — just in time. Among the attackers, witnesses say, were hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters, who came from nearby provinces. It was one of several mass killings under then-President Assad, whose attempts to crush protests helped foment an armed insurgency. Some Sunnis blame the entire community for Assad's brutal crackdowns, though Alawites say they also suffered under his rule. Many were waiting for the chance to let it out,” Haydar said from his hiding place after fleeing home.</p>

Sometime later it was bought by Baron de Dozsa and taken to his Tudor manor house in eastern England, according to Christopher Marinello, a lawyer who specializes in recovering stolen and looted artworks. Marinello said Tuesday that de Dozsa has declined to give up the painting, despite telling him “she never really liked it.” De Dozsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Marinello said the painting's rediscovery began when Barbara de Dozsa tried to sell it through an auction house in England a few years ago, and it was recognized as a stolen artwork. Paintings by Solario, who worked across Italy in the early 16th century, have sold at auction for several hundred thousand dollars.</p>

The automaker's share has slid by 50% - representing more than $800 billion in market value - since its December peak. Unless and until we see what replaces it, investors will be cautious, at best,” he predicted. However, he official expressed confidence that in the end, “it should be great for us.”</p>

Putin may well stick to previous demands over Ukrainian elections and a rejection of European peacekeeping forces Russia has also been pushing for a ceasefire, though the Kremlin had wanted that to be followed by elections in Ukraine, before any full negotiation about territory and Kyiv's future security. Until Tuesday's discussions between US and Ukrainian delegations bore fruit, the battlefield dynamics did not appear to favour a ceasefire. Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked with 337 drones, 91 of which were aimed at Moscow and the surrounding region. Fragments of a drone hit the ground, setting fire to cars shortly after 5am, Andrei Vorobyov wrote on his Telegram channel.</p>

In recent years, Volkswagen's financial woes may have become emblematic of Germany's economic downturn. “More than 8 million Volkswagen original currywursts marks a new sales record for us,” VW's chief human resources officer, Gunnar Kilian, said on social media this week. VW, long one of the most iconic brands in an economy that for decades was Europe's powerhouse but which has contracted for the past two years, has had little else to celebrate this week. But VW also acknowledged that challenges remained “arising from an environment characterised by political uncertainty, increasing trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions”.

Israel said on Tuesday that it had agreed to release five Lebanese citizens detained during its war with Hezbollah as a goodwill gesture to the neighbouring country's new president. "In coordination with the United States and as a gesture to Lebanon's new president, Israel has agreed to release five Lebanese detainees," a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. On Saturday, the military targeted a Hezbollah operative with an air strike in southern Lebanon. Lebanese media reported one killed and another wounded in what it said was an Israeli drone strike on a car.

At the same time, Ukraine has significantly ramped up its domestic weapon production since 2022, a direct response to Russia's all-out invasion in February of that year. After Smetanin's interview with Euronews, Ukraine opened private companies' access to defence technologies that are owned by the state. Three years into the full-scale invasion, Ukraine "now already has its own home made missiles," according to him. Also a new long-range version of Ukraine's domestically produced Neptune cruise missile is expected to become operational in the near future. But when it comes to protecting itself against Russia's most powerful ballistic missiles, Ukraine only has the US-made Patriot defence systems.</p>

A previous version of this article incorrectly said that the United States has allocated more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine since 2022. As Ukrainian and American leaders navigate this rift in relations, here's a closer look at the aid that Ukraine is hoping to get back. “And without strategic and tactical intelligence, we are looking at the Ukrainians having close to two months left before Ukrainian lines begin to buckle at one of the many fronts they are fighting,” he said. “They have done an excellent job marshaling their limited resources, but without U.S. intelligence and aid, it is an impossible task,” said Melinda Haring, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a senior adviser at Razom for Ukraine. Kiel estimates the total amount of U.S. aid allocated to Ukraine at more than $120 billion.</p>

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has slashed two programs that provided more than $1bn for schools and food banks to purchase food from local farms and ranchers. About $660m of those funds were contained in the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided funds to schools and child care facilities but is now being eliminated. The USDA unfroze funds for existing agreements, but a second round of funding in fiscal year 2025 has been nixed. “These proposals would cause millions of children to lose access to free school meals at a time when working families are struggling with rising food costs,” said a statement from Shannon Gleave, the president of the School Nutrition Association. The Massachusetts governor, Maura Healey, criticized the Trump White House for cutting programs which would have provided $12m in food-related funding for schools and food banks in her state.</p>

Maradona was found dead at his home near the Argentinian capital on 25 November 2020 having suffered a heart attack while he recovered from surgery he had undergone earlier that month to treat bleeding around the brain. Thousands flocked to the Casa Rosada presidential palace to attend the wake of a player who was famed for his sporting genius and a 1986 “hand of God” goal against England but spent decades battling cocaine and alcohol addiction. They claim those medics pushed for Maradona to receive home care, a decision that proved “reckless” and “totally deficient”. Mario Baudry, a lawyer for Maradona's ex-wife, Verónica Ojeda, said of Luque and Cosachov: “The main responsibility is theirs.” “All society needs to know … what really happened, who abandoned him … and whoever is responsible must pay the price,” Hilda Pereira, a pensioner, said.</p>

Over the past 24 hours, Russian troops have recaptured more than 100 square kilometers of land, the ministry said in its daily briefing on Tuesday. It remains unclear whether Kiev's troops will try to make a stand in Sudzha or retreat altogether. Now, the remnants of the Ukrainian force are dependent on a single major cross-border road, which has been coming under constant drone and artillery strikes. The Ukrainian zone of control, however, has gradually been shrinking ever since, with the invasion force now having lost more than two-thirds of its initial gains. Nearly 400 Ukrainian tanks, more than 300 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), 272 armored personnel carriers (APCs), and over 2,000 other armored vehicles were destroyed or captured in the hostilities in the area.</p>

The stopgap bill, revealed by House Republican leadership over the weekend, would fund the government through September and carves $13bn from non-defense spending while adding $6bn to military budgets and preserving a $20bn IRS funding freeze – priorities embraced by Donald Trump but denounced by Democrats as an assault on vulnerable Americans. The bill's priorities align closely with Trump's agenda, particularly its provisions that could grant the administration broader authority to redirect funds between programs – a power Democrats fear could allow significant reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval. That's a hard sell for the Democrats, who are facing intense pressure from within their party and constituency to resist Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk's unilateral cuts to federal agencies, which have eliminated more than 100,000 jobs. And unlike their House counterparts, Senate Democrats appear divided on the measure. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon also said he was reluctant to vote against it, saying: “Shutdowns are a bad idea.</p>

The detectorists Reg Mead and Richard Miles had immediately reported their discovery to Jersey Heritage.

In the geophysical survey, the team found linear anomalies spanning several tens of metres, parallel and perpendicular to each other, some with subdivisions that resemble late iron age rural Celtic settlements in northern France. This first century BC seacraft was equipped with a sail, steering oar pivoted near the stern and, crucially, nine oars on each side, which would have been invaluable to overcome unfavourable wind and steer clear of reefs.

“And as the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday, he is not going to tolerate that.” Khalil, a permanent US resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at the university last year, was detained on Saturday night in an unprecedented move that prompted widespread outrage and alarm from free speech advocates. On Tuesday, 13 members of Congress – led by the Palestinian-American US representative Rashida Tlaib – issued a letter demanding his immediate release. The letters stem from an executive order signed by Trump shortly after retaking office in January that purported to “combat antisemitism”. In a statement on Monday, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, said her department was “deeply disappointed that Jewish students studying on elite US campuses continue to fear for their safety amid the relentless antisemitic eruptions that have severely disrupted campus life for more than a year”.</p>

Senior US and Ukrainian officials have arrived in Saudi Arabia for high-stakes meetings aimed at repairing a severely damaged relationship that has left Kyiv without Washington's support. Zelenskyy has also flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the eve of separate, high-stakes meetings between Ukrainian and US officials. Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's position in Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia with US officials will be “fully constructive” and that he hopes for practical outcomes from the negotiations on ending the war. The US opposes language that could harm its efforts to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Rubio said on Monday, as Washington wrangled with G7 allies ahead of a meeting this week, further alarming them. A Democratic US senator who visited Ukraine recently said the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence-sharing had lessened Kyiv's defences against Russia, and dismissed Trump adviser Elon Musk calling him a “traitor.” “One hundred percent,” Senator Mark Kelly told reporters when asked if he had heard during his visit of specific attacks or incidents that would have been affected if Ukrainians had had the intelligence.</p>

New York fired more than 2,000 prison guards on Monday for failing to return to work after an illegal work stoppage – carried out amid fallout over the high-profile deaths of two detained people as well as reports of violence by guards. “After 22 days of an illegal strike, the governor and I are happy to report it is now ended,” the New York corrections department commissioner, Daniel Martuscello, said during a virtual press briefing. Guards upset over working conditions began illegally walking off the job on 17 February at many state prisons, forcing New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to send national guard troops in to maintain operations. Authorities have declined to provide details, but a court filing by the attorney general's office said there was “probable cause to believe” that as many as nine correctional officers either caused or could be implicated in his death. It is the second criminal investigation into a state prison inmate death in recent months.</p>

A new bill that would change an old licencing law has faced opposition from the left over concerns about alcohol consumption. Many rural communities now lack any form of local business, with cafés once serving as hubs for social interaction and community life. Supporters argue that the change could revive struggling rural communities, making it easier for entrepreneurs to open businesses and encourage social connections in isolated areas. The proposal has faced resistance from left-wing party La France Insoumise, which argues that it could encourage alcoholism.</p>

Organised criminal groups have long used west African countries as a staging post for cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. The revelations about Leijdekkers come at an awkward moment for the authorities in Sierra Leone, which earlier this year recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle. Dutch officials are still in discussions to extradite Leijdekkers, even though Sierra Leone does not have a formal extradition treaty with the Netherlands. Sources in Freetown told the Guardian that Sierra Leone's government wanted to swap Leijdekkers for the Netherlands-based influential social commentator Abdul Will Kamara,  AKA Adebayor, whose videos and long WhatsApp voice notes are popular among older people and those in rural areas. In February, the information minister, Chernor Bah, said two attempts to extradite Adebayor had been unsuccessful.</p>

Lutnick announced that he and Ford have agreed to meet in Washington on Thursday ahead of Trump's 2 April deadline for reciprocal tariffs. As President Trump escalated his trade war with Canada and US stocks rode a rollercoaster, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt painted an upbeat picture earlier today.

White House walks back doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs as Ontario relents on electricity levy after tit-for-tat day Asking rhetorically why the US received electricity from another country, he accused Canada of using energy, “that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat” and said “they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”. Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem. The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”.</p>

Trump's latest salvo, which whipsawed financial markets and rekindled fears of inflation, followed Ontario Premier Doug Ford's announcement that he would place a 25% surcharge on the electricity Canada's most populous province supplies to more than 1 million U.S. homes unless Trump dropped all of his tariff threats against Canada's exports into the U.S. Trump later met with about 100 chief executives of U.S. firms amid evidence that his trade policies could hurt the U.S. economy, threatening to dash a "soft landing" that until recently appeared as the base case and reignite inflation. "This is what a trade war looks like," said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. Trump's promise to double the metals levies on Canada sent some aluminum prices soaring.

(credit: ALEH)“Dressing up, pretending to be part of the flight crew, and engaging in activities that simulate travel are all incredible ways to enhance their motor skills, cognitive engagement, and social participation – all while having a great time.”Beyond providing an exciting experience for the kids, the event included a strong therapeutic aspect, allowing the children to experience movement, coordination, and social interaction in ways that supported both their physical and emotional development.

In a video posted on Facebook, Szijjarto stressed that the Druzhba pipeline is a critical component of Hungary's energy infrastructure, pointing out that if it ceases to function, oil deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia would be “physically impossible.” “We consider these attacks against our energy infrastructure targeting Hungary to be unacceptable,” the foreign minister said. “Hungary's energy supply is a matter of sovereignty and we expect everyone to respect this,” he added. According to media reports, three Ukrainian fixed-wing drones attacked the Druzhba terminal in Bryansk Region on Tuesday night. The attack was part of a larger raid on Russia, which reportedly involved more than 340 UAVs, nearly a hundred of which were brought down near Moscow.</p>

He had previously said the line of spiritual leaders might end with him. Beijing said in February it hoped the Dalai Lama would “return to the right path” and that it was open to discussing his future if he met such conditions as recognising that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China. That proposal has been rejected by the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in India. In his book, the Dalai Lama says he has received numerous petitions for more than a decade from a wide spectrum of Tibetan people, including senior monks and Tibetans living in Tibet and outside, “uniformly asking me to ensure that the Dalai Lama lineage be continued”. The book, which the Dalai Lama calls an account of his dealings with Chinese leaders over seven decades, is being published on Tuesday in the US by William Morrow and in Britain by HarperNonFiction, with HarperCollins publications to follow in India and other countries.</p>

The pursuit and arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant proves that the Hague-based court is a “weapon of Western influence,” Duane Dizon, a geopolitical and regional economy expert has told RT. Duterte is accused of crimes against humanity linked to a ‘war on drugs' during his presidency. Speaking to RT Dizon said that the ICC's actions were “more about asserting clout than accountability.” The court launched a preliminary probe into Duterte's anti-drug campaign in 2018. Established to prosecute grave crimes, the ICC has faced persistent criticism for its disproportionate focus on developing nations, particularly, on Africa, with many accusing it of neo-colonialism and selective justice, serving Western interests rather than impartial law.</p>

Recent US decisions on Ukraine should not be viewed through “rose-colored glasses,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, cautioning against excessive optimism about a change in the conflict. His statement comes after US President Donald Trump paused military aid and intelligence sharing with Kiev. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Peskov stated that “there is no need to rush to put on rose-colored glasses now,” and that one should always “hope for the best and prepare for the worst.” Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude and “gambling with World War III” by refusing to seek peace. On Monday, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Zelensky had sent a letter to Trump apologizing for the incident.</p>

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in a video on social media that commercial grocers must limit their markup to no more than 10% of wholesale price on 30 different food items, a policy that would be in effect from mid-March until the end of May, but could be extended. The data came as an “unpleasant inflation surprise” for Hungary, which “indicates increasing price pressure in the Hungarian economy with regard to more permanent inflationary trends,” Orsolya Nyeste, a macroeconomic analyst with Erste Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The populist government has pointed to external factors such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia to explain the yearslong inflation spiral, though prices in other regional countries like Poland, Romania and Slovakia haven't risen nearly as steeply. But some critics and economists argued that sellers simply raised prices on other products to make up for shortfalls caused by the price controls. Compounding Hungary's difficulties, the EU has withheld billions in funding from Budapest because of concerns over judicial independence and rule-of-law standards.</p>

India, the world's most populous country, with more than 1.4 billion people, had a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentration last year, but air pollution remains a “significant health burden” that reduces life expectancy there by an estimated 5.2 years, the report said. PM2.5 refers to tiny particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less that can go deep into lungs and even enter the bloodstream. A senior Chinese environmental official said last month that China aimed to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of this year. In comparison, North America has a “robust” air quality monitoring infrastructure that accounts for 56% of ground-based stations. Peter Guo is a fellow on NBC's Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.</p>

Members of the US administration have suggested repeatedly that Zelenskyy should hold elections or step down. Russia has celebrated the loss of support from Ukraine's largest, and previously steadfast, backer. While most European governments ended working ties with Vladimir Putin after the full-scale 2022 invasion, which they say is a war of aggression, Trump has been more willing to build a rapport with the Russian leader. On Tuesday, Putin's spokesperson said the signals from Washington were causing many in Moscow to rejoice, but added there should not be premature celebration. “You always need to hope for the best but still be prepared for the worst, and we should always be ready to defend our interests,” Dmitry Peskov said at a conference, in comments reported by Russia's Kommersant newspaper.</p>

Moscow should employ its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system in response to a major Ukrainian drone attack targeting residential areas and civilian infrastructure inside Russia, a top MP has stated. A total of 337 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down above Russian territory overnight, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday morning. “But I think it would be appropriate [to launch the Oreshnik], and it would be even better if it is more than one missile,” added the MP, who is a former deputy defense minister and holds the rank of colonel-general. Putin said that the Oreshnik's multiple warheads travel at ten times the speed of sound and cannot be intercepted by any existing air defense. In a separate interview with RIA Novosti, Kartapolov insisted that the Ukrainian drone raid was a PR stunt by Kiev that “did not pursue any military goals.”</p>

Nearly seventeen years ago - on May 28, 2008, to be exact - Nepal abolished a 239-year-old Hindu monarchy, with Gyanendra Shah as king, and brought the curtain down on a decade-long civil war that had killed over 16,000 people. International Monetary Fund data shows economic growth has declined over the past few years. Those welcoming Shah at the airport on Sunday said they were hoping for a change to stop their country from further deteriorating. Kulraj Shrestha, a 30-year-old carpenter who protested to remove Shah, has changed his mind and now supports the monarchy. And elections, that true test of a democracy, were to be held shortly after.</p>

Before Trump's announcement, there had been a mixed session in Asia-Pacific markets where Japan's Nikkei fell by 0.6% and the South Korean market lost 1.3%, while Chinese exchanges closed moderately higher, up between 0.3% and 0.4%. Writing on Truth Social, Trump accused “Radical Left Lunatics” of “trying to illegally and collusively boycott” the business after Tesla shares tumbled by 15% on Monday, their biggest daily decline since 2020. “Assuming that any tariff impact will not be material, how high can the euro go?”</p>

Highly toxic jet fuel leaking from oil tanker threatens local ecosystems as investigations begin into collision's cause As investigations stepped up, Downing Street said no evidence of foul play had been found. The ships collided close near a known breeding ground for harbour porpoises as well as a number of other marine and wildlife protected areas, which could now be under threat from any contaminants leaking from the wrecks, environmental NGOs warned. The whole incident from impact to evacuation lasted about 30 minutes, they said. “This is particularly relevant for container vessels where high workloads and fatigue can be major contributing factors.</p>

The US-Ukraine peace talks follow last month's White House talks when US President Donald Trump and Zelensky clashed, and took bilateral relations to an all time low. Trump raised his voice at Zelensky and said that he should be more grateful for the US aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia. Meanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance also berated Zelensky and called him “disrespectful”. Ukraine launched its biggest drone attack on Russia overnight , deploying 91 drones, killing one, closing airports and causing diversions of dozens of flights. Trump's deal will be discussed in the meeting, as the key to US support and military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine 3 years ago.</p>

But as France's debate over military spending intensifies, political divisions mean the chances of finding consensus are increasingly slim. “I think that in the current situation, France can hardly afford to increase its public debt,” Sylvain Bersinger, chief economist at consulting firm Asteres, told Euronews. While most MPs in France's lower house of parliament have expressed their support for Ukraine specifically, political divisions remain. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said he was against any measures that would place the burden on French citizens. LFI MP Alma Dufour, meanwhile, has raised concerns that increased military spending will ultimately benefit the US defence industry.</p>

The group also stated that hundreds of passengers were being held captive. “There are reports of intense firing at a Jaffar Express [train] going from Quetta to Peshawar," Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind told local media outlet Dawn. The region has seen repeated attacks on security forces, infrastructure, and civilians in recent years. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation's government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.</p>

Clifford, 26, will never be released from prison after being sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court for the murders, which were committed last July. Clifford allegedly began plotting to attack Louise two days after she had ended their 18-month relationship because he was “enraged” by the rejection. Alex Klein said of the triple killer: “You are a weak and insecure little boy who compulsively lied”, adding that his “soul will suffer for eternity”.

Governor Andrey Vorobyov detailed casualties across three municipalities, with the most devastating incident occurring in Domodedovo. The attack came just hours before high-level discussions between US and Ukrainian officials are set to start in Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian forces have been launching kamikaze drones at high-value Russian sites, including oil refineries and gas pipelines, such as a key Black Sea fuel supply route to Türkiye. Andrey Kartapolov, a general-turned-MP who chairs the State Duma Defense Committee, suggested deploying Oreshnik medium-range missiles in retaliation. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has suggested that the raid could serve as proof of Ukraine's “terrorist nature” for Feridun Sinirlioglu, Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who is visiting Moscow this week.</p>

Duterte has been investigated by the ICC over his brutal anti-drugs crackdown during his time in office that killed more than 6,000 people based on police data, though independent monitors believe the number of extrajudicial killings could be much higher. Duterte's detention “is a critical step for accountability in the Philippines,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Before becoming president, Duterte laid the groundwork for his bloody war on drugs that pitted police armed with impunity against drug users, small-time dealers and kingpins. But along with this reputation came allegations that he was connected to extrajudicial killings by a well coordinated group of vigilantes.

Donald Trump's trade war kicks into a higher gear at midnight, as 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum are scheduled to begin. When my husband attempted to give me his phone so I could speak with our lawyer, the officers got increasingly aggressive, despite Mahmoud being fully cooperative. After Trump decided not to drive in front of the assembled cameras, he got out, cracking: “You think Biden could get into that car?” One Republican senator, Rand Paul, has come out strongly against the bill, writing: “Count me as a hell no!” on X. The news was echoed by a report from Fox that employees could receive “reduction in force” notices ahead of sweeping layoffs.</p>

Russian air defenses shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions overnight, military officials said Tuesday, in what appeared to be the biggest Ukrainian drone attack on Russia in the three-year war. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the attack. Another person was wounded on a highway in the Lipetsk region, Gov. He said it may, in fact, make more sense to take some time to negotiate the precise details of the agreement, which is now a broad memorandum of understanding that leaves out many specifics.

In deploying Ugandan soldiers to Juba, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni moved as a guarantor of the peace process that keeps Kiir and Machar together in a delicate government of national unity, Kulayigye told The Associated Press Tuesday. The deployment of Ugandan troops to South Sudan underscores rising tensions in the oil-producing country that has been plagued by political instability and violence since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. Deputy army chief Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, who is seen as loyal to Machar, was among those detained. Kiir had angered Machar's group earlier in the year by firing officials seen as loyal to Machar, who has charged that “persistent violations through unilateral decisions and decrees threaten the very existence” of their peace pact. Kiir urged calm after last week's helicopter incident, saying in a statement that his government “will handle this crisis and we will remain steadfast in the path of peace.”</p>

Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack on Russia to specifically coincide with a visit to Moscow by the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said. A total of 337 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down above Russian territory overnight, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday morning. According to an earlier statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will be holding a meeting with Sinirlioglu in Moscow on Tuesday. Zakharova said on Monday that the OSCE continues to be in the “deepest existential and institutional crisis,” but expressed hope that there will be “a constructive, comprehensive exchange of opinions” between Lavrov and Sinirlioglu. Earlier this month, former Greek ambassador to Ukraine Vasilios Bornovas claimed that OSCE observers who had been working in Donbass between 2014 and 2022 secretly shared intelligence with Kiev.</p>

Now, the potential future German chancellor has demonstrated his extraordinary clumsiness in foreign policy matters with particular emphasis. There has never been a more blatant 360-degree turnaround — to quote the still-serving German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock — regarding campaign promises in Germany. This led him to be persuaded by his potential coalition partner into a debt orgy that will massively damage the country and for which he received nothing in return, especially regarding migration policy. Friedrich Merz knows that he would not get a majority for this in the newly elected parliament. From an economic perspective, defence spending is government consumption, as tanks and other acquisitions are not designed to produce anything in the future.</p>

At least one person was killed and three others were injured as Ukraine targeted Moscow in a "massive" overnight drone attack on Tuesday. Russia's Investigative Committee has reportedly opened a terrorism case in response to the massive drone attack. Russia's aviation watchdog said flights were suspended at all four of Moscow's airports to ensure air safety after the attacks. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions, both east of Moscow, were also closed. Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.</p>

The representative noted that Ms Wynn-Williams was fired eight years ago for "poor performance and toxic behaviour." An internal inquiry at the time ruled that Wynn-Williams' claims of harassment were "misleading and unfounded." They further implied that anti-Facebook campaigners have since paid Ms Wynn-Williams, portraying the book as a continuation of their goal.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has tracked abuses in Syria since 2011, documented at least 779 deaths between Thursday and Monday, executive director Fadel Abdul Ghany said. On Monday, Syrian state media reported that military police arrested two fighters who were shown in a video clip “committing illegal and bloody violations against civilians in a coastal village.” It was unclear to which faction the fighters belonged.

Mr Musk, in an interview with Fox News, said, "We're not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area." The attack, which began early Monday, led to widespread outages across Asia, Europe, and North America. However, cybersecurity experts caution that attributing an attack based on IP addresses alone is unreliable, as attackers can easily mask their locations. Since Mr Musk's $44 billion takeover of Twitter in 2022, the company has drastically reduced its workforce. Technical issues have become more frequent, and Musk's reinstatement of previously banned accounts - including those spreading conspiracy theories - has drawn criticism from advocacy groups.</p>

However, CEO Elon Musk remains unfazed, assuring investors that the company's long-term prospects remain strong. Despite his optimism, the decline in Tesla's market value has rattled investors, especially after recent pessimistic analyst projections. Furthermore, Spak no longer expects Tesla's annual sales to grow in 2025, instead forecasting a 5% decline. Ben Kallo, an analyst from Robert W. Baird & Co., also cut his delivery estimates for Tesla on March 6, citing demand concerns and production disruptions linked to the upcoming Model Y refresh. The company's Shanghai factory saw vehicle shipments nosedive by 49% in February to just 30,688 units, marking its weakest monthly performance since July 2022.</p>

Mark Hartl, a scientist at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University who studies the impact of chemical pollution on marine organisms, said that the environmental risks posed by jet fuel are likelier to be more immediate and localized than in a heavy crude oil spill. “If you've got huge plumes of this and birds flying through, they will be affected,” Hartl said.

Study co-lead Professor Tim Johnson, from Curtin University, said in a statement the discovery significantly challenged previous assumptions about our planet's ancient history. "Before our discovery, the oldest impact crater was 2.2 billion years old, so this is by far the oldest known crater ever found on Earth," Professor Johnson said. This would have been a major planetary event, resulting in a crater more than 100 km wide that would have sent debris flying across the globe. "Until now, the absence of any truly ancient craters means they are largely ignored by geologists. "This study provides a crucial piece of the puzzle of Earth's impact history and suggests there may be many other ancient craters that could be discovered over time."</p>

The Australian share market has plummeted, shedding more than $45bn after US markets tanked overnight on recession fears. “The market's reacting at the moment to a number of factors, but things like concerns of Trump's tariffs, that this could trigger an economic slowdown,” Steven Daghlian, a CommSec market analyst, said. On Sunday – and in the wake of weaker than expected US jobs and inflation data – Trump could not say if his protectionist policies could lead the US into a recession, sending shockwaves through global markets. China's retaliatory tariffs on select US imports are set to take effect by Monday. “Yes, we're down heavily, but this is after record highs just weeks ago,” Daghlian said.</p>

Musk's accusation comes after relations between the US and Ukraine have notably soured after a war of words erupted between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28 in the Oval Office. Elon Musk on Monday also re-posted a user's claims about Ukrainian groups funded by the USAID programme supposedly “blacklisting” senior Trump administration officials like vice president JD Vance and calling for prosecution against them.

About 540 Indians lured into a cyber crime network with fake job offers have been rescued from Thailand and other countries. These nationals were lured with fake job offers and sold to fake call centres involved in cyber fraud in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The Golden Triangle Region in Southeast Asia, where the international borders of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet, is a cyber crime hotspot where such fake call centres operate. The government said it keeps warning of such rackets that target Indians with fake job offers.

South Korea's Constitutional Court could soon rule on whether to dismiss or reinstate impeached conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol. That doesn't mean the political crisis caused by Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law is over. Here's what to expect about the court's likely impending verdict on Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law decree that is testing South Korea's democracy. “No matter what decision the Constitutional Court comes up with, South Koreans' division and extremely polarized politics can't help but to deepen,” Choi said.

Speaking to reporters aboard his plane before arriving, Rubio said he and national security adviser Mike Waltz would take stock of Ukraine's responses in Saudi Arabia. A pause on sharing U.S. intelligence that can be used for offensive purposes by Ukrainian forces remains in effect, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>

The decision stunned Ukrainian officials and alarmed U.S. allies in Europe who are desperately hoping for the talks to restore U.S.-Ukrainian relations as a wave of Russian attacks has continued to hit government and residential buildings across Ukraine. Ahead of Rubio's arrival in Jeddah, U.S. officials said they were pleased at the high-level delegation Zelensky chose to send. Rubio will be joined by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

“You don't have the cards right now,” Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in their White House blowup. Trump is “looking for quick wins — deals, I would argue — not anything remotely related to the incredibly difficult work” of conflict resolution. Hamas has dismissed Trump's threats and says dozens of remaining hostages will only be returned in exchange for an end to the war. Diana Buttu, a Palestinian analyst who advised peace negotiators in the 2000s, says Trump's strategy is unlikely to succeed. It helps if the warring parties are in what political scientists refer to as a mutually hurting stalemate.</p>

SAN JUAN ALOTENANGO, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemala's Volcano of Fire is erupting, and authorities have evacuated nearly 300 families while warning that another 30,000 people in the area could be at risk. Claudinne Ugalde, secretary of the disaster agency, said “some 30,000 people more or less are at risk in these three (jurisdictions) and we are trying to have them evacuate or self-evacuate,” she said. Isaac García, 43, a resident of El Porvenir on the slopes of the volcano, had that tragedy in mind when he and his family decided to heed authorities' warnings to evacuate early Monday. He came to a shelter opened in San Juan Alotenango with his mother, wife and their three children, as well as other relatives.

Kennedy has promised to address an epidemic of chronic illness with Donald Trump's backing, but his broad agenda from making food healthier to studying vaccines could clash with government spending cuts. Eliminating this pathway would make it mandatory for companies that want to introduce new ingredients in foods to publicly notify the FDA of their intended use and submit underlying safety data, HHS said. The FDA maintains a public inventory where all notices, supporting data and response letters are available for review. PepsiCo, General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Hershey, Mondelez and Kellanova did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. A few months ago the FDA had set in motion a restructuring of its food division to increase oversight of food supply and agricultural products under the former commissioner Robert Califf.</p>

Zelenskiy was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a day before talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials that Washington hopes will deliver substantial progress towards ending Russia's war with Ukraine. Assistance for the government in Kyiv, once something strongly supported by dozens of Trump's Republicans as well as Democrats, has become far more partisan since Trump began his second term on January 20. Underscoring the political divide, Musk called Kelly a "traitor" on X.com, a social media platform Musk owns, after Kelly posted that he had visited Ukraine during the weekend and accused Trump of trying to weaken Ukraine ahead of peace talks. Elon, if you don't understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do."

Last week, Trump agreed to postpone until early April tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that fall under the USCMA, a free trade deal he signed in 2019. Wednesday's closely watched report on inflation in February should bring modest relief, but the reprieve may be brief, with Trump's escalating trade war set to drive prices higher later this year. A core inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy items likely also rose 0.3%, economists predict, down from 0.4% the previous month. Now − nearly two months into a second Trump term − his administration is bracing Americans for economic turbulence as last year'scampaign rhetoric collides with the reality of an increasingly uncertain economy. Otherwise, a majority of federal employees will go without pay or be forced to stop working while most government services pause.</p>

"This was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of broader failures in our aviation safety system," the statement read. But it also makes me feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones," Homendy said. Unfortunately, one did, and so we are calling on action, but there clearly were indicators where safety trending could have occurred." Encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near Reagan show that, from 2011 through 2024, a vast majority of reported events occurred on approach to landing, Homendy said. Duffy also further discussed upgrades that he said will be made to runway safety and technology.</p>

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident. Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said. President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.</p>

In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. "Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check." While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out "fraud" from the benefit system.

"I'll let you know" whether 50% tariffs on Canada are going into effect, he said. "The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State," Trump wrote. Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second presidential term, putting the United States' closest ally on rockier footing. The strategy has not worked for Canadian officials, who have more aggressively retaliated with tariffs and public comments.</p>

The National Park Service manages 433 units, which are commonly referred to as parks. The data has been widely shared through social media accounts such as “National Park Diaries” on Instagram and Threads. Michigan is home to six national park units, which have not been spared from the nationwide reductions.

The United States will immediately lift a pause on intelligence sharing and resume providing security assistance to Ukraine after delegates from Kyiv agreed to accept the Trump administration's proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire with Russia. Trump, for his part, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy — not Vladimir Putin — a dictator. Asked whether Zelenskyy would be invited back to the White House, Trump responded: "Sure, absolutely." The announcement came hours after Russia said it had shot down more than 330 Ukrainian drones. The talks in Saudi Arabia were anchored by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Andriy Yermak, the chief of Zelenskyy's presidential office.</p>

For the junior national champion title, Kroll edged out 17-year-old Arthur Tirone from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, who finished second. Kroll was particularly surprised by his victory, as he and Tirone had identical combined jump scores for distance—132.5 meters. However, he remained humble about the victory, noting that many of his skiing friends who are “better than me were not there, but it still feels pretty good.” Kroll's next challenge may be balancing ski jumping with college or taking a gap year if he cannot incorporate the sport into his education.

In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.

At a congressional hearing in December, senior officials and lawmakers urged action. Last week, President Donald Trump told Congress that his Republican administration would “resurrect” the American shipbuilding industry, for commercial and military vessels, and he would create “a new office of shipbuilding in the White House.” In February, the heads of four major labor unions called on Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other “strong penalties” against China for its increasing dominance in that sector. They found that CSSC, which builds both commercial and military ships, sells three-quarters of its commercial production to buyers outside China, including to the U.S.-allied Denmark, France, Greece, Japan and South Korea. These foreign firms are thus funneling billions of dollars to Chinese shipyards that also make warships, advancing China's modernization of its navy and providing Chinese defense contractors with key dual-use technology, the report said.</p>

This move is part of an escalating trade dispute between the two nations, with Trump vowing to impose retaliatory measures. Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was applying "maximum pressure" on the US over its tariff war, and threatened to cut off exports entirely if Donald Trump increased tariffs further. President Trump has yet to offer more details on the electricity emergency, but the US Department of Energy (DOE) can issue emergency orders that would allow power plants to run at maximum capacity or waive some environmental regulations. US President Donald Trump announced doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminium from Canada to 50%. Soon, by Tuesday afternoon, Trump made a U-turn and called off the imposition of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, just hours after announcing the higher tariffs.</p>

Much of Ali's work prior to his confirmation to the bench focused closely on police and prosecutorial misconduct and civil rights protections, some of which made headlines during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. During his Senate confirmation hearing last February, Ali was grilled by Republicans over remarks made by his MacArthur Justice Center colleague, Cliff Johnson – who suggested during a podcast interview in 2020 that defunding the police is the first step in a "movement toward making police departments obsolete." Now, as a judge, Ali has been tasked with presiding over some of the most consequential cases to come up during Trump's second term. It is unclear whether the Trump administration will move to challenge that ruling in court. "I think it's reasonable to get the plaintiffs' invoices paid by 6 p.m. on Monday," Ali said.</p>

FILE PHOTO: Sahra Wagenknecht, leader of Germany's Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance party (BSW), attends a press conference after the German general election in Berlin, Germany February 24, 2025. The leftist populist BSW, which was created last year, scored 4.97% in last month's election, lacking just 13,400 votes to enter parliament in a country where around 60 million people are eligible to cast a ballot. "Several thousand BSW votes have apparently been incorrectly allocated to other parties or deemed invalid," the party's eponymous leader Sahra Wagenknecht was quoted as saying by paper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). Respect for the voters demanded that "possible errors be scrutinised and corrected", she was cited as saying. By clicking submit, you are agreeing to our Terms and Conditions & Privacy Policy.</p>

"Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent," Ali said. President Donald Trump attempted to freeze USAID payments after billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) flagged foreign aid spending as highly wasteful and fraudulent. Plaintiffs were also told to propose a schedule for next steps in this matter. Lawyers were also pressed over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress – something Ali referenced specifically in his ruling. "The provision and administration of foreign aid has been a joint enterprise between our two political branches," he said.</p>

But complicating that is what's expected to be “no” votes from a unified Democratic caucus and at least one Republican. Proposed cuts to DOGE were also left out, with Johnson saying they can be addressed in next year's spending talks. “This means a nearly $945 million cut for the District, impacting teachers, firefighters, and law enforcement,” it added. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has almost always opposed stopgap bills during his time in office, came out against the measure on Sunday.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is reportedly set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz led the U.S. delegation in Jeddah amid Trump's push to broker a swift end to the war that began in early 2022 with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Rubio told reporters late Tuesday that Ukraine has taken a concrete step toward ending the war. Trump has voiced interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. An agreement on the matter had been expected to be signed last month by Trump and Zelenskyy but was canceled after their tense Oval Office meeting Feb. 28.</p>

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has taken aim at CBS News over its "60 Minutes" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. They feel like those outlets are just trying to sheepdog people towards preferred political narratives, rather than playing it straight. Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' "word salad" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash. Bill Whitaker's "60 Minutes" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris is at the center of a high-stakes lawsuit. "The Complaint filed against CBS for ‘news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor—one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming," Paramount Global executives wrote.</p>

President Donald Trump selected a shiny red Tesla on the White House driveway as he showed support for Elon Musk's electric automaker. The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which is struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices. When asked by FOX Business Network's Larry Kudlow, Elon Musk has this response on how he was able to run his other businesses while overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency. During his first term, top adviser Kellyanne Conway urged people to show their support for Trump's daughter Ivanka by purchasing her retail products. During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk “how are you running your other businesses” while also advising Trump.</p>

He then suggested later in the day that those tariffs may not happen after Ontario's premier said it would suspend a surcharge on exports of electricity. And there is now bipartisan ire about subsidized Chinese steel undercutting world markets, leading many CEOs in the sector to actively cheer on Trump's most protectionist impulses. Still, the language from many of these pro-tariff executives is also very similar to Trump's own reasoning for his focus on steel and aluminum. Trump has described this week's action as a sort of unfinished business after he imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum in his first term but with exceptions that, in his view, allowed cheap Chinese products to continue undercutting the market by moving through third-party countries. Increased steel tariffs were also often advocated by then-President Biden, who talked about tripling them and told a Pittsburgh crowd in 2024 of China, "They're not competing.</p>

In a post on his own Truth Social network, the US President threatened to “permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada” if Canadian retaliatory tariffs are not dropped. Trump has offered Canada a simple way out: Join the US as its 51st state. The US president said: “This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.” Weeks into Trump's trade war – in which the US has most heavily targeted its Northern and Southern neighbours – rolling political shocks have dented global stocks and the US economy. They would have negative effects on spending, investment — and we see some signs of that.”</p>

US President Donald Trump  has said he will "buy a brand new Tesla" after shares in the electric car firm fell more than 15%. As part of the sell-off, shares in technology firms dropped, with Tesla stock sinking by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia, Facebook owner Meta, Amazon, and Google-parent Alphabet also fell sharply. Despite his comments, Trump policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales, including his revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations. "When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year," she said. Investors are "certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days", she added.</p>

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns. The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for "general search" and "general search text.” No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.</p>

One could argue that gain isn't so insignificant when stacking it up with other Mag 7 members — all of which are down for the year. Apple (AAPL) is off by 9% year to date, Microsoft (MSFT) 10%, Amazon (AMZN) 11%, Google (GOOG) 12%, Nvidia (NVDA) 20%, and Tesla (TSLA) a stunning 45%. "Meta is not impacted by tariffs and has no China exposure," Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. Tesla counts on China as an important sales outlet, while Amazon's third-party sellers source cheap goods from the country. Also helping sentiment on Meta is that it had a strong fourth quarter, unlike several of its Mag 7 rivals (see Tesla).</p>

While that's cheap for Amazon, it's not the cheapest on a relative basis to other "Magnificent Seven" stalwarts. That distinguished honor goes to fellow cloud competitor Microsoft (MSFT), whose stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.9 times. It remains to be seen if investors view Amazon's stock as cheap enough at current valuation levels given economic growth fears. But it's worth nothing the Street hasn't lost confidence in Amazon, at least not yet. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 have stayed fairly consistent since Amazon reported its latest results in early February.</p>

"What we underestimated was how the US's wavering support for NATO and Ukraine would trigger a watershed moment for the eurozone — with Germany expected to also follow through with sizeable fiscal stimulus," Pinder wrote. The German DAX touched a record high earlier this month as Europe's largest economy prepares to boost infrastructure and defense spending, while the Trump administration signals it will be less expansive in its military support of its European counterparts. "The regional change is additional to our style call since last summer that Growth style, US Tech, and Mag-7, are all unlikely to work this year," JPMorgan head of global and European equity strategy Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. However, JPMorgan's Matejka cautioned that "tactically, near term, a lot has repriced very quickly."

Small business owners were feeling uncertain about the future in February as they continued to deal with lingering inflation and labor challenges. Meanwhile, the NFIB's uncertainty index rose four points to 104, reaching a record high in February. Labor remains another top headache, with 38% of all small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill in February, marking the highest reading since August 2024.

Since those remarks were broadcast on Sunday, top Trump officials and advisers have sought to calm investor fears. "Trump is keeping political leaders guessing regarding his next moves on tariffs, but the problem is that he's also keeping investors guessing and that's reflected in the dire market mood," said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors were initially optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war. But Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to President Trump, has pushed back against those projecting this bleak outlook. Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent US resident, was arrested for his role in last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>

Southwest executives have long said they didn't plan to charge for bags, telling Wall Street analysts that it was a major reason why customers chose the airline. Southwest said its "rigorous research" found that "our 'bags fly free' policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from bag fees." Southwest CEO Bob Jordan had cited the company's long-standing bag policy in an earnings call last July. The airline also said Tuesday that it will launch a new, basic economy fare, something rivals have offered for years.

In recent weeks, economic forecasting teams from the likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and others have moved their 2025 GDP projections lower — Morgan Stanley now forecasts 1.5% growth in 2025, and Goldman sees 1.7%.

In recent weeks, however, "the economic and corporate earnings data have deteriorated," Dutta wrote.

In a bill filed on March 10, Texas Representative Ron Reynolds proposed the state's comptroller not be allowed to invest more than $250 million of its Economic Stabilization Fund — otherwise known as a “rainy day” fund — in Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The legislation also suggested that Texas municipalities or counties could not invest more than $10 million in crypto. If passed and signed by Governor Greg Abbott, the bill would take effect on Sept. 1. Cointelegraph reached out to Rep. Reynolds' office for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin's correction may be over, supported by derivatives markets, a weak dollar and contagion from the US budget crisis. Despite Bitcoin's 30% drop from its all-time high of $109,350, four key indicators suggest that the correction may be over. Similarly, the Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate is hovering near zero, signaling balanced leverage demand between longs and shorts. Several publicly traded companies with market values exceeding $150 billion have seen sharp declines from their all-time highs, including Tesla (-54%), Palantir (-40%), Nvidia (-34%), Blackstone (-32%), Broadcom (-29%), TSM (-26%), and ServiceNow (-25%). The key points of contention in House Speaker Mike Johnson's proposal are increased spending on defense and immigration.</p>

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is one step closer to relaunching its services in India after securing a license with the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). “It's a major step towards empowering Indian entrepreneurs to build, innovate and scale global onchain businesses — all from home.” Cointelegraph contacted Coinbase for more information about its India launch plans but did not receive an immediate response. Legal expert Amit Kumar Gupta told Cointelegraph that many lawmakers view the industry negatively, associating it with gambling and illegal activities.

Charles Cascarilla, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer Paxos, is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will urge lawmakers to establish “cross-jurisdictional reciprocity” in stablecoin regulations. “We fear that products like Paxos' Global Dollar (USDG) stablecoin, issued by a regulated affiliate in Singapore, will languish while departments and agencies make their determinations,” Cascarilla wrote in his speech. Cascarilla recommended US lawmakers strengthen the current “international reciprocity language” to include clearly defined, accelerated timelines for the US Treasury Department to designate overseas jurisdictions for stablecoin regulation. “This timeframe would force swift action and prevent bureaucratic delays while guaranteeing thorough scrutiny of foreign regulatory regimes,” the executive said. While Paxos' Cascarilla is now calling for the US to take urgent action in forcing a global framework for stablecoin issuers that are regulated outside of the US, some industry CEOs have urged all stablecoin firms to get regulated domestically instead.</p>

Hedge funds and professional trading desks, which once chased higher returns in low-liquidity altcoins, can deploy leverage through derivatives or take exposure via ETFs on legacy financial rails. Venture capital (VC) firms have historically been the lifeblood of alt seasons, injecting liquidity into nascent projects and spinning grand narratives around emerging tokens. Web3 and AI-driven crypto startups are still drawing attention, but the days of indiscriminate funding for every token with a white paper may be numbered. If venture capital pivots further toward structured exposure through ETFs rather than a direct investment in risky startups, the consequences could be severe for new altcoin projects. With institutions gravitating toward structured exposure and a lack of retail-driven speculative demand, liquidity is not trickling down to altcoins as it once did.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 14% during the past week to close around $80,708 after investors were disappointed with the lack of direct federal Bitcoin investments in President Donald Trump's March 7 executive order that outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. Other analysts have also warned that Bitcoin may experience a deeper retracement toward the “low $70,000's range,” which Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph could “provide a foundation for a more sustainable recovery.” “Then we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make their country great again,” added Hayes, referring to quantitative easing, a monetary policy where central banks increase the money supply by buying government bonds and other financial assets. Bitcoin's price rose over 1,050% during the last quantitative easing period, from just $6,000 in March 2020 to $69,000 by November 2021, after the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy was announced during the COVID-19 pandemic on March 23, 2020, buying over $4 trillion worth of assets such as treasuries.

After the announcement, Cardano's ecosystem saw renewed attention, with significant whale accumulation and increased trading volume across its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. With multiple networks now government-backed, crosschain DeFi protocols that facilitate liquidity between Ethereum, Solana and Cardano are seeing renewed interest. Building on these endorsed networks offers a more straightforward path to funding, but expectations around compliance and security will rise accordingly. Crosschain bridges like Wormhole, initially connecting Ethereum and Solana, will likely expand to include Cardano as the demand for connectivity between all endorsed networks grows.

The move aligns with a growing institutional push toward regulated crypto services in Europe following the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which went into full effect for crypto asset service providers on Dec. 30, 2024. The institutional offering came nearly two months after Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany's first crypto asset service provider to receive a full license under MiCA, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 17. Boerse Stuttgart's license was part of the firm's efforts to become a regulated infrastructure provider for banks, brokers and asset managers. While MiCA is widely viewed as a positive step for global crypto regulation, some industry experts worry about potential regulatory overreach that could impact retail investors and drive crypto firms out of Europe.

GOP Senator Bill Hagerty, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said on March 10 that he introduced an update of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which would go to a Banking Committee vote on March 13. The bill is co-sponsored by Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott, who is also chair of the Banking Committee chair, along with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. “The updated version of the GENIUS Act makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more,” Gillibrand said in a statement. Web3 learning app EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok said on X that the latest version of the GENIUS Act, shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, gives “US-issued stablecoins a competitive advantage.” The GENIUS Act still has a way to go before becoming law.</p>

An Ethereum developer rejected speculation that the Ethereum Foundation (EF) was behind a recent deposit of more than 30,000 Ether into the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO. On March 10, a wallet address deposited 30,098 Ether (ETH), worth about $56 million, into Sky. Wu Blockchain later clarified that while the account was suspected of belonging to the Ethereum Foundation, transaction history suggested it was more likely associated with an early Ethereum investor. The address received a 4 million Dai (DAI) transfer from the EF ETH Sale in May 2022, and initial ETH funding was traced back to a wallet called jonny.eth. Community members celebrated the move, with Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov saying, “DeFi will win.” The EF also said there's “more to come,” suggesting this is not their last foray into DeFi.</p>

However, with Bitcoin's price surge, those sold coins would now be worth over $18 billion — raising questions about whether the government should have held onto them. If multiple governments start stockpiling Bitcoin, it could integrate crypto more deeply into global finance, potentially affecting reserve diversification and even international sanctions. With the government holding Bitcoin, it may also incentivize policies that promote crypto growth, though balancing innovation and consumer protection remains a challenge. Some fear Trump's crypto agenda could slow down broader regulation by making the issue partisan.Legal and logistical hurdlesTransferring seized Bitcoin into a government reserve isn't simple.</p>

India's Web3 ecosystem, driven by Gen Z developers, saw rapid growth in 2024, with investments surging 224% despite stringent crypto tax policies. India's contribution to the global Web3 ecosystem — primarily in software development, gaming, investments and startup funding — increased year-on-year despite an absence of locally tailored crypto regulations. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Tak Lee, CEO and Managing Partner at Hashed Emergent, pointed out four key factors driving India to the top of global crypto adoption: retail crypto transactions on centralized services, highest trading volumes, institutional adoption and retail DeFi transactions. While funding opportunities and builder initiatives like hackathons support initial growth, Indian developers have pointed out employers' lack of willingness to pay salaries that match global industry standards. In contrast, investments into the Indian Web3 landscape saw a 224% increase in 2024 compared to the previous year — sourced from various avenues such as local funds, ecosystem funds and corporate venture arms of leading exchanges.</p>

A proposed rule change pushing for some crypto firms to register as exchanges could be abandoned under a new directive from the acting chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Uyeda says the rule was initially crafted in 2020 under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to establish more straightforward rules for alternative trading systems; the guidance was intended to mainly impact US Treasury market participants. Effectively, the vastly expanded definition of an exchange would have picked up various protocols used with respect to crypto assets,” he added. Gensler's time at the SEC came with an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto. After Genlers' resignation, the SEC has since taken a new friendlier approach toward crypto.</p>

Anthony Pompliano speculates US President Donald Trump may be taking matters into his own hands in an attempt to lower interest rates. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they're crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin (BTC) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. While Trump hasn't confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can't borrow money.” However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America's top bank to start cutting again.</p>

Scientists in China have created a satellite with laser-imaging technology powerful enough to capture human facial details from more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) away. SAL relies on the motion of an object (like a satellite) to provide finer resolution images than other, beam-scanning radar imagery systems. Inclement weather or other impairments to visibility could significantly impact the system's precision and reliability.

Tech advocates suggest that once we have superintelligent computers, day-to-day life could fundamentally change, affecting work, governance and the pace of scientific discovery. Some argue that AGI functions as little more than a marketing term, offering no concrete guidance on how to best use AI models or their societal impact. Computer scientist José Hernández-Orallo of the Universitat Politécnica de València in Spain says that it's possible ARC-AGI just assesses a model's ability to recognize images. “I don't think it matters whether or not they're artificially generally intelligent,” he says.What might matter far more, based on the recent DeepSeek news, is traditional metrics of cost per task. If achieved, it's meant to herald a major turning point for society, beyond which machines will function independently on equal or higher footing than humans.</p>

Perovskite cells are much cheaper and more flexible than their silicon alternatives, but they have major durability problems. Notably, they degrade quickly due to chemical reactions with moisture in the air that make them leak iodine. As the fastest-growing and cheapest form of renewable energy, solar power is key to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This not only prevented the iodine from leaking but also created a more uniform and electrically conductive structure. "With these improvements, we're breaking new ground in stability and performance, bringing perovskite technology closer to becoming a mainstream energy solution."</p>

The Champions League might not get any better than this between now and Munich. It might equally be said that they have employed the best goalkeeper in the world for nearly seven years, precisely so that when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia rained fire on their goal, Liverpool did not buckle. The expected goals (xG) might paint a picture of Parisian dominance but when Ousmane Dembele taps into an empty net from three yards out, your xG is going to look a little inflated. Alisson might still have had to make some more outstanding saves -- the 17 that he ended this tie with is more than Arsenal's David Raya has made across the entire 2024-25 Champions League -- but they were off stunning strikes from range. Trent Alexander-Arnold's status must be in serious doubt after he was forced to limp off with what appeared an ankle injury.</p>

Former Chiefs safety Justin Reid reportedly came to terms on a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the New Orleans Saints. Like former teammate and 2021 draft classmate Fields, Jenkins is hoping to revive his career with a new team after things didn't necessarily pan out in Chicago.

A 2021 second-round pick, Myers also has four playoff starts under his belt while playing with Rodgers and current Packers starting quarterback Jordan Love.

Harvey Elliott has now entered for Szoboszlai but neither team will want to lose this with only 13 minutes between them and a shootout. No one wants extra time but with PSG having made fewer changes, they'll at least have more potential for fresh legs if we get there. This Liverpool match has been played at an absurd pace with 13 shots and four on target from both sides.

The Toronto Blue Jays failed to reach an extension with star first baseman and impending free agent Vladimir Guerrero ahead of his self-imposed deadline earlier this spring. Now, details are starting to surface on what, exactly, the Blue Jays offered and how much far apart that was from Guerrero's demands. We ranked Guerrero as the top available player, noting that his career numbers to date lined up shockingly well with Miguel Cabrera, the two-time Most Valuable Player Award recipient that he was often compared to during his prospect days. The Blue Jays had previously submitted an offer to Guerrero worth around $340 million, suggesting they had significantly upped their offer ahead of the deadline in an effort to get a deal done. Guerrero, 25, heads into the 2025 season a career .288/.363/.500 (137 OPS+) hitter with 160 home runs and 21.5 Wins Above Replacement.</p>

Pochettino otherwise would need to take his first look at Reyna in games where something isn't on the line, unlike players who he has seen like Brenden Aaronson and Alejandro Zendejas, both of whom, missed out.

Gardner-Johnson to the Houston Texans in a surprise trade for former first-round draft pick Kenyon Green. General manager Howie Roseman is known for squeezing value out of his frequent trades, but this one doesn't necessarily feel designed to come out like a clear victory for the Eagles; it's more of a "necessary evil," like the club letting Super Bowl starters Milton Williams and Josh Sweat cash in elsewhere via free agency. Gardner-Johnson is a tone-setting playmaker, but he's bounced between teams in part due to his outsized personality and volatile contract talks. The Eagles also have plenty of young defensive backs to help offset his departure, with Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell and Reed Blankenship all held in high regard. More than that, Philly needed another O-line investment with Becton headed for the open market, and Green comes cheap on a rookie deal, with first-round tools that revered assistant Jeff Stoutland should be able to mold.</p>

Only someone who smacks people around on ice while wearing knives strapped to their feet would think that the best move when entering a hockey fight would be to throw a damn Superman punch. Simon Benoit of the Maple Leafs got into with Michael Kesselring of Utah on Monday night and things went wild immediately. Rather than simply putting up his dukes, Benoit took to the sky to punch Kesselring in the head — which is a bold move in a sport where players are wearing helmets. It's tough to say if anyone really won this fight. Naturally punching someone in a hockey helmet is not a good idea, and Benoit learned this the hard way by dislocating his own thumb in the exchange.</p>

The Texas Rangers have already pulled their hat from shelves because of an unfortunate translation error. On Monday, New Era dropped their "Overlap" series, which features MLB team names behind the primary logo. This created clunky and awkward aesthetics for most teams, but the Rangers had a bigger issue. They just don't spell out vulgarities in other languages. We can only hope that 2026 will also bring some headwear hijinks courtesy of MLB.</p>

The Titans entered Monday with almost $60M in salary cap space, and still found a way to botch this process. Moore has been reviled by Steelers fans for years due to his terrible play and turnstile work at offensive tackle, yet the Titans seemingly missed this memo. That doesn't mean the Titans had to make this deal though, and they played themselves. At this point it's fair to question whether or not the Texans have a plan. We knew Dallas wasn't going to be a big player in free agency because of their ongoing cap issues, but God is this bad.</p>

Several of the conferences that expect multiple bids start their tournaments on Tuesday and there are some compelling story lines to watch. Also, most conference tournament games are played on neutral courts and wins away from home carry a little more weight with the committee. 3-5 seed lines with six teams that could possibly end up there, including Michigan, Wisconsin and last year's national runner-up Purdue.

Sixteen national coaches associations have written the NCAA Division I Board of Governors in support of the National Junior College Athletic Association's effort to change decades-long eligibility requirements for junior college athletes. There is also an emerging feeling that NJCAA schools could monetize and formalize their relationship as a "minor league" to Division I. In 2018, Power Five football schools averaged about two JUCO players per team (129), according to one report. Among those are Jackie Robinson, Albert Pujols, Bryce Harper as well a pair of Heisman winners, Roger Staubach and Cam Newton. Georgia's Stetson Bennett won a pair of championships after attending Jones College in Ellisville, Mississippi.</p>

In return for Gardner-Johnson and a 2026 sixth-round draft pick, the Texans are sending offensive guard Kenyon Green and a 2026 fifth-rounder to the Eagles. Gardner-Johnson initially joined the Eagles via trade in 2022 and immediately brought both physicality and playmaking to Philly's secondary, logging six interceptions in just 12 games en route to a Super Bowl appearance. A contract dispute saw him leave for the Detroit Lions in 2023, only to return to the Eagles on a three-year deal last offseason. Still just 23, he's missed extensive time due to injury over the last two seasons, including the entire 2023 campaign, but logged 23 combined starts for Houston's front out of Texas A&M. He figures to step in as a starter in place of interior veteran Mekhi Becton, who hit free agency this week.</p>

But he would still add talent to any wide receiver room, and put up big numbers during his 2023 campaign where he hauled in 72 passes for 1,250 yards and five touchdowns. That youth and potential are going to serve him well in free agency. He allowed just a single sack during the 2024 season, according to charting data from Pro Football Focus, and would be a solid option for teams looking for help on the interior. Douglas has at least four interceptions in each of the last three seasons, and has broken up at least seven passes in six of his seven NFL campaigns. Those skills at the catch point should find him a home relatively quickly.</p>

Do note that we've omitted Dodgers right-hander Roki Sasaki from this exercise since the focus is only on players who were already with an MLB organization. Soto isn't as blessed defensively, but the Mets will live with that component of his game provided he keeps stacking up 30-homer, .400-OBP seasons. He'll round out a rotation that now looks significantly stronger and deeper on paper than Arizona's recent iterations. Another talented left-handed starter, Fried (and his eight-year, $218 million contract) was part of the Yankees' pivot after losing out on Juan Soto. He's coming off a season that saw him set career highs in both home runs (32) and stolen bases (21).</p>

Like former teammate and 2021 draft classmate Fields, Jenkins is hoping to revive his career with a new team after things didn't necessarily pan out in Chicago.

It's spring in the Big Ten, and while fans are paying attention to March Madness, they're also keeping an eye on their football teams. As we saw at Indiana last season, when Curt Cignetti showed up and brought in almost an entirely new team, sometimes it works out better than anybody could've imagined. Joe Rossi had an excellent five seasons running the defense and left last year to join Jonathan Smith's staff at Michigan State. He was replaced by Corey Hetherman, who lasted only one season before Miami poached him to be their new defensive coordinator. Kyle Monangai is gone, and while we'll all miss that cannonball of a running back, just about everybody else on the Rutgers offense returns.</p>

Owner and general manager Jerry Jones is signing Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams to a one-year, $3 million contract, per NFL Media. Williams, who turns 25 years old on April 25, can earn up to $3.5 million with incentives as a Cowboy. The 2021 second-round pick out of North Carolina flashed early, but his brutal knee injury, in which he tore his ACL and LCL in 2022, has prevented him from growing into a game-changing running back. He was the Broncos' leading rusher in 2024 with 513 yards and four touchdowns on 139 carries (3.7 yards per carry), but that production wasn't anything remarkable.

Kupp also made it clear that he is highly motivated to resume his career elsewhere. Despite his recent injury issues, expect several teams to be interested in bidding for Kupp's services, especially those that could use a sure-handed veteran wideout with playoff experience. Dallas needs some reinforcements around CeeDee Lamb, especially with Brandin Cooks hitting the open market. Seattle also lured the top free agent quarterback available in Pro Bowler Sam Darnold, who agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract. In Denver, Kupp would play with an up-and-coming quarterback and inside Sean Payton's pass-happy offense.</p>

Milt is a good player,” Fangio said last August, just before that runaway Super Bowl season took place. As a three-tech tackle, Williams can get to the quarterback or running back in all kinds of evil ways. But Philly did stunt their linemen 11 times, and that was a serious component of the pressure they were able to generate. It's not always easy to reset in a split second when the run is going away from you. Per Sports Info Solutions, Williams generated two sacks and 21 total pressures against zero- to three-step drops on just 190 true pass rushes.</p>

It will be fascinating to see what New England does in the NFL Draft after signing Carlton Davis. Protection for Caleb Williams is more or less set now, and that's a mammoth win — but it wasn't all Chicago has done. This definitely wasn't the sexiest free agent haul of the day, but it was a pure football nerd series of signings by new GM James Gladstone and HC Liam Coen — targeted, and intentional. Despite these moves my favorite might be the sneaky signing of receiver Dyami Brown. This is a testament to the culture in Tampa Bay that GM Jason Licht has cultivated.</p>

DA [defensive coordinator Dennis Allen] and I have been talking about what that looks like on defense. That doesn't necessarily mean we need five new starters, because all it takes is one individual to blow up a play. Go back to Jonah Jackson's non-injury 2023 season, because that's what Ben Johnson and the Bears traded for/are paying for. Joe Thuney has been one of the NFL's best and smartest guards for quite a few years. Like Thuney, Dalman is more technician than mauler, though he can get grimy when the need arises.</p>

Crochet and Edwards were former top prospects who might not have even gotten the opportunity to do what they did last season on teams with more options. They'll cycle through Quad-A types like Matt Mervis, Kyle Stowers, and Jonah Bride to start the season, but we should see De Los Santos before too long. Durbin was getting, frankly, irresponsible levels of hype from some in the Fantasy Baseball community earlier this offseason, but that doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. Honorable mention: Abner Uribe -- The Brewers have plenty of late-inning options even after trading Devin Williams – keep an eye on Craig Yoho, who has been striking out everyone this spring – but I'll just remind you that everyone was very excited about Uribe this time last year, and there's still impact upside in the late innings if he gets a chance. It's always tough to earn an everyday job as a lefty in Tampa, but with what he's doing this spring, they may have no choice.</p>

Cutting Jonathan Allen to save $15.5M and then paying Javon Kinlaw a guaranteed $30M ... is interesting. Meanwhile, Philadelphia fans would somehow find a way to say the Laremy Tunsil trade was bad.

Fantasy managers should benefit from some of the deals that were announced Monday. This was one of the best landing spots for any running back since J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are free agents, and Harris can now be the featured back in Los Angeles. But if it's not someone with an early-round pick then Harris should be considered a No. Dobbins averaged 14.8 PPR points per game for the Chargers, and hopefully Harris can fill that role. And the nice thing that Sean Payton did for Williams in Denver was highlight his receiving skills with 52 catches for 346 yards on 70 targets last season, and Williams could end up playing on passing downs in Dallas if another running back of prominence is added.</p>
