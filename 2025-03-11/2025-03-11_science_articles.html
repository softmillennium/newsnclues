The recent discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino has left scientists scratching their heads. New research suggests it could be evidence that Stephen Hawking was right about the nature of black holes and the early universe.

Five decades ago, famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking theorized that the Big Bang may have flooded the universe with tiny black holes. Now, researchers believe they may have seen one explode.

In Feb. 2025, the European collaboration KM3NeT — which consists of underwater detectors off the coasts of France, Italy and Greece — announced the discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino. This ghostly particle had an energy of around 100 PeV — over 25 times more energetic than the particles accelerated in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful atom smasher.

Physicists have struggled to come up with an explanation for such an energetic neutrino. But now, a team of researchers who were not involved in the original detection have proposed a surprising hypothesis: The neutrino is the signature of an evaporating black hole. The team described their proposal in a paper that was uploaded to the arXiv database and has not been peer-reviewed yet.

In the 1970s, Hawking realized that black holes aren't entirely black. Instead, through complex interactions between the black hole event horizon and the quantum fields of space-time, they can emit a slow-but-steady stream of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This means black holes evaporate and eventually disappear. In fact, as the black hole gets smaller, it emits even more radiation, until it essentially explodes in a firestorm of high-energy particles and radiation — like the neutrino spotted by the KM3Net collaboration.

But all known black holes are very large — at least a few times the mass of the sun, and often significantly larger. It will take well over 10^100 years for even the smallest known black holes to die. If the KM3NeT neutrino is due to an exploding black hole, it has to be much smaller — somewhere around 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms). That's about as heavy as two fully grown African elephants, compressed into a black hole smaller than an atom.

The only known potential way to produce such tiny black holes is in the chaotic events of the early Big Bang, which may have flooded the cosmos with "primordial" black holes. The smallest primordial black holes produced in the Big Bang would have exploded long ago, while larger ones might persist to the present day.

Unfortunately, a 22,000-pound black hole should not survive all the way from the Big Bang to the present day. But the authors pointed out that there might be an additional quantum mechanism — known as "memory burden" — that allows black holes to resist decay. This would allow a 22,000-pound black hole to survive for billions of years before it finally exploded, sending a high-energy neutrino toward Earth in the process.

—'Cosmic Horseshoe' may contain black hole the size of 36 billion suns — one of the largest ever detected

—Scientists may have just discovered 300 of the rarest black holes in the universe

Primordial black holes might be an explanation for dark matter — the invisible substance that accounts for most of the matter in the universe — but so far, searches for them have turned up empty. This new insight may provide an intriguing clue. The researchers found that if primordial black holes of this mass range are abundant enough to account for all the dark matter, they should be exploding somewhat regularly. They estimated that if this hypothesis is correct, the KM3NeT collaboration should see another showstopping neutrino in the next few years.

If that detection happens, then we may just have to radically rethink the way we approach dark matter, high-energy neutrinos and even the physics of the early universe.

A tornado has torn through central Florida, destroying homes and sending broadcasters ducking for cover live on air. And experts have warned more tornadoes may hit the southwest in the coming days, with severe storms forecast.

The twister hit Seminole County in the Orlando metropolitan region on Monday (March 10) with peak wind speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h), weather website AccuWeather reported.

The tornado raced over a distance of around 4 miles (6 kilometers) in 15 minutes, destroying two homes, uprooting trees and damaging vehicles. There weren't any serious injuries reported as a result of the tornado, according to FOX 35 Orlando.

FOX 35 Orlando staff confirmed the tornado's location live on air when it hit their studio. Brooks Garner, a meteorologist at the TV station, was tracking the storm when a camera showed a gray mass of wind and rain approaching the FOX building.

"Take shelter!" Garner said as the tornado hit. "Everybody in the FOX 35 building, get to your safe space, under your desk if you're not in a designated area. We're catching debris right now on the roof."

FOX 35 Orlando staff said they felt the building shake and heard debris hit the roof as the tornado passed over them, FOX Weather reported. Nobody in the building was hurt, according to the report.

Tornadoes are narrow, rapidly rotating columns of air that stretch from clouds down to the ground during a thunderstorm. They are among the most violent storms on Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory.

Scientists categorize a tornado's strength using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which ranges from EF0 to EF5. The Florida tornado was EF2, meaning winds of 111 to 135 mph (179 to 217 km/h). For context, the most powerful EF5 tornadoes have winds of more than 200 mph (322 km/h). The last twister to reach EF5 was the 2013 Moore tornado, which killed 24 people and devastated the city of Moore in Oklahoma.

More tornadoes could hit the central and southeastern U.S. later this week. A powerful storm is expected to sweep across the country from west to east, with a risk of severe thunderstorms that could spawn tornadoes in 12 states, including Florida, on Friday and Saturday (March 14 to 15), according to a statement released by AccuWeather.

"All of the ingredients are coming together for a significant severe weather outbreak," Bernie Rayno, chief on-air meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in the statement. "We could end up with two dozen tornadoes or more by the end of the weekend."

	Testing for AGI may not be the best measure of AI's abilities and impacts

14 hours ago

When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek burst onto the scene in January, it sparked intense chatter about its efficient and cost-effective approach to generative AI. But like its U.S. competitors, DeepSeek's main goal is murkier than just efficiency: The company aims to create the first true artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

For years, AI developers — from small startups to big tech companies — have been racing toward this elusive endpoint. AGI, they say, would mark a critical turning point, enabling computer systems to replace human workers, making AI more trustworthy than human expertise and positioning artificial intelligence as the ultimate tool for societal advancement.

Yet, years into the AI race, AGI remains a poorly defined and contentious concept. Some computer scientists and companies frame it as a threshold for AI's potential to transform society. Tech advocates suggest that once we have superintelligent computers, day-to-day life could fundamentally change, affecting work, governance and the pace of scientific discovery.

But many experts are skeptical about how close we are to an AI-powered utopia and the practical utility of AGI. There's limited agreement about what AGI means, and no clear way to measure it. Some argue that AGI functions as little more than a marketing term, offering no concrete guidance on how to best use AI models or their societal impact.

In tech companies' quest for AGI, the public is tasked with navigating a landscape filled with marketing hype, science fiction and actual science, says Ben Recht, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It becomes very tricky. That's where we get stuck.” Continuing to focus on claims of imminent AGI, he says, could muddle our understanding of the technology at hand and obscure AI's current societal effects.

The term “artificial general intelligence” was coined in the mid-20th century. Initially, it denoted an autonomous computer capable of performing any task a human could, including physical activities like making a cup of coffee or fixing a car.

But as advancements in robotics lagged behind the rapid progress of computing, most in the AI field shifted to narrower definitions of AGI: Initially, this included AI systems that could autonomously perform tasks a human could at a computer, and more recently, machines capable of executing most of only the “economically valuable” tasks a human could handle at a computer, such as coding and writing accurate prose. Others think AGI should encompass flexible reasoning ability and autonomy when tackling a number of unspecified tasks.

“The problem is that we don't know what we want,” says Arseny Moskvichev, a machine learning engineer at Advanced Micro Devices and computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute. “Because the goal is so poorly defined, there's also no roadmap for reaching it, nor reliable way to identify it.”

To address this uncertainty, researchers have been developing benchmark tests, similar to student exams, to evaluate how close systems are to achieving AGI. 

For example, in 2019, French computer scientist and former Google engineer Francois Chollet released the Abstract Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence, or ARC-AGI. In this test, an AI model is repeatedly given some examples of colored squares arranged in different patterns on a grid. For each example set, the model is then asked to generate a new grid to complete the visual pattern, a task intended to assess flexible reasoning and the model's ability to acquire new skills outside of its training. This setup is similar to Raven's Progressive Matrices, a test of human reasoning.

The test results are part of what OpenAI and other tech companies use to guide model development and assessment. Recently, OpenAI's soon-to-be released o3 model achieved vast improvement on ARC-AGI compared to previous AI models, leading some researchers to view it as a breakthrough in AGI. Others disagree.

“There's nothing about ARC that's general. It's so specific and weird,” Recht says.

Computer scientist José Hernández-Orallo of the Universitat Politécnica de València in Spain says that it's possible ARC-AGI just assesses a model's ability to recognize images. Previous generations of language models could solve similar problems with high accuracy if the visual grids were described using text, he says. That context makes o3's results seem less novel. 

Plus, there's a limited number of grid configurations, and some AI models with tons of computing power at their disposal can “brute force” their way to correct responses simply by generating all possible answers and selecting the one that fits best — effectively reducing the task to a multiple-choice problem rather than one of novel reasoning.

To tackle each ARC-AGI task, o3 uses an enormous amount of computing power (and money) at test time. Operating in an efficient mode, it costs about $30 per task, Chollet says. In a less-efficient setting, one task can cost about $3,000. Just because the model can solve the problem doesn't mean it's practical or feasible to routinely use it on similarly challenging tasks.

It's not just ARC-AGI that's contentious. Determining whether an AI model counts as AGI is complicated by the fact that every available test of AI ability is flawed. Just as Raven's Progressive Matrices and other IQ tests are imperfect measures of human intelligence and face constant criticism for their biases, so too do AGI evaluations, says Amelia Hardy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. “It's really hard to know that we're measuring [what] we care about.”

Open AI's o3, for example, correctly responded to more than a quarter of the questions in a collection of exceptionally difficult problems called the Frontier Math benchmark, says company spokesperson Lindsay McCallum. These problems take professional mathematicians hours to solve, according to the benchmark's creators. On its face, o3 seems successful. But this success may be partly due to OpenAI funding the benchmark's development and having access to the testing dataset while developing o3. Such data contamination is a continual difficulty in assessing AI models, especially for AGI, where the ability to generalize and abstract beyond training data is considered crucial.

AI models can also seem to perform very well on complex tasks, like accurately responding to Ph.D.-level science questions, while failing on more basic ones, like counting the number of r's in “strawberry.” This discrepancy indicates a fundamental misalignment in how these computer systems process queries and understand problems.

Yet, AI developers aren't collecting and sharing the sort of information that might help researchers better gauge why, Hernández-Orallo says. Many developers provide only a single accuracy value for each benchmark, as opposed to a detailed breakdown of which types of questions a model answered correctly and incorrectly. Without additional detail, it's impossible to determine where a model is struggling, why it's succeeding, or if any single test result demonstrates a breakthrough in machine intelligence, experts say.Even if a model passes a specific, quantifiable test with flying colors, such as the bar exam or medical boards, there are few guarantees that those results will translate to expert-level human performance in messy, real-world conditions, says David Rein, a computer scientist at the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research based in Berkeley, Calif.

For instance, when asked to write legal briefs, generative AI models still routinely fabricate information. Although one study of GPT-4 suggested that the chatbot could outperform human physicians in diagnosing patients, more detailed research has found that comparable AI models perform far worse than actual doctors when faced with tests that mimic real-world conditions. And no study or benchmark result indicates that current AI models should be making major governance decisions over expert humans.

The benchmarks that OpenAI, DeepSeek and other companies report results from “do not tell us much about capabilities in the real world,” Rein says, although they can provide reasonable information for comparing models to one another.

So far, researchers have tested AI models largely by providing them with discrete problems that have known answers. However, humans don't always have the luxury of knowing what the problem before them is, whether it's solvable or in what time frame. People can identify key problems, prioritize tasks and, crucially, know when to give up. It's not yet clear that machines can or do. The most advanced “autonomous” agents struggle to navigate ordering pizza or groceries online.

Large language models and neural networks have improved dramatically in recent months and years. “They're definitely useful in a lot of different ways,” Recht says, pointing to the ability of newer models to summarize and digest data or produce serviceable computer code with few mistakes. But attempts like ARC-AGI to measure general ability don't necessarily clarify what AI models can and can't be used for. “I don't think it matters whether or not they're artificially generally intelligent,” he says.What might matter far more, based on the recent DeepSeek news, is traditional metrics of cost per task. Utility is determined by both the quality of a tool and whether that tool is affordable enough to scale. Intelligence is only part of the equation.

AGI is supposed to serve as a guiding light for AI developers. If achieved, it's meant to herald a major turning point for society, beyond which machines will function independently on equal or higher footing than humans. But so far, AI has had major societal impacts, both good and bad, without any consensus on whether we're nearing (or have already surpassed) this turning point, Recht, Hernández-Orallo and Hardy say.

For example, scientists are using AI tools to create new, potentially lifesaving molecules. Yet in classrooms worldwide, generative chatbots have disrupted assessments. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more and more U.S. teens are outsourcing assignments to ChatGPT. And a 2023 study in Nature reported that growing AI assistance in university courses has made cheating harder to detect.

To say that AI will become transformative once we reach AGI ignores all the trees for the forest.

Scientists in China have created a satellite with laser-imaging technology powerful enough to capture human facial details from more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) away.

This breakthrough represents a performance increase of 100 times or more compared to leading spy cameras and traditional telescopes, according to a report on the new technology in the South China Morning Post.

Amongst a broad gamut of potential applications, the technology could allow operators to surveil foreign satellites to a previously impossible level of detail. The researchers at China's Academy of Sciences' Aerospace Information Research Institute outlined their findings in a new study published in the Chinese Journal of Lasers (Issue 52, Volume 3).

According to the South China Morning Post, the scientists conducted a test across Qinghai Lake in the northwest of the country with a new system based on synthetic aperture lidar (SAL), a type of laser radar capable of constructing two-dimensional or three-dimensional images.

SAL relies on the motion of an object (like a satellite) to provide finer resolution images than other, beam-scanning radar imagery systems. Previous SAR systems have relied on microwave radiation, which has longer wavelengths, which results in lower resolution images.

However, this new system operates at optical wavelengths, which have much shorter wavelengths than microwaves and produce clearer images (though microwaves are better for penetrating into materials, because their longer wavelengths aren't scattered or absorbed as easily).

During the test, which targeted arrays of reflective prisms placed 63.3 miles (101.8 km) away from the lidar system, the device detected details as small as 0.07 inches (1.7 millimeters) and measured distances to within 0.61 inches (15.6 mm).

This is a huge leap forward from previous milestones, like a 2011 test conducted by defense firm Lockheed Martin that was able to achieve an azimuth resolution of 0.79 inches (2 centimeters) from only 1 mile (1.6 km) away, or a Chinese test where scientists achieved a then-best 1.97 inch (5 cm) resolution at a distance of 4.3 miles (6.9 km).

To achieve this latest breakthrough, the Chinese team split the laser-beam driving the lidar system across a 4x4 micro-lens array, which in turn expanded the system's optical aperture — the opening that controls the amount of light entering a camera system — from 0.68 to 2.71 inches (17.2 mm to 68.8 mm). In this way, researchers could bypass the tradeoff of field of vision versus size of aperture, which has historically restricted such camera systems.

It's important to note that testing took place during near perfect weather and atmospheric conditions with steady wind and limited cloud cover. Inclement weather or other impairments to visibility could significantly impact the system's precision and reliability.

Perovskite cells are much cheaper and more flexible than their silicon alternatives, but they have major durability problems. A new breakthrough could be about to change that.

Scientists have made a cheap and flexible solar cell that lasts nearly 10 times longer than others of its type, an advance that could one day help to revolutionize solar energy production.

Often referred to as the "holy grail" of solar power, perovskite cells offer a lightweight alternative to traditional silicon-based solar technology. Their flexible structure enables them to be applied to cars and phones in the form of a printable layer so they can charge on the go.

Sounds too good to be true? So far, you're right. Perovskites come with some major flaws. Notably, they degrade quickly due to chemical reactions with moisture in the air that make them leak iodine.

But now, a team of researchers has found a solution to this problem. By embedding nanoparticles within the perovskites, they produced a new cell that lasts for 1,530 hours, a near-tenfold increase on previous perovskite solar cell designs. The researchers published their findings Feb. 20 in the journal EES Solar.

"By addressing these common challenges we see with perovskite solar technology, our research blows the doors wide open for cheaper, more efficient and more widely accessible solar power," study co-author Imalka Jayawardena, an engineering researcher at the University of Surrey's Advanced Technology Institute in the U.K., said in a statement. "What we've achieved here is a critical step toward developing high-performance solar cells that can withstand real-world conditions — bringing us closer to their commercial use at a global scale."

As the fastest-growing and cheapest form of renewable energy, solar power is key to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But the technology's growth is hampered by its reliance on silicon, a finite and non-renewable resource that, in its purest form, is costly to produce.

To get around this bottleneck, scientists have looked to develop perovskite alternatives — synthetic versions of naturally occurring calcium titanium oxide crystals that can be made at a fraction of the cost. But unlike pure silicon cells, which can last for decades, solar cells made from perovskite only last for 100 or so hours, drastically limiting their utility.

In the new study, the scientists looked for a way to trap the iodine that leaks from perovskites. Their solution was to embed tiny nanoparticles of aluminum oxide within the cells as they were manufactured. This not only prevented the iodine from leaking but also created a more uniform and electrically conductive structure.

After testing these cells under extreme heat and humidity, the researchers found that the modified cells maintained a high performance for more than two months (1,530 hours), a significant improvement on the 160-hour lifespan of unenhanced perovskite cells.

The researchers plan to continue investigating their new technique to see if these gains can be built upon further.

"A decade ago, the idea of perovskite solar cells lasting this long under real-world conditions seemed out of reach," study lead author Hashini Perera, a researcher at the Advanced Technology Institute, said in the statement. "With these improvements, we're breaking new ground in stability and performance, bringing perovskite technology closer to becoming a mainstream energy solution."

Where is it? Kavachi volcano, Solomon Islands [-8.992492984, 157.96863838]

What's in the photo? A plume of discolored water rising up from an undersea eruption

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? May 14, 2022

This unusual image shows a large plume of discolored water rising toward the Pacific Ocean's surface from the Kavachi volcano, also known as "sharkcano," during an undersea eruption.

Kavachi is a submarine volcano that is part of the Solomon Islands, around 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Vangunu Island. Its peak stands roughly 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above the seafloor and lies just 65 feet (20 m) below the waves. The volcano is named after the sea god of the Vangunu people and is also referred to as "Rejo te Kvachi," or "Kavachi's Oven," according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

In 2015, a research expedition discovered multiple scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) living within the volcano's central crater. The surprising presence of the oceanic predators at the volcano raised "new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals exist," the researchers wrote.

It is unclear whether any of the sharks at Kavachi were hurt by the outburst that triggered the plume in the image or if they were able to sense the incoming eruption and evacuate the crater.

The image was first released in May 2022 by NASA Goddard on the social media platform X along with the caption: "You've heard of sharknado, now get ready for sharkcano."

The plume in the photo is part of an eruption that began in October 2021 and lasted for just a few weeks after the aerial image was taken. Similar plumes occurred during subsequent eruptions in August 2023 and April 2024, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Before then, the volcano's most recent major eruptions were in 2016, 2014, 2007 and 2003. In the past, researchers also sighted ephemeral islands up to half a mile (1 km) wide being birthed by the eruptions and then sinking. A similar ghostly landmass recently emerged after an undersea volcano in Japan blew its top in 2023.

Kavachi experiences "phreatomagmatic eruptions," which occur when magma meets water and ejects steam, ash, volcanic rock fragments and chunks of magma known as "incandescent bombs," according to the Earth Observatory.

A study conducted in the wake of the 2007 eruption found that the volcanic plumes are made of warm, acidic water that also contains particulate matter and sulfur, which "attracts microbial communities that thrive on [the chemicals]," the researchers wrote.

The volcano can also launch jets of heated water without any visible plumes or other signs of erupting.

Residents of neighboring islands have frequently reported that they regularly see steam and ash on the water's surface between eruptions, further confirming that the so-called sharkcano is percolating beneath the surface.
