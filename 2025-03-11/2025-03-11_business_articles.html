▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shopped for a new Tesla on the White House driveway on Tuesday, selecting a shiny red sedan to show his support for Elon Musk ‘s electric vehicle company as it faces blowback because of his work to advance the president's political agenda and downsize the federal government. 

“Wow,” Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model S. “That's beautiful.”

Musk got in on the passenger side and joked about “giving the Secret Service a heart attack” as they talked about how to start a vehicle that can reach 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour in a few seconds. 

Trump told reporters that he would write a check for the car, which retails for roughly $80,000, and leave it at the White House so his staff can drive it. The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which is struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices. 

When asked by FOX Business Network's Larry Kudlow, Elon Musk has this response on how he was able to run his other businesses while overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency.

“It's a great product,” he said. Referring to Musk, Trump said “we have to celebrate him.”

It was the latest — and most unusual — example of how Trump has demonstrated loyalty to Musk, who spent heavily on his comeback campaign last year and has been a key figure in his second administration. Tesla's stock price increased nearly 4% on Tuesday after dropping almost 48% since Trump took office in January.

The Republican president announced on social media overnight that he was going to buy a new Tesla as “a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”




Musk continues to run Tesla — as well as the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump's adviser.

“Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote. “But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's ‘baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.”

Speaking later Tuesday at a business roundtable event, Trump said that Musk, the world's richest man, “shouldn't be scarified or have to suffer because he wants to help the government.”

Others have also rallied to Musk's defense. Alex Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist, said that he bought a customized version of a Cybertruck that he'll give away to a customer of his online store next month. 

In addition to Tesla's struggles, Musk has faced other challenges too. He said X was targeted by a “massive cyberattack” that disrupted the social media platform on Monday, and the last two test launches of his Starship rocket ended in explosions.

Presidents almost never drive for security reasons. Joe Biden got behind the wheel of an electric truck while promoting domestic manufacturing, and Barack Obama took a spin with Jerry Seinfeld in the White House driveway for a comedy show. 

But regardless of the practicality of Trump's purchase, his overnight announcement about buying a Tesla represented another step in how the president has blurred lines between private and public interests.

During his first term, top adviser Kellyanne Conway urged people to show their support for Trump's daughter Ivanka by purchasing her retail products. 

“Go buy Ivanka's stuff,” she said. “I'm going to give it a free commercial here.”

Trump's wealth and business savvy is core to his political appeal. The president promoted his products while running for office last year, and he attached his name to a cryptocurrency meme coin that launched shortly before he took office. 

However, it's rare to see Trump use his own money to support an ally, no matter how important they are. 

Musk is the world's richest person, with billions of dollars in government contracts. He's also exerting sweeping influence over Trump's administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and traveling frequently with the president. 

During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk “how are you running your other businesses” while also advising Trump.

“With great difficulty,” he said. 

“But there's no turning back, you say?” Kudlow responded.

“I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk said. 

Tesla has recently faced protests and vandalism. Police are investigating gunshots fired at a dealership in Oregon, and fire officials are examining a blaze that destroyed four Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle. 

At times, the White House has needed to play cleanup for Musk, who had never worked in public service before and has admitted that he'll make mistakes along the way.

For example, Musk presented inflated estimates of fraud in government benefits like Social Security on Monday, leading Democrats to argue that he was planning cuts to the popular programs. 

“Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” Musk said in the interview. “That's the big one to eliminate.”

The next morning, a White House account on X criticized news organizations as “lying hacks” and told Democrats to “spare us the fake outrage” about reducing benefits. 

“He was clearly talking about the WASTE in the programs,” the White House posted.

                    The News Journal Names Dr. Janice Nevin Among Delaware's Most Influential Business Leaders                

ChristianaCare President and CEO Janice E. Nevin, M.D., MPH, has been recognized as a top business leader by Delaware Online/The News Journal.

For the fifth year in a row, Delaware Online/The News Journal recognized “the folks who continue to shape Delaware's future … those who have a big impact in the First State — from leaders in health care, law and business, as well as movers and shakers in the arenas of dining, entertainment, social media and more.”

Since 2014, Nevin has overseen ChristianaCare's ascension as a national health care leader in the areas of quality and safety, health equity, virtual health and value-based care. At the same time, she has guided ChristianaCare's expansion of services and programs throughout the region including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

“I am particularly proud of our focus on quality and safety, health equity, improving access and driving down health care costs while increasing the value of our care,” Nevin said.

“We are doing that through programs like Hospital Care at Home, which provides virtual and in-person care by a team of physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and other providers. And our Medicaid accountable care organization has shown great reductions in spending — $6.2 million in 2023 alone — while improving the quality of care for nearly 30,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Delaware.

“Our quality and patient safety metrics have been nationally recognized by U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek, the American College of Surgeons and many more. We couldn't do any of this without our great staff, who inspire me every day. Our talented caregivers are truly ChristianaCare's greatest asset.”

A visionary and collaborative health care leader, Nevin has led ChristianaCare's transformation from a health care system to a system that truly impacts health. She is nationally recognized as a pioneer and thought leader in value-based care and population health, including her belief that truly great health care is built on the values of love and excellence. These values are exemplified in her commitment to health equity and making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for everyone in the communities that ChristianaCare serves.

FALL RIVER — This weekend marks the end of an era for another Fall River restaurant staple.

Just one week after the closure of a famous North End eatery, O Gil Restaurant will be bidding a bittersweet goodbye at the beloved family restaurant, a go-to for Portuguese cuisine in the city's South End for 34 years. 

Looking to get a taste of their authentic no-frills, all-flavor fare before it's too late? Better head to 915 County St. soon.

On Tuesday, longtime employee Debbie Esposito confirmed that Saturday, March 15, will be their last day of business.

"It's very sad, I've been here 32 years," said Esposito, a long time waitress and bartender who started there in 1993. "But everything good comes to an end."

The Tiverton resident is a veteran among the O Gil staff whose tenure at the small neighborhood spot goes back almost as far as its inception. 

Current owner Victor Fagundo opened O Gil in 1991, along with his brother-in-law Felisberto Sousa, who died in September 2024.

O Gil Restaurant — named after Fagundo's father, Gil Fagundo, who is credited with bringing Portuguese steak to Fall River — garnered a reputation over the years for serving one of the best Portuguese steaks — and more — in a city packed with Luso options. 

According to Esposito, among the things that made O Gil special was the family atmosphere and the love and care they poured into their cooking.

"Everything is homemade, our sandwiches are huge, our french fries are hand-cut, the soups are the best in the city, homemade chicken and kale," she said. "They put a lot of heart and soul into it ... it was always a family restaurant."

Since Fagundo and Sousa announced their desire to retire and put the restaurant up for sale in late 2023, locals have been anxiously counting down O Gil's final days.

And while the closure doesn't come as a shock for patrons, it's still a blow for the many who've long frequented the casual, homestyle spot tucked away on a Fall River side street. 

"Everybody's bummed out and upset," Esposito said.

The sale of the County Street property is not yet official but is expected to change hands this month, according to new owner Kristin Teves.

Teves, co-owner of North South Property Management along with her husband, is no stranger to the Fall River restaurant fixture, having managed the South End property for over 20 years.

Her plans include leasing the County Street location and renovations to the restaurant space are also expected.

While her hope is that the O Gil spot will continue to operate as a restaurant, Teves indicated that is no guarantee and the future of the building remains uncertain at this time.

"It's definitely a legacy here in Fall River," Teves said in a late February interview. "Whenever you're in a group of Portuguese people, everyone has their opinion on their favorite steak and favorite meal in the city, and O Gil's is always in the top three. I'd like to keep it there for people that love it and for people that have grown up with it. It's truly a part of the city and I'd like to see it stay a part of the city."</p>

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's latest threat of 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum upended markets Tuesday, but his plan for an increase of any level could be heartily welcomed by American manufacturers of those products.

"We stand fully behind your leadership," nine US steel industry executives said in a recent letter to the president about a set of 25% duties planned on all steel and aluminum imports from all countries set to come into force tomorrow.

Trump surprised markets on Tuesday by announcing that he would by going higher and imposing "an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%," on steel and aluminum from Canada on top of the previously announced 25% duties that start Wednesday.

He then suggested later in the day that those tariffs may not happen after Ontario's premier said it would suspend a surcharge on exports of electricity.

"I'll let you know," Trump told reporters as Philip Bell, the Steel Manufacturers Association president, added in a live Yahoo Finance interview Tuesday afternoon that he hopes at least the 25% duties stay in place.

Stocks quickly sold off Tuesday morning as the president also elevated his war of words with Canada but then whipsawed up and down on the competing headlines.

"It's more uncertainty, it's more chaos, he changes his mind on a whim," Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari said in another Yahoo Finance live appearance at one point.

But Tuesday morning's fresh round of agita belies a more nuanced view of Trump's 25% duties within the steel and aluminum industry after years of executives expressing concern about things like "steel dumping" from China.

And there is now bipartisan ire about subsidized Chinese steel undercutting world markets, leading many CEOs in the sector to actively cheer on Trump's most protectionist impulses.

Executives also have a familiar legal and political playbook for this week's steel and aluminum tariffs after Trump undertook similar actions during his first term — even though the duties do represent a mixed bag for some with closer economic ties to Canada.

One example of the industry support for Trump has come in the form of the recent letter sent to the president from the heads of US Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), and Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), among others, touting the plan for 25% blanket duties.

"We urge you to resist any requests for exceptions or exclusions and to continue standing strong on behalf of American steel," the letter said, according to a copy reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

"We stand fully behind your leadership," it added.

The letter also touted Trump's similar 2018 action on steel and aluminum that imposed 25% duties but mostly focused on China. The letter said it allowed American producers to reinvest and drive up capacity by nearly 80%.

Some in the aluminum industry have also spoken favorably about Trump's plans, with White House aides also touting the support of the industry in remarks this week about why the duties would be going forward.

But the reaction has been somewhat more mixed among some CEOs in a reflection of greater interrelationships between the US and Canada.

Alcoa (AA) CEO William Oplinger recently said that his aluminum-manufacturing company would be hurt by the tariffs, given both increased prices and because of the company's extensive operations in Canada.

"This is bad for the aluminum industry in the US," Oplinger said at a conference, adding that the bottom line is that 100,000 US jobs were at stake even before Trump's latest threat this week doubled the tariffs on Canadian aluminum.

The final consumers of steel and aluminum products are also likely to be less enamored with Trump's move as evidence mounts that it could raise an array of prices.

Domestic steel prices jumped in February when Trump announced his plan, with the price of a ton of domestic steel now nearly $1,000 a ton from around $700 previously.

A recent Bloomberg report found that consumer products from aluminum baseball bats to stainless steel pans to fishing reels could see higher prices as a result.

Still, the language from many of these pro-tariff executives is also very similar to Trump's own reasoning for his focus on steel and aluminum.

Trump has described this week's action as a sort of unfinished business after he imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum in his first term but with exceptions that, in his view, allowed cheap Chinese products to continue undercutting the market by moving through third-party countries.

"It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions and that's all countries, no matter where it comes from," the president said when announcing his plan in February.

Increased steel tariffs were also often advocated by then-President Biden, who talked about tripling them and told a Pittsburgh crowd in 2024 of China, "They're not competing. They're cheating."

The bulk of this week's move is also being made using presidential tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, making it a formal continuation of the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump launched during his first term.

These "Section 232" tariffs are much more familiar to business leaders than the tariffs Trump has imposed so far using emergency authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

Trump also announced Tuesday he would be declaring a national emergency on electricity in response to Canadian moves to impose an additional fee on US electricity consumers.

Trump promised that "this will allow the US to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada."

FIRST ON FOX: A government accountability nonprofit is calling on the House to launch a probe into whether Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., misappropriated her taxpayer-funded member allowance.

Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, sent a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) on Tuesday, questioning "several troubling expenses" from AOC's disbursements, which they claim are "in contravention of federal law and the standards of the House of Representatives."

Each member of Congess receives a Member Representational Allowance ("MRA"), a budget for official duties that "may not be used for personal or campaign purposes," according to the Congressional Research Service. However, the "Squad" member is being accused of using these funds for "campaign purposes."

AOC reportedly made a payment of $3,700 to a "Juan D Gonzalez" and another for $850 to "Bombazo Dance Co Inc.," with both expenditures described as being used for "training."

"100% wrong," Ocasio-Cortez wrote. "None of this is taxpayer money, this is an FEC filing. Be loud and wrong about something else. Try again next time."

The filing states that Ocasio-Cortez's "assertion that these expenses are ‘an FEC filing,' and not reflective of her MRA – as well as her claim that '[n]one of this is taxpayer money' – is both troubling and obviously incorrect."

"Either she does not know the difference between her campaign funds and MRA, or, more likely, she knows the highlighted expenses were not for official business and should have been paid by her campaign and reported to the FEC."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, said, "Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated."

"Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated. In the era of reining in government spending, the American people deserve to know lawmakers are being good stewards of their tax dollars."

Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment.

The congresswoman has faced ethics complaints in the past, including from the Heritage Foundation in 2023 accusing her of "falsely accusing" and "defaming" the creator of the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, Chaya Raichik.

Ocasio-Cortez also faced an ethics probe in 2023 after being accused of accepting "impermissible gifts associated with her attendance at the Met Gala in 2021," which may have violated House rules, standards of conduct and federal law.

It's happening: Southwest Airlines will start charging passengers to check bags for the first time.

It's a stunning reversal that shows the low-cost pioneer is willing to part with a customer perk executives have said set it apart from rivals for more than half a century of flying in hopes of increasing revenue.

Southwest's changes come after months of pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for quick changes at the company, which held on for decades — until now — to perks like free checked bags, changeable tickets and open seating.

For tickets purchased on or after May 28, Southwest customers in all but the top-tier fare class will have to pay to check bags, though there will be exceptions. Elite frequent flyers who hold A-List Preferred status will still get two bags, and A-List level members will get one free checked bag. Southwest credit card holders will also get one free checked bag.

"Two bags fly free" is a registered trademark on Southwest's website. But its decision to about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk brings the largest U.S. domestic carrier in line with its rivals, which together generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data.

Southwest didn't say how much it plans to charge to check bags, but a single bag costs $35 to check on Delta, American and United.

Southwest shares rose 8% Tuesday after its baggage fee announcement and investor update, while other large carriers' shares and the broader market fell.





Southwest executives have long said they didn't plan to charge for bags, telling Wall Street analysts that it was a major reason why customers chose the airline.

At an investor day in September, Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags but lose $1.8 billion of market share. Southwest said its "rigorous research" found that "our 'bags fly free' policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from bag fees."

Some airline executives see an opportunity.

"I think, clearly, there are some customers who [chose Southwest] because of that, and now those customers are up for grabs," Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at an investor conference on Tuesday, after Southwest's announcement. "We'll see how that plays out over the next period of time as they continue to implement multiple changes to their products."

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, speaking at the same conference, likened Southwest's baggage policy change to "the slaying of a sacred cow" and said lower-paying customers will be most affected.

"I view it as a big deal because it's more — it feels more financially driven — a results-driven airline than it's ever been before," he said.

Southwest CEO Bob Jordan had cited the company's long-standing bag policy in an earnings call last July.

"After fare and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the No. 1 issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest," Jordan said.

But Southwest has changed its tune.

"What's changed is that we've come to realize that we need more revenue to cover our costs," COO Andrew Watterson said in an interview with CNBC about the baggage fee changes. "We think that these changes that we're announcing today will lead to less of that share shift than would have been the case otherwise."

Jordan said Tuesday that the new baggage policy will likely help drive sign-ups for its co-branded credit card and that it made sense because of its commercial reach, listing its tickets through outside platforms like Google Flights and Expedia.

"In contrast to our previous analysis, actual customer booking behavior through our new booking channels such as metasearch, did not show that we are getting the same benefit from our bundled offering with free bags, which has led us to update the assumptions," he said.

Jordan said the carrier has new executives with "direct experience implementing bag fees at multiple airlines and that's also helped further validate the new assumptions."

Southwest said the changes it announced Tuesday will add $800 million in earnings before interest and taxes this year and $1.7 billion in 2026, bringing 2026 total increases, including other initiatives, to $4.3 billion, up from a $2.6 billion target it shared at its investor day in September.

During those presentations in September, Southwest's then chief transformation officer, Ryan Green, told analysts that an analysis showed Southwest would lose more money from passengers defecting to rivals if it started charging for bags than it would make from the fees.

"The fact that free bags is a key driver of choice creates the risk that customers may choose the competition if we change the policy," he said.

Southwest said last month that it had parted ways with Green.

The airline also said Tuesday that it will launch a new, basic economy fare, something rivals have offered for years.

Southwest, in addition, will change the way customers earn Rapid Rewards: Customers will earn more of the frequent flyer miles depending on how much they pay. Redemption rates will vary depending on flight demand, a dynamic pricing model competitors use.

And flight credits for tickets purchased on or after May 28 will expire in one year, or earlier, depending on the type of fare purchased.

It's the latest in a string of massive strategy changes at Southwest as its performance has fallen behind rivals.

Last July, Southwest shocked passengers when it announced it would ditch its open seating model for assigned seats and add "premium" extra legroom options, ending decades of an single-class cabin.

The airline is also looking to slash its costs. Higher expenses coming out of the pandemic have taken a bite out of airline margins.

Last month, Southwest announced its first mass layoff, cutting about 1,750 jobs roughly 15% of its corporate staff, many of them at its headquarters, a decision CEO Jordan called "unprecedented" in the carrier's more than 53 years of flying.

"We are at a pivotal moment as we transform Southwest Airlines into a leaner, faster, and more agile organization," he said last month.

Earlier this year, Southwest announced the retirement of its longtime finance chief, Tammy Romo, who was replaced by Breeze executive Tom Doxey, and its chief administrative officer, Linda Rutherford. Both executives worked at Southwest for more than 30 years.

Southwest has also cut unprofitable routes, summer internships and employee team-building events its held for decades.
