Now, the Trump administration has announced that these drugs, which have been in use for decades and gone through rigorous testing, will be subject to new scrutiny.

Invoking a burden of chronic disease, including in children, the administration has pledged to, in its words, “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by” certain commonly prescribed medications. In the coming months, its “Make America Healthy Again” commission plans to review a slew of existing medications, including SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

More than 10 percent of U.S. adults took antidepressants over the previous 30 days, data from 2015 to 2018 show. And SSRIs are among the most widely prescribed of those drugs.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned the safety of antidepressants and other psychiatric medicines, making misleading and unsubstantiated claims about the drugs. For instance, as recently as his January confirmation hearings, he likened taking SSRIs to having a heroin addiction. He also has suggested — without evidence — that SSRIs play a role in school shootings.

With the executive order and statements like these, “it’s implied there is something nefarious or harmful” about antidepressants and related medications, says Lisa Fortuna, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Children, Adolescents and Their Families. “People may think that they’re dangerous drugs.”

Like any pharmacological treatment, SSRIs can come with side effects, which can range from mildly annoying but tolerable to rare and serious. And the drugs don’t work for everyone. But there’s strong scientific evidence that they can be very helpful for many people, including children and adolescents, says Fortuna, who’s also a psychiatrist at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine.

Science News spoke with Fortuna and two other psychiatrists about the science behind SSRIs, what’s known and unknown about the drugs, and how the recent rhetoric — unsupported by mainstream scientific research — can stigmatize people with mental illness.

SSRIs can treat more than depression

Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa. These are brand names of some common SSRI antidepressants. These drugs are called antidepressants, but they are used for a wide range of conditions, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders, says psychiatrist Awais Aftab of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

Across all of these disorders, Aftab says, numerous clinical trials have generally shown that SSRIs, which have been around for decades, perform better than a placebo. But nothing in medicine is absolute. With depression, for instance, about half of people who try one or several antidepressants ultimately respond well, Aftab says. Other people see minor improvements and still others aren’t helped. “It’s a kind of mixed bag,” he says.

What conditions do SSRIs help treat? While SSRIs are called antidepressants, they are used to treat a wide range of disorders. Here’s a partial list: Depression

Anxiety

Bulimia

Obsessive-compulsive disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder

Binge eating disorder

Rheumatoid arthritis

Though the drugs often take weeks to work, they can improve people’s mood, ability to sleep and decrease their anxiety, says Giuseppe Guaiana, a clinical psychiatrist at Western University in London, Canada, and the chief of psychiatry at the nearby St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital. His team recently reviewed 37 clinical trials that evaluated antidepressants in people with generalized anxiety disorder. Bottom line: The researchers are highly confident that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, Guaiana’s team reported in January.

But that doesn’t mean SSRIs are a good choice for every patient. “It’s a little bit more complicated than that,” he says.

SSRIs have side effects

Before SSRIs, doctors often relied on a class of medications called tricyclic antidepressants. Those came with all sorts of unpleasant side effects, including cardiac issues like sudden drops in blood pressure.

“Antidepressants are not addictive, because people don’t get high.” psychiatrist Awais Aftab

SSRIs are a step up from those older drugs, Guaiana says. Still, “no medication is perfect,” he says. SSRIs can cause upset stomachs, headaches and reduced sexual desire. And that’s no small thing. Estimates vary quite a bit; the percent of people taking SSRIs who experience negative sexual side effects, such as a loss of libido, range from 25 to over 70 percent. For context, more than 8 million people in the United States were estimated to take one kind of SSRI, sertraline (sold as Zoloft), in 2022.

With multiple SSRIs currently available in the United States, doctors can try different options and doses to find a regimen that works — and one that patients find tolerable. That’s standard practice, Aftab says. Much of medicine requires assessing the risks and benefits of a particular treatment. Even something as commonplace as aspirin, for example, can be iffy for some patients and helpful for others. The same trade-offs exist for SSRIs.

SSRIs are not addictive

Addiction has a specific definition. With drugs like heroin or painkillers or cocaine, Aftab says, “there’s a sense of euphoria, there’s a kind of pleasant, psychoactive effect that the person is seeking and craving.”

Once people stop using an addictive drug, he says, “they desire that drug, they think about it, they want to obtain it.” People struggling with substance use disorders will often go to great lengths to get their drug of choice, which leads to problematic behavior. That doesn’t happen with SSRIs.

“So in that classic sense, antidepressants are not addictive, because people don’t get high,” Aftab says. “They don’t get a euphoric feeling. They don’t crave them. They don’t chase them or engage in theft or dishonesty.”

But like many medicines, SSRIs can cause dependency. Think of a heavy coffee drinker going cold turkey, and suffering through splitting headaches. Their body has gotten used to the caffeine; quitting it requires a period of adaptation.

A similar sort of physical adjustment can happen when some people stop taking SSRIs, Aftab says. Symptoms include depression, anxiety and irritability. That overlap in psychological symptoms can make it hard to distinguish the original illness from signs of withdrawal. There can be physical symptoms too, like nausea, dizziness, restlessness and palpitations. Some people’s symptoms are a bit unusual, Aftab says. “They might experience brain zaps,” unpleasant jolts that feel like electricity.

Still, these physical symptoms seem to be relatively rare, occurring in only about 15 percent of people who discontinue SSRIs, researchers reported in 2024 in the Lancet Psychiatry. And they are not the same as an addiction.

What’s more, SSRIs might actually help people avoid addiction to heroin or other drugs, Fortuna says. That’s because mental illnesses like depression and anxiety are risk factors for addiction. If we treat those underlying conditions, she says, that could prevent substance use disorder.

SSRIs are just one of the tools for treating mental illness

Mental illness among young people is a major problem in the United States. In 2023, more than half of girls in high school reported feelings of hopelessness and persistent sadness; the same was true for over a quarter of boys.

Psychiatrists have many ways to help kids cope. That includes evidence-based options such as individual therapy, family therapy and educational support, as well as medication. And the number of adolescents and young adults on antidepressants has been on the rise. In 2022, pharmacies in the United States dispensed one or more antidepressant prescriptions to nearly 6.8 million people ages 12 to 25. That’s compared with about 4.6 million people in 2016, researchers reported in Pediatrics in 2024. But, Fortuna says, “there’s this misconception that if you come to us, all we’re going to do is push medication.”

Feeling hopeless In 2023, some 40 percent of U.S. teens reported stretches of more than two weeks of feeling so sad or hopeless that they stopped doing their regular activities. The feeling was more prevalent for girls than boys, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.

In reality, she takes a comprehensive approach, walking patients and their parents through different treatment options and discussing the risks and benefits of each. Antidepressants, for example, carry what’s known as a black box warning about suicide. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyses, antidepressants were linked to an increase in suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under 25. That sounds scary, but the science isn’t so clear-cut, Fortuna says. The warning has been controversial. What scientists do know is that “untreated depression is definitely related to suicidality,” she says.

Still, doctors make sure to monitor young patients closely. And overall, she says, “the field is not fast or hasty to provide SSRIs to children and adolescents.”

Mental health stigma still exists today

In many ways, society still struggles to accept depression as a serious medical condition. Naysayers sometimes think that people suffering from depression “just need to suck it up,”Aftab says.

Treatments often bring judgment too. SSRIs in particular have been questioned since they gained popularity in the 1990s. Perspectives that these drugs create artificial happiness or change a person into someone else still exist. “Stigmatizing attitudes about psychiatric medications are still fairly common,” Aftab says. “We’re in this weird kind of phase where large chunks of the population are pretty comfortable with taking these medications, but we also have large chunks of people that have really negative and stigmatizing views of them.”

SSRIs are medications for mental illness, just like insulin is medication for diabetes, Fortuna says. She’s concerned that the current round of antidepressant negativity could make parents of children on the medications feel like they’re doing something wrong by treating their kids. Mental illness is a medical condition, she says, “and it’s something that our medical profession can treat.”

Guaiana worries that some mentally ill people might avoid treatment and go on to harm themselves. Undertreatment of depression has been linked to suicide, he says. Results from a 2024 study, for example, suggest that SSRIs offer short-term protection against suicidal thoughts.

There are still unanswered questions about SSRIs

The first SSRI — fluoxetine, or Prozac — was launched in the late 1980s. But scientists still have questions about how this family of drugs works. “We’re not completely in the dark,” Guaiana says, “but there is definitely much more we need to know.” For instance, it’s not clear why these drugs take weeks, or even months, to start helping with symptoms. It’s also unclear how they perform over years of use, or whether long-term use brings its own side effects. And aspects of withdrawal, including how common it is and what the main symptoms are, remain relatively understudied.

That’s also true for how SSRIs work for people with multiple mental health issues, like severe anxiety combined with a trauma-related disorder. It’s not just an academic question; Guaiana sees and treats patients like that in the clinic. “This is something we need to have more data on,” he says.

Still, it’s clear that these drugs are essential medicines for many people. What’s not helpful is blanket statements about these drugs’ value, Guaiana says. We shouldn’t say, “antidepressants are wonderful and work for everybody,” or that “antidepressants are horrible and don’t work.” Instead, he says, “we need to be nuanced.”

https://sciencenews.org,Uranus emits more heat than previously thought,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/uranus-energy-planet-sun,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","Uranus emits more energy than it gets from the sun, two new studies report — a discovery that contradicts findings from the venerable Voyager spacecraft.

When Voyager 2 sped past Uranus on January 24, 1986, the spacecraft detected no significant excess heat from the planet, making it seemingly unique among the sun’s giant worlds. However, new observations from space- and ground-based telescopes reveal that Uranus does in fact radiate more energy than sunlight provides, two research teams report in work submitted to arXiv.org in late February.

“Uranus is not as odd as we thought it was,” says planetary scientist Patrick Irwin of the University of Oxford, a coauthor on one of the studies.

Both teams say that Uranus, which takes 84 years to orbit the sun, reflects a bit more sunlight into space than Voyager had found. This means that the sun heats the planet less than previously thought, suggesting that Uranus must generate some heat to explain its temperature.

The upshot: “Uranus does indeed have internal heat,” says Liming Li, a planetary scientist at the University of Houston and coauthor on the other study. This heat is presumably left over from the planet’s birth.

Li’s team estimates that Uranus emits 12.5 percent more energy than it receives from the sun. Irwin’s team pegs the excess at 15 percent, consistent with the other team’s result.

“Uranus is still an outlier,” Irwin says, because the other giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune — radiate more than twice as much energy as they get from the sun.

No one knows why Uranus is so subdued. But the planet has another oddity: It rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees — compared with 3 degrees for Jupiter, 27 degrees for Saturn and 28 degrees for Neptune.

Planetary scientists have long suspected that a giant object knocked Uranus over. If so, the impact may have dredged up hot material from the interior, Irwin says, causing Uranus to lose much of its heat during its youth.",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,The meaning of artificial general intelligence remains unclear,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-general-intelligence-ai-unclear,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek burst onto the scene in January, it sparked intense chatter about its efficient and cost-effective approach to generative AI. But like its U.S. competitors, DeepSeek’s main goal is murkier than just efficiency: The company aims to create the first true artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

For years, AI developers — from small startups to big tech companies — have been racing toward this elusive endpoint. AGI, they say, would mark a critical turning point, enabling computer systems to replace human workers, making AI more trustworthy than human expertise and positioning artificial intelligence as the ultimate tool for societal advancement.

Yet, years into the AI race, AGI remains a poorly defined and contentious concept. Some computer scientists and companies frame it as a threshold for AI’s potential to transform society. Tech advocates suggest that once we have superintelligent computers, day-to-day life could fundamentally change, affecting work, governance and the pace of scientific discovery.

But many experts are skeptical about how close we are to an AI-powered utopia and the practical utility of AGI. There’s limited agreement about what AGI means, and no clear way to measure it. Some argue that AGI functions as little more than a marketing term, offering no concrete guidance on how to best use AI models or their societal impact.

In tech companies’ quest for AGI, the public is tasked with navigating a landscape filled with marketing hype, science fiction and actual science, says Ben Recht, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It becomes very tricky. That’s where we get stuck.” Continuing to focus on claims of imminent AGI, he says, could muddle our understanding of the technology at hand and obscure AI’s current societal effects.

The definition of AGI is unclear

The term “artificial general intelligence” was coined in the mid-20th century. Initially, it denoted an autonomous computer capable of performing any task a human could, including physical activities like making a cup of coffee or fixing a car.

But as advancements in robotics lagged behind the rapid progress of computing, most in the AI field shifted to narrower definitions of AGI: Initially, this included AI systems that could autonomously perform tasks a human could at a computer, and more recently, machines capable of executing most of only the “economically valuable” tasks a human could handle at a computer, such as coding and writing accurate prose. Others think AGI should encompass flexible reasoning ability and autonomy when tackling a number of unspecified tasks.

“The problem is that we don’t know what we want,” says Arseny Moskvichev, a machine learning engineer at Advanced Micro Devices and computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute. “Because the goal is so poorly defined, there’s also no roadmap for reaching it, nor reliable way to identify it.”

To address this uncertainty, researchers have been developing benchmark tests, similar to student exams, to evaluate how close systems are to achieving AGI.

For example, in 2019, French computer scientist and former Google engineer Francois Chollet released the Abstract Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence, or ARC-AGI. In this test, an AI model is repeatedly given some examples of colored squares arranged in different patterns on a grid. For each example set, the model is then asked to generate a new grid to complete the visual pattern, a task intended to assess flexible reasoning and the model’s ability to acquire new skills outside of its training. This setup is similar to Raven’s Progressive Matrices, a test of human reasoning.

The test results are part of what OpenAI and other tech companies use to guide model development and assessment. Recently, OpenAI’s soon-to-be released o3 model achieved vast improvement on ARC-AGI compared to previous AI models, leading some researchers to view it as a breakthrough in AGI. Others disagree.

“There’s nothing about ARC that’s general. It’s so specific and weird,” Recht says.

Computer scientist José Hernández-Orallo of the Universitat Politécnica de València in Spain says that it’s possible ARC-AGI just assesses a model’s ability to recognize images. Previous generations of language models could solve similar problems with high accuracy if the visual grids were described using text, he says. That context makes o3’s results seem less novel.

Plus, there’s a limited number of grid configurations, and some AI models with tons of computing power at their disposal can “brute force” their way to correct responses simply by generating all possible answers and selecting the one that fits best — effectively reducing the task to a multiple-choice problem rather than one of novel reasoning.

To tackle each ARC-AGI task, o3 uses an enormous amount of computing power (and money) at test time. Operating in an efficient mode, it costs about $30 per task, Chollet says. In a less-efficient setting, one task can cost about $3,000. Just because the model can solve the problem doesn’t mean it’s practical or feasible to routinely use it on similarly challenging tasks.

AI tests don’t capture real-world complexity

It’s not just ARC-AGI that’s contentious. Determining whether an AI model counts as AGI is complicated by the fact that every available test of AI ability is flawed. Just as Raven’s Progressive Matrices and other IQ tests are imperfect measures of human intelligence and face constant criticism for their biases, so too do AGI evaluations, says Amelia Hardy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. “It’s really hard to know that we’re measuring [what] we care about.”

Open AI’s o3, for example, correctly responded to more than a quarter of the questions in a collection of exceptionally difficult problems called the Frontier Math benchmark, says company spokesperson Lindsay McCallum. These problems take professional mathematicians hours to solve, according to the benchmark’s creators. On its face, o3 seems successful. But this success may be partly due to OpenAI funding the benchmark’s development and having access to the testing dataset while developing o3. Such data contamination is a continual difficulty in assessing AI models, especially for AGI, where the ability to generalize and abstract beyond training data is considered crucial.

AI models can also seem to perform very well on complex tasks, like accurately responding to Ph.D.-level science questions, while failing on more basic ones, like counting the number of r’s in “strawberry.” This discrepancy indicates a fundamental misalignment in how these computer systems process queries and understand problems.

Yet, AI developers aren’t collecting and sharing the sort of information that might help researchers better gauge why, Hernández-Orallo says. Many developers provide only a single accuracy value for each benchmark, as opposed to a detailed breakdown of which types of questions a model answered correctly and incorrectly. Without additional detail, it’s impossible to determine where a model is struggling, why it’s succeeding, or if any single test result demonstrates a breakthrough in machine intelligence, experts say.



Even if a model passes a specific, quantifiable test with flying colors, such as the bar exam or medical boards, there are few guarantees that those results will translate to expert-level human performance in messy, real-world conditions, says David Rein, a computer scientist at the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research based in Berkeley, Calif.

For instance, when asked to write legal briefs, generative AI models still routinely fabricate information. Although one study of GPT-4 suggested that the chatbot could outperform human physicians in diagnosing patients, more detailed research has found that comparable AI models perform far worse than actual doctors when faced with tests that mimic real-world conditions. And no study or benchmark result indicates that current AI models should be making major governance decisions over expert humans.

The benchmarks that OpenAI, DeepSeek and other companies report results from “do not tell us much about capabilities in the real world,” Rein says, although they can provide reasonable information for comparing models to one another.

So far, researchers have tested AI models largely by providing them with discrete problems that have known answers. However, humans don’t always have the luxury of knowing what the problem before them is, whether it’s solvable or in what time frame. People can identify key problems, prioritize tasks and, crucially, know when to give up. It’s not yet clear that machines can or do. The most advanced “autonomous” agents struggle to navigate ordering pizza or groceries online.

General intelligence doesn’t dictate impact

Large language models and neural networks have improved dramatically in recent months and years. “They’re definitely useful in a lot of different ways,” Recht says, pointing to the ability of newer models to summarize and digest data or produce serviceable computer code with few mistakes. But attempts like ARC-AGI to measure general ability don’t necessarily clarify what AI models can and can’t be used for. “I don’t think it matters whether or not they’re artificially generally intelligent,” he says.



What might matter far more, based on the recent DeepSeek news, is traditional metrics of cost per task. Utility is determined by both the quality of a tool and whether that tool is affordable enough to scale. Intelligence is only part of the equation.

AGI is supposed to serve as a guiding light for AI developers. If achieved, it’s meant to herald a major turning point for society, beyond which machines will function independently on equal or higher footing than humans. But so far, AI has had major societal impacts, both good and bad, without any consensus on whether we’re nearing (or have already surpassed) this turning point, Recht, Hernández-Orallo and Hardy say.

For example, scientists are using AI tools to create new, potentially lifesaving molecules. Yet in classrooms worldwide, generative chatbots have disrupted assessments. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more and more U.S. teens are outsourcing assignments to ChatGPT. And a 2023 study in Nature reported that growing AI assistance in university courses has made cheating harder to detect.

To say that AI will become transformative once we reach AGI ignores all the trees for the forest.",sciencenews

https://livescience.com,Evidence for Stephen Hawking's unproven black hole theory may have just been found — at the bottom of the sea,https://www.livescience.com/space/black-holes/evidence-for-stephen-hawkings-unproven-black-hole-theory-may-have-just-been-found-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:29:33 GMT","An illustration of ""Hawking radiation"" leaking out of a black hole. New research into the origins of an incredibly powerful particle detected on Earth could pave the way to proving some of Hawking's major black hole theories correct.

Five decades ago, famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking theorized that the Big Bang may have flooded the universe with tiny black holes. Now, researchers believe they may have seen one explode.

In Feb. 2025, the European collaboration KM3NeT — which consists of underwater detectors off the coasts of France, Italy and Greece — announced the discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino . This ghostly particle had an energy of around 100 PeV — over 25 times more energetic than the particles accelerated in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful atom smasher.

Physicists have struggled to come up with an explanation for such an energetic neutrino. But now, a team of researchers who were not involved in the original detection have proposed a surprising hypothesis: The neutrino is the signature of an evaporating black hole . The team described their proposal in a paper that was uploaded to the arXiv database and has not been peer-reviewed yet.

Hawking's elephant-size black holes

In the 1970s, Hawking realized that black holes aren't entirely black. Instead, through complex interactions between the black hole event horizon and the quantum fields of space-time, they can emit a slow-but-steady stream of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This means black holes evaporate and eventually disappear. In fact, as the black hole gets smaller, it emits even more radiation, until it essentially explodes in a firestorm of high-energy particles and radiation — like the neutrino spotted by the KM3Net collaboration.

Related: Stephen Hawking's black hole radiation paradox could finally be solved — if black holes aren't what they seem

But all known black holes are very large — at least a few times the mass of the sun, and often significantly larger . It will take well over 10^100 years for even the smallest known black holes to die. If the KM3NeT neutrino is due to an exploding black hole, it has to be much smaller — somewhere around 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms). That's about as heavy as two fully grown African elephants, compressed into a black hole smaller than an atom.

The only known potential way to produce such tiny black holes is in the chaotic events of the early Big Bang, which may have flooded the cosmos with ""primordial"" black holes . The smallest primordial black holes produced in the Big Bang would have exploded long ago, while larger ones might persist to the present day.

Unfortunately, a 22,000-pound black hole should not survive all the way from the Big Bang to the present day. But the authors pointed out that there might be an additional quantum mechanism — known as ""memory burden"" — that allows black holes to resist decay. This would allow a 22,000-pound black hole to survive for billions of years before it finally exploded, sending a high-energy neutrino toward Earth in the process.

Primordial black holes might be an explanation for dark matter — the invisible substance that accounts for most of the matter in the universe — but so far, searches for them have turned up empty. This new insight may provide an intriguing clue. The researchers found that if primordial black holes of this mass range are abundant enough to account for all the dark matter, they should be exploding somewhat regularly. They estimated that if this hypothesis is correct, the KM3NeT collaboration should see another showstopping neutrino in the next few years.

If that detection happens, then we may just have to radically rethink the way we approach dark matter, high-energy neutrinos and even the physics of the early universe.",livescience
https://livescience.com,The universe's water is billions of years older than scientists thought — and may be nearly as old as the Big Bang itself,https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/the-universes-water-is-billions-of-years-older-than-scientists-thought-and-may-be-nearly-as-old-as-the-big-bang-itself,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:44:20 GMT","An illustration of a watery planet in the early universe. New research suggests that the first water molecules in space may have formed billions of years earlier than previously predicted.

Water may have emerged in the universe far earlier than scientists thought — and it could mean that life could be billions of years older too, new research suggests.

Water is one of the most essential ingredients for life as we know it. But exactly when water first appeared has been a question of scientific interest for decades.

Now, new research suggests that water likely existed 100 million to 200 million years after the Big Bang — billions of years earlier than scientists previously predicted. The research was published March 3 in the journal Nature Astronomy .

The early universe was dry because it was mainly filled with very simple elements, like hydrogen, helium and lithium. Heavier elements didn't develop until the first stars formed, burnt through their fuel supplies and ultimately exploded. Such stellar explosions, known as supernovas, acted like pressure cookers that combined lighter elements into increasingly heavier ones.

""Oxygen, forged in the hearts of these supernovae, combined with hydrogen to form water, paving the way for the creation of the essential elements needed for life,"" study co-author Daniel Whalen , an astrophysicist at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K., said in a statement .

To determine when water first appeared, the researchers examined the most ancient supernovas, called Population III supernovas. Whalen and his team looked at models of two types of these early star remnants: core-collapse supernovas, when a large star collapses under its own mass; and pair-instability supernovas, when a star's interior pressure suddenly drops, causing a partial collapse.

The researchers found that shortly after the Big Bang, both supernova types produced dense clumps of gas that likely contained water.

Overall, the amount of water in these gas clouds was probably pretty small — but it was concentrated in the areas where planets and stars were most likely to form, the team found.

https://livescience.com,Scientists discover giant blobs deep inside Earth are 'evolving by themselves' — and we may finally know where they come from,https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/scientists-discover-giant-blobs-deep-inside-earth-are-evolving-by-themselves-and-we-may-finally-know-where-they-come-from,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:41:24 GMT","Two enormous blobs deep inside Earth appear to be the remnants of oceanic crust that was pushed down into the mantle.

We finally know where two giant blobs in Earth's middle layer came from — and they're a mismatched pair.

These strange regions in Earth's mantle, known as ""large low velocity provinces"" (LLVPs), are actually chunks of Earth's crust that have sunk into the mantle over the past billion years, new research suggests.

Scientists have long known that there are LLVPs — one below the Pacific Ocean and the other below Africa. In these regions, seismic waves from earthquakes travel 1% to 3% more slowly than they do in the rest of the mantle. Scientists believe they may affect the planet's magnetic field because of the way they influence heat flow from Earth's core.

There's a lot of debate about what LLVPs are. Some studies have suggested that they're material from the ancient Earth — either a layer of primordial unmixed rock from the planet's formation or a leftover hunk of the giant space rock that hit Earth 4.5 billion years ago, forming the moon.

Others have suggested that the blobs are huge chunks of oceanic crust that were pushed into the mantle when one tectonic plate slipped under another — a process known as subduction.

The crust hypothesis had not been subject to as many studies as the ancient-material idea, said James Panton , a geodynamicist at Cardiff University in the U.K. In a new study, published Feb. 6 in the journal Scientific Reports , he and his colleagues used computer modeling to determine where subducted crust entered the mantle over the past billion years and to find out whether that subducted crust could form features similar to the LLVPs.

""We found that the recycling of the oceanic crust can indeed generate these LLVP-like regions beneath the Pacific and Africa without the need for a primordial dense layer at the base of the mantle,"" Panton told Live Science. ""They are evolving by themselves, simply through the process of subduction of oceanic crust.""

That doesn't mean there isn't dense material from Earth's youth at the bottom of the mantle, Panton said; there may be a thin layer of ancient material that contributes to the LLVPs as well. But if subduction alone can explain the LLVPs, that could hint at their age.

""That potentially means that shortly after we started having subduction on Earth, then maybe that's when we started to have LLVPs,"" Panton said. (The advent of subduction is itself a complicated question. Some scientists think it began more than 4 billion years ago, while others think it started around a billion years ago.)

The subduction process has resulted in two different types of blobs, the authors said in the study. The LLVP under Africa doesn't get as much crustal material currently as the LLVP under the Pacific, which is fed by the subduction zones of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a horseshoe-shaped line of subduction that circles the Pacific Ocean.

The African LLVP is thus older and better mixed with the rest of the crust, the team said. It also has less of a volcanic rock called basalt, which means it is less dense than the Pacific LLVP. This may explain why the African LLVP extends 342 miles (550 kilometers) higher in the mantle than the Pacific LLVP.

One question for the future, Panton said, is how hot regions of the mantle called mantle plumes may help drive the subduction process in the Pacific and influence the LLVPs. These plumes stretch from the very bottom of the mantle to volcanic hotspots at the surface, such as the Hawaiian islands.

In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the United States following a successful, national vaccination program — transmission of the disease had ceased within America , but even now, measles has yet to be eradicated worldwide. The continued spread of measles in other countries and lapses in America's vaccination rates leaves the country vulnerable to outbreaks like the one happening in Texas right now. The ongoing outbreak has so far claimed two lives , with cases increasing due to the incredibly high transmissibility of measles and low vaccination rates in the affected areas.

In this adapted excerpt from his book Booster Shots (Penguin Random House, 2025), pediatrician and infectious disease specialist Dr. Adam Ratner looks at a historical measles outbreak in Texarkana, a city at the border of Texas and Arkansas. In the outbreak, the side of the state line people happened to live on determined their fate.

True to its name, Texarkana straddles the border between the states of Texas and Arkansas. In the 1960s, about two-thirds of the population lived in the part of the city that was in Bowie County, Texas, with the remainder residing in Miller County, Arkansas. The division did not generally affect the day-to-day workings of the city, with residents of both counties attending the same local businesses, churches, and events.

However, separate public schools and public health departments were maintained on either side of the state line. Texarkana was a natural laboratory to understand how policy choices could dictate health.

In late June 1970, a 5-year-old Texarkana boy who had traveled out of the area was diagnosed with measles. He represented the first recognized case in an outbreak that would last more than six months and involve more than 600 people, mostly children. That isn't the remarkable part — measles outbreaks were becoming more frequent everywhere.

What made Texarkana different is that State Line Avenue separated two jurisdictions with quite different approaches to measles vaccination. Texas had no requirement for measles vaccination prior to school entry and generally eschewed mass vaccination campaigns.

Fewer than 60% of 1- to 9-year-olds on the Texas side were immune to measles either through vaccination or prior illness. In contrast, Arkansas maintained a school mandate and had held mass immunization campaigns for preschool- and school-aged children in each of the two years prior to the outbreak. An estimated 95% of their 1- to 9-year-olds were immune.

The result was striking. A political division, not a physical one, determined who got measles and who didn't. Of the 633 Texarkana measles cases, 606 (nearly 96% of the total) occurred in people who resided in the Texas portion of the city. This disparity in rates occurred despite significant contact between residents from the two sides. The messages were clear — vaccination had protected children who happened to reside on the Arkansas side of town, and community campaigns and school mandates were highly effective in preventing measles spread.

The Texarkana story is frequently cited in public health circles and is used as a teaching case for students of epidemiology. The lesson that is sometimes missed is that in addition to showing that vaccination protects against disease, the Texarkana measles outbreak also provides a stark reminder that political decisions about funding for public health, acceptability of school mandates, and myriad other issues can have real and lasting effects on the health of populations.

Today, Texarkana's unusual geographic and political arrangement continues to instruct us about the deeply intertwined nature of politics and health. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as Obamacare), which was passed in 2010, states were required to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with coverage going into effect in 2014.

A 2012 Supreme Court decision (National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius) made states' acceptance of the ACA's Medicaid expansion funds optional rather than mandatory. Arkansas accepted Medicaid expansion; Texas did not. Jonathan M. Metzl , author of "" Dying of Whiteness ,"" has chronicled how states' political decisions, including accepting or refusing Medicaid expansion, can change the health — and even alter the life expectancy — of its citizens. It is hard to imagine a place where that line is so sharply drawn as in Texarkana.

A 2023 report from Public Health Watch [a nonprofit news organization] detailed a ""widening divide in health care access"" between the two sides of Texarkana on the basis of those decisions. Despite the demographic similarities between the Texas and Arkansas sides of the city, after nine years of Medicaid expansion, the differences were stark. More non-elderly adults uninsured, more hospitalizations for life-threatening conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, worse access to care — these are the legacy of Texas's refusal to accept the ACA's Medicaid expansion.

Just as the 1970 measles outbreak made clear, in Texarkana, living on the wrong side of State Line Avenue can be hazardous to your health.

https://livescience.com,East Asians who can digest lactose can thank Neanderthal genes,https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/east-asians-who-can-digest-lactose-can-thank-neanderthal-genes,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:06:26 GMT","A new genetic analysis suggests that 1 in 4 East Asian people carry a version of the lactase gene that differs from the gene variants carried by European and African populations. This gene variant may have been inherited from Neanderthals.

A large proportion of East Asian people carry unique versions of the lactase gene that enables humans to digest the sugars in milk, new research hints.

These genetic variants were likely inherited from humans' extinct cousins, the Neanderthals , tens of thousands of years ago, according to a study published Mar. 10 in the journal PNAS . And it may be that the variants offered an evolutionary advantage by helping early hunter-gatherers thwart infections, new data suggest.

In some people of European or African descent , the lactase gene helps carriers digest a sugar called lactose in milk after they're weaned off of breast milk; this phenomenon is known as ""lactase persistence."" Many people who carry alternative versions of the gene can't continue breaking down lactose after infancy, so they become lactose intolerant .

The versions of the lactase gene behind lactase persistence are believed to have emerged in populations in Europe and Africa between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago , around the same time humans on these continents began rearing animals and consuming their milk.

Related: Papua New Guineans, genetically isolated for 50,000 years, carry Denisovan genes that help their immune system, study suggests

This has led scientists to theorize that the lactose-tolerance variants were selected for within these populations, meaning they became more common over the course of evolution because they offered an advantage. In this case, they may have increased survival rates by allowing adults to absorb nutrients from milk.

However, until now, little was known about the genetic mechanisms behind lactase persistence and lactose intolerance in East Asians. About 65% of adults worldwide are thought to be lactose intolerant, but this figure rises to between 70% and 100% in East Asian populations.

In the new study, scientists compared thousands of genomes sampled from modern humans, including those with East Asian, European or African ancestry. The data came from individuals in a range of countries, such as China, Japan, Spain, Italy and Nigeria.

The analysis revealed that around 25% of the people with East Asian ancestry carried versions of the lactase gene that are not found within the European or African populations. That's around the same proportion of people who have lactase persistence in East Asian populations. These genetic variants trigger an increase in the activity of the lactase gene in the body, the researchers found.

At first glance, this suggests that these genetic variants may have also been selected for during evolution for dietary reasons, the researchers said. However, further analyses in the same study revealed that this may not have been the case.

Indeed, the researchers went on to compare samples of East Asian genomes with the genome of a Neanderthal who lived in the Altai Mountains in Siberia around 120,000 years ago . This led them to discover that the East Asian variants of the lactase gene were likely inherited by hunter-gatherers from Neanderthals as a result of interbreeding events between the two groups.

Neanderthals and Homo sapiens are known to have interbred on multiple occasions over the millennia . This happened after both species came into contact with one another following the migration of the latter group out of Africa into Eurasia, possibly up to 250,000 years ago .

The new results suggest that the lactose-intolerance variants started being selected for between 25,000 and 28,000 years ago — more than 10,000 years before dairy culture emerged in the Altai Mountain region .

In other words, the variants emerged before people in the region started regularly consuming milk. This suggests that the selective pressure on these variants was not related to improving people's ability to digest lactose.

To figure out what other advantages these variants might offer, the team scoured a database chronicling gene activity in different cells. They discovered that the lactase gene variants seen in East Asian people altered the activity of three genes in immune cells, causing them to expand in number.

Based on this result, the study authors think it's possible that these variants were selected for because they somehow enhanced the ability of East Asian hunter-gatherers to combat infections.

""Neanderthals — having inhabited Eurasia for approximately 400,000 years — likely carried alleles [genetic variants] adapted to local pathogens and environmental challenges,"" study co-author Shuhua Xu , a professor of human population genetics at Fudan University in China, told Live Science in an email.

Taken together, the findings imply that variants of the lactase gene may have been selected for different reasons across the world, the researchers concluded. These findings may prompt scientists to question why selection of the lactase gene occurred in European and African populations, they added; perhaps the answer isn't solely about drinking milk.",livescience

Tornadoes are narrow, rapidly rotating columns of air that stretch from clouds down to the ground during a thunderstorm. They are among the most violent storms on Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory .

Scientists categorize a tornado's strength using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which ranges from EF0 to EF5. The Florida tornado was EF2, meaning winds of 111 to 135 mph (179 to 217 km/h). For context, the most powerful EF5 tornadoes have winds of more than 200 mph (322 km/h). The last twister to reach EF5 was the 2013 Moore tornado , which killed 24 people and devastated the city of Moore in Oklahoma.

More tornadoes could hit the central and southeastern U.S. later this week. A powerful storm is expected to sweep across the country from west to east, with a risk of severe thunderstorms that could spawn tornadoes in 12 states, including Florida, on Friday and Saturday (March 14 to 15), according to a statement released by AccuWeather.

This breakthrough represents a performance increase of 100 times or more compared to leading spy cameras and traditional telescopes, according to a report on the new technology in the South China Morning Post .

Amongst a broad gamut of potential applications, the technology could allow operators to surveil foreign satellites to a previously impossible level of detail. The researchers at China’s Academy of Sciences’ Aerospace Information Research Institute outlined their findings in a new study published in the Chinese Journal of Lasers (Issue 52, Volume 3).

According to the South China Morning Post , the scientists conducted a test across Qinghai Lake in the northwest of the country with a new system based on synthetic aperture lidar (SAL), a type of laser radar capable of constructing two-dimensional or three-dimensional images.

How this new powerful spy satellite works

SAL relies on the motion of an object (like a satellite) to provide finer resolution images than other, beam-scanning radar imagery systems. Previous SAR systems have relied on microwave radiation, which has longer wavelengths, which results in lower resolution images.

However, this new system operates at optical wavelengths, which have much shorter wavelengths than microwaves and produce clearer images (though microwaves are better for penetrating into materials, because their longer wavelengths aren’t scattered or absorbed as easily).

During the test, which targeted arrays of reflective prisms placed 63.3 miles (101.8 km) away from the lidar system, the device detected details as small as 0.07 inches (1.7 millimeters) and measured distances to within 0.61 inches (15.6 mm).

This is a huge leap forward from previous milestones, like a 2011 test conducted by defense firm Lockheed Martin that was able to achieve an azimuth resolution of 0.79 inches (2 centimeters) from only 1 mile (1.6 km) away, or a Chinese test where scientists achieved a then-best 1.97 inch (5 cm) resolution at a distance of 4.3 miles (6.9 km).

To achieve this latest breakthrough, the Chinese team split the laser-beam driving the lidar system across a 4x4 micro-lens array, which in turn expanded the system’s optical aperture — the opening that controls the amount of light entering a camera system — from 0.68 to 2.71 inches (17.2 mm to 68.8 mm). In this way, researchers could bypass the tradeoff of field of vision versus size of aperture, which has historically restricted such camera systems.

It’s important to note that testing took place during near perfect weather and atmospheric conditions with steady wind and limited cloud cover. Inclement weather or other impairments to visibility could significantly impact the system’s precision and reliability.",livescience

This unusual image shows a large plume of discolored water rising toward the Pacific Ocean's surface from the Kavachi volcano, also known as ""sharkcano,"" during an undersea eruption.

Kavachi is a submarine volcano that is part of the Solomon Islands, around 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Vangunu Island. Its peak stands roughly 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above the seafloor and lies just 65 feet (20 m) below the waves. The volcano is named after the sea god of the Vangunu people and is also referred to as ""Rejo te Kvachi,"" or ""Kavachi’s Oven,"" according to NASA's Earth Observatory .

In 2015, a research expedition discovered multiple scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) living within the volcano's central crater. The surprising presence of the oceanic predators at the volcano raised ""new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals exist,"" the researchers wrote.

It is unclear whether any of the sharks at Kavachi were hurt by the outburst that triggered the plume in the image or if they were able to sense the incoming eruption and evacuate the crater.

The image was first released in May 2022 by NASA Goddard on the social media platform X along with the caption: ""You’ve heard of sharknado, now get ready for sharkcano.""

Before then, the volcano's most recent major eruptions were in 2016, 2014, 2007 and 2003. In the past, researchers also sighted ephemeral islands up to half a mile (1 km) wide being birthed by the eruptions and then sinking. A similar ghostly landmass recently emerged after an undersea volcano in Japan blew its top in 2023.

Explosive plumes

Kavachi experiences ""phreatomagmatic eruptions,"" which occur when magma meets water and ejects steam, ash, volcanic rock fragments and chunks of magma known as ""incandescent bombs,"" according to the Earth Observatory.

A study conducted in the wake of the 2007 eruption found that the volcanic plumes are made of warm, acidic water that also contains particulate matter and sulfur, which ""attracts microbial communities that thrive on [the chemicals],"" the researchers wrote.

The volcano can also launch jets of heated water without any visible plumes or other signs of erupting.

Residents of neighboring islands have frequently reported that they regularly see steam and ash on the water's surface between eruptions, further confirming that the so-called sharkcano is percolating beneath the surface.",livescience

You try to pour some ranch dressing onto your plate to dip your veggies into. You tip the container upside down, but nothing comes out. Seems like a solid.

So you shake the bottle up and down, and a big blob of dressing plops out and hits your plate. Seems like a liquid.

But the dressing doesn't spread all over the plate, like milk or any other liquid would if you spilled it. Rather, it maintains some shape, kind of like the veggies on your plate. Seems like a solid.

But every time you plunge your solid carrot or celery into the blob of dressing, it distorts the shape of the blob a bit. You can even smear and spread the blob around, but the shape and stiffness of the celery isn't affected by this game. Seems like a liquid.

So, is ranch dressing a liquid and a solid? Or is it neither?

I'm a professor of physics and biophysics , and my research focuses on understanding squishy materials that have both liquid and solid properties. Physicists call these materials soft matter. In my lab , we investigate what makes biological materials such as skin and snot squishy — and how we can create bio-inspired materials that have the same fascinating properties. I also host a social media channel, Physics Mama , where my two boys and I ask and answer questions about the physics of everyday life.

The basic states of matter

To figure out what's going on with ranch dressing, you need to understand what the different states of matter are and what makes each one unique. ""Matter"" is just the scientific word for ""stuff,"" and it is anything that is made up of the microscopic building blocks called atoms and that has mass .

You probably learned in school that there are three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Think ice cube, a puddle of water and fog. Maybe you also learned about a fourth state, known as plasma .

These different states are defined by how the extremely tiny molecules making up the matter interact with each other . These molecules are so small that you can't see them with your naked eye. But their invisible interactions determine the properties of the materials that you can see.

Molecules in a solid are physically attached to each other in a way that keeps them from moving around relative to each other. This is what makes solids rigid and able to keep a fixed shape.

The molecules in a liquid, on the other hand, are not connected to each other. They can move around, slide past each other and mix themselves up. This freedom of movement is what allows a liquid to take the shape of whatever container it is in.

The molecules in a gas are completely free to move around without really bumping into the other molecules in the gas too much. Like a liquid, a gas will take the shape of any container it is in and has no fixed shape. But unlike liquids and solids, gases can also change their size or volume.

A plasma is similar to a gas but has much more energy. This energy causes the electrically charged parts of the molecules, called protons and electrons, to break apart. The Sun and stars are examples of plasma, as is the material that makes neon signs glow .

Elasticity and viscosity

While solids hold their shape, they are not completely rigid. The connections between the molecules behave like tiny springs, which makes solids elastic . If you push on a solid, it will deform — but it will bounce back to its original state when you stop pushing, kind of like your mattress when you bounce on your bed. Of course, this happens at the molecular level, so you can't see it happening.

And even though liquids easily change shape, they do resist this change due to the friction between the liquid molecules as they try to move past each other. This friction is called viscosity . Liquids such as honey or syrup are much more viscous than liquids such as milk or water, making them harder to stir. Imagine trying to swim in a swimming pool of honey — delicious but difficult.

A fifth state

Ranch dressing is actually a fifth state of matter known as soft matter. Soft matter can have properties of both liquids and solids, so materials scientists say it is viscoelastic — a combination of viscous and elastic . Other common examples of soft matter include yogurt, cookie dough, shampoo, toothpaste, silly putty, snot, slime and frosting .

A post shared by Rae Robertson Anderson (@physics_mama) A photo posted by on

These substances aren't quite solid and aren't quite liquid — they're a little of both. You can pour shampoo out of a bottle, but if you put a bit between your fingers and pull them apart, it will stretch between your fingers. Cookie dough can hold its own shape, but if you push on it, it deforms and doesn't bounce back.

Many viscoelastic materials exhibit shear thinning , which means that their viscosity decreases the more you agitate them. This is why shaking your bottle of ranch dressing or ketchup allows you to pour it out — even though before shaking it was too solid-like to leave the bottle. It's also why yogurt that seems quite solid and able to maintain its shape becomes more liquid-like when you stir it quickly.

Squishy materials can also exhibit shear thickening — they become more rigid the harder you try to deform them. This is how Oobleck, a simple mixture of cornstarch and water , works. You can slowly pour it and submerge your hand in it, like any other liquid, but if you squeeze it or shake it up it solidifies.

(Image credit: Pawel Kajak via Getty Images)

A different kind of molecule

The reason these squishy materials have both liquid and solid properties is that they're made of polymers : long, chainlike molecules. These long chains get all tangled up, like a bowl of spaghetti , so they are sort of connected, like the molecules in a solid, but also sort of free to move past one other, like molecules in a liquid.

Most store-bought ranch dressing contains xantham gum, which is a natural polymer used to thicken and stabilize many foods.

So the next time you try to pour your ranch dressing out of the bottle, you can imagine the xantham gum polymers all tangled up with one another, making the dressing act like a solid. When you shake the bottle, you're disentangling the polymers so they slide and flow past each other, allowing the dressing to flow easily out of the bottle and onto your plate.

Often referred to as the ""holy grail"" of solar power , perovskite cells offer a lightweight alternative to traditional silicon-based solar technology. Their flexible structure enables them to be applied to cars and phones in the form of a printable layer so they can charge on the go.

Sounds too good to be true? So far, you're right. Perovskites come with some major flaws. Notably, they degrade quickly due to chemical reactions with moisture in the air that make them leak iodine.

But now, a team of researchers has found a solution to this problem. By embedding nanoparticles within the perovskites, they produced a new cell that lasts for 1,530 hours, a near-tenfold increase on previous perovskite solar cell designs. The researchers published their findings Feb. 20 in the journal EES Solar .

""By addressing these common challenges we see with perovskite solar technology, our research blows the doors wide open for cheaper, more efficient and more widely accessible solar power,"" study co-author Imalka Jayawardena , an engineering researcher at the University of Surrey's Advanced Technology Institute in the U.K., said in a statement . ""What we've achieved here is a critical step toward developing high-performance solar cells that can withstand real-world conditions — bringing us closer to their commercial use at a global scale.""

Solar power surge

As the fastest-growing and cheapest form of renewable energy, solar power is key to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But the technology's growth is hampered by its reliance on silicon, a finite and non-renewable resource that, in its purest form, is costly to produce.

To get around this bottleneck, scientists have looked to develop perovskite alternatives — synthetic versions of naturally occurring calcium titanium oxide crystals that can be made at a fraction of the cost. But unlike pure silicon cells, which can last for decades, solar cells made from perovskite only last for 100 or so hours, drastically limiting their utility.

In the new study, the scientists looked for a way to trap the iodine that leaks from perovskites. Their solution was to embed tiny nanoparticles of aluminum oxide within the cells as they were manufactured. This not only prevented the iodine from leaking but also created a more uniform and electrically conductive structure.

After testing these cells under extreme heat and humidity, the researchers found that the modified cells maintained a high performance for more than two months (1,530 hours), a significant improvement on the 160-hour lifespan of unenhanced perovskite cells.

The researchers plan to continue investigating their new technique to see if these gains can be built upon further.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Sending nudes but no first kisses: teenagers’ relationships during the pandemic,https://theconversation.com/sending-nudes-but-no-first-kisses-teenagers-relationships-during-the-pandemic-251875,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:18 GMT","Five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term effects of lockdown on education, mental health and social life are still being reckoned with. But for teenagers and young adults, one of the most profound – and often overlooked – impacts was on their romantic relationships.

At an age when in-person socialising, dating and sexual exploration are crucial for development, young people found themselves suddenly confined to their homes, cut off from their peers and reliant on screens for connection.

Over 2021 and 2022 I carried out a study, along with a colleague, in which we spoke with 38 young adults aged 18 to 25, and 80 adolescents at secondary school and sixth forms to explore how lockdown had affected their romantic relationships.

One 18-year-old captured the experience succinctly. “It was weird. Normally, you’d just meet people, talk, see how things go. But suddenly, everything had to be so intentional, so digital. It wasn’t the same.”

Our findings revealed more than just a temporary disruption. Lockdown exposed fundamental truths about the role of relationships in young people’s lives. While digital technology enabled connection, it could not fully replace in-person intimacy, often intensifying existing relationship dynamics rather than transforming them.

The constraints of lockdown also exposed the emotional, psychological and social work young people do to sustain, develop and sometimes end relationships – a process usually taken for granted.

More critically, the findings are a reminder of why in-person interpersonal life is so vital: not just for romantic or sexual development, but for identity, autonomy and emotional wellbeing.

Adolescence and young adulthood are critical periods for developing relationship skills, testing boundaries and forming identity. This was interrupted by lockdown. It stripped young people of spontaneous, embodied encounters – those fleeting, unplanned moments that form the foundation of relationships.

Physical cues such as body language, tone of voice and touch are crucial in building trust and intimacy. These were largely absent in a world mediated through screens.

Pandemic ghosting

For some, the absence of social scrutiny provided a welcome relief. Teenagers, in particular, described how lockdown gave them the space to reflect on relationships away from the judgment of their peers.

However, this detachment also made relationships more disposable. Without shared spaces – school corridors, coffee shops, parties – relationships became easier to avoid rather than directly manage. Conflict could be ignored with a simple act of digital silence.

One teen explained how during lockdown, arguments and conflicts were easier to avoid: “you don’t have any interaction in person to sort things out”. Another said that “if people were annoyed or upset… they’d… just disappear.”

Others felt the weight of losing key rites of passage: first dates, first kisses, casual social interactions that naturally build connections. For those on the brink of forming new relationships, lockdown stalled romantic development entirely.

Some described emerging from the pandemic feeling unprepared for dating or intimacy. They lacked confidence in their ability to read social cues or navigate face-to-face conversations. One young person described returning to in-person socialising as requiring the “skill of just speaking to people… normally… I just found it like, what am I doing? So, I had to try and re-learn that.”

Digital intimacy

For many young people, technology was a lifeline for their relationships during isolation. Video calls, messaging apps and social media provided ways to maintain emotional connections.

However, this required more effort and conscious planning than in-person interactions, which some found unnatural or pressurising. Relationships became more performative. They required carefully curated responses and constant availability, rather than the easy, spontaneous flow of in-person interaction.

Some described how maintaining a relationship over text felt “all or nothing”. Without the casual reinforcement of everyday interactions, conversations often felt overly deep, forced or simply exhausting. Others found themselves trapped in relationships they might have otherwise drifted away from but felt obligated to sustain because, as one participant put it, “you’ve got nothing else to do.”

Young people described feeling obligated to be constantly available. They talked about how they ultimately had little to talk about and nothing to do. This meant ending up having empty and awkward conversations after a while, without a reasonable excuse not to participate.

The shift to digital also amplified the different vulnerabilities faced by young men and women, particularly in the realm of sexting and digital intimacy. Young women in particular reported increased pressure to send intimate images, as lockdown heightened expectations for virtual forms of connection. Some described engaging in unwanted image-sharing to maintain relationships. On the other hand, others found the period valuable for exploring intimacy digitally in ways that felt safe and empowering.

Despite the increased dependence on digital platforms, the young people we spoke to were clear: virtual interaction was no substitute for physical presence. Many expressed frustration at the limitations of digital connection, emphasising how much was lost when relationships lacked in-person spontaneity, playfulness and touch.

Lasting legacies

As we move forward, the legacy of lockdown may be twofold. On the one hand, digital tools will continue to play a key role in relationship maintenance. They have made long-distance intimacy and online connection more normal.

On the other hand, the collective yearning for in-person connection may reinforce the enduring value of physical presence. Many young people expressed a renewed appreciation for face-to-face interactions, recognising them as fundamental rather than optional.

For young people, the pandemic was not just about missing school or social events. It reshaped how they connect, love and negotiate intimacy. While digital technologies provided a stopgap, they could not replace the messy, unpredictable and deeply human experience of in-person relationships. One thing is clear. The social worlds of young people matter, and we must do more to protect and nurture them in times of crisis.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Europe may struggle to replace the military intelligence that Ukraine needs – but it has key strengths,https://theconversation.com/europe-may-struggle-to-replace-the-military-intelligence-that-ukraine-needs-but-it-has-key-strengths-251871,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:25 GMT","US intelligence has been an essential part of Ukraine’s defence for over a decade. Since the invasion of Crimea in 2014 the US has been supplying Kyiv with a continuous stream of electronic, satellite and human intelligence. This has been decisive in the war with Russia in providing warnings and in making Ukrainian attacks on the Russian military more effective.

If President Donald Trump were to return to pausing, or withdrawing US military intelligence from Kyiv, its depth and breadth will be very difficult to replace. Europe remains the most obvious source of replacement intelligence capabilities, but as yet cannot replace the US’s scale, speed and quality of military intelligence.

A US withdrawal of intelligence will leave Ukraine with less real-time intelligence about Russian military formations and movements. It will also reduce Kyiv’s targeting accuracy on the battlefield. Ukraine is likely to be exposed to more aerial attacks and heavier military and civilian casualties, because of receiving fewer warnings.

If Europe tries to replace the US’s intelligence contribution in Ukraine it will require a stark increase in funding from the UK and EU member states. More importantly, it will require a strong focus on coordination, and overcoming some European legal restrictions on sharing intelligence. These are aspects that will require more trust and political will than the EU (and UK) have been able to show before.

What could happen next?

Since Trump arrived in the White House, European nations have promised to offer more support to Ukraine militarily and are likely to increase their intelligence support for Ukraine. This will be an important signal to the US that Europe is not entirely reliant upon them.

However, Europe’s best intelligence efforts will still leave Ukraine disadvantaged in comparison to where it was under former president Joe Biden. This is due to the sheer scale of the US intelligence community. Its strengths include: information from informants, from communications, from imagery and from assessment about enemy capabilities.

The UK, France and Germany do have strength in battlefield communication and electronic intelligence. The UK operates the US-built RC-135 Rivet Joint intelligence aircraft to intercept Russian military communications and radar outputs from international airspace. France runs its satellite-based CERES interception programme, while Germany also routinely intercepts Russian communications. Other less capable European nations, on Russia’s borders, also maintain their own interception programmes.

Read more: What is the value of US security guarantees? Here's what history shows

European signals intelligence (information gathered from people communicating with each other) could partially replace the US on the Ukrainian battlefield, especially in the areas around the EU/Nato borders. But it will not deliver the same level of information from further afield. They can provide Ukraine with communications intercepts and electronic surveillance, but without the reach and speed of the US. The US is able to process intelligence fast as it has far more analysts.

Britain, France and Germany have considerable human networks (such as informants) in Russia, Ukraine and in other countries such as China and Iran, but not as many as the US outside those areas.

Problems caused by US withdrawal

Much of the west’s ability, when it comes to offering more support to Ukraine, is stymied by how closely its systems have been tied to, and are dependent upon, the US. For instance, the UK’s military intelligence community has relied on double checking with colleagues in the US, when gathering potentially useful information.

Satellite imagery and reconnaissance is an intelligence function that European nations can supply to Ukraine, but not on the scale of the US. France is a global leader in optical imaging via its Helios and CSO satellites, with additional access to high resolution commercial satellites.

But there are some clear areas where other western nations will be able to help. Europe has been able to provide Ukraine with access to commercial satellites quickly after US aerospace company Maxar suspended Ukrainian use.

Ukraine’s military intelligence agency (HUR) already shares a dedicated platform to analyse French satellite imagery . Germany and Italy have very capable satellite-based radar imaging systems and provide data from these to Ukraine.

While Europe lacks satellite-based infrared early-warning systems for missile launch detection (which only the US and Russia has) it does have powerful imaging resources to track ground developments.

But in intelligence analysis, one of the areas of advantage for the US is in part due to scale, but also due to computing advantages in the US to deploy big data and AI on intelligence questions. European partners rely heavily on the US for this capability which means that Ukraine will receive less real-time intelligence information and possibly lower quality intelligence assessments too.

Concerns about sharing information?

If the US fully withdraws from supplying Ukraine with intelligence, the Europeans will face coordination issues to gather together intelligence without the US as co-ordinator.

The longstanding integration of western intelligence (especially between US and UK through Nato) means Europe will have to overcome 70 years of institutional memory to create new working patterns if the US withdraws fully from sharing security information, or is no longer seen as a reliable partner. European and Canadian nervousness around sharing intelligence (and Australia and New Zealand, to a lesser extent) with Trump’s government will further complicate the western intelligence picture. However the situation will be to the advantage of Russia and China, who know that Ukraine is weakened by a lack of access to US information and support.

To improve their intelligence efforts, European, and other western nations which support Ukraine, will also need to increase their global collection of information. This is because, for example, weapons used by Russia in Ukraine have their origins in and transit from China, North Korea, and Iran.

Overall, the western allies, without the US, have a strong package of military intelligence but there are plenty of areas they are going to need to improve on, if the US is not going to play the leadership role it once had.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How the US threw out any concerns about AI safety within days of Donald Trump coming to office,https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-threw-out-any-concerns-about-ai-safety-within-days-of-donald-trump-coming-to-office-251659,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:36 GMT","The EU has a long-established reputation as a global standard setter, and as a reliable partner for international regulatory cooperation, especially in the digital field. But the second Trump administration is disrupting these dynamics.

In the last decade, several US big tech companies were scrutinised and sanctioned by EU data protection watchdogs for abusing customers’ personal data. Meanwhile, other nations have adopted digital regulations that are modelled on the EU’s GDPR. They reason that doing so will enhance privacy protections domestically while also strengthening their economic presence in the EU. The list of these countries keeps increasing, and includes countries traditionally operating on a protectionist agenda, such as China and Brazil.

The same had been true for artificial intelligence. Regulations on the development and use of AI drawn up under the presidency of Joe Biden signalled a degree of alignment with Brussels. The EU’s approach focuses on managing the risks stemming from AI – a goal that appeared to be seriously embraced by the US, too.

But shortly after arriving in office in January, Trump signed several executive orders “removing barriers to American leadership in artificial intelligence”. The Trump administration’s stated aim is to “achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance”. This includes a new stance on AI that concentrates exclusively on economic and competitiveness arguments. Concerns around the risks of that technology, which the EU framework puts at its core, are no longer even part of the conversation in the US.

Trump has also launched an investigation into the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) as part of a wider exercise to see if “remedial actions” (for which, read tariffs) are needed in response to the taxes and regulations levied at US tech companies. EU acts seek to combat concentrations and abuses of digital power and the risks of social media platforms. The US is flexing its muscles, while the EU is exposed to a form of regulatory blackmail.

These are but a few examples of the new US government’s remarkably deregulatory approach concerning digital issues, despite the increasing global consensus around the risks and perils in this field.

These developments in the US are concerning considering the numerous failings of AI technology and whistleblowers’ revelations about the harmful practices of online platforms. Trump’s administration is attempting to use a rethoric based on competitiveness as a magic wand to erase numerous scandals about social media and artificial intelligence, including algorithms that spread harmful content and fake news. From a user perspective, the exposure to unregulated social media and artificial systems equates to the absence of protection from profound individual and collective risks.

There may be various rationales for the strategy of breaking with existing laws and international partners. Reinforcing the US tech industry and establishing a leading position in AI development and production are certainly part of the equation. Yet Trump’s administration is also establishing a new techno-elite that shifts the relationship between big tech and politics in the US from one of influence to one of direct involvement. With X owner Elon Musk riding the wave of tech bro empowerment straight into a senior role in the White House, it is evident that the current US government aims to remove much needed guardrails for social media, online platforms and AI companies.

While the recent iterations of EU digital regulation are far from perfect, the US deregulation stance is conducive to disorder and chaos precisely due to the lack of legal standards and rules. As history teaches us, chaos allows abuses of power by the few and the weakening of the many.

These developments prompt questions on the future of cooperation between the EU and the US in the field of digital and tech regulation. The EU has made digital regulation a pillar of its regulation goals since 2020. As indicated in various declarations, the ethos of the EU digital strategy is rooted in the traditional balancing between market objectives and social protections. Economic goals are combined with European values such as respect of fundamental rights, consumer protection and fair competition.

The fallout

The geopolitics of digital regulation may push the EU towards an under-enforcement of its own digital rules so that it can continue to rely on US tech companies and avoid tariffs. The recent US executive orders may cause a chilling effect on the enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, or a potential lax application of the EU AI Act that requires developers of AI systems to respect a series of standards for their products to be lawfully marketed in the EU. Worryingly, some weeks ago the EU withdrew the proposed EU directive on AI liability, which introduced rules on how people could claim compensation for damages caused by AI systems.

Handing unfettered power to privately owned digital companies sits uneasily both with the European tradition of antitrust rules and consumer protection, as well as the values of EU constitutionalism that emerged in the aftermath of the second world war. The conquests of democracy and its values could be significantly eroded in a digital world that is becoming increasingly unequal. What is more, capitulation in the face of regulatory blackmail would equate to a relinquishment of global influence for the EU. The EU regulatory tradition and role as international standard-setter would be undermined were the EU to give in to US pressure.

Regardless of legal traditions and democratic values, any regulator should put people first when drawing up the rules that will govern the digital space – not the interests of a handful of tech companies. Jurisdictions that do not pursue policies ensuring a safe digital world for ordinary people are effectively declaring where their interests reside – not with the many but in the power and wealth of the few.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Iraqi Kurdistan faces a deepening economic crisis as unpaid wages pile up,https://theconversation.com/iraqi-kurdistan-faces-a-deepening-economic-crisis-as-unpaid-wages-pile-up-251550,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:48 GMT","Public sector workers in Iraqi Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, have endured irregular and delayed salary payments for more than a decade. Many of these people are owed staggering amounts of money – US$50,000 (£38,700) on average, and as much as US$120,000 for higher-level employees.

The region’s 6.5 million inhabitants have been caught in the middle of an unresolved political and financial conflict between the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq’s federal government in Baghdad. The conflict centres on disputes primarily over territorial control and oil revenues.

There are longstanding political tensions over Kurdish autonomy and governance in northern Iraq, particularly in disputed areas like oil-rich Kirkuk. The KRG held a referendum for independence in 2017, which was backed decisively by people living in northern Iraq. The electoral commission said 92% of the 3.3 million people who cast their ballots supported secession.

Baghdad, which had opposed the vote, rejected the result. It swiftly imposed sanctions on the region and sent Iraqi troops to retake several contested territories. Iraq’s Supreme Court ruled later in the year that, in order to preserve the unity of Iraq, no Iraqi province was allowed to secede.

Another major issue is the KRG’s independent export of the region’s oil production. Baghdad is opposed to this too, insisting that all of Iraq’s oil revenues must be centrally managed. The KRG, however, argues that its right to manage natural resources is protected under Iraq’s constitution.

The dispute escalated in 2023 when Iraq’s Supreme Court ruled that revenues from Iraqi oil and gas must be fairly distributed to all of Iraq’s people, regardless of where it is found. This ruling has led to budget cuts in Iraqi Kurdistan.

These unresolved disputes have left Iraqi Kurdistan in economic and political limbo, with frequent salary delays for public sector employees and growing public frustration.

Iraqi Kurdistan is now experiencing a wider economic downturn, as the region’s limited private sector is also being affected by the salary crisis.

Public sector employees make up a significant portion of the workforce. When they do not get paid on time, they cut back on spending. Businesses, from small shops to large retailers, are experiencing a slowdown in economic activity, leading to closures and layoffs.

Adding to the hardship is the lack of reliable access to basic services such as water and electricity. Many Kurdish households only receive water for a few days each week, forcing families to ration their supply or buy expensive private alternatives.

The situation with electricity is even worse. Government-provided power is available only for set hours each day, leaving households and businesses reliant on costly private generators.

While ordinary people suffer from water shortages and power cuts, the region’s ruling elite enjoy uninterrupted access to luxury services. The inconsistency in the provision of these essential services is not due to a lack of resources, but a failure of governance.

The ruling elite – dominated by the Barzani and Talabani families – have amassed vast wealth since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 through their monopolisation of key industries. Investigations suggest that substantial amounts of the region’s oil wealth have been diverted through opaque contracts and off-the-books transactions.

Instead of channelling Iraqi Kurdistan’s oil revenues into public services, healthcare or infrastructure, large sums reportedly disappear into private accounts, foreign investments and elite patronage networks. This mismanagement has resulted in billions of US dollars in unaccounted oil revenues.

This economic monopoly has also reinforced a jobs-for-votes system. Reliant on government wages, the KRG’s 1.2 million civil servants feel pressured to support the region’s dominant parties, the Kurdistan Democratic party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

To maintain this political stranglehold, the two parties have suppressed private sector growth, ensuring economic dependency on public jobs. The telecommunications sector, for example, is dominated by Barzani-linked Korek Telecom and Talabani-linked Asiacell, with bureaucratic barriers blocking private competition.

Meanwhile, weak banking infrastructure and a lack of investment incentives stifle private sector growth, pushing people toward government jobs controlled by the ruling parties. Salaries and promotions often depend on political loyalty, reinforcing economic dependency and making independent enterprise difficult.

Creating a debt crisis

The unpaid salary backlog has forced many of Iraqi Kurdistan’s residents into massive personal debt. Many civil servants have been forced to borrow money from family, friends or banks just to cover rent, food, medical bills and tuition for their children. The mounting financial pressure has also led to an increase in divorce rates.

Even if the KRG returns to paying salaries on time, the backlog must still be paid. Both Baghdad and the KRG are legally responsible for ensuring public sector workers receive the money they are owed.

Ignoring these arrears is a clear violation of the constitutional and international obligations that Iraq has committed to, which include the UN’s sustainable development goals.

The right to a fair wage and timely compensation is enshrined in Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which Iraq is a signatory to. And Iraq’s own constitution guarantees citizens the right to social and economic welfare, which includes timely wages.

Iraqi Kurdistan’s salary crisis is also contributing to the global refugee crisis. The Crossing, a documentary that aired on ITV in 2022 about the capsizing of a dinghy of asylum seekers in the English Channel, demonstrated that economic despair has prompted many Kurds to risk their lives on dangerous migration routes in search of stability and opportunity.

Without a structured repayment plan, the crisis will remain unresolved – even if salaries are paid moving forward.",theconversation

The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-led (HTS) government has been struggling for legitimacy since it ousted Bashar al-Assad late last year, following more than a decade of civil war in a country riddled with sectarian divisions. The deal recognises the Kurdish minority as “an integral part of the Syrian state” and guarantees “the rights of all Syrians to representation and participation in the political process”.

It’s a timely development for the interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. The deal follows days of violence in the coastal region of Latakia in the west of the country in which more than 1,000 people – mainly civilians – were killed.

The ostensible spark was a government raid to arrest former regime officials who had gone to ground in the region. But there was nothing spontaneous about what happened next. In synchronised attacks, squads of Assad regime remnants ambushed and killed scores of government security forces.

Snipers then pinned down reinforcements and fired on ambulances. Adding to the fog of war, thousands of armed Sunni civilians streamed into Latakia to prevent a coup against the new government.

The security forces have regained control, but at a terrible cost. In scenes that resembled the worst moments of Syria’s civil war, hundreds of civilians were killed. A rally to defend a free Syria had descended into calls for vengeance and ended in a shocking, sectarian massacre. But for anyone watching, all the warning signs had been showing for some time.

Institute for the Study of War

Mounting tension

The first indication of building tension was that other anti-Assad rebel groups were beginning to lose patience with the new government, particularly after al-Sharaa announced in December 2024 that all the militias would be dissolved and integrated into the HTS-controlled defence ministry. This was flatly rejected by some factions. Others endorsed it, but deliberately obstructed efforts to move forward with al-Sharaa’s plans for the integration process.

These events directly precipitated the massacres of early March. HTS is a relatively small rebel group. It was quickly overwhelmed by the recent uprising. The government had to rely on other militias – the very same ones it had failed to place under its control.

The result was chaos. There is no evidence that al-Sharaa ordered the massacres, but he could not prevent them. The worst violations appear to have been carried out by foreign Jihadists and the Syrian National Army, a coalition of Turkish proxy militias.

It is doubtful that al-Sharaa can punish those responsible, given that he is reliant on Turkish patronage to stay in power. The uprising and the massacres have only strengthened this dynamic.

The new government also failed to delineate a transparent framework for transitional justice. Their reluctance to do so is understandable. After over a decade of brutal civil war, there are few innocent parties in Syria today. It was not only the Assad regime but also HTS and many other rebel groups that committed war crimes.

Equally, Syria’s minorities – particularly Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam that comprises around 10% of Syria’s population – were over-represented in the Assad regime’s top echelons. Most rebel groups were Sunni dominated. Any public attempt to settle scores, then, could alienate Syria’s minorities.

EPA-EFE/Mohammed al-Rifai

This approach backfired in two ways. First, the new government’s security forces conducted secretive operations to root out high-profile regime remnants. Since the wanted individuals were often Alawites, it was these communities that felt disproportionately targeted.

This, in turn, exacerbated the Alawite community’s fears and insecurities. Indeed, it was one of these security sweeps that preceded the recent violence.

Second, without a transparent process of accountability and justice, many Syrians took the law into their own hands. These “revenge killings” were mostly carried out by Sunnis against Alawites.

Consequently, Alawites felt that they could not rely on the government to protect them and many refused to hand in their weapons. These three trends – the Alawite community’s increased alienation, the failure of many of its members to disarm and the Sunni-led extrajudicial killings – all culminated in the recent violence.

Bitter insurgency

But the insurgency did not emerge overnight. In December 2024, a group calling itself the Syrian Popular Resistance declared war against the government.

In the same month, a senior Iranian general advocated that Tehran use its “networks” to “form resistance cells” in Syria. This was not just bluster. Not only was there a steady increase in attacks against security forces in early 2025, but Iran also continued to use Syria as a conduit to supply weapons to Lebanon’s Hezbollah.

Members of these longstanding networks had nothing to gain from turning themselves in. Many committed war crimes for Assad and were wanted men. But they also had financial motivations. These networks were crucial conduits for smuggling captagon, an amphetamine-like drug.

Under Assad, Syria manufactured upwards of 80% of the world’s captagon supply. Increased demand for the drug, in turn, kept the sanctions-hit regime afloat.

Assad may have fled to Moscow, but the smuggling networks stayed put, as did captagon’s customer base. Syria’s new government fought against the captagon trade and weapons smuggling alike. This was a noble aim, yet it also made some form of armed resistance inevitable.

Elsewhere in the country, the SDF’s decision to lay down its arms is a major breakthrough, given that oil-rich eastern Syria has functioned as a de facto independent state since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011.

But the dynamics that provoked the March massacres have not gone away. The SDF deal gives the HTS-led government an opportunity to focus on addressing the grievances of the Alawite community and on providing a transparent framework for justice and reconciliation, while acting forcefully against pro-Assad remnants.

This is a difficult balancing act, but it is a necessary one. Syria remains a country with too many guns and not enough investment, accountability and good governance.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte arrested for crimes against humanity – a blow against impunity,https://theconversation.com/former-philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-arrested-for-crimes-against-humanity-a-blow-against-impunity-251926,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:52:40 GMT","The arrest of Rodrigo Duterte, who served as president of the Philippines between 2016 and 2022, for crimes against humanity for his part in the country’s violent “war on drugs” is a welcome blow against impunity. Duterte was arrested on March 11 by Interpol, which was carrying out an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) charging him with crimes against humanity.

It’s a step, at least, towards justice for the families of the victims of thousands of extrajudicial killings – maybe tens of thousands. Nobody knows exactly how many.

A key part of Duterte’s campaign platform when he ran for president in 2016 was to combat what he called “the drug menace”. During his previous 22 years as the mayor of Davao city in the province of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, he had operated a similar policy.

The 1,040 deaths during his war on drugs there became the subject of an excellent 109-page report by the pressure group Human Rights Watch: “You Can Die Any Time”: Death Squad Killings in Mindanao.

Duterte never shied away from that notoriety. His policy of running death squads from the presidential palace resulted in violence on a scale that shocked the world. But he wasn’t reinventing the wheel. When he was mayor of Davao, his right-hand men included many of the same characters who then oversaw the national drug war (Operation Tokhang).

Orgy of violence

The drug war escalated quickly from Manila and came to consume the whole country. At first, victims’ bodies would be left with a sign which claimed they were a drug pusher or user. Eventually, those signs disappeared and the victims were just left for dead.

Then the police became brazen. A “shoot first – ask question later” policy accelerated to the point where vendettas and vigilante assassination had the perfect cover to get away with murder on an industrial scale. Suspected police corruption or downright disregard for the law was caught on security camera and published in the media.

It was hoped by many citizens that the sentencing of three police officers to 40 years in prison in 2017 for killing of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos signalled an end to impunity in the Philippines. But, this remains the only case of police accountability. And the guilty verdict was reached largely because CCTV footage refuted police attempts to cover up their part in the murder.

Thousands of people disappeared – children too – all caught up in the vigilante violence that the state had instigated but couldn’t contain. Activists, dissidents, journalists, lawyers and clergy were also increasingly targeted during the drug war. Many of the murders were barely investigated, if at all. Motorcycle assassinations by gunmen riding pillion became a scourge – and evidence proved hard to come by.

Prosecution will not be easy

There are numerous significant hurdles for the ICC prosecution to overcome. The police’s involvement in the killings presents a massive challenge. With the exception of Kian’s case, killings committed by uniformed police have long since been swept under the carpet. Police officers were allegedly involved in some of the vigilante killings, out of uniform as guns for hire – but were subsequently acquitted.

EPA-EFE/Rolex dela Pena

Many of these murders left no evidence. Bodies were quickly moved and the blood washed off the streets. Given the time that has now passed and police complicity in the violence, nobody should be under the impression there is a mountain of forensic evidence waiting to be analysed or that witness statements were even taken at the time. Many of the deaths were not even recognised as crimes when they occurred.

But timing matters. At the time of these crimes, the Philippines was a signatory to the Statute of Rome, the treaty which set up the ICC. In 2019, Duterte withdrew the country from the ICC’s jurisdiction, but this didn’t absolve those responsible for the three years of bloodshed before that.

But even given a case can now be brought against Duterte, witnesses and – most importantly, whistleblowers from inside the police – will be hard to come by. Many of those that have tried to bear witness to the reign of terror have had to flee the country.

Meanwhile, Duterte’s camp will be quick to mount a popular defence that this is a show trial. Rodrigo didn’t pull the trigger himself – even if he has openly admitted to killing people when mayor of Davao. His culpability and responsibility for the deaths isn’t something he has denied or refuted. Though his team will vociferously deny that the ICC has any cause to interfere with domestic Filipino affairs.

There is an awful lot of politics involved here too, which I have written about previously here. Accountability for the murderous violence starts with Rodrigo Duterte. But it needs to delve much deeper into the Philippines national police and will be incredibly disruptive. It will require the support of the current president, Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. Thus far, he has been reticent to provide that support.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Inside the sex lives of chimpanzees: it’s about much more than just reproduction,https://theconversation.com/inside-the-sex-lives-of-chimpanzees-its-about-much-more-than-just-reproduction-251836,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:13:19 GMT","Doug was the leader of his chimpanzee group. He had quickly gained a reputation from human observers as a fair and tolerant alpha male. One day he was separated from the group for some health checkups along with a young, confident male, Vis, and Vis’s ally, Zsabu.

We couldn’t see what was happening from our vantage point, but you could hear it. Screaming and banging. Something was kicking off. Doug had been ambushed by the two males and had to be released hastily by the keepers.

When he emerged he wasn’t badly injured, but was clearly distressed – this giant male was screaming, crouching and outnumbered. In our months of observation, we’d never seen him like this.

Little Jones, a low-ranking male often picked on by his peers, approached him and started making submissive gestures. Doug rushed over to mount him for a few moments, with the weaker chimp crouching down as Doug thrusted on top of him.

That seemed to be a green light for many of the 40 or so chimps in the group to offer comfort and reassurance to Doug, too. It was an extraordinary sight.

Jake Brooker/Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust , CC BY-SA

Most of the group approached Doug, embracing, touching and body kissing him. There was also mutual genital touching and several invited Doug to mount them. This kind of extreme consolation is rare in chimp communities, reserved for very special circumstances.

People often think that animals just use sex for reproduction. In fact, for many animals and birds, sex can play a comparable social role to what it plays in humans. As we saw in this research into the chimps at the Chimfunshi sanctuary in north-western Zambia, sex can help ease tension, relieve stress, strengthen bonds and even repair relationships.

Chimps v bonobos

We spent months observing the chimpanzees at Chimfunshi, living in simple concrete bungalows near to their large, forested enclosures. We spent nearly all day every day observing them, living vicariously through their soap opera.

You get the privilege of coming to know each and every chimp, almost like a person – the way they walk, look and sound. Even the silhouettes of their bodies as they walk away in semi-darkness as the light of the day falls.

We compared their sexual behaviour with a group of bonobos slightly over 1,000 miles away at the Lola Ya Bonobo sanctuary, near Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Chimps and bonobos are humans’ closest relatives, having diverged from us between 5 and 7 million years ago. They still share around 98.7% of our DNA and offer us fascinating insights into what we may have been like before we became human.

Researchers used to use chimps as the poster boys of human evolution, while ignoring our less understood yet equally important other cousin. More recently, though, researchers have become more interested in bonobos, as well as comparing the two species together.

Like humans, both chimpanzees and bonobos have rich and complex social lives. In both species we see striking variations in different groups’ use of tools, cultures, social tendencies, and even the amount they engage in conflict.

That said, there are fascinating differences between the two species. Bonobo groups are overseen by coalitions of dominant females and their sons, whereas the chimp hierarchy is usually structured around an alpha male and his male cronies.

Bonobos are generally viewed as peaceful and tolerant, while chimps have drawn the short straw in public relations, often depicted as violent, competitive, even murderous.

Some of these differences have become contested, however. For instance, some bonobo groups are less tolerant and more aggressive than some chimpanzee groups, while both apes share food peacefully and cooperate.

Chimpanzees can be tolerant and tender with one another; they can help others in need and comfort them in distress. They’ll often release their aggression by charging or making a lot of noise, without necessarily coming to blows.

One characteristic that has continued to be firmly associated with bonobos is their heightened sexuality. Whether in the wild or captivity, they habitually engage in sexual interactions in almost all age and sex combinations.

Sex seems to help them manage social problems, such as repairing social bonds after fights and facilitating cooperation, such as before sharing food.

Zanna Clay/Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary , CC BY-SA

Yet, against assumptions, our study found that even this difference is not what it appears. When directly comparing the two species in similar sanctuary environments, we found chimps also use sex to navigate tense social situations, as we saw with Doug, and to reconcile after fights.

Both species share similar sexual repertoires, although genito-genital rubbing – moving genitals together rhythmically while in a “missionary” position – is more common in bonobos, especially females.

Chimpanzees, particularly males, often mount and hold the genitals of their allies, especially during conflicts either within their group or with other groups. They often thrust against one another, and these behaviours appear to serve a reassurance and tension-reducing role.

As with bonobos, we see all different sex combinations, sometimes with more dominant chimps doing the mounting but sometimes the other way around. Meanwhile, chimps are more likely to engage in other behaviours such as body kissing.

Human evolution

Evidence that both bonobos and chimpanzees use sex to manage social problems suggests that our last common ancestor would have done so too — and most likely early humans as well.

Our findings challenge the idea that human sexuality is uniquely complex. Far from being a cultural construct, the social role of sex appears to echo through time from our ancestors to our modern societies.

Much like our primate relatives, humans also rely on other strategies beyond sex for conflict resolution, such as verbal and physical reassurance. Yet, sex remains a potent and often overlooked tool in human social dynamics.

And just as the sexual behaviours of bonobos and chimps reflect their social structures, human sexuality is influenced by our societies too. The way we use sex — for intimacy, pleasure, bonding and negotiation — may be one of our most ancient, and flexible traits.

Back in Chimfunshi, Doug wasn’t deposed after his altercation with Vis and Zsabu. The outpouring of intimate affection from the community reinforced his position as leader of the group, which was then cemented by another incident later that day.

The whole community seemed to be quietly eating until Doug and his close male ally Pan suddenly attacked Vis and his mother Violet, the dominant female. They bodyslammed both of them, sending a clear message that the group was not under new management. The violence went no further, and Doug still leads to this day.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Toad patrol volunteers are ensuring frisky amphibians can cross the road to reach their mating grounds,https://theconversation.com/toad-patrol-volunteers-are-ensuring-frisky-amphibians-can-cross-the-road-to-reach-their-mating-grounds-250684,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:13:17 GMT","During February and March, volunteers head out after dark with buckets and florescent jackets to stand on roads across the UK. These are the toad patrols, and they help an amphibian with love on its mind.

Early spring is the start of the breeding season for common toads (Bufo bufo to scientists). A warm, wet evening is the perfect cue for males to embark for a pond where they hope to find a mate. Females usually arrive a few weeks later, but they only stay long enough to mate and spawn.

Males, who outnumber the females, must engage in gladiator-style battles to win mates. In one pond scientists studied in Sweden, there were four males for every female. The scientists reported intense competition, with only 20.5% of males breeding successfully. The male grabs hold of the female for several days, and as the female begins laying eggs, he fertilises them. Toads lay a long double string of eggs that are black in colour, unlike the mass of eggs laid by frogs.

After that, the parents begin to depart the pond. The spawn they leave behind takes around 16 weeks to grow into toadlets. You’ll often find the toadlets leaving a pond en masse during a wet summer evening, darting for cover to avoid getting eaten. Outside of the breeding season, toads spend their time in woods, grassland and gardens until spring begins and they start their migration.

Stubbier than frogs, with shorter legs, toads crawl to breeding ponds, which can be up to 5km away. Their destination is typically a familiar one. One study found that over 80% of adults that survived to breed the following year returned to their pond of origin.

You may wonder why a species that has made this migration for millions of years needs the help of a toad patrol. Toads are equipped for the journey to their breeding ponds, but they are not built to withstand the obstacles and barriers that people have put in their way. The natural world has been split apart by roads. Britain has 247,800 miles of road, on which 20 tonnes of toad is estimated to be squashed each year.

What toad patrols have taught us

If a road has lots of toads crossing in the spring, it can be registered with Froglife and a patrol set up to ferry toads across it. The charity Froglife is committed to the conservation of all amphibians, reptiles and their habitats, and has coordinated toad patrols for over 35 years.

Toad patrollers are tasked with recording how many amphibians they help across the road in an evening and how many they find dead. Volunteers are also asked to record the number of days in which a patrol is active each season and how many people take part. This helps scientists understand whether any changes in recorded toad numbers are not just a result of more people submitting data. In 2023, there were 203 crossing sites in the UK, which helped over 115,000 toads to cross a road safely.

The information gathered by these patrols has shown that toad numbers have declined by 68% since 1985 in some areas of the UK, but the reasons are unclear. The loss of ponds for breeding and disruption to migration routes are among the most likely causes.

Roughly half of the UK’s ponds were lost during the 20th century. Those that remain are in a generally poor state. It is no surprise that toads have continued to decline despite the best efforts of volunteers, who have been venturing out on dark, damp evenings since the early 1980s.

One study analysed how effective the patrols were for conserving toads. The authors mentioned a period in Cambridgeshire in the mid-1990s, when volunteers dwindled each year because of declining toad numbers at crossings.

This period still saw significant toad casualties, and it took several years before people realised that toad populations could be reduced by road traffic. By this point, local ponds, despite being protected, saw only small numbers of toads breeding and hardly any toads at the crossing because the local population was so depleted.

Mr Toad from Wind in the Willows may have enjoyed zooming around in his sports car, but reckless driving on rural roads is causing real toads to decline. With ever smaller populations, toads need all the help they can get to ensure that adults arrive at their breeding ponds safely.

The Toads on Roads project is one way you can help support toads. See if there is one near you.

https://theconversation.com,How climate change could be increasing your chance of catching a virus from sewage – new study,https://theconversation.com/how-climate-change-could-be-increasing-your-chance-of-catching-a-virus-from-sewage-new-study-243220,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:13:25 GMT","When we think of climate change, we may consider extreme weather events – record-breaking heatwaves, heavy downpours and devastating floods. But have you considered that these changes could also increase your risk of exposure to certain viruses?

We now live in world where extreme weather events are common. With the increasing frequency of prolonged rainstorms and heatwaves, climate change may raise the likelihood of being exposed to sewage-associated viruses in rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Intense rainstorms can also result in rainwater overloading urban sewer systems. As a result, raw untreated sewage is released into rivers, lakes and coastal waters.

Newly published research I have collaborated on shows that sewage-associated viruses can persist for days in certain weather conditions, raising health risks for people exposed to untreated outfall.

Raw sewage contains human urine and excrement, and carries with it a rich load of dead cells, food waste, pharmaceuticals, bacteria and viruses. Although most viruses shed by humans are relatively harmless, people infected with disease-causing viruses – such as enterovirus and norovirus – can shed billions of viral particles each time they go to the toilet.

Even after the disease symptoms have passed, people can still shed the viruses in large amounts when they use the lavatory. These are then released into the sewer system, flowing through the network until they reach the sewage treatment plant.

Typical wastewater treatment practices used in the UK are more than 99% effective at removing viruses. But despite this efficiency, treated wastewater discharged into the environment still poses some risk. Consequently, every day of the year, our rivers, lakes and seas receive potentially harmful viruses.

However, the release of raw untreated sewage represents a much more severe risk.

Health risks from extreme weather

While the UK is prolonged periods of rain, climate projections also predict more heatwaves like those in 2022, where temperatures reached record highs.

It’s important for scientists to understand how these extreme weather events will influence the sewage-associated viruses discharged into the environment. We already know that recreational water users are exposed to harmful pathogens as a direct result of sewage discharge and agricultural runoff entering bodies of water.

What remains unclear is how weather conditions affect a virus’s ability to infect people – and whether climate change could make these risks worse. Understanding this is crucial to tackling the growing health challenges posed by extreme weather and sewage contamination.

To explore these questions, scientists need reliable ways to detect potentially infectious viruses in the environment. This isn’t easy. Environmental samples often contain contaminants including various chemicals and bacteria, which can interfere with standard laboratory testing methods. These challenges make it difficult to accurately assess the presence and potential risk of harmful viruses in water sources.

Sam Oaksey/Alamy

To address these challenges, my colleagues and I developed methods that filter out viruses too damaged to cause infection. This approach ensured our data focused solely on the potentially infectious viruses in each sample. Our methods also allowed us to identify multiple types of virus simultaneously, making the process more efficient and comprehensive.

We conducted a series of experiments to investigate how climate change affects sewage-associated viruses, and the risks they pose to human health. These experiments were designed to simulate both short-term weather events, such as storms, and long-term changes including rising temperatures.

We introduced sewage-associated viruses, such as adenovirus and norovirus, into samples of river, estuary and seawater, and tracked how they degraded over two weeks. In one experiment, we exposed the samples to different temperatures, while in another, we simulated sunlight exposure. At various intervals, we measured the levels of intact, potentially infectious viruses to monitor their decline.

Read more: Eight ways to overhaul the UK's inadequate sewer system

From this data, we calculated “T90 decay rates”, which is the time it takes for viral loads to drop by 90%. These rates were measured separately for viruses still capable of causing infections, and for those in all stages of decay. Interestingly, we found that the type of water – river, estuarine or sea – had little effect on how long viruses remained infectious or detectable in our analyses.

Enteric viruses – those that cause stomach upsets – stayed infectious in seawater for up to three days at temperatures as high as 30C. At cooler temperatures, they lasted even longer, persisting for up to a week.

When exposed to sunlight, viruses in water survived less than 24 hours on a sunny day. But on cloudy days, they remained viable for around 2.5 days. These findings demonstrate the significant health risks posed by sewage-associated viruses in wastewater.

Advice

To reduce the risk of infection, our research suggests people should avoid recreational activities in waters affected by sewage discharge for at least 2.5 days during cloudy weather, and at least 24 hours after sunny days. And climate change could worsen the problem: some summers may see an increase in sewage contamination, especially following heavy rain after droughts.

This issue isn’t limited to the UK, of course. Many countries continue to release untreated or partially treated sewage into natural waters, making it a global health concern.

Our research highlights the urgent need for better sewage treatment practices worldwide. It also demonstrates the need for governments and health agencies to develop targeted risk management strategies which address the growing threats posed by climate change.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The ‘sustainable’ cod in your shopping basket may be no such thing – new study reveals mislabelling,https://theconversation.com/the-sustainable-cod-in-your-shopping-basket-may-be-no-such-thing-new-study-reveals-mislabelling-251420,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:20 GMT","Cod sold in some European supermarkets is being mislabelled and is actually fished far from its claimed origin, according to our new study. We sampled cod sold in Germany, Spain, France and the UK and found that about 30% of it originated in a different location.

Seafood mislabelling, in which one species is sold as another, is a common problem. It may happen by mistake or by deliberate fraud, in which case, there is at least hope for improvement, as various DNA methods are now available for testing species.

But our new research highlights another problem: the mislabelling of geographical origin. As with species mislabelling, this issue can affect the sustainable management of fisheries, the conservation of fish in the wild and consumer trust.

Within a single species, some fish stocks can be severely depleted while others are sustainably harvested. Our findings suggest that mislabelling of geographical origin is commonplace. This means consumers could be unknowingly buying seafood from overfished stocks, or from regions where illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing is common, along with human rights abuses.

Atlantic cod is a useful subject for an investigation into the origins of fish people buy. This species is widely distributed and organised into several regional populations across the north Atlantic that all vary in their conservation status.

The north-east Arctic cod stock is large, relatively stable and well managed. The North Sea cod stock, meanwhile, is depleted and overfished. This discrepancy between two commercially important fish stocks in Europe highlights the importance of accurate labelling. Yet, until now, there had been no investigation into the extent of geographical mislabelling among European retailers.

We sampled 108 Atlantic cod products and compared the reported catch location for 31 of them with their geographical origin, which we determined using DNA analysis.

Less than 2% of our samples belonged to haddock instead of cod, which suggests species mislabelling is on a downward trend in Europe thanks to robust traceability and labelling regulations.

But the geographic origins of nearly a third of the samples was incorrectly reported in written or verbal communication. We might have expected fish from the over exploited North Sea stock to have been passed off as fish from the remote and less heavily fished northeast Arctic, but the opposite was observed. Somewhat surprisingly, errors were more prevalent among samples that were labelled as originating in the overexploited North Sea stock.

Why misreport fishing locations?

Whether deliberate or not, the reasons behind the mislabelling of any seafood product are not straightforward, but range from economic incentives to supply chain complications.

Mislabelling a product’s fishing location can hide serious infringements – by passing off fish from a depleted stock as sustainably caught, for example. It can also be motivated by consumer preferences. People tend to prefer local products, and in the case of cod, may prefer fish from regional waters, especially if they are unaware that it is a depleted stock.

Despite a relatively strong framework for tracing and labelling seafood in the EU and in the UK, enforcement is inconsistent. Issues persist with paper-based methods for tracing fish origins, though a fully digital system could replace this in the EU in the near future.

Atlantic cod is a staple fish and one of the most comprehensively studied. The prevalence of mislabelled origins for this species – and in a market with relatively stringent regulation – should raise concerns about the misrepresentation of other species elsewhere.

Methods for investigating species mislabelling have been refined, while those designed to evaluate the fishing location of marketed seafood are underused. This must change. The routine application of DNA testing could aid the monitoring of wild fish and the sustainable consumption of seafood.

When buying fish from a fishmonger, ask where it was caught, instead of asking if it is local. This can help you select fish that was caught in the region rather than fish caught by local fishers in a distant sea. When buying from a supermarket, check that the fishing location is indicated on the label. Some regions are associated with higher risks of human rights abuse or illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Inform yourself on which regions are affected by these problems, and if possible, try and avoid seafood from there.

Staying informed can help you avoid falling hook, line and sinker for mislabelled fish next time you shop.

https://theconversation.com,Fighting fungal nail infections: simple steps for healthier toenails,https://theconversation.com/fighting-fungal-nail-infections-simple-steps-for-healthier-toenails-251666,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:28 GMT","Even celebrities aren’t immune from foot-related issues such as the dreaded thickened toenail. Actor Danny DeVito, former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt have all posted photos of their poorly pinkies online over the past couple of years.

Thickened and discoloured toenails can be caused by a variety of issues, from ill-fitting shoes or trauma from stubbing your toe, to ageing and psoriasis (a chronic skin condition). Often, though, they’re caused by a fungal infection.

Fungal nail infections may seem embarrassing, but they’re actually very common. Also known by the scientific name onychomycosis, fungal nails affect around 10% of people worldwide, climbing to 50% in older adults.

These infections most often affect the toes, causing nails to thicken, crumble and become discoloured. The effect isn’t just cosmetic, though. Fungal nails can cause paronychia – pain and inflammation of the skin around the nail – making everyday activities more challenging.

Fungal nail infections are most often caused by dermatophytes – the fungi that feed on keratin, the protein that gives nails their strength. Yeasts and moulds can also cause the condition.

Sharing communal spaces like gyms, hot tubs, swimming pools and changing rooms increases your exposure to fungal spores. Then, tiny cracks or injuries from everyday wear or poor footcare can allow these organisms to invade the nail – typically through gaps between the hard nail plate and the underlying nail bed.

Older age, weakened immune systems, diabetes and poor circulation make nails more brittle and less resilient to infection. Closed shoes and sweaty feet create ideal growth conditions.

However, a few simple daily habits can help prevent fungal nail infections:

1) Dry your feet thoroughly after each shower or swim – this makes your toenails less inviting to fungi.

2) Choose shoes made from breathable materials and wear moisture-wicking socks to help keep your feet dry.

3) Ensure a good shoe fit and protect your nails during activities to maintain nail health.

4) Wear flip-flops in public areas like pools, gyms and communal showers to limit exposure to fungal spores.

But even if you follow all these measures, a fungal nail infection can still happen. If you develop a crumbly, discoloured nail, how should you treat it?

Home remedies and medication

Applying Vicks VapoRub to the affected nail is a popular home remedy. But while there may be lots of personal success stories on social media, there’s scant scientific evidence to support these claims.

As far as I can see, only two small clinical trials have tested the product’s effectiveness on fungal nails. One pilot study found that 83% of people showed some improvement, with nearly 28% achieving both a laboratory-confirmed cure and visibly clearer nails after 48 weeks. And another study in people living with HIV reported similar improvements after 24 weeks.

Vicks VapoRub contains ingredients with antifungal properties, including eucalyptus oil, camphor and menthol. The product may also oxidise when exposed to air and sunlight, producing a mild bleaching effect that brightens the nail.

However, it’s important to note this product is licensed as a cough suppressant and topical analgesic (a medication applied directly to the skin to relieve pain in muscles and joints), not as a treatment for fungal nail infections. So, while the research findings may sound promising, larger, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness as a standalone therapy.

Alternatively, oral medications are available by prescription and can clear the infection in 50–80% of cases over several months. But they require regular monitoring for side-effects and potential drug interactions, so may not be suitable for everyone.

Topical treatments like paint-on nail lacquers are another option for mild cases affecting one or two nails. These treatments tend to have fewer side effects compared with oral medications, but often struggle to penetrate the nail bed. As a result, it can take six-to-12 months to see improvement as the nail grows out.

Laser therapy is an emerging treatment that uses high-energy light to heat the nail and kill the fungus, while leaving surrounding tissue unharmed. Early studies suggest several laser therapy sessions may lead to clearer nails, but the long-term benefits remain uncertain – and this treatment can be costly due to the need for repeated sessions.

A combined approach that pairs oral medication with topical treatments and regular nail cutting tackles the problem from multiple angles. This method has shown promising results in clearing infections more effectively, particularly when several nails are affected.

Simple lifestyle changes

Fungal nail infections are a widespread condition, influenced by factors like moisture, age, immune status and nail trauma. Simple lifestyle changes can greatly reduce the risk. Advances in treatments, from oral and topical medications to laser and combined approaches, offer hope for healthier nails.

Bear in mind, though, it can be a challenge to tell the difference between thickened nails caused by trauma from footwear, and those caused by a fungal nail infection. So, someone with thick, discoloured nails might home-treat with topical products, mistakenly thinking they have a fungal toe infection. But in fact, they will only see improvement once they remove the cause of the trauma – a podiatrist can diagnose this condition accurately.

In all cases, if you continue to struggle with fungal nail infections, consider seeking medical advice from a specialist. This should ensure you can step confidently into each new day.",theconversation

All names and some other details of people mentioned in this article have been changed to protect their privacy.

“Up to the age of 12 … she was bright, popular, sporty. Everybody wanted her on their team; everybody wanted her at their party.” But as a young teenager, she “literally changed overnight and became somebody we didn’t recognise”.

Kasia was talking to us about her daughter, Sophia, who began suffering from spiralling mental health issues which led to homelessness and addiction. Kasia also had to deal with a mental health team that didn’t talk to one another (“incompetent people who relied on other incompetent people”). At the age of 28, Sophia took her own life by stepping in front of a train.

“I could see it coming,” Kasia said. “I absolutely knew it was coming and nobody would listen to me, and I think that was, probably, the worst time … It, literally, was coming towards us like a speeding train.”

We interviewed Kasia about what it had been like to attend the coroner’s inquest that followed Sophia’s tragic death. The interview was part of Voicing Loss, an extensive, three-year research project on bereaved people’s experiences of the coroner service in England and Wales, in which we interviewed 190 people with personal or professional experiences of inquests.

Laurel was another bereaved parent who spoke about failings in care. Her son, Finn, had a developmental disability and died at the age of 15 after an accident. Laurel told us:

We had been systematically let down by services for many, many years up to his death – we’d been campaigning for help for him … He ended up falling through the gaps in the system. Not disabled enough and not enabled enough. This is where it all started to go wrong … You’re already made to feel that you’re, kind of, a pain. It’s your fault and you’re a pain … You do shout out, but you’re silenced, and you feel nervous to rattle that cage. You live in terror.

Hope and vindication

Coroners in England and Wales are a special kind of judge, appointed by the local authority, whose role is to investigate violent, unnatural and unexplained deaths, and deaths which have occurred in prison and other forms of state detention.

The inquest is the final stage of the coroner’s investigation, unless the coroner has already established that the death was a “natural” one and requires no further examination. If it was a death in custody, even of natural causes, an inquest must be held.

The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.

The inquest most commonly takes the form of a public court hearing, at which the coroner, sometimes with a jury, addresses four questions: who died, how did they die, when and where did they die? In some cases, the inquest must not only look at the cause of death but also at the “circumstances” in which the death occurred. But, an inquest is not a trial, and does not assign blame or establish liability for the death.

Government figures show that, in 2023, 195,000 deaths – one-third of all registered deaths – were reported to the coroner for possible investigation, and coroners concluded almost 40,000 inquests.

Many bereaved relatives, like Kasia and Laurel, hope that the inquest will identify any institutional failings that caused or contributed to the death. They hope that, in so doing, the inquest will shine a light on precisely how the failings came to have such devastating consequences.

Most of all, many hope that the resultant learning will help to ensure other families do not endure similar tragedies. The same hopes emerge in widely differing contexts. For example, whether the failings at issue relate to health services, social care provision, the criminal justice system, employers’ treatment of their employees, corporate governance, government policy, or any other sphere of life.

For Kasia, the inquest into Sophia’s death went at least some way towards fulfilling her hopes. The coroner recognised the serious shortcomings in the healthcare that had been offered to Sophia over the many years she had suffered from severe mental illness. Kasia said:

I felt I was honouring her by getting some of these people accountable, having them made accountable … One of the outcomes for me was that all the issues I had raised were vindicated.

Laurel, too, was greatly relieved that the coroner who heard Finn’s inquest identified inadequate support from services as the background to the incident in which he died. “I found peace in that inquest, strangely,” she told us. “For me, I found peace, because I could see everything, or pretty much everything, was uncovered.” The inquest was meaningful to Laurel in other ways, too. After having been treated by services as if she had herself been “at fault” as Finn’s mother, the love and care she had always shown her son was now acknowledged:

The thing was, during the entire inquest, there was nothing but praise … and it came from the coroner, and it came from the people who were questioned … That helped me a lot, because of what I’d been through … to have one of the social workers say (because I’d had a terrible time with some social workers) ‘You’ve never seen a mother’s love like it’.

Unfulfilled expectations and severe underfunding

However, for many of the bereaved relatives we spoke to, the realities of the inquest fell far short of their expectation that all factors relevant to the death, including institutional failings, would be thoroughly and robustly scrutinised. Our research found that this mismatch between expectations and realities was a cause of anger and despair. It could make the grief that follows traumatic bereavement even more crushing.

Various factors contributed to this problem. Like most public services, the coroner service – which is based in local authorities – is severely underfunded. In an Extraordinary Report published in early 2024, then chief coroner Thomas Teague KC noted the “chronic under-resourcing” of the service, and that local coroners’ teams are “understaffed and overworked”. The consequences include widespread backlogs and delays, and excessive caseloads for coroners’ officers whose job it is to facilitate coroners’ investigations and to liaise with bereaved relatives and others.

In the context of an overstretched service, many inquests are less detailed and probing than families want. Adding to the risk of disappointing the bereaved is the fact that coroners have wide discretion when it comes to setting the scope of inquests: that is, in deciding which specific issues will be examined, what evidence will be considered, and which witnesses, if any, will be called. What some coroners deem an adequate investigation may appear, to grieving relatives, to be cursory and far too narrow.

Elle spoke to us about a coroner who did not seem interested in exploring, in depth, the potential causes of her son Daniel’s death. She described having fought for proper care for Daniel, since the moment of his birth. A serious birth injury had left him with a number of disabilities, in relation to which compensation had been awarded. He died in hospital at the age of 17, after falling ill. She said the family had been raising concerns in the hospital that he was really ill because they had seen it before and he had been given the appropriate care. But this time their pleas seemed to fall on deaf ears. Elle said:

[This time] they would tell us that there was nothing wrong with Daniel, that he was fine. Or they would tell us that he was dying because of his cerebral palsy. It was clear to us that he had a very obvious infection … Things got worse, and worse, and worse. Daniel just got more and more ill. There were endless mistakes in his care.

Yet, the inquest into Daniel’s death produced a conclusion that was far from what Elle had expected. At the end of the inquest, she said, “the coroner just came in, didn’t even look at us, and read out this thing basically saying that the death was a natural death, and that he didn’t find any faults in Daniel’s care at all”.

Elle vehemently disagreed with the coroner’s decision, adding: “There’s no way in a million years his death was natural. It’s an unnatural death caused by clinical negligence at his birth, exacerbated by the treatment at hospital.” As far as Elle was concerned, there were “lots of issues that were just ignored” by the inquest, which “left us in despair”. She summed up her experience of the inquest with the comment: “It’s just shock, distress, trauma. We’ve been traumatised by it without any question.”

‘It made us feel like we’d failed dad’

Sylvia attended the inquest into the death by suicide of her husband, Ronan, at the age of 50. Ronan was suffering from multiple, deep-rooted mental health and addiction problems, in relation to which he was struggling to access help, when he took his own life. Sylvia had expected the coroner to look at the many “contributing factors surrounding Ronan’s death”, but found “there was a total lack of understanding of these factors – the coroner brushed over them”.

We interviewed Sylvia with her son, Tom, who had also attended the inquest. Mother and son agreed that the coroner’s investigation had been wholly inadequate. Tom said: “It made us feel like we’d failed dad. There was no justice for him whatsoever … It was sort of like: ‘Yes, suicide’.”

Sylvia agreed, adding: “I think the overwhelming thing was that Ronan wanted the help. He was speaking to all these agencies and he was telling everybody, asking for help … But [the inquest] was very short and brief, like ‘he meant to do that, and off you go.’ …And that’s the thoughts that it leaves you with: that we haven’t done Ronan justice.”

Sylvia believed the inquest had let Ronan down, as had the services which did not respond to his pleas for help before his death. “All these people that have failed him, even at the inquest – before, during and after – all these people that have failed him, they’ve walked away from it, scot-free.”

Reflecting on the inquest into her husband Louis’s death, Eva spoke similarly of her sense of injustice at how the coroner’s investigation had proceeded. Louis was a longstanding member of the armed forces when he died from suicide, aged 55. According to Eva, the coroner showed no interest in the pressures relating to Louis’s military role that, in her view, had precipitated the suicide. The result was that the armed forces were not held to account.

She said that after the coroner gave his conclusion, people from the military and Ministry of Defence “came running up to me, shook my hand: ‘Oh, we’re very sorry. Goodbye.’ In other words, ‘Oh, so there’s no more work for us here – the coroner has said his bit. Goodbye.’ Pat on the head. ‘Bugger off now.’”

Ten years after the inquest, Eva still felt great anger about it. “I’ve seen something and it’s wrong, and I just can’t swallow it. I can’t.”

Limits to the coroner’s role

It is widely assumed – by bereaved people and the public more widely – that the main purpose of the coroner’s inquest is to learn lessons from the death, in order to help prevent future such deaths.

By law, however, the prevention of future deaths is an “ancillary” or supplementary part of the coroner’s role. The coroner’s central task is to find the “facts” of the death – particularly, the cause of death. If, in so doing, the coroner becomes aware of a risk of future deaths and considers that action can be taken to reduce that risk, they must write what is commonly known as a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) report.

The report is sent to people and organisations in a position to take appropriate action, who are required to respond within 56 days. Most PFD reports, and recipients’ responses, are published online on the judiciary website. The independent database the Preventable Deaths Tracker also provides access to reports along with detailed analysis.

As made clear in guidance for coroners, PFD reports are recommendations that action should be taken, but do not specify what the actions should be. And, crucially, the coroner has no powers or part to play in monitoring, overseeing or enforcing any organisational changes that may – or may not – result from their reports.

The coroner’s limited powers in relation to prevention were a source of acute frustration and disappointment for some of the bereaved people we interviewed.

Vivienne’s daughter, Lara, died from suicide at the age of 18, during a mental health crisis. The inquest proved to be, in some ways, “quite cathartic”. Vivienne explained:

When Lara died, people stopped saying her name; she was no longer part of the conversation … We come to the inquest, and her name is being used almost every other sentence, which was wonderful. It’s heartbreaking, but it was wonderful.

Vivienne was initially satisfied that the coroner issued three Prevention of Future Deaths reports for health trusts and other services. However, she rapidly became disillusioned: “I had a moment where I thought that actually something might happen as a result [of the reports] … but of course it hasn’t.”

Vivienne contacted the local trust and found out that almost a year after Lara died, a young girl died under almost identical circumstances. “Then I realised that if I’m standing in the trust’s crisis centre, talking to the chief person when Lara was alive – begging for their help to save her life – if they didn’t listen to me then, they’re not going to listen to me now she’s dead … It was at that point that I thought: ‘Enough. Enough.’ And I just let it go because I ran out of fight.”

Tabitha’s son Cy died in prison at the age of 23 after a delayed response to a health emergency. She told us: “It was all about the officer not calling code blue [the emergency response code] … he could have been saved, if he’d had his medication.”

At the inquest, Tabitha and her family “just felt it was just something to write on the death certificate, to close the case of this person’s life”. They came to the view that “the coroner is powerless” and that there was little concern with systemic problems in the prison. Tabitha said another boy died in the same circumstances a year later. She added:

Even though they make recommendations for prevention of future deaths, it’s not binding … We go through the whole process for something, which absolutely means nothing … So it makes you wonder: what was the point of the whole thing?

Mistrust

Many of the bereaved in our study said their hopes of the inquest had been dashed. They regarded the inquest as yet one more instance of institutional failing, on top of other institutional failings that had – over days, weeks, months or even years – formed the backdrop to the death of their relative.

This caused or entrenched a deep sense of mistrust. They now mistrusted not only the coroner service, but also the law and state authorities more widely. Eva told us that before her husband Louis’s inquest, she used to have “total faith in the law being objective, based on fact.” But today she thinks “if I had anything to do with the law or the coroners: no. I don’t trust them.”

Sidney was 37 when he died from suicide after struggling with a gambling problem for almost 20 years. Sidney’s stepfather, Luke, was shocked and disillusioned when the coroner showed little interest in gambling as the likely cause of Sidney’s suicide, and in how gambling-related deaths could be prevented. Luke told us:

I am utterly, utterly despondent and disappointed in the whole system … My God, I’m just an ordinary guy, who’s been a normal citizen for years. But I see this sort of thing where we just don’t get anywhere, and we’re stuck in it – whether it is Grenfell, or all the way that the Manchester bombings were handled … And I am getting very, very disappointed in – not society – but the way that society is governed.

What needs to change?

Over the course of our research, we heard from bereaved people who told us that their deceased relative had been denied justice; that there was no accountability for the death; and that they saw little prospect of change that would help to prevent similar deaths in the future.

We also heard about other aspects of the coronial process that added to the pain of what was an inherently difficult and distressing experience. Many interviewees, for example, said that they had received minimal information about the process, leaving them baffled and anxious. We also heard about interactions with professionals who – over the course of the investigation and even during the inquest hearing at the coroner’s court – displayed a marked lack of compassion, sensitivity and respect. When the deceased was spoken about in a disrespectful manner, this was a cause of particular hurt.

The repercussions of these experiences were often profound and long-lasting. Maria’s brother Leon, who had a learning disability and a number of physical health conditions, died at the age of 45 while he was at a residential treatment and assessment centre. Maria described an exchange at the inquest, when a witness referred dismissively to “people like Leon” which made her feel “in the moment of his death again. It felt like I was experiencing it twice: we haven’t come out of it; gosh, we’re never going to come out of it; we never will”.

Tom said he felt “really defeated” after his father Ronan’s inquest, while his mother Sylvia commented: “I’m terribly sad really that they’re treating people this way … You know, the experience we’ve had with them – I would not wish that on my worst enemy.”

Celia – Sidney’s mother – told us that her experience of the inquest was “probably deeply damaging to my own personal journey with the grief, because disappointment is not something you want on top of trauma”.

It is evident from our findings that there is an urgent need for reform to the coroner service. Reform should include changes to practice: for example, in the form of better provision of information; more empathetic and supportive treatment of bereaved people; and greater emphasis on respect for the deceased.

But, more fundamentally, time is overdue for a public conversation about the functions and purposes of the inquest process. A question that must be central to this conversation is whether the process should be more consistently, clearly and comprehensively focused on identifying and tackling institutional failings and other underlying causes of preventable deaths. And, if so, what structures and resources are required if this is to be done effectively. As Celia told us:

It’s not about the process as it exists today. There are so many improvements that need to be made that can’t be done by simply throwing a few more ushers at it, or a couple of therapists, or a person who tells you what your rights are. It’s deeper than that. It’s got to go further than that and it’s got to be kinder than that. We’re not flaky people; we’re flawed people. We are people that have been through a terrible experience. And some of us have got important things to say.

The current row is over new guidance published by the Sentencing Council, the independent public body that advises judges and magistrates on sentencing.

The guidance, effective from April 1, broadens the categories of cases in which pre-sentence reports should be sought. Compiled by the probation service, pre-sentence reports give courts information about an offender’s background, the circumstances of their offence, the risk they pose and their suitability for certain types of sentence.

The reports conclude with a sentencing proposal which takes these factors into account, alongside the seriousness of the offence. The judge or magistrate is not bound by the recommendation.

The guideline states that pre-sentence reports “will normally be considered necessary” in a number of circumstances. These include cases where the offender is a young adult, a sole or primary carer for dependent relatives, female, a victim of domestic abuse or trafficking, or suffers from addiction issues or a serious chronic medical condition.

However, it is the recommendation for pre-sentence reports before sentencing offenders from ethnic, cultural or faith minorities which has proved particularly controversial.

The previous guideline stated that pre-sentence reports should be sought in cases where the court was considering whether a community order or custody would be appropriate. What is new in the revised version is the list of groups for whom a pre-sentence report is considered particularly important.

However, this guideline does not mandate a pre-sentence report where it is deemed to be unnecessary. For example, where the court feels it already has a comprehensive picture of the offender’s circumstances.

What may seem at first glance to be a mundane procedural amendment has generated a strong backlash from government ministers and the opposition. Shadow justice minister Robert Jenrick claimed that there is a “blatant bias against Christians and straight white men”. Meanwhile, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has urged the Sentencing Council to review the guidance. Mahmood threatened to legislate in order to give the government powers to overrule the council.

In response, the chair of the Sentencing Council has written a public letter reasserting the body’s important role in maintaining the independence of the judiciary.

Why do we need pre-sentence reports?

It’s important to understand what the Sentencing Council is, and why it is recommending this new guidance.

The Sentencing Council is an independent public body which consists of 14 members. Most of these are judges, but it also includes the director of public prosecutions and a chief officer of police. Other members include those representing victims’ interests, rehabilitation services and an academic.

One of the council’s criteria for issuing new guidelines is that there is evidence of inconsistencies or inequalities in sentencing.

There is a substantial body of research pointing to disparities in sentencing outcomes between white offenders and those from ethnic minorities. The systematic sentencing of ethnic minority defendants to harsher sentences than white defendants was a focus of the 2017 Lammy review, an independent review on discrimination in the UK’s policing and criminal justice systems.

The review found evidence that disproportionate sentencing meant that the odds of receiving a prison sentence for drugs offences were around 240% higher for ethnic minority offenders. This is particularly concerning given the prisons overcrowding crisis, not least as ethnic minority offenders are overrepresented in the prison population.

Although there are variations across age groups and offence types, government statistics suggest that ethnic minority defendants are more likely than white defendants to receive an immediate custodial sentence, rather than a community sentence, for the same seriousness of offence. The statistics also suggest that ethnic minorities have a consistently higher average custodial sentence length for equivalent offences.

The Sentencing Council’s view is that the wider use of pre-sentence reports could help reduce these disparities by ensuring that judges and magistrates have as much information as possible at their disposal. This reasoning is supported by academic research that shows how sentencing differs across ethnic groups. For example, by emphasising aggravating factors and minimising mitigating factors when they apply to ethnic minority defendants, leading to more custodial sentences as well as longer sentences.

Importantly, the new guidance does not require judges to hand down lighter sentences to ethnic minorities. It simply recommends pre-sentence reports to be sought for more categories of offender so that the sentence can take into account any relevant factors.

The Sentencing Act 2020 stipulates that one of the purposes of sentencing is “the reform and rehabilitation of offenders”. This cannot be achieved if offenders’ personal circumstances are not considered.

Of course, the picture is not entirely clearcut. Some research suggests that the disparities may not be as stark as those suggested by the Lammy review. However, there is widespread consensus that there are some disparities, and addressing these is well within the remit of the Sentencing Council.

The government could follow recommendations to take other measures to tackle racial disparities in sentencing. For example, by improving outcomes for children and young people from ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system, as well as considering the indirect discrimination of social deprivation.

These are long-term projects and there are no quick fixes. But having pre-sentence reports in a greater number of cases is a first step to helping sentencers arrive at fair, transparent and effective sentences for all offenders.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How to save workplace diversity schemes from the DEI backlash (without collecting more data),https://theconversation.com/how-to-save-workplace-diversity-schemes-from-the-dei-backlash-without-collecting-more-data-251738,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:43 GMT","In a radio discussion on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, a journalist asked me which year these schemes started in the UK. I felt thrown by the question. It assumed that the broad array of initiatives associated with DEI, including policies, training programmes, themed events and staff networks, had an inception date. I responded, as I often do: “It’s complicated.”

DEI schemes are facing significant challenges. In the USA, president Donald Trump has used executive orders to terminate initiatives across federal agencies. Some private companies, including those with headquarters in the UK, have also seized on this moment to cut these commitments.

Critics may argue the objectives of DEI schemes have gone too far and mutated into a dogmatic belief system.

It’s hard to pinpoint when exactly, for them, a line was crossed. Perhaps it was when senior civil servants urged their teams to recognise “white privilege”, when employers introduced changes to reflect colleagues’ neurodiversity or when policies began acknowledging trans and non-binary people?

As a researcher and writer on DEI, I find myself pushed into a corner. Aware that comments like “It’s complicated” do not create a snappy soundbite, I feel coaxed into defending all these schemes. Even though my work has long argued that many approaches do nothing to address entrenched inequities in organisations (for example, poor working conditions, low pay and precarious employment – problems not unique to minority communities).

Even worse, they can give the illusion of action, preventing more worthwhile initiatives from taking place.

But there is an opportunity to reimagine DEI in the workplace, ensuring that potentially transformative schemes are not abandoned because of political winds. That may also mean choosing not to defend schemes that were never fit for purpose.

To help shepherd in this new era, it is essential to focus on how organisations categorise and count workers. In most UK workplaces, employees are invited to disclose information about their sex, race, sexual orientation, disability, religion and other characteristics in their human resources record. This data is used to give insights on diversity across roles, calculate pay gaps, design recruitment schemes and for other targeted initiatives.

Data about workers’ identity characteristics – and the contours of categories that determine who counts – is the fuel that powers DEI schemes. For individuals who fall between category cracks, a data-first approach was never going to represent their lives and experiences in a meaningful way and always force them into boxes not of their choosing.

Focusing attention on categories and counting, I believe there are three principles that need to inform the future of DEI schemes.

1. Strengths and limitations

Let’s be honest, DEI schemes were never perfect. As a knee-jerk response to movements like MeToo and Black Lives Matter, many companies introduced initiatives that could never deliver all that they promised.

Noble objectives such as visibility and inclusion routinely failed to counter the risks that come with bringing people into historically hostile and exclusionary organisations. For example, initiatives that support women into careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) lose all value if they fail to change work cultures, meaning that women continue to leave the sector at a higher rate than men.

2. End the obsession with data

Data is everywhere in conversations about DEI – whether it’s the proportion of women in senior leadership roles or the number of survey responses from disabled employees. It can have a huge impact, but we need to temper our faith that data alone can remedy the stickiest DEI challenges.

Overoptimism in data embeds a belief that all aspects of a person’s identity in the workplace can and should be counted. Organisations need to consider what their schemes expect from workers, as inviting people to share information affects some staff more than others. For example, trans workers are forced to reveal themselves in the data to ensure they are not counted in the “wrong way” or, when choosing to withhold sensitive information, find themselves unfairly labelled as duplicitous.

However, archaic HR systems and other data-gathering technologies are often ill-designed to deal with experiences that are complex, fluid and overlapping. While many aspects of the workplace have radically changed during the past 15 years, employers’ approach to the collection of identity data has remained relatively static.

3. Shaping how people experience the workplace

In the process of categorising and counting workers, DEI schemes partly alter understandings of what it means to see yourself as a member of a minoritised community.

For example, designing the category “Black British” then collecting data about “Black British” workers partly constructs what experiences are understood to count. People put themselves into the category expected of them. While these categories can create a sense of community, they also impede the actions of individuals who go against stereotypes and pursue careers “outside the box”.

As US historian of science Theodore M. Porter observed, counting practices “create new things and transform the meaning of old ones”. In other words, efforts to count what happens in the workplace are always going to be partly shaped by who does the counting.

What comes next?

The interplay between DEI schemes and practices of categorising and counting forces many workers into providing data that testifies to their existence and the harms they experience in the workplace. However, data does not always change the minds of decision-makers. Too often it can be discarded as anecdotal or biased because those collecting it shared life experiences with their research subjects.

What comes next needs to be anchored in solidarity across shared struggles. DEI schemes are not a special dispensation nor bending to a lower standard, but above all else they are about ways of working that empower everyone to excel.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Protecting artists’ rights: what responsible AI means for the creative industries,https://theconversation.com/protecting-artists-rights-what-responsible-ai-means-for-the-creative-industries-250842,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:13:21 GMT","The global sprint to develop artificial intelligence technologies is intensifying, fuelled by substantial investments from both public and private sectors keen to maintain a competitive edge in the AI era.

In the UK, the AI industry is predicted to generate £400 billion by 2030. Yet the regulatory frameworks that govern these advances are often seen as barriers to innovation and investment.

To reduce the potential risks in AI technologies, businesses and public organisations worldwide are increasingly adopting self-regulation to promote responsible AI practices. The Make it Fair Campaign, launched by the UK’s creative industries on February 25, calls on the UK government to support artists and enforce copyright laws through a responsible AI approach.

This article is part of our State of the Arts series. These articles tackle the challenges of the arts and heritage industry – and celebrate the wins, too.

Responsible AI encompasses a comprehensive framework that addresses various factors, from technical challenges to ethical considerations. As companies develop and incorporate AI technologies, the dialogue must extend beyond algorithms and data integrity to include a thoughtful examination of their social and economic impact.

Initiatives aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability are essential for rebuilding public trust, fostering a collaborative relationship between humans and AI, and paving the way for innovations that are not only effective but welcomed by society.

The need for responsible AI approaches is becoming increasingly urgent as artists deal with serious concerns regarding copyright infringement and job security. In the UK, the creative industries are worth £126 billion, employing 2.4 million people in 2022.

Opportunities and risks

AI has already transformed nearly every sector, and the creative industries are no exception. Generative AI promises diverse opportunities, from enriching creative processes to delivering personalised audience experiences alongside improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

As these technologies continue to evolve, providing creators with greater control and improved quality over generated outputs, they are set to become invaluable tools for visual artists, writers, musicians and producers around the world. However, these opportunities come with substantial risks, particularly concerning intellectual property rights and the potential reshaping of the workforce.

Generative AI systems draw heavily on human creations; without artists’ original contributions, these technologies would be unable to generate new content. Unfortunately, the lack of transparency and regulation for generative AI systems creates an unprecedented environment where copyrighted works are being used without compensation and explicit consent to train AI models.

The same systems that are undermining creators’ intellectual property are also diminishing their job opportunities – as generative AI platforms streamline processes and enhance productivity, they also risk eliminating jobs within the creative industries.

And as AI-generated outputs proliferate, they may eventually outnumber original works in training models, potentially leading to a cultural landscape dominated by a bland, uniform AI aesthetic.

Balancing AI and copyright

In January 2025, the UK released the AI Opportunities Action Plan, outlining the government’s strategy for developing AI.

While the UK has yet to establish specific legislation regarding AI safety and development, such as the EU’s 2024 AI Act, the plan advocates for a pro-innovation regulatory framework, which may provide a competitive advantage for AI tech companies over more stringent regulations.

Regarding copyright issues, the UK action plan highlights that the current uncertainty surrounding intellectual property protection is hindering AI innovation and ambitions. It references the EU AI Act as a potential model that encourages AI innovation while ensuring copyright holders maintain control over their content.

However, despite being the most ambitious regulation to date – providing clear expectations and guidelines for AI use in the EU – the act falls short of addressing growing concerns about copyright infringement.

The act states that any use of copyrighted material requires authorisation from the copyright holder unless regulated exceptions apply. One significant exception is found in the EU Directive 2019/790, which allows the use of copyrighted works for text and data mining purposes.

Although copyright holders can opt out of this use or reserve their right to be remunerated through a licensing agreement, exercising this option puts the burden on artists, who might not be aware of the clause or that their creations are being used for AI training models.

This makes it nearly impossible for creators to track the theft of their intellectual property. Even if they identify an infringement, the potential cost of suing an AI company will remain out of reach for most artists.

In the recent consultation on AI and copyright launched by the UK government, artists and cultural organisations were invited to share their views on its proposed approach.

Although the results of this survey – which closed on February 25 – are yet to be published, ministers appear ready to offer significant concessions over initial proposals. Following weeks of mounting protests by UK artists, officials are now discussing a range of changes, which according to some sources might exempt certain sectors from the opt-out system and would give preferential access to British AI companies.

In a call to action from UK unions, the TUC has demanded that legislation guarantees transparency measures to identify the presence of copyrighted works in training data, enabling artists to exercise their rights regarding their use.

However, copyright challenges don’t stop at national borders. The International AI Safety Report, released after the AI Action Summit in Paris last month, sheds light on this complex issue. Countries have different rules governing online data collection and intellectual property protection, making the global landscape hard to handle.

Adding to the difficulty, AI companies struggle with limited tools to properly source and filter training data based on licenses, complicating their ability to verify usage on a large scale. As a result, many developers are becoming hesitant to share details about the content they use.

Meanwhile, website owners are tightening restrictions on data crawling, effectively blocking content extraction altogether, which in turn might hinder legitimate AI research efforts.

As states navigate the fine line between promoting innovation and safeguarding rights, the conversation around AI and copyright is set to evolve. One thing is certain: the creative industries cannot flourish without the original input of creators.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How the color of St. Patrick’s Day went from blue to green,https://theconversation.com/how-the-color-of-st-patricks-day-went-from-blue-to-green-248985,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:48:51 GMT","St. Patrick’s Day usually conjures images of partying, Catholicism, Irish nationalism and, perhaps most famously, the color green: green clothes, green shamrocks, green beer and green rivers.

So my students are often surprised when I tell them that St. Patrick’s Day was once a solemn feast day when you’d be far more likely to see the color blue. In fact, there’s even a color known as St. Patrick’s blue.

‘True blue’

Historians don’t know much about St. Patrick. But they believe he was born in the fifth century as Maewyn Succat.

He wasn’t Irish; rather he was born in Wales, the son of a Roman-British official. He was, however, captured by Irish pirates and enslaved in Ireland. After six years he went back to Britain but returned to Ireland as one of the missionaries to convert Irish pagans to Christianity. At some point he adopted the Latin name Patricius. In the 10th century, the first evidence of St. Patrick being a beloved figure in Ireland emerged.

In the early 17th century, Luke Wadding, an Irish priest, persuaded the Catholic Church to make March 17 a feast day for St. Patrick.

Back then, feast days were far from raucous affairs: Catholics typically went to Mass and then had a quiet dinner at home to celebrate. Other denominations, including Anglicans and Lutherans, recognized the day as well. But any commemorations would include the color blue. The Dublin Evening Post reported that in a 1785 St. Patrick’s Day ceremony in Dublin, a group of men identifying themselves as patriots “marched in a grand procession round the garden, dressed in true blue, and carrying along with them a number of curious pageants.”

Constance Markievicz, who fought in the 1916 Easter Rebellion for independence and was the first minister of labour in the Irish Free State, maintained that blue was “the old colour of Ireland.” To connect the past to the nationalist movement, she used blue as the background for the Irish Citizen Army’s flag.

In 1934, Irish politician W.T. Cosgrave asserted that blue is “in perfect, traditional, national accord with our history and in close association with the most revered and venerated memory of our patron Saint.”

Out with the old, in with the new

Since the 12th century, Ireland had been a colony of Great Britain. Like the American Colonists who rebelled against the British crown, a group of rebels called the United Irish launched an insurrection in 1798 in a quest for independence.

Led mostly by middle-class Protestants and in coordination with some Catholics, the United Irish adopted the “wearing of the green” to represent Irish nationalism and their fight against British imperialism.

The rebellion failed, and the British government made Ireland part of the United Kingdom in 1801 to prevent future revolutions. The government also bestowed greater rights to Protestants over Catholics.

Ireland became more sectarian over the course of the 19th century, and nationalism became more associated with Catholicism. In some ways, the two became interchangeable.

With nationalism ascendant and Catholics outnumbering Protestants, green was widely embraced, particularly since it had been worn by the United Irish.

Green crosses the pond

Before the 1840s, most Irish immigrants to America had been Protestants, many of whom had been the descendants of Scottish settlers in Ulster and would later become known as the Scots Irish. Like those that would succeed them, they celebrated St. Patrick’s Day to commemorate their connection to Ireland.

In the earliest recorded American celebration of the day, banquets toasting Ireland and St. Patrick took place in Boston in 1737. By the 1760s, annual parades were being held in New York and on the island of Montserrat to celebrate Irish culture and identity.

Irish immigration to the new world increased dramatically after the Great Hunger of the 1840s, when the potato crops failed and over 1 million indigent Catholics arrived in the U.S. Facing discrimination from American Protestants who claimed they were more loyal to the pope than to the U.S., they viewed St. Patrick’s Day as a link to the history and culture of Ireland. Celebrations were a badge of pride and dignity, and they called for Irish independence to demonstrate they, too, believed in republican principles.

Irish nationalist groups active in the U.S. – the Fenians, Clan na Gael and, later, Irish Northern Aid – participated in these American St. Patrick’s Day parades, proudly wearing green to demonstrate their nationalism and the connection to past nationalist groups such as the United Irish.

In Ireland, however, St. Patrick’s Day remained a solemn day of observance with little revelry. The Irish government didn’t recognize St. Patrick’s Day as a public holiday until 1903, and the first parade in Dublin wasn’t held until 1931. Even pubs remained closed on March 17 until 1961.

Since 1922, when 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland became semi-independent, the tricolor flag of Ireland has been the official flag. Green represents the Catholics, orange represents the Protestants, and the white in the middle symbolizes peace. Yet green remains the color associated with St. Patrick’s Day and Ireland throughout the world, largely due to the Catholic diaspora and its association with nationalism.

However, blue still plays a symbolic role in Ireland: Since 1945, the flag representing the president of Ireland has a gold harp with a dark blue background – the color known as St. Patrick’s blue.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"Queer theatre in the 19th century was a place of codes, cross-dressing and blackmail",https://theconversation.com/queer-theatre-in-the-19th-century-was-a-place-of-codes-cross-dressing-and-blackmail-250689,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:37 GMT","In today’s theatre industry, you don’t have to look far to find queer representation. Although the theatre has long been seen as an accepting place for LGBTQ+ people, in the 19th century, examples of queer lives from the stage profession are difficult to find.

I’m a theatre historian at the University of Warwick, and for queer history month in February, I worked on retrieving histories of LGBTQ+ men.

The best-known queer icon from the theatre prior to the 20th century is Oscar Wilde. Details of his arrest in 1895 for gross indecency, the notorious trials that followed and his imprisonment are well-documented.

Yet there were other high profile court cases involving members of the theatre’s queer community in this period. Thomas Boulton and Frederick Park were actors, performing in semi-professional and amateur shows. In some amateur settings it was common for female roles to be played by men and Boulton and Park had established themselves in this line of acting.

However, their cross-dressing extended beyond the stage. They lived much of their lives as women and in 1870 were arrested in the audience of the Strand Theatre in London while dressed as women. A trial accusing them of the “abominable crime of buggery” took place the following year.

These two examples highlight a common problem that queer historians encounter in our research – that much of what we know about the lives of LGBTQ+ people, before the mid-20th century, has only survived because of the criminalisation of male homosexuality.

I’m one of many historians working to find alternative methods for recovering these histories by attempting to unlock the systems that queer people were forced to use to communicate with one another. These include codified actions, gestures, behaviour, spaces, places, visual motifs and fashions.

Boulton and Park had identified the theatre as the one place in society where it was acceptable to cross-dress and had used it to safely experiment with their gender and sexual identities. With amateur dramatics becoming increasingly popular in the 19th century, in my ongoing research I propose that by looking sideways at other men who exploited this opportunity, a whole range of new queer narratives may be found.

One example I have discovered through this approach is Orlando Bridgeman, who performed female parts at the University of Cambridge in the 1890s. While some men chose to contrast these roles with their masculine features, Bridgeman performed them realistically.

This approach was considered harmful to young men following the Boulton and Park scandal. While performing female parts may not be enough to pinpoint a lost queer history, by widening the scope, other clues come to the fore. In a production of Jupiter in 1894, Bridgeman performed the role of Ganymede – a figure who, since the Renaissance, was associated with homosexual love.

Blackmail and codified queerness

Another young man who cross-dressed in amateur theatricals was Charles Cotsford Dick. He became embroiled in a homosexual blackmail network in the 1890s at a time when the blackmailing of queer men was widespread.

As the theatre has always tackled contemporary social issues, this criminal activity soon became the topic of a play, The Blackmailers, in London in 1894. Besides being the first known time that a homosexual character was seen on stage, it is also likely the first opportunity for a queer actor, Charles Colnaghi, to perform some of their own realities.

One of the most fascinating case studies I’ve been working on is Willy Clarkson – the leading theatrical wigmaker and costumier in Britain.

He was frequently described in the press as “eccentric”, “strange”, “peculiar” and “queer” and had his effeminacy and bachelor status stressed. These were common ways to allude to queer men. His biographer, Harry Greenwall, wrote in The Strange Life of Willy Clarkson in 1936 that while he “lived and died a bachelor … His morals were not my business”.

Meanwhile the gay actor John Gielgud recalled in Plays and Players magazine in 1983 how male customers had to “avoid too close physical contact with [Clarkson], in case his hands should become unduly familiar”. His queerness was seemingly known but not openly discussed.

Close analysis of Clarkson’s life illuminates several possibilities as to how queerness was codified in the 19th century.

When photographed or caricatured, the viewer’s attention is often drawn to his hands and rings. This is also true of images of Wilde and other queer men of the period. It may not be coincidental that the queer actor, Cecil Crofton, retired from the profession to become a ring dealer.

There is ample evidence to propose that there was a codification of rings and hand gestures that enabled men to signal their sexuality to one another. Similarly, handheld fans appear repeatedly in these images.

In a staged photograph of Clarkson, an ostrich-feather fan is placed behind him. While it is well-established that fans were used to communicate, this language was likely extended by queer people.

For over a decade I have been asking whether it might be possible to use what I call a “historical queerdar” to locate queer stories of the past. That is to suggest that the historian may be able to use their own queer identity to read subtle signs in the historical record to aid the identification of queer narratives.

Though legal provisions have been put in place to protect queer people in Britain today, attitudes have been slower to change and queer people continue to be forced to behave differently. As a result, there remains an embodied knowledge within the queer community. I believe that analysis of these unspoken languages may help us to find new queer histories.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Ramadan: why napping might be especially beneficial during fasting,https://theconversation.com/ramadan-why-napping-might-be-especially-beneficial-during-fasting-251683,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:30 GMT","During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset. This unique rhythm often leads to changes in sleeping patterns. With nights shortened and days filled with fasting, many Muslims find themselves battling fatigue and a dip in alertness – and a well-timed nap may provide a much needed boost.

Recently published research on athletes fasting during Ramadan has demonstrated that even a 40-minute nap taken after a strenuous evening session can significantly improve physical and cognitive performance. And, in studies with soccer players, those who napped showed better performance in short-distance shuttle runs and attention tests than those who skipped the nap.

So, why can naps have such a transformative effect on our energy levels?

Siesta science

Naps work by giving the brain and body a chance to reset. When you’re awake for long stretches – especially under the stress of altered meal times and reduced nighttime sleep – the brain accumulates sleep pressure.

A nap, especially in the early afternoon when many experience a natural dip in alertness, can relieve that pressure and enhance mood, reaction time, and even physical endurance. One 2024 study, for instance, showed that a 40-minute nap not only reduced feelings of sleepiness but also improved performance in tasks that require focus and quick thinking. While a 2025 study of female athletes found that both 40-minute and even 90-minute naps could enhance physical performance and mood after a night of sleep restriction.

But it’s not all good news for habitual nappers. Although longer naps sometimes show even greater benefits, they may also lead to temporary grogginess – a phenomenon known as sleep inertia – which can counteract the positive effects if not managed properly.

But there’s evidence that exposure to bright light and face washing could help nappers combat sleep inertia. For some, though, this grogginess can linger long enough to affect productivity, mood, and overall performance.

When it comes to nap duration and timing, the key is to find the “sweet spot”. Short naps – lasting around 20 to 30 minutes – can improve alertness without causing sleep inertia. On the other hand, longer naps, such as those lasting 40 minutes or more, have been shown to boost both mental and physical performance but must be scheduled carefully to avoid interfering with nighttime sleep.

To nap, or not to nap?

During Ramadan, when the body is already adapting to a shifted sleep schedule, a carefully timed nap might be especially beneficial. It can serve as a counterbalance to the reduced sleep quality and quantity that sometimes accompany fasting. However, if taken too late in the day, a nap might delay the onset of your regular sleep cycle, leading to disrupted sleep patterns.

But, when taken at the right time, napping can be a valuable tool for enhancing alertness, mood, and even physical performance – benefits that are particularly relevant during periods of fasting like Ramadan.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt a daily nap should be guided by your personal lifestyle, sleep quality, and overall health goals. For many, a well-timed, moderate-length nap is not only a healthy habit, but also a strategic advantage in managing daily challenges – whether you’re fasting during Ramadan or simply trying to make the most of a hectic day.",theconversation

It’s been over a decade since Adichie published her previous novel, Americanah, following on global successes for Half of a Yellow Sun and Purple Hibiscus.

Adichie’s work is widely studied by academics, not least African literature scholar Daria Tunca. She told us what Dream Count is about and whether it’s worth reading.

What’s the story about?

Dream Count tells the intersecting stories of four African women. The novel recounts the characters’ hopes, dreams and struggles, interweaving flashbacks from their childhood and earlier adulthood with episodes set in the narrative present, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first woman is Chiamaka, a US-based travel writer from a wealthy Nigerian family. She spends much of her adult life looking for the ideal romantic partner.

Penguin Random House

Chiamaka’s narrative is followed by the story of her friend Zikora, a Nigerian lawyer who also lives in the US. She gives birth to a baby boy after her boyfriend has left her.

The third section is devoted to Kadiatou, Chiamaka’s Guinean housekeeper. Kadiatou is sexually assaulted by a powerful guest in the hotel where she works as a cleaner – a story inspired by the real-life case of Nafissatou Diallo and Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

The book ends with the story of Chiamaka’s cousin Omelogor, a banker in Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja. In addition to her banking job, Omelogor maintains a website giving life advice to men, and she spends a short time in a US university conducting research on pornography.

The novel presents an engaging, occasionally humorous, and deeply moving portrait of these women as they negotiate social expectations, especially when it comes to marriage and motherhood.

How does it add to Adichie’s literary output?

Adichie’s fiction has always given pride of place to the experiences of Nigerian women.

Some of her most memorable characters have included the teenage Kambili in Purple Hibiscus (2003), who is caught between conservative and progressive views of Catholicism. Another is the blogger Ifemelu in Americanah (2013), who spends years in the US without ever forgetting her first love, Obinze, whom she left behind in Nigeria.

Dream Count tackles some aspects of the female experience far more explicitly than Adichie’s previous work. For example, the book discusses physical issues related to women’s bodies (from fibroids to the pain of childbirth). It extensively explores misogyny, which is perpetuated in different forms by both men and women.

Above all, Dream Count is about human connections. Much of the novel depicts romantic relationships, friendships between women, and mother-daughter interactions.

Despite life’s challenges, the novel suggests, our loved ones are sometimes more attuned to our emotions than we might be ourselves.

Dream Count also broadens Adichie’s artistic range – for example, the novel features drug-taking scenes in Abuja, which constitute largely uncharted territory in the author’s work.

Was it worth the 12-year wait?

Emphatically, yes.

Dream Count rewards the attentive reader who is willing to let the book slowly add layers of nuance. The novel recounts the women’s lives one by one, revisits narrative episodes from different perspectives, and gradually pieces together the puzzle of the characters’ emotional journeys.

While Dream Count features Adichie’s trademark humour and biting satire, it mostly stands out for its unfiltered portrayal of women who are in turn passionate, vulnerable, infuriating, resilient, and dignified.

There’s a growing body of African work about love and relationships. Why is this important?

Quite simply, it is important because love matters; well-crafted love stories help us grow.

In the African literary context, books like this are all the more important as they show that, in the past few years, African writers have assertively pushed back against the “single story” – the stereotypical portrayal of the continent as plagued by poverty and violence – that Adichie so eloquently condemned in her 2009 TED talk.

Indeed, many western publishers have favoured work by African authors that fits racist prejudices about the continent. Writers have been pressured to produce “poverty porn” that presents a clichéd image of Africa as riddled by war, disease and corruption.

In recent years, creative African fiction published globally has offered more nuanced perspectives and tackled broader themes – starting with love.

However, Dream Count makes the point that western literary gatekeepers have not entirely relented. In the novel, Chiamaka pitches her idea for a travelogue about restaurants and nightclubs to a white editor, only to be asked to write a book about rape in the Congo instead. The twist is that this episode occurs in a commercially published African novel whose central theme is … love, explored in all its complicated messiness.

Let this be a reason for cautious optimism.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,US funding cuts may affect Nigeria’s fight against terrorism. Here’s how,https://theconversation.com/us-funding-cuts-may-affect-nigerias-fight-against-terrorism-heres-how-250871,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:05:09 GMT","The United States decision to cut international aid funding will affect Nigeria in various ways. One is in the fight against terror groups like Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province operating in the country and across the Sahel region of west Africa. Over the years, the US has granted hundreds of millions of dollars as security assistance to Nigeria, as part of a broader partnership to promote regional security and stability. Security scholar Al Chukwuma Okoli explains the possible consequences of the US funding cuts.

What do the US funding cuts mean for counterterrorism in Nigeria?

The freeze in aid might limit Nigeria’s capacity for counterterrorism operations, increase the country’s vulnerability to terrorist recruitment, and motivate Nigerian authorities to explore domestic solutions.

It’s also possible that the development will create an opportunity for terrorists to exploit.

Reduced capacity for counterterrorism operations:

The US has supported the Nigerian military with training, equipment, logistics and intelligence. Stopping this could undermine Nigeria’s capacity to counter the activities of terrorist groups.

Terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, Ansaru and Islamic State West Africa Province have been very active in northern Nigeria, where they wield competitive territorial control in some rural communities of the north-west and north-east regions.

The aid freeze is equally likely to affect humanitarian assistance to populations affected by terrorism in Nigeria. According to the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance, no fewer than 7.9 million were in need of humanitarian assistance in Nigeria by 2024. The US has provided humanitarian support for refugees, captive populations, internally displaced persons, and other victims of terrorism.

A reduction in this flow of aid could make the humanitarian situation in the country even worse than it already is.

Increased vulnerability to terrorist recruitment:

The aid freeze may create an atmosphere conducive to recruiting people into terrorism. Poverty, lack of education and unemployment make communities susceptible to recruitment.

Intervention organisations might be set back in their efforts to provide critical services in education, healthcare and economic empowerment. Already, humanitarian operations have been significantly hindered in parts of the regions occupied by terrorists and bandits.

This could make some communities more vulnerable to radicalisation.

Spurring domestic counterterrorism solutions:

The US aid funding freeze may compel Nigeria to look inward for counterterrorism funding, partnerships and solutions.

It might help the country to reduce reliance on foreign assistance and partnerships.

Relying on local solutions also gives the country the advantage of protecting itself against possible sabotage by foreign elements. Security assistance could be used to subvert the country’s sensitive security interests.

How can terrorist groups exploit the situation?

Terrorist organisations thrive on opportunities to take advantage of a situation. They could exploit operational gaps and capitalise on the humanitarian crisis that the funding freeze may cause.

Exploiting operational gaps

With reduced US counterterrorism support, Nigerian security forces may struggle to cover all areas effectively. Terrorist groups might be able to move and operate more freely.

The end of US intelligence support could weaken Nigeria’s capacity for gathering and analysing intelligence.

This would make it more difficult to anticipate and disrupt terrorist activities in a technically precise and focused manner.

Capitalising on humanitarian crises

Humanitarian crises make populations vulnerable. Terrorist groups often exploit that to spread their extremist messages, recruit new members and win the hearts and minds of local communities.

The withdrawal of US aid funding could complicate humanitarian challenges in Nigeria.

In locations where the Nigerian government is perceived as ineffectual, terrorist groups may provide alternative governance structures, offering basic services and winning the support and acceptance of the people.

The economic and humanitarian consequences of the aid freeze could lead to greater dissatisfaction among young Nigerians. They might form a pool of potential recruits and support-agents for terrorism.

Enhancing propaganda

Terrorists could use the US decision to further their propaganda against the US-Nigeria defence and security partnership.

The propaganda might portray the US as an unreliable and illegitimate partner.

What can be done about these threats?

To block the gaps created by the US freeze of counterterrorism funding, Nigeria needs to look inward. It can consider a number of strategic options:

Diversify funding sources

One option is the European Union, which has been providing significant support to Nigeria’s counterterrorism efforts. The EU has been one of the biggest external financiers of counterterrorism in Nigeria. Through its CTED-UNODC Partnership Project, the EU has facilitated the training of 7,765 criminal justice personnel on aspects of counterterrorism investigation, prosecution and adjudication.

Other options include the United Kingdom, China, and African military powers such as Egypt.

China has increasing interests in security governance in Africa.

Regional cooperation

Nigeria needs to strengthen its cooperation and security alliances with neighbouring countries. A case in point is the Multinational Joint Task Force, a regional security formation aimed at combating Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region.

The Economic Community of West African States and the Lake Chad Development Commission can also be explored for collective security potential.

Domestic resource mobilisation

Nigeria can increase its domestic budget allocation for counterterrorism efforts and use the resources effectively.

Private sector partnerships can be explored, in addition to calling on goodwill, expertise and cooperation.

Improve operational efficiency

Nigeria can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its security sector to reduce waste and use resources optimally.

It can explore opportunities for intelligence-led operations. This involves using data and analysis.

They operate across sectors like transport, energy and public utilities, and some are among the largest employers in those sectors.

Entities like these are created and controlled by a country’s government to provide essential services and drive economic development. In South Africa, they were formed in the 20th century, when the government recognised the need to support local industries by providing services such as rail transport, financing and electricity.

As the country industrialised, more state-owned entities were established to serve businesses and communities and to create jobs. In the early 21st century they were also tasked with generating revenue for the state.

But when South Africa’s state-owned enterprises are mentioned in civil society discourse, it’s often for all the wrong reasons. They’re beset by poor service delivery, financial difficulties and allegations of corruption. Their performance has significantly deteriorated in the past 15 years. Unclear mandates, poor management, and insufficient infrastructure and resources are among the reasons.

This has overshadowed their potential to contribute to research, development and innovation which could support economic growth.

We at the Centre for Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators at the Human Sciences Research Council have conducted research to identify what state-owned enterprises need to do to bolster research and development (R&D) and innovation.

We used three state-owned enterprises as case studies. They operate in different sectors: forestry, aviation and energy. They were chosen for their apparent innovation through R&D or other activities. We identified five ways to assess whether a state-owned enterprise is ready and able to achieve its objectives via R&D and innovation: its human capabilities, technological capability, collaborations and partnerships, research infrastructure and governance.

The three organisations successfully integrated R&D and innovation into their strategies. But improvements were needed in the areas of capacity, resources and organisation.

Although state-owned enterprises are unique entities, the framework we developed using those five areas helped us to understand their innovative traits as players within a specific sector. It is a valuable assessment tool that can guide individual state-owned enterprises and policymakers in improving the enterprises’ R&D and innovation outputs. Ultimately, this might contribute to economic growth and the development of specific sectors.

Case study: a forest of opportunities

The South African Forestry Company SOC Limited, founded in 1992, was one of the three organisations we studied. It has a dual mandate. One is commercial, focused on timber harvesting, processing and related activities, both nationally and internationally. The second is socio-economic: to deliver returns to its shareholder, the Department of Public Enterprises, while promoting rural economic development.

In South Africa, the company manages 189,760 hectares of forest, including 121,585ha of commercial plantation. In Mozambique, it manages 82,547ha of forest; 15,258ha of this is commercial plantation. It processes about 10% of South Africa’s logs and produces over ten million seedlings annually.

Here’s how the organisation performed in 2022 (the year we conducted our research) in the five assessment areas.

Human capacity: The R&D team makes up less than 1% of its workforce of about 5,000 people. The organisation’s training academy provides a wide range of programmes for employees and the communities close to its operations. It supports capacity building in the sector through postgraduate bursaries.

Technological capacity: The organisation’s ability to use R&D and technology to achieve its business goals spans the entire timber value chain. The organisation also has non-timber capabilities. These include community-based forestry, training and eco-tourism.

Collaboration: There are strong collaborations with universities, research councils, communities and global and local organisations. This helps to build capacity and to solve different operational problems. It also grows relationships with communities.

Research infrastructure: The company conducts R&D at its nursery in Tweefontein in the Western Cape province and R&D centre at Sabie in Mpumalanga province. For instance, timber tissue culture research is done at the centre to improve lumber yields over time. The centre has state-of-the-art equipment and more is being sourced.

Governance: The organisation recognises the importance of R&D and continues to invest in it. An innovation portfolio is part of its executive structure. However, it hasn’t achieved its capital investment goals. It also does not have strategies for intellectual property management or technology transfer.

Room for improvement

All three of our case studies had made R&D and innovation activities part of their strategic planning. They also had clear examples of innovative performance and did well when it came to collaboration.

Still, there was a lot of room for improvement. All three entities needed to hire more researchers and technicians. All three also face the challenge of using the technological knowledge and systems they have developed over years towards generating income from innovation. This can be done through commercialising intellectual property.

Research infrastructure is an area of concern for all three entities. They need more long-term investment. We also found that long-standing R&D programmes needed to be refreshed. More proactive approaches to innovation and the commercialisation of intellectual property could help.

Going forward

We believe that our analysis and the resulting indicators can be used by all South African state-owned enterprises to assess what they need to achieve more R&D and innovation. It’s a tool for them to track their progress in becoming more innovative, and going beyond their core service delivery mandates.",theconversation

After a rocky start to those negotiations, officials from the U.S. and Ukraine announced an agreement on March 11, 2025. The U.S. would resume support and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, with some conditions, and both agreed to work toward “a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security.”

The initial announcement from Ukraine’s government stated that critical minerals would also “offset the cost of American assistance,” but that line was removed from the joint statement. Getting Russia to agree to a ceasefire would be the next step.

There’s no doubt that Ukraine has an abundance of critical minerals, or that these resources will be essential to its postwar reconstruction. But what exactly do those resources include, and how abundant and accessible are they?

The war has severely limited access to data about Ukraine’s natural resources. However, as a geoscientist with experience in resource evaluation, I have been reading technical reports, many of them behind paywalls, to understand what’s at stake. Here’s what we know.

Ukraine’s minerals fuel industries and militaries

Ukraine’s mineral resources are concentrated in two geologic provinces. The larger of these, known as the Ukrainian Shield, is a wide belt running through the center of the country, from the northwest to the southeast. It consists of very old, metamorphic and granitic rocks.

A multibillion-year history of fault movement and volcanic activity created a diversity of minerals concentrated in local sites and across some larger regions.

A second province, close to Ukraine’s border with Russia in the east, includes a rift basin known as the Dnipro-Donets Depression. It is filled with sedimentary rocks containing coal, oil and natural gas.

Before Ukraine’s independence in 1991, both areas supplied the Soviet Union with materials for its industrialization and military. A massive industrial area centered on steelmaking grew in the southeast, where iron, manganese and coal are especially plentiful.

By the 2000s, Ukraine was a significant producer and exporter of these and other minerals. It also mines uranium, used for nuclear power.

In addition, Soviet and Ukrainian geoscientists identified deposits of lithium and rare earth metals that remain undeveloped.

However, technical reports suggest that assessments of these and some other critical minerals are based on outdated geologic data, that a significant number of mines are inactive due to the war, and that many employ older, inefficient technology.

That suggests critical mineral production could be increased by peacetime foreign investment, and that these minerals could provide even greater value than they do today to whomever controls them.

Why the US is so interested

Critical minerals are defined as resources that are essential to economic or national security and subject to supply risks. They include minerals used in military equipment, computers, batteries and many other products.

A list of 50 critical minerals, created by the U.S. Geological Survey, shows that more than a dozen relied upon by the U.S. are abundant in Ukraine.

A majority of those are in the Ukrainian Shield, and roughly 20% of Ukraine’s total possible reserves are in areas currently occupied by Russia’s military forces.

Critical minerals Ukraine currently mines

Three critical minerals especially abundant in Ukraine are manganese, titanium and graphite. Between 80% and 100% of U.S. demand for each of these currently comes from foreign imports..

Manganese is an essential element in steelmaking and batteries. Ukraine is estimated to have the largest total reserves in the world at 2.4 billion tons. However, the deposits are of fairly low grade – only about 11% to 35% of the rock mined is manganese. So it tends to require a lot of material and expensive processing, adding to the total cost.

This is also true for graphite, used in battery electrodes and a variety of industrial applications. Graphite occurs in ore bodies located in the south-central and northwestern portion of the Ukrainian Shield. At least six deposits have been identified there, with an estimated total of 343 million tons of ore– 18.6 million tons of actual graphite. It’s the largest source in Europe and the fifth largest globally.

Titanium, a key metal for aerospace, ship and missile technology, is present in as many as 28 locations in Ukraine, both in hard rock and sand or gravel deposits. The size of the total reserve is confidential, but estimates are commonly in the hundreds of millions of tons.

A number of other critical minerals that are used in semiconductor and battery technologies are less plentiful in Ukraine but also valuable. Zinc occurs in deposits with other metals such as lead, gold, silver and copper. Gallium and germanium are byproducts of other ores – zinc for gallium, lignite coal for germanium. Nickel and cobalt can be found in ultramafic rock, with nickel more abundant.

No figures for Ukraine’s reserves of these elements were available in early 2025, with the exception of zinc, whose reserves have been estimated at around 6.1 million tons, putting Ukraine among the top 10 nations for zinc.

Critical minerals that aren’t being mined – yet

Geologists have identified potentially significant volumes in Ukraine of three other types of critical minerals important for energy, military and other uses: lithium, rare earth metals and scandium.

None of these had been mined there as of early 2025, though a lithium deposit had been licensed for commercial extraction.

The largest potential lithium reserves exist at three sites in the south-central and southeastern Ukrainian Shield, where the grade of ore is considered moderate to good. How much lithium these reserves hold remains confidential, but technical reports suggest it’s on the order of 160 million tons of ore and 1.6 million to 3 million tons of lithium oxide. If most of this could be recovered in a profitable way, it would place Ukraine among the top five nations for lithium.

Smaller volumes of tantalum and niobium, also used in steel alloys and technology, have also been identified in these reserves. Most of Ukraine’s lithium occurs as petalite, which, unlike the other main lithium mineral, spodumene, requires more expensive processing.

Rare earth elements in Ukraine are known to exist in several sites of volcanic origin and in association with uranium in the south-central portion of the Ukrainian Shield. These haven’t been developed, though sampling has indicated commercial potential in some sites, while other sites appear less viable.

Rare earth elements in high demand for superior magnets and electronics – neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium – are all present in varying amounts in these areas. Other critical minerals are associated with these deposits, especially zirconium, tantalum and niobium, in undetermined but potentially significant amounts.

Finally, scandium, used in aluminum alloys for aerospace components, has been identified as a byproduct of processing titanium ores. Ukraine’s scandium does not appear to have been studied in enough detail to evaluate its commercial potential. However, world production, about 30 to 40 tons per year, is forecast to grow rapidly.

Ukraine’s mineral future

It’s clear that Ukraine is endowed with valuable resources. However, extracting them will require roads and railways for access, infrastructure such as electricity and mining and processing technology, investment, technical expertise, environmental considerations and, above all, cessation of military conflict.

Those are the true determinants of Ukraine’s mining future.

The novel coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, began as a “cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause” reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It had spread to 118,000 cases reported in 114 countries by March 11.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general at the time, said in a media briefing that day that “the WHO is deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.” He urged leaders to move quickly to scale up their emergency responses, saying that “all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.”

Public health agencies like the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention played critical roles throughout the pandemic in coordinating with local health departments to detect, trace and test for the virus. The WHO and CDC websites received unprecedented traffic as they became invaluable go-to sources for the most up-to-date resources on means of prevention, case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths. The National Institutes of Health was instrumental in its development of COVID-19 treatments and contributions to vaccine research.

Now, five years later, the Trump administration has cut more than 5,000 employees at the NIH and the CDC combined, and is withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO.

At the same time, the U.S. is facing outbreaks of tuberculosis, a resurgence of measles among unvaccinated communities, and the worst flu season in 15 years.

Much of the work of the WHO, CDC and other public health agencies occurs behind the scenes, only occasionally drawing public attention. To put these roles into perspective, it can be helpful to examine public health before these unifying entities existed.

A spreading epidemic, slow communications

As the author of the 2020 book “Constructing the Outbreak: Epidemics in Media and Collective Memory” and “Capturing COVID: Media & the Pandemic in the Digital Era,” published in 2025, I have extensively studied how public health crises have unfolded. And through my research as a health communication scholar, I have analyzed the integral role of nonprofits and public agencies in protecting public health.

Both the WHO and the CDC were set up in the 1940s. Before an international or even national network of public health agencies existed, there were no coordinated communication means, external investigations or formalized ways of recording data across geographic areas. Without a means of sharing information, it was much more difficult for outbreaks and epidemics to be linked between regions.

One notable example was the 1918 influenza pandemic, a deadly combination of influenza and pneumonia that first emerged in a Kansas army base in the spring of 1918. From there, the epidemic moved overseas, spreading throughout Asia and Europe by late summer. When it returned to the U.S. in August, the disease had been mislabeled the “Spanish flu.” The lack of media coverage of the spring outbreak, paired with the lack of disease tracking, meant that most people believed the lethal strains had begun in Europe.

No one formally tracked these outbreaks until the disease returned with American troops in August 1918. In September, the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service attempted to gauge the magnitude and transmission of influenza by sending telegrams to state health officers.

Public Health Reports

By that point, it was much too late for mass preparation. The few stories of the spring outbreaks had been buried in a flood of competing news stories about the world war. Therefore, people knew almost nothing about the raging disease until it infected their own town. Short on resources and caregivers, communities struggled to create makeshift hospitals and find healthy residents to nurse the ill.

For example, at the University of Kansas during the influenza pandemic, female professors cared for sick students, faculty and staff, washed linens and prepared food. Since agencies like the WHO and CDC didn’t yet exist and the world war further impeded communication, little information was documented and shared across geographic regions, such as the sharing of information on how to prevent the disease from spreading, possible treatments or even the number of cases and deaths.

The influenza pandemic quickly faded in the public’s collective memory, due in part to an absence of personal narratives and follow-up stories after cases subsided – at least until COVID-19 sparked renewed public interest in the 100-year-old crisis.

Polio epidemic saw a more coordinated response

Starting in the 1930s, public health responses to polio outbreaks demonstrated the advantages of nationally coordinated efforts. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis helped battle polio through fundraising, running extensive campaigns to educate the public, supporting scientific research and helping victims from the acute hospital stage through rehabilitation. This effort was especially apparent in the 1952 polio epidemic.

In the summer of 1952, U.S. polio cases escalated, eventually totaling 57,628 – more than one-third of which included various stages of paralysis. Throughout the epidemic, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis coordinated with local chapters of its organization. Together, the foundation kept people informed of the growing epidemic, created emergency polio-focused hospital wings, recruited nurses and other health professionals, and shared resources to the areas with outbreaks.

Widespread vaccination efforts led to a deep reduction in polio cases in the U.S. by the 1960s, prompting the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to change its name and mission to the March of Dimes. The organization served as a model for nonprofits and public health agencies for communicating and coordinating between local and national entities.

The critical role of public health agencies

The CDC opened in 1946 as a small organization based in Atlanta, aimed at fighting malaria in the U.S. Two years later, representatives from 53 countries ratified the constitution of the WHO. This global entity brought countries together across continents to tackle disease surveillance, prevention, treatment and research.

As these agencies expanded into new areas of public health over the 1950s and 1960s, they mirrored many of the approaches and strategies utilized by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis: tracking and recording data public, educating the public, investigating threats, aiding in moments of crisis and supporting scientific research. Together, the CDC and the WHO greatly improved public health, from the global eradication of smallpox and the decline of vaccine-preventable diseases to the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS treatments.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the roles of these agencies often didn’t garner much attention, as field agents traveled to examine something as routine as salmonella or as frightening as hemorrhagic fever cases.

While public opinions of the CDC and the WHO shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, recent survey results indicate that the majority of Americans trust public health agencies at least to some degree. A 2024 survey found that nearly 60% of American adults believe that the U.S. benefited from its WHO membership.

Unfortunately, when infectious diseases move out of the spotlight and are seen as less urgent, the critical roles of these public health agencies fade into the distant collective memory, much like the 1918 and COVID-19 pandemics. People soon enough forget the need for ongoing scientific research, educational programs and teams that can quickly respond to local, national and international levels.

Disease continues to be a threat, as the outbreaks of measles, tuberculosis, influenza and other pathogens remind us. People are still sick or dying of COVID-19: As of March 1, 6,725 people had died in the U.S. from COVID-19 just in 2025, and nearly 7.1 million have died worldwide since January 2020.

Without strong, coordinated efforts between public health agencies, even small health calamities can escalate into full-blown epidemics or even pandemics, which the world will be far less prepared to handle.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The world regulated sulfur in ship fuels − and the lightning stopped,https://theconversation.com/the-world-regulated-sulfur-in-ship-fuels-and-the-lightning-stopped-249445,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:03:23 GMT","If you look at a map of lightning near the Port of Singapore, you’ll notice an odd streak of intense lightning activity right over the busiest shipping lane in the world. As it turns out, the lightning really is responding to the ships, or rather the tiny particles they emit.

Using data from a global lightning detection network, my colleagues and I have been studying how exhaust plumes from ships are associated with an increase in the frequency of lightning.

For decades, ship emissions steadily rose as increasing global trade drove higher ship traffic. Then, in 2020, new international regulations cut ships’ sulfur emissions by 77%. Our newly published research shows how lightning over shipping lanes dropped by half almost overnight after the regulations went into effect.

Chris Wright

That unplanned experiment demonstrates how thunderstorms, which can be 10 miles tall, are sensitive to the emission of particles that are smaller than a grain of sand. The responsiveness of lightning to human pollution helps us get closer to understanding a long-standing mystery: To what extent, if any, have human emissions influenced thunderstorms?

Aerosol particles can affect clouds?

Aerosol particles, also known as particulate matter, are everywhere. Some are kicked up by wind or produced from biological sources, such as tropical and boreal forests. Others are generated by human industrial activity, such as transportation, agricultural burning and manufacturing.

It’s hard to imagine, but in a single liter of air – about the size of a water bottle – there are tens of thousands of tiny suspended clusters of liquid or solid. In a polluted city, there can be millions of particles per liter, mostly invisible to the naked eye.

These particles are a key ingredient in cloud formation. They serve as seeds, or nuclei, for water vapor to condense into cloud droplets. The more aerosol particles, the more cloud droplets.

In shallow clouds, such as the puffy-looking cumulus clouds you might see on a sunny day, having more seeds has the effect of making the cloud brighter, because the increase in droplet surface area scatters more light.

In storm clouds, however, those additional droplets freeze into ice crystals, making the effects of aerosol particles on storms tricky to pin down. The freezing of cloud droplets releases latent heat and causes ice to splinter. That freezing, combined with the powerful thermodynamic instabilities that generate storms, produces a system that is very chaotic, making it difficult to isolate how any one factor is influencing them.

We can’t generate a thunderstorm in the lab. However, we can study the accidental experiment taking place in the busiest shipping corridor in the world.

Ship emissions and lightning

With engines that are often three stories tall and burn viscous fuel oil, ships traveling into and out of ports emit copious quantities of soot and sulfur particles. The shipping lanes near the Port of Singapore are the most highly trafficked in the world – roughly 20% of the world’s bunkering oil, used by ships, is purchased there.

In order to limit toxicity to people near ports, the International Maritime Organization – a United Nations agency that oversees shipping rules and security – began regulating sulfur emissions in 2020. At the Port of Singapore, the sales of high-sulfur fuel plummeted, from nearly 100% of ship fuel before the regulation to 25% after, replaced by low-sulfur fuels.

But what do shipping emissions have to do with lightning?

Scientists have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain the correlation between lightning and pollution, all of which revolve around the crux of electrifying a cloud: collisions between snowflake-like ice crystals and denser chunks of ice.

When the charged, lightweight ice crystals are lofted as the denser ice falls, the cloud becomes a giant capacitor, building electrical energy as the ice crystals bump past each other. Eventually, that capacitor discharges, and out shoots a lightning bolt, five times hotter than the surface of the Sun.

We think that, somehow, the aerosol particles from the ships’ smokestacks are generating more ice crystals or more frequent collisions in the clouds.

In our latest study, my colleagues and I describe how lightning over the shipping lane fell by about 50% after 2020. There were no other factors, such as El Niño influences or changes in thunderstorm frequency, that could explain the sudden drop in lightning activity. We concluded that the lightning activity had fallen because of the regulation.

The reduction of sulfur in ship fuels meant fewer seeds for water droplet condensation and, as a result, fewer charging collisions between ice crystals. Ultimately, there have been fewer storms that are sufficiently electrified to produce a lightning stroke.

What’s next?

Less lightning doesn’t necessarily mean less rain or fewer storms.

There is still much to learn about how humans have changed storms and how we might change them in the future, intentionally or not. Do aerosol particles actually invigorate storms in general, creating more extensive, violent vertical motion? Or are the effects of aerosols specific to the idiosyncrasies of lightning generation? Have humans altered lightning frequency globally?

My colleagues and I are working to answer these questions. We hope that by understanding the effects of aerosol particles on lightning, thunderstorm precipitation and cloud development, we can better predict how the Earth’s climate will respond as human emissions continue to fluctuate.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"From TB to HIV/AIDS to cancer, disease tracking has always had a political dimension, but it’s the foundation of public health",https://theconversation.com/from-tb-to-hiv-aids-to-cancer-disease-tracking-has-always-had-a-political-dimension-but-its-the-foundation-of-public-health-249928,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:49:40 GMT","Federal datasets began disappearing from public view on Jan. 31, 2025, in response to executive orders from President Donald Trump. Among those were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which asks respondents about their gender identity and sexual orientation and tracks behaviors like smoking and drug use; CDC’s HIV dataset; and CDC and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease registry’s Environmental Justice Index, which tracks pollution in communities, and Social Vulnerability Index, which identifies communities at high risk for disease and disability.

The collection of public health surveillance data has never been politically neutral. It has always reflected ideas about individual rights. With our colleagues James Colgrove and Daniel Wolfe, we have written about the history and ethics of surveillance. Despite controversy, it remains public health’s foundational tool.

Surveillance typically involves tracking individuals with diseases by name for the purpose of direct action, including isolation, quarantine and treatment. It allows health officials to identify environmental threats and evaluate treatments. It allows governments to direct prevention and treatment resources where they are needed most, be that to a region or a group at highest risk. By the early 20th century, public health officials argued that without surveillance, they worked “in the darkness of ignorance” and “might as well hunt birds by shooting into every green bush.”

Three major controversies in the history of public health underscore what is at stake with the collection and maintenance of this information.

Tuberculosis – doctors resist sharing names

The collection of tuberculosis data provided the basic blueprint for public health surveillance.

Debates over tuberculosis reporting began in the late 19th century, when the bacterial infection was reframed not as a disease of the elite but of the urban poor. New York City was the first in the country to require that physicians report the names of TB patients in an effort to address the leading cause of death in both the city and the U.S.

The medical community bitterly resisted tuberculosis surveillance. A prominent New York City surgeon argued that surveillance represented a “dictatorial … encroachment” of the health department that threatened to rob physicians of their patients.

But most people were not under the care of a private physician, and tuberculosis surveillance was a way to ensure that the largely immigrant poor living in the tenement districts got referrals to clinics, nourishment and, if necessary, isolation. Despite physicians’ attempts to kill these efforts, there was no public outcry about tracking “the great white plague” despite extensive, sensational coverage of the controversy in the popular press.

HIV/AIDS – resistant patients at the forefront

Debates around TB surveillance unfolded during a period in which both public health and medicine were highly paternalistic and authoritarian: Health department physicians or private physicians made medical decisions, not patients.

That changed with the AIDS epidemic, the first major infectious disease threat in more than a generation. AIDS arrived as American politics took a sharp conservative turn with the election of President Ronald Reagan. When in 1985 it became possible to test for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, the prospect of named surveillance triggered deep fears about stigma and discrimination.

Catherine McGann via Getty Images

The prospect of reporting the names of those with HIV prompted one gay activist to declare, “First comes the national registry, then come the boxcars, then come the camps for people with AIDS.” Gay rights advocates, who prioritized privacy, rejected HIV surveillance as a threat.

An alliance of gay rights leaders and civil liberties advocates was initially able to prevent health departments from undertaking named HIV surveillance. But by the end of the 1980s, there was growing pressure to return HIV/AIDS to “the medical mainstream,” meaning that it could be managed therapeutically like other chronic conditions. As effective treatment became available in the 1990s, opposition faded, and all 50 states required named reporting.

Cancer – patients demand to be counted

If TB and HIV/AIDS reporting began as histories of resistance, the story was very different when it came to cancer reporting, which lagged far behind infectious disease surveillance.

In the wake of the environmental and women’s movements, citizen activists, mothers of children with birth defects and women with breast cancer became alarmed about the threat of cancer linked to pesticides or industrial pollutants. Women with cancer asserted a “right to be counted.” Although the National Cancer Act of 1971 directed the National Cancer Institute to “collect, analyze, and disseminate all data useful in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer,” by the 1980s, 10 states still had no registry.

Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, then an independent member of the U.S. House of Representatives, called for a federally funded program to collect data on cancer in every state. Speaking in support of his bill in 1992, Sanders repeatedly invoked communities’ right to know: “We need to know the age of people who are coming down with cancer. We need to know where they live. We need to know the kind of work they do. We need their racial and ethnic backgrounds.”

President George H.W. Bush signed the Cancer Registries Amendment Act, which mandated cancer surveillance, into law in 1992. But it was not until 2000 that all states established cancer registries.

Surveillance is foundational for public health

In the broader history of surveillance, two key lessons have emerged.

First, despite some pitched battles, communities have more often viewed surveillance as serving their interests.

Second, the system of public health surveillance in the U.S. remains an underfunded patchwork. The Pew Environmental Health Commission called birth defects surveillance “woefully inadequate.” In 1972, the U.S. House Committee on Government Operations described occupational disease surveillance as “70 years behind infectious disease surveillance and counting.” In 2010, we ourselves observed that it was now “a century behind and counting.”

The scope of the changes that the Trump administration has planned for federal data systems and datasets is unclear. Per a federal court order, key public health surveillance systems and datasets are back online. But the landing pages for both the Social Vulnerability Index and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey display a caveat based in politics rather than science that “any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”

Systems can be compromised if datasets are scrubbed of key variables that enable public health action with populations at highest risk, are halted, or are removed from the public eye. Communities cannot act on what they cannot count.",theconversation

Researchers like me, who study death and dying, hoped that such scenes would spur more Americans to embrace end-of-life planning by discussing their wishes with family members and by completing an advance directive, which formalizes those wishes into a legal document.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic about 1 in 3 Americans had an advance directive. That number has not increased post-COVID, even among those age 65 and older who were most vulnerable to hospitalization and death during the pandemic.

In the past five years, health care professionals and patient advocacy groups have tried to make advance care planning easier by increasing public education and availability of advance directives in medical settings. But health care professionals frequently lack the time to broach these topics at routine visits or don’t feel comfortable having such conversations with their patients.

Conversations about death are difficult and trigger a great deal of anxiety for most individuals. I teach an undergraduate course on death and dying, which aims to decrease that anxiety and help people communicate more comfortably about issues relating to death. Students who take it report more comfort negotiating these difficult conversations with loved ones. But most Americans don’t receive such training.

My team’s research suggests that the biggest barrier to engaging in end-of-life planning is a lack of knowledge about advance directives and what it takes to complete one.

What is advance care planning?

Advance care planning is the process of communicating with your loved ones about your medical wishes in case you are incapacitated and unable to make health care decisions for yourself. For example, you might discuss whether or in what circumstances you would want to be placed on a ventilator or kept alive on life support.

Many people find it helpful to state these wishes in an advance directive, a legally binding document in which they can also designate a health care agent. The agent agrees to uphold and advocate for these wishes in case of a medical emergency – for example, if the person is in a coma after a car accident. Medical facilities are required to honor an advance directive.

An advance directive does not address funeral planning or what to do with a person’s belongings. Those issues are addressed in a will or estate planning.

Why people abstain from advance care planning

One major barrier to advance care planning is that many people simply don’t know much about it.

In a study I conducted with colleagues that will be presented at an upcoming conference, only 6% of 300 participants could clearly define advance care planning, and only 2% could accurately define advanced directives.

Even if people were aware of these concepts, they often had inaccurate ideas about them, our study showed. For example, many people assumed that advance directives are expensive, require a lawyer to complete like a will or estate planning, and are time-consuming.

In reality, advance directives can be completed for free. These documents are available online and through most medical facilities, and they can take as little as 30 minutes to fill out. Advance directives are specific to the state in which you live and typically require the signatures of two witnesses who are not invested in your health care decisions, but they do not need to be notarized.

Although filling out the necessary document is less burdensome than many people assume, doing so requires speaking with family and friends to determine who understands your wishes and who would be willing to act as your health care agent. That requires more time and effort.

In focus groups we conducted with adults ages 20 to 68 and presented at a 2021 conference, most participants assumed their doctor would make decisions about interventions such as life support. In reality, people’s next of kin are tasked with making these difficult decisions.

What if your next of kin refuses to remove you from life support but you do not wish to be kept alive? What if your next of kin are your three children and they cannot agree about what to do? What if it is an estranged spouse or parent? These scenarios play out every day in medical facilities throughout the country, exacerbating the pain and anxiety already associated with end of life.

Even among hospice workers and funeral home directors who work directly with grieving family members, our research found that 39% did not have a designated health care agent. Their reasons included not feeling urgency for appointing a health care agent, lacking time or knowledge about advance care planning, and not having anyone to designate as a health care agent.

How to tackle advance care planning

The first step to carrying out advance care planning is to think about what you want. Do you want to be kept alive by any means necessary? Or would you prefer to not be kept alive with a feeding tube if you are in a coma or persistent vegetative state?

Second, identify one or more people who you feel could make sound decisions on your behalf in a medical emergency. You can usually designate up to three people who can serve as a health care agent in case your first agent cannot be reached. Once you have identified at least one person, carve out time to talk with them about whether they are willing to take on the role and what your wishes are for your end-of-life care.

You can explore resources provided by organizations such as The Conversation Project and the National Institute on Aging to help you navigate these steps.

The next step is simple – download an advance directive form or obtain one from your hospital and fill out the name of your designated agent and their contact information. You can also fill out the section indicating your wishes about life support and other lifesaving measures so that there are no doubts about your wishes. Ask two friends or co-workers to witness and sign.

You can speak with your doctor’s office about adding your advance directive to your electronic medical records, give a copy to your health care agent and keep a copy at home in a prominent place. Then you can breathe a sign of relief knowing that in the event of a sudden illness or accident, you are saving your loved ones from a gut-wrenching decision or a big argument about your care.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,How Trump’s foreign aid and diplomatic cuts will make it harder for the US to wield soft power to maintain its friendships and win new ones,https://theconversation.com/how-trumps-foreign-aid-and-diplomatic-cuts-will-make-it-harder-for-the-us-to-wield-soft-power-to-maintain-its-friendships-and-win-new-ones-249442,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:49:16 GMT","The Trump administration has proposed shuttering USAID and cutting some of the State Department’s critical diplomatic programs; it has also announced tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. As scholar Borja Santos Porras has noted, these measures may lead to modest savings, however, the long-term damage to the reputation of the U.S. abroad will likely outweigh any such gains.

As an expert on how nations manage their reputations, particularly in terms of rebuilding diminished ones, I believe the recent foreign-aid cuts are undermining a critical foreign-policy tool that is often undervalued, if not outright ignored, within the Trump administration: soft power.

Soft power is the ability of nations, in this case the U.S., to use its appeal – and others’ affinity and often friendship toward it – to induce cooperation. In other words, it is a strategy to get others to do what the U.S. government wants them to do, but without coercion.

Since the end of World War II, it has been this soft power that has been the heart and soul of American foreign policy.

How nations manage their reputations

The phrase soft power was coined by a professor at Harvard University, Joseph S. Nye Jr., in 1990. It refers to the ability of nations to influence other countries in pursuit of their interests without having to bully them into doing so.

The central idea is that others are likely to be compelled to partake in friendly behaviors, such as taking a more favorable trade stance or investing in your nation, when they understand your needs and have affinity toward you.

The core benefit of soft power lies in its cost to implement. It is lower-risk and lower-cost than hard power strategies, such as tariffs, sanctions or even the threat of military force. Hard power also requires the maintenance of a strong military to coerce or bully others through abrasive interactions and to constantly mitigate threats.

Soft power is a product of how others perceive the nation’s culture, including its internal and external economic, social and political values and policies. If others generally have affinity and respect for those characteristics, they are more likely to listen to you, to respect your positions and interests, and to follow your example. The goal is to develop a more sustainable, long-term relationship than one based on coercion and control.

To [wield soft power], the U.S. has since the 1960s used the distribution of foreign aid through USAID as central to the promotion of a positive image of itself to others. Over the past 60 years, USAID has worked to eradicate or combat smallpox, polio and malaria; it has worked to decrease infant and maternal mortality rates and contributed to the overall decrease of global rates of extreme poverty and food insecurity.

Such actions, combined with the broader appeal of the U.S. economy and popular culture, have produced a world where the U.S. government frequently gets what it wants without having to resort to hard power. In contrast with a nation like China that relies much more on coercive economic relationships, the U.S. has been effective at maintaining an extensive network of friends with common values and interests. At this time, the Chinese approach is beginning to make inroads with some African and Asian nations, which, I argue, makes it even more critical for the U.S. to maintain its soft power presence.

Financial costs of reputation

A 2017 study conducted by three professors at Drexel LeBow College of Business found that every spot a nation dropped on a ranking of global reputations produced a 2% decrease in export volume to that nation. They found that a move up the rankings produced an equally positive result.

In the context of the U.S. trade relationship with a nation like Canada, they noted that this would amount to as much of a decrease as US$5 billion in exports for each spot in the rankings dropped. The tariff threat has produced a deterioration of Canadian perceptions of the U.S., with more than 1 in 4 viewing the U.S. as an “enemy” and 68% perceiving it less favorably after the threat of American tariffs against Canada.

The financial costs to the U.S. are likely to be in the billions of dollars. Taking into account other trade partnerships under similar threats, the total costs of this strategy are likely to be substantial.

Limits of soft power

Soft power has limitations as well. For example, during the buildup to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the U.S. worked extensively to win over global public support, particularly from France and Germany. Despite the strong affinity and partnership with those nations, the Bush administration found that soft power’s influence only goes so far.

In some cases, persuasion and affinity simply aren’t enough to overcome national security concerns. In these instances, the U.S. can still choose to act unilaterally using its hard power, like the Trump administration’s approach to trade. However, such actions often produce significant, long-term reputational damage.

This doesn’t imply that diplomatic options are lost. Rather that some combination of soft and hard power, or what Nye coined as “smart” power, makes diplomacy and engagement possible in even the most difficult cases. In American foreign policy, smart power entails proactively preventing threats and challenges to U.S. interests and security. This is done through diplomatic engagement, development projects through programs like USAID and the State Department, and collaboration with friends and allies.

The key for the U.S., I argue, is to use soft power when it can and hard power only when it must. It will be this balance that will ensure the U.S. maintains its extensive network of allies and partners. Such alliances have been the backbone of U.S. foreign policy and have distinguished the U.S. from other past global superpowers.",theconversation

Legal experts explain how these lawsuits suppress free speech,https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-slapp-suit-legal-experts-explain-how-these-lawsuits-suppress-free-speech-251098,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:49:02 GMT","Strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP suits, are civil claims brought against people or organizations who voice opinions publicly. These lawsuits are intended to intimidate opponents and suppress advocacy efforts by forcing critics to spend time and money on expensive litigation.

The term “SLAPP suit” was coined by law professor George W. Pring and sociologist Penelope Canan in their 1996 book “SLAPPS: Getting Sued for Speaking Out.” The authors provided examples of SLAPPs filed in response to advocacy on many issues, including civil rights, environmental preservation, consumer protection and women’s rights.

SLAPP suits often exploit power and financial imbalances. Responding to lawsuits is expensive. Lawyers are pricey, and so are court costs and litigation expenses, such as collecting evidence, interviewing potential witnesses and purchasing specialized software to manage electronic data.

Lawsuits also are mentally and emotionally taxing. Requirements such as disclosing documents, making court appearances and being subject to questioning can make heavy demands on participants’ time and attention. Litigation can last for years.

These burdens, or even the prospect of them, can have a chilling effect on free speech.

SLAPPing Greenpeace

Conflicts between developers and environmental activists are ripe for SLAPP suits, sometimes labeled eco-SLAPPs. For example, a civil trial began in North Dakota on Feb. 26, 2025, in which Energy Transfer, a Texas company that builds pipelines, is suing the environmental organizations Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International.

Greenpeace was involved in protests in 2016 and 2017 against construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, which connects oil production areas in North Dakota to energy markets in Illinois. Along with other advocacy groups and Native American tribes, Greenpeace opposed plans for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation. Protesters argued that this design threatened tribal water supplies if the pipeline should spill or leak.

The Obama administration blocked the disputed section of the pipeline in 2016, but the Trump administration approved it in 2017. The pipeline was completed and entered operation in that year, despite large-scale protests.

Energy Transfer is suing Greenpeace for damages that the company says it incurred because of construction delays on the pipeline. The company argues that protests and demonstrations organized by Greenpeace caused these delays.

Along with claims of trespass and nuisance, Energy Transfer alleges that Greenpeace defamed the company to its financial backers. The company says that Greenpeace included false statements in a letter to the company’s banks that asserted construction of the pipeline desecrated tribal burial grounds and important cultural sites.

As a result, Energy Transfer claims that it lost US$68 million in financing and was forced to spend millions of dollars on public relations efforts to remedy the damage. The company is seeking monetary damages in an amount to be proved at trial.

Greenpeace contends that the lawsuit is an attempt to silence its free speech and protest rights, and that the letter sent to banks was an act of free expression providing information already cited many times by tribes opposing the pipeline.

Protection varies from state to state

Unlike many other states, North Dakota does not have an anti-SLAPP law. Currently, 35 states and Washington have laws designed to reduce the harms caused by SLAPP suits.

These statutes vary greatly, including with regard to the types of speech they protect. Some laws seek to blunt the economic harm of SLAPP suits and require litigants who bring SLAPP suits to pay defendants’ legal costs and attorney fees if those suits are unsuccessful. Other statutes merely permit such shifts at the judge’s discretion. These variations mean that cases may fare very differently based on where a lawsuit is filed.

Greenpeace leaders say a verdict ordering the organization to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages could drive the group into bankruptcy. Such an outcome would have an obvious chilling effect on other environmental groups – the kind of result that anti-SLAPP laws are designed to prevent.",theconversation

While many stories in this new chapter of lunar exploration will be reminiscent of the Apollo missions 50 years ago, others may look quite different.

For instance, the European Space Agency is currently working to make space travel more accessible for people of a wide range of backgrounds and abilities. In this new era, the first footprint on the Moon could possibly be made by a prosthetic limb.

Historically, and even still today, astronauts selected to fly to space have had to fit a long list of physical requirements. However, many professionals in the field are beginning to acknowledge that these requirements stem from outdated assumptions.

Some research, including studies by our multidisciplinary team of aerospace and biomechanics researchers, has begun to explore the possibilities for people with physical disabilities to venture into space, visit the Moon and eventually travel to Mars.

Current research

NASA has previously funded and is currently funding research on restraints and mobility aids to help everyone, regardless of their ability, move around in the crew cabin.

Additionally, NASA has research programs to develop functional aids for individuals with disabilities in current U.S. spacecraft. A functional aid is any device that improves someone’s independence, mobility or daily living tasks by compensating for their physical limitations.

The European Space Agency, or ESA, launched its Parastronaut Feasibility Project in 2022 to assess ways to include individuals with disabilities in human spaceflight. A parastronaut is an astronaut with a physical disability who has been selected and trained to participate in space missions.

At the University of North Dakota, we conducted one of the first studies focused on parastronauts. This research examined how individuals with disabilities get into and get out of two current U.S. spacecraft designed to carry crew. The first was NASA’s Orion capsule, designed by Lockheed Martin, and the second was Boeing’s CST 100 Starliner.

Alongside our colleagues Pablo De León, Keith Crisman, Komal Mangle and Kavya Manyapu, we uncovered valuable insights into the accessibility challenges future parastronauts may face.

Our research indicated that individuals with physical disabilities are nearly as nimble in modern U.S. spacecraft as nondisabled individuals. This work focused on testing individuals who have experienced leg amputations. Now we are looking ahead to solutions that could benefit astronauts of all abilities.

Safety and inclusion

John McFall is the ESA’s first parastronaut. At the age of 19, Mcfall lost his right leg just above the knee from a motorcycle accident. Although McFall has not been assigned to a mission yet, he is the first person with a physical disability to be medically certified for an ISS mission.

Astronaut selection criteria currently prioritize peak physical fitness, with the goal of having multiple crew members who can do the same physical tasks. Integrating parastronauts into the crew has required balancing mission security and accessibility.

However, with advancements in technology, spacecraft design and assistive tools, inclusion no longer needs to come at the expense of safety. These technologies are still in their infancy, but research and efforts like the ESA’s program will help improve them.

Design and development of spacecraft can cost billions of dollars. Simple adaptations, such as adding handholds onto the walls in a spacecraft, can provide vital assistance. However, adding handles to existing spacecraft will be costly.

Functional aids that don’t alter the spacecraft itself – such as accessories carried by each astronaut – could be another way forward. For example, adding Velcro to certain spots in the spacecraft or on prosthetic limbs could improve a parastronaut’s traction and help them anchor to the spacecraft’s surfaces.

Engineers could design new prosthetics made for particular space environments, such as zero or partial gravity, or even tailored to specific spacecraft. This approach is kind of like designing specialized prosthetics for rock climbing, running or other sports.

Accessibility can help everyone

Future space exploration, particularly missions to the Moon and Mars that will take weeks, months and even years, may prompt new standards for astronaut fitness. During these long missions, astronauts could get injured, causing what can be considered incidental disability.

An astronaut with an incidental disability begins a mission without a recognized disability but acquires one from a mission mishap. An astronaut suffering a broken arm or a traumatic brain injury during a mission would have a persistent impairment.

During long-duration missions, an astronaut crew will be too far away to receive outside medical help – they’ll have to deal with these issues on their own.

Considering disability during mission planning goes beyond inclusion. It makes the mission safer for all astronauts by preparing them for anything that could go wrong. Any astronaut could suffer an incidental disability during their journey.

Safety and inclusion in spaceflight don’t need to be at odds. Instead, agencies can reengineer systems and training processes to ensure that more people can safely participate in space missions. By addressing safety concerns through technology, innovative design and mission planning, the space industry can have inclusive and successful missions.",theconversation

From March 16-22, 2025, the nation celebrates the 20th anniversary of national Sunshine Week, which originated in Florida, historically home to the most transparent and accountable governments in the country.

Times have changed.

At the University of Florida Joseph L. Brechner Freedom of Information Project, my colleagues and I have researched and taught about the freedom of information since 1977. We monitor the state of open, accountable government, and our research findings do not bode well for democracy – in Florida and throughout the U.S.

But first, let’s look back to sunnier days.

Sun rises

Florida enacted its first version of a public records law in 1909, the sixth state to do so. The movement was led by Nebraska in 1866 and Montana in 1895. Florida’s law was repealed in the 1950s and then returned in 1967 as the Sunshine Law.

“Sunshine” was equated with the state’s nickname but also the concept of government transparency – lighting the dark recesses of secrecy. The Sunshine Law also played on a famous quote by former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis that “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.”

Something unique happened in Florida then. Transparency took hold.

Journalists such as Pete Weitzel at the Miami Herald pushed hard for governments to operate more transparently, building momentum through the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors. They and other media groups helped launch, with US$11,000, the Florida Freedom of Information Clearinghouse in 1977 at the University of Florida. The journalism college assigned a professor and grad student to monitor public record denials, open meeting closures and court cases, and to alert newspaper editors to secrecy legislation. This effort created a culture of transparency, including among elected leaders.

Journalists successfully pushed for a constitutional amendment in the early 1990s, which required transparency across the state and required a two-thirds vote from the state Legislature to adopt exemptions to the law.

Several provisions of Florida public records law stood out:

• Attorney fee-shifting is mandatory. If a citizen is denied government information, sues and prevails, the agency is required to pay the person’s attorney fees. Our research indicates that this is one of the most important elements in public record laws to encourage compliance.

• The definition of a public record is broad, even applying to documents created by a private person or contractor acting on behalf of the government. Applying the law to private actors is unique in the U.S., and even in the world.

• Governing bodies face strict requirements to deliberate in public. Just two officials communicating with each other constitutes an official meeting and must be announced ahead of time, allowing for public attendance. Most states require a quorum, or majority, of the governing body to be considered an official meeting.

The nonprofit Florida First Amendment Foundation was launched in 1985 to promote government transparency and hired its first paid employee, Barbara Petersen, in 1995, to monitor secrecy legislation, train public employees and aid people trying to get information. The organization banded with the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors to create Sunshine Sunday each March to promote the right to know. This event went national in 2005 as Sunshine Week.

All these factors led Florida to become known as the most transparent state in the nation.

Increasing clouds

Fast forward to 2025, and we see an entirely different climate in Florida.

The decline of newspapers has meant fewer reporters pushing for records, fewer editors advocating for transparency, and fewer owners suing government agencies.

Copy charges related to getting public records create barriers for average citizens. Research shows that providing fee waivers would increase accessibility without significant costs.

Through the years, legislators became emboldened to pass more exemptions to the Florida Sunshine Law – more than 1,100 and growing. Some of those exemptions were focused on protecting personal privacy – for example, in reaction to journalists requesting the autopsy file of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt after his 2001 death.

Fear of terrorists following 9/11 led to a flurry of exemptions, such as hiding records about crop dusters to prevent al-Qaida from hijacking planes to spread anthrax.

Companies profiting from public records sparked another backlash. For example, some companies acquired public mugshots, posted them online and allowed people to have them removed for a price. Some attorneys gamed the fee-shifting provision, submitting public record requests that would be difficult to fulfill, sued immediately and then settled with agencies for thousands of dollars.

Elected leaders turned against transparency, Petersen, who now directs the Florida Center for Government Accountability, told me recently. One of the prominent examples she points to is Gov. Ron DeSantis’ refusal to disclose his travel expense records.

I hear it every week – calls from journalists and others stymied by state and local government agencies. They often cite high copy fees for public records, claims of exemptions and outright ghosting by agencies. One reporter encountered Miami city commissioners sworn in at a private ceremony. Another challenged Tallahassee police refusing to provide information about an officer-involved shooting. A college journalism student was told she had to pay $1,665 for records about Florida dams that could fail and ended up pleading with the government to “free the dam records.”

One of my studies from 2019 indicated that, on average, if you requested a public record in Florida, you would receive it about 39% of the time. That placed the state 31st in the nation, the bottom half.

More recent data from the nonprofit MuckRock reports Florida’s percentage declining – as of February 2025, to 35%.

Bobby Block, current director of the Florida First Amendment Foundation, wrote in February that “There was a time when Florida set the gold standard for open government. … Those days are over.”

Not just Florida

Florida is reflective of a national trend – a secrecy creep spreading throughout the country, culminating in transparency deserts in cities big and small.

The United States is losing its reputation as a leader in open, accountable government. Its federal Freedom of Information Act, often known as FOIA, ranks 78th in strength out of 140 nations, and continuously drops as new countries adopt better laws. An information commissioner from Africa told me a few months ago that he and his colleagues laugh at the United States’ weak FOIA law, referring to it as a “toothless poodle.”

On average, according to our research, if you asked for a public record in America 10 years ago, you would get it about half the time. Now, it’s down to about a third of the time, and just 12% at the federal level.

Even the U.S. Department of Justice’s own statistics show a similar decline in full release of records, and the average response time has nearly doubled over the same period, from 21 to 40 days.

What happens when compliance reaches 0%?

Aside from the ramifications on democracy itself, every American will feel the pain in their pocketbooks and everyday lives.

Studies show that public record laws lead to cleaner drinking water, safer restaurants, better-informed school choice, less corruption, saved tax dollars and a lower chance of sex offenders reoffending.

According to Stanford economist James Hamilton, for every dollar spent on public-records journalism, society benefits $287 in saved lives and more efficient government.

Some transparency advocates have raised the alarm on actions taken by the new Trump administration, such as the removal of agency websites, the firing of FOIA staff and the dismantling of the Open Government Federal Advisory Committee.

It is likely these efforts will escalate the secrecy creep and allow it to trickle down to the state and local levels. It is important to note, though, that declining transparency is a long-term trend that transcends any one president or political party. The federal government reached its absolute low in full compliance with FOIA last year, under the Biden administration.

It’s easy to point fingers at one politician, but perhaps wiser to look at the entire system, which many scholars say is broken and should be reimagined.

German sociologist Max Weber posited that secrecy is the natural tendency for bureaucracy if left unchecked. For decades, news companies, particularly in Florida, pushed back against that secrecy through public pressure and litigation.

With that opposing force weakened, if not disappearing, what or who will replace it?

Nonprofit groups have filled some of the gap, and independent online news sites are growing and enforcing public record laws.

But will it be enough? Ultimately, it is up to the citizenry. If the people don’t cherish and demand transparent government, then the politicians certainly won’t, whether in Florida or the rest of the country.",theconversation

Brown and Navy Admiral Lisa Franchetti. Trump also fired military lawyers who advise senior officers on the legality of their behavior in combat and at home.

Over at the FBI, the president has tapped loyalists Kash Patel and Dan Bongino to direct the executive branch’s largest internal security agency. These men have little administrative experience in federal law enforcement but have repeated Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.

Trump has reportedly used denialism – about Joe Biden winning the 2020 election and that Jan. 6 entailed pro-Trump protesters violently assaulting police officers – to help vet appointees for senior national security and intelligence posts. Loyalty tests can screen for appointees who will enthusiastically carry out a president’s agenda and follow orders – even if asked to break the law.

Further, Trump promoted Sean Curran, his personal bodyguard, to lead the Secret Service – the presidential guard unit. Curran’s appointment meant bypassing senior service members in favor of what one news report called a “mostly anonymous U.S. Secret Service agent” who had never served in Secret Service headquarters but had a close relationship with Trump.

Such coordinated personnel changes – firing Pentagon lawyers, appointing loyalists to lead the FBI and selecting Trump’s personal bodyguard to lead a security service – are consistent with a strategy of “personalizing” the security forces.

That personalization is a hallmark of strongman rule throughout the world.

Loyalty to the leader, not the law

Security force personalism happens when leaders reshape the country’s security forces by purging nonpartisan, law-abiding officers and promoting loyal officers who would never rise through the ranks on merit.

Whereas a professional military in a democracy is loyal to the Constitution, personalist security forces are loyal to their leader.

Sometimes this process entails recruiting personnel from the leader’s party or allied ethnic, tribal or extremist groups. It may even include creating a paramilitary force, presidential guard or a new special forces unit staffed with officers and rank-and-file loyal to the leader. These forces then remain outside of the normal military chain of command.

Repressing dissent – and democracy

When leaders put loyalists in charge of the men with guns, it becomes easier to repress opposition from citizens, political figures and any dissenting military leaders.

That’s for three reasons.

First, personalized security forces are more likely to follow the leader’s orders to shoot peaceful anti-government protesters. Security forces loyal to Nicaragua’s president, Daniel Ortega, killed roughly 300 protesters in 2018 and 2019 when civil society groups mobilized to protest Ortega’s proposed pension cuts. Loyalist military or paramilitary forces in Russia and Belarus have similarly quashed public dissent in recent years.

Second, because citizens often know that personalized security forces are more likely to shoot citizens than to defend them against foreign threats, opposition groups are less likely to organize a protest. This makes it easier for leaders to silence independent media, jail opposition political candidates, stuff ballot boxes and steal votes so they never lose another election.

A few years after Ortega’s forces killed protesters in the streets, he jailed seven opposition presidential candidates and claimed to have won the 2021 election.

Third, personalism of security forces weakens the power of other groups that might otherwise constrain the leader, such as elites in the ruling political party and even generals who oppose a leader’s power grab.

If elites fear loyal security agents, they tend to keep their mouths shut when they disagree with the leader – or else, research shows, face a purge. Generals, too: Research finds that loyal security forces reduce the risk of military coup attempts.

Leaders who don’t give up power

Our data on security force personalization in autocracies indicates that when leaders put loyalists in charge of security forces, removing these leaders from power peacefully through elections or protest becomes much more difficult.

Take the example of Syria, where President Hafez Assad came to power after a successful military coup in 1971. The country had experienced more than a dozen coup attempts since 1946. The biggest threat to Assad’s power was another military coup.

To minimize this threat, he created a personalized security force by promoting fellow Alawites, a minority ethno-religious group, to the senior ranks of the Syrian military. Assad subsidized military housing for loyal officers and created an overlapping network of family-controlled security units outside the formal military.

Security force personalization harmed the Syrian military’s capacity to fight. This is frequently the case because this process often purges competent officers and creates incentives for senior officers to lie to the leader about bad news.

But it was useful for enabling the Assad family to rob the country blind and ensure that the leader’s son, Bashar Assad, succeeded his father.

Syria did not have free and fair elections under the Assads, and ruling party elites could not check the leader’s power. When citizens mobilized peacefully in 2011 to oust the Assad regime, loyal security forces killed and imprisoned tens of thousands of Syrians.

The Assads’ reign of terror only ended after 12 years of brutal civil war.

Follow the money

Personalized security forces need money – both to ensure loyalty and to acquire the weapons needed when the leader orders violent repression.

So leaders who personalize their security forces must funnel huge sums of money to the most loyal units, sometimes making them more powerful than the regular army.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, for example, receives revenue from state oil exports and controls sanction-busting smuggling networks. Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s Special Guard units, though smaller than the regular military, always had better equipment and training.

In 2003, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni assigned his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to lead a new Presidential Guard Brigade and gave this unit the job of fighting terrorism so he could control military aid from the U.S. The longtime leader’s son now commands the entire Ugandan Armed Forces. Age 81 and with his son in charge of the men with guns, Museveni looks set to win his eighth term in office next year.

Security forces personalization in the US?

The purges at the Pentagon in late February will not transform the U.S. security apparatus into a personalized force overnight, nor will they likely spur the military to oust Trump. Even though the Constitution establishes civilian control over the military, senior officers can nonetheless resist pressure from Trump to quash protest.

But the firings do spark concerns about politicizing the military. So do other moves by Trump that signal greater ambitions to personalize the security forces, such as selecting loyalists to lead the FBI and Secret Service and purging the military lawyers who help soldiers abide by the law.

Look at the new faces and follow the money. Will the Trump administration bypass the senior ranks to promote junior officers whose military careers depend on Trump remaining in power? Will the US$50 billion “savings” that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to extract from the Defense Department instead fund a new security force?

The most serious sign of security personalization in the U.S. would be the creation of a new force outside the regular military chain of command – think the Department of Government Efficiency, but with guns. Pro-Trump military contractors are already calling for the government to fund a “small army of private citizens empowered to make arrests” and deport immigrants.

His administration has frozen federal grants, issued executive orders aligned with the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, and, most prominently, created what he calls the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

DOGE has been billed as a cost-cutting initiative, although the actual amount of money being saved remains unclear. To lead DOGE, Trump appointed Elon Musk, a megadonor whose companies hold federal contracts worth billions. Musk has already moved forward with major cuts, including sweeping workforce reductions, the curtailment of government operations and purges of entire agencies. Thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs.

While certainly dramatic, these actions reflect a longer trend of privatizing government. Indeed, my sociological research shows that the government has steadily withdrawn from economic production for decades, outsourcing many responsibilities to the private sector.

3 indicators of privatization

At first glance, total government spending appears stable over time. In 2024, federal, state and local expenditures made up 35% of the U.S. economy, the same as in 1982. However, my analysis of Bureau of Economic Analysis data offers a new perspective, recasting privatization as a macroeconomic phenomenon. I find that U.S. economic activity has become increasingly more privatized over the past 50 years. This shift happened in three key ways.

First, government involvement in economic production has declined. Historically, public institutions have played a major role in sectors such as electric power, water delivery, waste management, space equipment, naval shipbuilding, construction, and infrastructure investments. In 1970, government spending on production accounted for 23% of the economy. By 2024, that figure had fallen to 17%, leaving the private sector to fill the gaps. This means a growing share of overall government spending has been used to fund the private sector economy.

Second, government’s overall ability to produce goods and services – what economists call “productive capacity” – has fallen relative to the private sector, both in terms of labor and capital. Since 1970, public employment has lagged behind private sector job growth, and government-owned capital assets have trailed those of the private sector. Although public sector capital investments briefly rebounded in the 2000s, employment did not, signaling a shift toward outsourcing rather than direct hiring. This has significant implications for wages, working conditions and unionization.

Third, and relatedly, government increasingly contracts work to private companies, opting to buy goods and services instead of making them. In 1977, private contractors accounted for one-third of government production costs. By 2023, that had risen to over half. Government contracting – now 7% of the total economy – reached US$1.98 trillion in 2023. Key beneficiaries in 2023 included professional services at $317 billion, petroleum and coal industries at $194 billion and construction at $130 billion. Other examples include private charter schools, private prisons, hospitals and defense contractors.

The meaning of privatization

Privatization can be understood as two interconnected processes: the retreat of government from economic production, and the rise of contracting. The government remains a major economic actor in the U.S., although now as more of a procurer of goods and services than a provider or employer.

The government’s shift away from production largely stems from mainstreamed austerity politics – a “starve the beast” approach to government – and backlash against the New Deal’s expansion of federal economic involvement. In 1971, the controversial “Powell Memo,” written by future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, mobilized business leaders around the goal of expanding private sector power over public policy. This fueled the rise of conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, the eventual architect of the Project 2025 privatization agenda.

While government production shrank, government contracting expanded on promises of cost savings and efficiency. These contracting decisions are usually made by local administrators managing budgets under fiscal stress and interest group pressure, including from businesses and public sector unions.

Yet research shows that contracting frequently fails to reduce costs, while risking monopolies, weakening accountability and public input, and sometimes locking governments into rigid contracts. In many cases, ineffective outsourcing forces a return to public employment.

The consequences of privatization

Trump’s latest moves can be viewed as a massive acceleration of a decades-long trend, rather than a break from the past. The 50-year shift away from robust public sector employment has already privatized a lot of U.S. employment. Trump and Musk’s plan to cut the federal workforce follows the same blueprint.

This could have major consequences.

First, drastic job cuts likely mean more privatization and fewer government workers. Trump’s federal workforce cuts echo President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 mass firing of more than 11,000 air traffic controllers, a source of prolonged financial struggles and family instability for many fired workers. Trump’s firings and layoffs are already reaching far beyond Reagan’s.

In addition, since federal spending directly contributes to gross domestic product, cuts of this magnitude risk slowing the economy. The Trump administration has even floated the idea of changing GDP calculations, potentially masking any reality of economic decline.

Rapid privatization is also likely to trigger significant economic disruptions, especially in industries that depend on federal support. For example, USAID cuts have already sent shock waves through the private sector agricultural economy.

Finally, the privatization trend risks eroding democratic accountability and worsening racial and gender inequalities. That’s because, as my prior research finds, public sector unions uniquely shape American society by equalizing wages while increasing transparency and civic participation. Given that the public sector is highly unionized and disproportionately provides employment opportunities for women and Black workers, privatization risks undoing these gains.

As Trump’s administration aggressively restructures federal agencies, these changes will likely proceed without public input, further entrenching private sector dominance. This stands to undermine government functioning and democratic accountability. While often framed as inevitable, the American public should know that privatization remains a policy choice – one that can be reversed.",theconversation

The announcement followed peace talks in Saudi Arabia, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled on March 10, and is a remarkable turn of events. The ball is now in Russia’s court in terms of whether it accepts the ceasefire proposal.

Zelenskyy’s recent shouting match with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the White House, at a surface level, could not have gone much worse from the Ukrainian leader’s perspective. Both Trump and Vance subjected Zelenskyy to scathing attacks before their meeting abruptly ended.

The fallout from the meeting initially seemed even worse than the meeting itself. On March 3, Trump paused material military aid to Ukraine, and two days later, the U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukrainians. The decision on intelligence has since been reversed following Ukraine’s agreement with the ceasefire proposal.

Trump needs a win

When campaigning for president, Trump promised to end the war in 24 hours. After he won a second term, Trump has appeared disinterested and even antagonistic towards Russia at times.

The domestic turmoil that’s been fuelled by many of his policies, however, has seemingly caused him to seek a win in international affairs. Enter Ukraine.

Nonetheless, Trump’s increased focus on Ukraine in recent weeks, including his Oval Office attack on Zelenskyy, has required the Ukrainian leader to adapt. He’s therefore been making moves to shore up support for Ukraine in a world devoid of American leadership.

Ukraine and Trump’s fixation

Trump’s fixation with Ukraine stems from several aspects of his world view.

First, while theories of Trump being a Russian agent may be overblown, he does seem fixated on Russian President Vladimir Putin. This fixation likely stems from the fact that Putin, much like Trump, views the world in a transactional manner. Putin is someone with whom Trump, who broadcasts himself as a deal-maker, can reach an agreement.

Second, the Russia-Ukraine conflict aligns with Trump’s world view that the U.S. provides too much and the rest of the world too little to secure international stability. This perspective is particularly the case with Europe, whom Trump views as “free-loading” via American security guarantees.

Third, Trump views Ukraine as having the potential to assist American industry and defence, just not in a military manner. The rare earth minerals that Ukraine possesses have significant economic and military implications, and the market is dominated by the state Trump and many others view as America’s chief rival: China.

Fourth and finally, Trump correctly views the U.S. as having leverage over Ukraine. American military aid has largely allowed Ukraine to fight a protracted war against a much larger enemy. While the degradation of Russia’s military and economy benefits the U.S., Trump’s focus on short-term objectives largely overlooks this point.

Did Zelenskyy outplay Trump?

Trump, however, did not account for Zelenskyy’s strength of character. While Trump is seeking to use Ukraine for his own advantage, Zelenskyy remains focused on Ukraine’s interests — and not on America first. The emerging personality conflict between both men made the chaotic Oval Office meeting almost inevitable.

Given Trump’s rhetoric towards Zelenskyy in the lead-up to that meeting, it’s curious the Ukrainian leader agreed to the meeting at all. But Zelenskyy himself reportedly pushed for the meeting, and even had French President Emmanuel Macron intervene on his behalf.

American support for Ukraine was disappearing before the tumultuous meeting. There has been no new aid for Ukraine since Trump assumed the presidency. For Ukraine to survive, it needs a new patron.

Zelenskyy has taken risks during the conflict, not all of which have worked in his or Ukraine’s favour. Those risks, however, have always been calculated. His attempt to bolster support for Ukraine among its non-American allies following the contentious White House meeting might be an example of this type of calculation.

Europe rallies around Ukraine

In the aftermath of the meeting, the international community has rallied around Ukraine. Most important, however, has been the European response.

For all the problems in Trump’s approach, he is correct that the European response to Russia’s invasion has left a lot to be desired from Ukraine’s perspective. While Europe has provided more financial assistance to Ukraine than the U.S., it has largely occurred in spurts and only after American leadership on the issue.

France and the United Kingdom have emerged as Ukraine’s biggest backers in Europe. This is not new, as both countries have been among Ukraine’s most vocal supporters over the last few years. What Ukraine needs, however, is for that vocal support to turn into action.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an 800 billion euro program for European Union members to bolster their defence capabilities soon after Zelenskyy met with European leaders in London in early March. In explaining her rational, von der Leyen stated:

“With this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine… This approach of joint procurement will also reduce costs, reduce fragmentation, increase interoperability and strengthen our defence industrial base.”

EU is critical

Though not perfect, the renewed support from the EU and the U.K. may allow Ukraine to continue fighting as Russia’s declining economy hinders Putin’s war effort.

In the aftermath of the Oval Office showdown with Trump and Vance, Zelenskyy has done what he can to repair Ukraine’s relationship with the U.S. and satiate Trump’s ego, but tension remains. From Ukraine’s perspective, it needs a new partner in its war against Russia, and the EU can serve that purpose.

The U.S. may be the country pushing for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but it’s Europe that will play the most vital role in Ukraine’s ability to win the war if it endures.",theconversation

If this man is still alive, he must be feeling vindicated. America’s current retreat from its engagements around the world — from gutting USAid to abandoning European allies — constitutes a surrender of power comparable in living memory only to Mikhail Gorbachev’s unilateral withdrawals from Afghanistan, Eastern Europe and elsewhere between 1988 and 1991 — right before the Soviet Union’s collapse.

Accompanying both foreign policy about-faces, we can’t miss profound shifts in the two states’ ideological foundations.

Destabilizing master signifiers

Gorbachev justified his “restructuring” or perestroika by invoking the Soviet Union’s founding father, Vladimir Lenin. He did so, however, by observing that the historical Lenin had pragmatically modified policies according to circumstances. That called into question the mythological Lenin — an infallible hero whose virtues could not be questioned.

The Russian-born American anthropologist Alexei Yurchak argues that Lenin was the Soviet system’s “master signifier.”

As long as his sacredness remained unquestioned, referring to Lenin could legitimize a range of policies and actions. Viewing Lenin through a historical lens, however, called his sacredness into question. It consequently became impossible for Soviet citizens to agree on what policies and actions were legitimate. This crisis of meaning allowed chronic political, economic and social problems to suddenly to become devastating.

America’s master signifier is its Constitution, reverentially enshrined in Washington, D.C., rather like Lenin’s body is in Moscow. Under President Donald Trump, however, violations of the Constitution have become routine, and the federal government’s legislative branch has shown little will to guard its powers from executive encroachment. Like Lenin under Gorbachev, it seems that the sacred centre of America’s political system has become destabilized.

As a written contract, a constitution is easier to interpret than the thoughts of a dead man. Lenin’s advantage, however, was that he could embody traits considered virtuous in the Soviet system. Where could Americans look for that same type of guiding light?

For most of American history, it was George Washington — the first president who swore to uphold the Constitution.

George Washington’s America

As a hero of the Revolutionary War, Washington could have become king.

Army officers, frustrated at the central government’s weakness after the war under the Articles of Confederation, considered a coup d'état. Washington — the army’s commander in chief — could have led the overthrow (as Oliver Cromwell had or Napoleon Bonaparte would).

Washington refused, and after British capitulation in 1783, he relinquished his command to Congress.

In 1789, after the Constitution was ratified as a legal solution to the problems of confederation, Washington was unanimously elected president. After two terms, however, he rejected suggestions that he stand for a third.

He frequently stressed the importance of habit in human affairs and reasoned that, if he clung to power, Americans might not get accustomed to peaceful and regular rotation of office. By retiring, he transferred much of the reverence that had accrued to him onto the Constitution.

Remembering Washington

Washington’s birthday falls on Feb. 22, and Americans began observing it while he was still alive. In 1879, U.S. Congress made the day a federal holiday, an occasion for celebrating the example of selfless public service and respect for the rule of law that “the father of his country” had embodied.

So it remained until 1971.

In that year, the Monday Holiday Act went into effect. Adopted in 1968 at the behest of the business lobby, which saw in three-day weekends an opportunity for sales, the act moved Washington’s birthday commemoration to the third Monday in February.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)

Since many states also celebrated Abraham Lincoln’s birthday and the new date fell between his and Washington’s, some began calling it “Presidents’ Day.” When nationwide advertisers and calendar-makers adopted the term in the 1980s, it came to seem official.

The name change, of course, eroded the holiday’s connection to Washington, and insofar as it remained more than a shopping day, it came to be associated with all the presidents, effectively cheapening it. Though the federal holiday officially remains “Washington’s Birthday,” few Americans know that.

The dangers of mythologizing

The shift happened to coincide with a wave of revisionist historiography that pointed out Washington — a slave-owner — was not perfect.

Read more: What Florida gets wrong about George Washington and the benefits he received from enslaving Black people

All historiography is revisionist in the sense that historians revise existing interpretations on the basis of new evidence. For those who wanted an untainted idol, however, it appeared either that Washington could no longer fit the bill or that historical facts had to be massaged.

Ever since, historical assessments have tended to get lost in culture wars, where neither side can accept a real person with both reprehensible and admirable traits.

In the Soviet Union, however, most citizens found it difficult to think historically about Lenin because, under the conditions of dictatorship, open public debate based on factual information about him had been impossible.

Dictatorship depends on mythological thinking that worships heroes and does not expose contradictions between official pronouncements and reality. In the early 1990s, Russians failed to establish the rule of law for a similar reason: they could not overcome the habit of mythologizing, which made them prioritize personality over policy.

The personality they chose as independent Russia’s first president — Boris Yeltsin — lacked Washington’s respect for the rule of law.

Losing sight of Washington

Thanks to Washington, the U.S. got off to a better start. But by abandoning the widespread commemoration of his historically exceptional deference to the rule of law, Americans have have lost an opportunity to practise historical thinking in the public sphere.

Not only has mythological thinking encroached, but it is now even possible for a president to style himself as a monarch and to emulate Napoleon, as Donald Trump has.

The Constitution — America’s master signifier — has lost its ability to unite citizens around a shared sense of meaningfulness.

Escalating trade tensions further, Trump has also announced he’ll put an additional 25 per cent tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum in response to Ontario’s 25 per cent surcharge on electricity to three U.S. states.

With more than 90 per cent of Canada’s aluminum exports going to the U.S. — a market of $16.7 billion — the new tariff threatens to disrupt a critical trade relationship.

Almost 30 per cent of Canadian aluminum ends up being used as a durable, lightweight material in the automotive and transportation sector, which is itself under strain due to shifting U.S. trade policies.

In the face of this trade insecurity and a growing demand for green energy, a recent Canadian innovation that uses aluminum as a fuel could provide new opportunities for growth and diversification.

A new role for aluminum

Canada may seem an unlikely leader in aluminum production, given that it has no reserves of bauxite, the raw mineral that yields finished aluminum. However, the country’s huge supply of renewable hydroelectric power makes it the world’s fourth-largest producer of aluminum.

A new Canadian-developed process is reimagining aluminum’s role not just as a manufacturing material, but as a clean energy storage medium and fuel.

Instead of using aluminum to make goods like car parts, beer cans and foil wrap, the process uses aluminum as a vessel for storing energy until it is needed. This new process has the potential to significantly cut carbon emissions, open up new markets and increase energy security.

(AP Photo/Lauren Petracca)

It works by triggering a reaction between aluminum and water that generates heat, hydrogen and aluminum oxide. In this reaction, just one litre of aluminum produces the same amount of heat as burning a litre of diesel fuel, while yielding the equivalent of four litres of liquid hydrogen, another useful fuel.

The process is circular — once the energy has been extracted from the aluminum, the leftover aluminum oxide can be turned back into aluminum using another clean process, which also happens to be Canadian.

Clean energy potential

Aluminum production is energy-intensive, requiring large-scale smelters that consume huge amounts of electricity. This has earned aluminum the nickname “solid electricity.” The ability to reanimate this stored energy could help Canada more effectively utilize its abundant clean energy resources that have, until now, been challenging to capture and store.

Unlike fossil fuels, which can be shipped globally, energy from renewable sources is much harder to transport over long distances. Renewable energy is often in the form of electricity, and sending electricity through power lines over long distances results in significant line losses.

Read more: E-fuels can play a huge role in Canada's journey towards a net-zero future

Aluminum is safe, stable and Canada already has a robust infrastructure for making and transporting it. This positions the country to both meet its own energy needs with hydro, solar and geothermal power and export surplus energy.

For instance, Canada could use aluminum to export clean energy to Europe, which is actively looking for reliable energy partners to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas.

What makes this potential especially attractive is a breakthrough process developed by the Canadian consortium Elysis that takes most of the carbon emissions out of the process of making aluminum.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot

The main contributor to carbon emissions in traditional aluminum production are carbon anodes. In this process, carbon binds with oxygen released during the smelting process to produce carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change.

Elysis’ carbon-free anodes eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the smelting process, leaving only aluminum and oxygen, effectively making aluminum a clean energy storage medium. This means Canada can now produce aluminum with near-zero carbon emissions.

A path to renewable energy leadership

This new aluminum energy cycle is particularly exciting because it combines two of Canada’s greatest strengths: its vast renewable energy potential and its well-established aluminum industry.

These advancements open up the opportunity for Canada’s aluminum sector to move beyond traditional markets and enter the global energy trade.

This innovation could create new demand for Canadian aluminum, diversify the industry’s customer base and reduce the uncertainty and risk of international trade. Ultimately, it could result in greater growth and stability for aluminum producers by reducing their reliance on U.S. trade policies.

Read more: Trump's tariff threat is a sign that Canada should be diversifying beyond the U.S.

Canada could expand its aluminum industry without the need for additional mining, since the aluminum can be reused indefinitely.

Using aluminum as a fuel source also has the potential to usher in a new era of energy security at home and abroad. Clean energy stored in aluminum could be stockpiled for use in remote regions or major centres during times of peak energy demand.

Turning this vision into reality will require investments in research and development to commercialize this nascent form of renewable energy technology. With the right support, Canada could unlock a new era of energy independence and become a renewable energy superpower in a post-fossil fuel world.",theconversation

Canada immediately retaliated on March 4, imposing 25 per cent tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. imports, with plans to expand to $155 billion after consultation. The second round of retaliatory measures is on hold until the pause is up.

This move escalated tensions into a full-scale trade war between the two countries. In a trade war, no country wins, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau aptly noted. Yet governments impose tariffs — essentially import taxes — because they protect domestic industries from foreign competition.

While tariffs can provide temporary relief to certain sectors, studies have shown that the cost to consumers outweighs the benefit to industries. In addition, the industries that seek protection are typically well-organized, politically influential and relentless in lobbying for trade barriers.

Canada’s decision to retaliate was less about responding in kind, and more about pressuring the America’s most influential export industries. Canada aimed to target politically influential export sectors — like Florida’s orange industry — which may then pressure Washington to negotiate with Canada for a bilateral tariff reduction, pitting U.S. exporters against import-competing industries.

A well-designed retaliation strategy should target politically influential U.S. industries while minimizing harm to Canadian consumers. The question is, how well did Canada execute its response?

What Canada got right

Canada largely focused significantly on U.S. products with domestic or non-U.S. alternatives. For example, tariffs on U.S. dairy could be substituted by Canadian producers, bourbon can be replaced with Canadian or European whiskey and Florida orange juice can be replaced by Brazilian imports.

The tariffs were designed to hit industries in Republican strongholds and swing states to increase domestic opposition to Trump’s trade war. Florida (orange juice), Wisconsin and Georgia (dairy and poultry) and Kentucky (bourbon) were all targeted. This mirrored the EU’s 2018 successful retaliation strategy against the U.S., which targeted similar products.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)

Early signs suggest this approach had an impact, as Trump later paused tariffs linked to the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), likely due to Republican pushback.

Instead of escalating the trade war aggressively, Canada’s response was measured. It matched U.S. tariff levels but didn’t go beyond them, which helped maintain diplomacy and positioned Canada as a responsible player in the dispute.

Additionally, by delaying tariffs on industrial goods like machinery and chemicals, Ottawa likely gave Canadian firms time to source alternatives, softening supply chain blows and minimizing its impact on domestic industries.

Areas for improvements

While Canada’s response was largely strategic, some missteps increased the burden on its own consumers.

Tariffs on everyday items like toilet paper, clothing and kitchenware risk raising prices for Canadian households. Similarly, tariffs on plastic building materials could inflate renovation costs, indirectly harming Canada’s expensive construction sector.

Canada exempted U.S. crude oil and natural gas from tariffs, possibly to protect integrated supply chains. However, while this may have been necessary to protect North America’s integrated energy supply chains, it also meant that Canada left a significant leverage point on the table, as it could have put pressure on Republican states like North Dakota.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Laura Proctor

Additionally, Canada excluded major agricultural products like soybeans and pork, which could have hurt farmers in infuential Iowa. Additionally, while Canada imposed some restrictions on U.S. pork imports, it refrained from targeting soybeans — an agricultural product that China leveraged against the U.S. in 2018 to politically influential states like Iowa.

Another potential shortfall was the largely bilateral nature of Canada’s response. Co-ordinating with other trading partners also affected by U.S. tariffs, such as the European Union partners and Mexico, could have amplified pressure by presenting Washington with a united front.

Recalibrating Canada’s tariff response

At its core, Canada’s trade war with the U.S. is akin to standing up to a schoolyard bully. While resistance is necessary, taking on the fight alone is risky. Instead, Canada should collaborate with other nations also eager to challenge U.S. protectionism. There have even been calls for Canada to join the EU.

Canada’s retaliation was effective in sending a political message by hitting Trump’s base where it hurts most, like Wisconsin’s dairy farms, Harley Davidson motorcycles, Florida’s orange juice and Kentucky’s bourbon distilleries. However, by casting too wide a net and a flat 25 per cent tariff on almost all consumer goods, Canada risks causing unnecessary harm to its own consumers.

With Trump pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, Canada now has an opportunity to refine its strategy. Recalibrating its approach — by dropping consumer essentials and focusing on high-impact sectors — could enhance its effectiveness while reducing collateral damage to domestic consumers.

By refining its approach and seeking stronger international alliances, Canada can ensure that its trade policies not only counter U.S. protectionism but also benefit both consumers and exporters in the long run.",theconversation

The average number of subscriptions an American consumer maintains is four and a half, spending nearly US$1,000 a year. The average Canadian household pays for two and a half streaming TV platforms.

As I explore in my new book, Music in Orbit: Satellite Radio in the Streaming Space Age, well before subscriptions became the norm for streaming media, satellite radio companies Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Radio convinced radio listeners to become radio subscribers at the turn of the new millennium.

The companies were marketed as radio beyond radio, expanding the range of channels available to listeners and using celebrities to convince subscribers of the value of these new services.

What is satellite radio?

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

Sirius and XM merged to form SiriusXM in 2008 and it’s now the only satellite radio service available. Satellites are used in a broad array of communications undertakings, but SiriusXM is a unique digital radio service delivered by satellites in the geostationary orbit just over 35,000 kilometres above Earth.

Under media conglomerate Liberty Media, SiriusXM stands as one of a few massive music companies that operate in the internet-streaming-online audio-radio nexus, after having rolled out internet streaming options and purchasing American internet radio company Pandora.

The first attempt to establish satellite radio came from a company named WorldSpace, founded in 1990, which covered areas in Africa, the Middle East, a large part of western Europe, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India and Iran. WorldSpace filed for bankruptcy in 2008.

XM launched the first American digital satellite radio service in September 2001. Sirius followed in early 2002. In 2005, the companies began service in Canada, developing a slate of Canadian music channels and bringing Canadian artists to an international audience by satellite.

When the services launched, the radio industry was focused on change. In 1999, reports claimed that radio was in prime position to take advantage of “the new media age.” With the massive investments in time, research and money that Sirius and XM had put into launching satellites and establishing receivers, industry partnerships, offices and personnel, the two companies were able to capitalize on the theme of change.

From radio listener to radio subscriber

To convince everyday radio listeners that a subscription was worthwhile, the music on satellite radio had to be perceived as exceptional. The new services were said to offer 100 “super-niche” channels, with music formats that could be “splintered to appeal to never-before practical audience niches, thanks to the advantage of serving a nationwide audience, rather than the greatest common denominators in a given locale.”

One XM television commercial from 2002 boasted a “revolutionary new kind of radio that delivers more choice, better sound and coast-to-coast coverage.” After a satellite flashes across outer space, the commercial depicts violins, a jukebox, a grand piano and vinyl records raining down from the sky.

A limited-term free trial subscription for use in the automobile was one way that the satellite radio companies grew subscribers. The aim was to minimize “churn,” the rate of subscription cancellations, and to make use of the ideal sonic space of the car to make satellite radio a part of a listener’s daily life.

Celebrity musicians on air

Another way to entice listeners was to acquire celebrity talent to host shows or brand channels. The most obvious figure here is radio shock jock Howard Stern, who moved to Sirius in 2006 to take advantage of its uncensored subscription format. In the process, Sirius’s subscriber numbers shot up from 600,000 when he first signed on to over six million at the end of 2006.

Many of the on-air hosts from the early days of Sirius and XM were established legacy musicians, like Bob Dylan (Theme Time Radio Hour on the Deep Tracks channel), Tom Petty (the Buried Treasure channel and show by the same name), and B.B. King (B.B. King’s Bluesville).

The E Street Band’s guitarist and Sopranos star “Little Steven” Van Zandt was one of the earliest musician figures on satellite radio, contributing to the long-running Underground Garage channel and working as a creative adviser for Sirius as of 2004.

One profile of Van Zandt’s influence on Sirius’s early days indicates the deep musical knowledge that the satellite company was eager to promote to potential subscribers. When the Outlaw Country channel was being created in 2004, Van Zandt had trouble tracking down music for the channel, suggesting that it was rare and far beyond what a commercial broadcast station would play.

On Theme Time Radio Hour, which ran on XM from 2006 to 2009, Bob Dylan played a wide range of music that had been influential on his own career, telling stories and adding context to the songs he played. In one instance, he celebrated blues guitarist Memphis Minnie through a metaphor of high-quality vintage cars.

Listening to the past

Fascination with new technology and a sense of its prestige, however, existed earlier with the origins of FM radio and its growth.

FM’s association with high-quality sound meant it became associated with other music media, such as stereo and LP records. According to radio historian Christopher H. Sterling, the “cultural awakening” of the later 1950s was important to FM radio and its future in the U.S., one “expressed in increasing public interest in classical music, an interest sparked by the 1958 introduction of stereo recordings.”

FM was also home to the experimental sounds of freeform radio in American in the late 1960s and 1970s, and where early Canadian campus radio stations were first licensed.

Increasing power of few corporations in music

Satellite radio’s trajectory has predicted the cultural, musical and technological shifts that now define the 2020s.

Beyond anticipating the turn to subscription models, satellite radio relied heavily on celebrity musicians on the radio, a strategy that Apple Music has used to drive subscriptions and opened access to a vast amount of uncensored content that today has exploded through the internet and podcasting.

The rise of satellite radio also reflects the increasing power that few corporations have in the music industries, raising questions about the serious problems now facing working musicians and communities.

In 2016, Jan Dawson in Variety said that SiriusXM “probably isn’t the first name that comes to mind when you think about subscription content, yet it’s one of the most successful companies in that category.” SiriusXM developed a subscription model for music listening, the very business model that has become so common in music listening in the 21st century.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Why we shouldn’t let lower fertility rates fuel pronatalist policies,https://theconversation.com/why-we-shouldnt-let-lower-fertility-rates-fuel-pronatalist-policies-250955,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:00:46 GMT","Buried in the Donald Trump administration’s recent avalanche of executive orders in the United States was a starkly revealing provision: A Department of Transportation order requiring projects to prioritize federal highway and transit funding to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average. Those with declining birth and marriage rates could face funding cuts.

In my work as a planetary health researcher, I understand the complex dynamics between reproductive rights, population dynamics and environmental sustainability. This new executive order has me worried.

Accounting for demographic trends is indeed fundamental when planning for a country’s infrastructure and transportation needs. But this executive order has nothing to do with sound infrastructure planning. Rather, it reflects the Trump administration’s ideological shift towards mainstreaming “pronatalist” policies across sectors far beyond reproductive rights and healthcare.

Pronatalism is a political ideology that seeks to increase birth rates with policies that encourage people to have more children. Pronatalism can be motivated by cultural, religious, geopolitical or economic imperatives.

Pronatalist policies can manifest in many ways. These could range from soft measures (such as stigmatizing those who choose not to have children) to hard measures (such as restricting access to contraception.

The global picture

The shift towards pronatalist policy is not unique to the United States.

Worldwide, governments are reacting to demographic shifts with alarm, introducing measures to incentivize childbirth. However, these measures fail to acknowledge that the global population is actually still increasing.

For example, Poland and South Korea both offer cash transfers for babies. Russia revived the Stalin-era “Mother Heroine” award for women who have 10 children in less than 10 years. China has replaced its anti-natalist “one-child policy” with an aggressive pronatalist regime — clamping down on vasectomies and tracking menstrual cycles.

Until recently, high infant and child mortality rates meant having many children was essential for maintaining stable populations. But advances in healthcare, sanitation and living standards have significantly reduced mortality rates. This has caused a decline in fertility rates which has reshaped the role of reproduction in modern societies.

Yet many countries view this demographic shift with concern. These fears are largely rooted in cultural, economic and political motivations — fuelling a rise in pronatalist policies globally.

But population policies that prioritize demographic targets over reproductive autonomy — a person’s power to make their own reproductive choices — have repeatedly led to devastating consequences.

For example, until 1989, Romania’s communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu enforced strict pronatalist policies. Abortions were banned, contraception was restricted and women were subjected to invasive pregnancy surveillance. Those without children faced punitive taxation. These measures led to a surge in unsafe abortions, high maternal mortality, overcrowded orphanages and lasting social trauma.

Pronatalist policies also seem to go against what most people want. Across cultures and religions, people overwhelmingly seek to control their fertility when given the choice. Research also shows that when women have access to education and contraception, they tend to choose smaller families.

Alarmist narratives about falling fertility rates distract from a more personal reality as well: that half of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended. Pronatalist policies thus appear to go against the advancement of reproductive autonomy.

Pronatalist narratives also undermine efforts to reduce humanity’s impact on the environment. Population size and growth are both major drivers of environmental degradation and climate change.

Embracing the lower fertility rates we’re seeing could help drive transformative changes needed to ease pressure on natural resources, shrink greenhouse gas emissions and ensure a more sustainable future.

Lower fertility rates in context

The world’s population is expected to grow by an additional two billion people in the coming decades. But we don’t actually know how many people the planet can sustainably support. Its carrying capacity is not a fixed measure. It’s contingent upon technological advancements, consumption patterns, economic structures and the ever-evolving interactions between humans and the environment.

Some ecological economists have even calculated that in order for everyone to have a reasonable standard of living, a truly sustainable global population would be around around 3.2 billion people. Although these estimates are far from certain, what’s clear is that a smaller global population would improve our chances to restore balance.

The fear of population decline and push for pronatalist policies obscures the critical fact that we have yet to address the consequences of the rapid population growth we’ve experienced since the 1950s. Environmental degradation and climate change have both been driven in large part by this rapid growth.

A major argument pronatalists use is that a shrinking population will lead to economic decline. This reasoning is outdated — rooted in economic models that assume perpetual growth and ignore ever-pressing planetary boundaries. While it’s clear that an ageing society presents challenges, lower birth rates don’t necessarily mean lower living standards. On the contrary, a smaller population can be conducive to labour productivity and fairer wealth distribution.

The past two centuries of explosive economic and population growth were an anomaly in human history. The idea that we must endlessly expand is a modern fiction — not a historical norm. We’re now entering “the age of depopulation” — a period characterized by lower fertility levels, and, in time, population decline. We must prepare and embrace this shift instead of trying to reverse it.",theconversation

https://theconversation.com,Journal indexation: The misconception of guaranteed quality,https://theconversation.com/journal-indexation-the-misconception-of-guaranteed-quality-250829,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 02:01:31 GMT","Higher education institutions and research institutes are no strangers to commercial scientific journal indexers such as Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). These platforms serve as primary benchmarks for academic success and research performance evaluation. Within the scientific community, indexers function as a credibility currency for research’s perceived prestige and reliability.

This requirement has led to the misconception that indexation equates to research quality — while it does not necessarily guarantee high-quality research.

The indexation process merely demonstrates compliance with administrative requirements set by indexers. These include a peer review system, transparent editorial policies, and properly structured metadata or supporting data.

In other words, journal indexation alone cannot serve as the sole metric for research performance. Instead, evaluation systems should prioritise impact-driven indicators.

Journal indexation vs research quality

There are many factors that contribute to research quality, including the compatibility between the research question and the chosen methodology, the integrity and transparency of the research process, and the accessibility of data or supplementary research materials (such as datasets, methods of analysis, and research logs). Peer review processes typically evaluate these aspects.

Take Nature journal, for example. This prestigious publication retracted an article titled A Specific Amyloid-ß Protein Assembly in the Brain Impairs Memory in 2024 after it was proven that the lead researcher had manipulated images. Unfortunately, before the retraction, the article had already been cited 2,375 times and accessed by more than 74,000 readers.

According to the indexer Web of Science, Nature has an impact factor of 50.5 and is classified in journal quartile Q1 (18.51) in the ScimagoJR indexer (Scopus) under the multidisciplinary category.

Despite being widely regarded as a reputable reference, bibliometric indicators — statistical analyses of published books and articles — have inherent limitations.

For instance, the impact factor only measures the average number of citations per article in a journal over the past two years. However, citation distribution is often uneven — while some articles receive many citations, others may receive none. As a result, the impact factor does not necessarily reflect the overall quality of all published articles in a given journal.

The misconception impacts

This misconception about journal quality has negatively affected the academic climate, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia. Many policies prioritise the quantity of publications and citation rates over research quality.

As a result, policymakers in higher education and research direct academics to focus on topics with global appeal to increase their chances of publication in indexed journals recognised by international indexing institutions.

Regrettably, this trend often leads to the neglect of local social and humanities issues, such as environmental sustainability and community-based problems, which are considered less appealing to an international audience.

The pressure to publish in indexed journals also increases the risk of unethical academic practices. Misconduct such as plagiarism, data fabrication, and ‘salami slicing’ — the practice of splitting a single study into multiple smaller papers to inflate publication counts — has become more prevalent. In fact, paper mills—cartels of publishing companies that sell fabricated scientific articles — are a documented issue.

These practices not only damage researchers’ credibility but also undermine the integrity of the academic community as a whole. As publicly funded institutions, universities and research institutes must prioritise disseminating inclusive and impactful knowledge to society.

What are the alternatives?

Research quality appraisal requires a more inclusive and holistic paradigm to counter the negative effects of indexation-based performance evaluation. Several global science initiatives advocate for such changes, including the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), launched in 2012, the Leiden Manifesto in 2021, and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (COARA) in 2023.

Reforming academic policies at both institutional and national levels is crucial to fostering a thriving research ecosystem. Relevant ministries must promote evaluation systems that prioritise research impact, while bibliometric indicators should serve as complementary rather than primary assessment tools.

Governments and academic institutions can also offer incentives for research that addresses strategic national issues rather than focusing solely on indexation standards.

Additionally, academic institutions should enhance capacity-building programmes for journal editors and researchers, including training in academic writing and editorial management. This approach can help local journals meet international standards while retaining their unique identity.

Transparency is equally vital. One concrete step is facilitating researchers’ storage of raw data and related materials in the National Scientific Repository (RIN), ensuring public accessibility.

Scientific articles undergoing peer review can also be shared as pre-prints, allowing the public to read and provide feedback. For publicly funded research, adhering to transparency principles demonstrates the researcher’s accountability to the society that finances their work.

While journal indexation improves the accessibility of scientific articles, it should not be the sole performance metric — let alone a measure of research quality. Relying on bibliometric indicators as a ‘shortcut’ for performance appraisal could ultimately reduce the research’s relevance and societal impact in Indonesia.

Estão batendo à nossa porta. Ainda assim, continuam pegando a maioria das pessoas despreparadas. Especialmente no Brasil, onde segundo o Censo de 2022 16 milhões vivem em favelas e comunidades urbanas, e o número de moradores em áreas de risco mais do que dobrou nos últimos dez anos. Também em 2022, o país liderou a movimentação interna das Américas por conta de tragédias ambientais, e no ano seguinte teve um número recorde de desastres geo-hidrológicos.

Ainda que a proliferação de desastres seja realidade em todo o mundo, as pessoas e as regiões não são afetadas da mesma forma. Um exemplo disso está no afastamento das pessoas com deficiência dos debates sobre o enfrentamento dos efeitos das mudanças climáticas.

E esse distanciamento é atribuído ao chamado capacitismo ambiental, que se caracteriza pela discriminação das pessoas com deficiência nas atividades de ativismo ambiental e nos fóruns de planejamento para o enfrentamento de desastres causados pelas mudanças climáticas. O que resulta no acesso limitado a informações, recursos e serviços especificamente destinados a essas pessoas.

Ao materializar barreiras físicas, tecnológicas, atitudinais, comunicacionais e informacionais, impede-se o acesso aos artigos de emergência, à informação relevante, à assistência e aos espaços adequados e seguros. A pauta da justiça climática tem tratado pessoas com deficiência como parte de um estrato populacional vulnerável, em vez de discutir a marginalização e a exclusão impostas a essas pessoas; e tem produzido soluções que supõem que toda a população conta com redes de apoio sólidas (o que não procede).

É desumano aguardar passivamente os eventos climáticos esperados sem considerar as pessoas com deficiência, inclusive porque são expostas a maiores riscos nos desastres. A taxa de mortalidade de pessoas com deficiência durante o grande terremoto do leste do Japão, por exemplo, foi duas vezes maior do que a observada entre seus pares sem deficiência. Além disso, questões adjacentes à saúde, como falta de acesso a medicamentos, ameaça no quadro de saúde mental e possíveis agravamentos funcionais são desconsiderados nos protocolos de enfrentamento aos desastres climáticos.

A capacidade de evacuação imediata da pessoa com deficiência e suas famílias é bem menor, assim como a probabilidade de sua remoção antes do desastre. As barreiras dificultam ou impedem os processos de desocupação, já limitados pela profunda exclusão social que marca suas vidas. Apesar disso, recebem menos assistência pós-desastres e são excluídas dos planos de reconstrução e recuperação. São pessoas privadas de apoio social formal e informal, críticos para o enfrentamento desse tipo de situação.

Mas quem são as pessoas com deficiência?

De acordo com dados da Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) de 2022, 16% da população mundial têm deficiência, ou seja, 1,3 bilhão de pessoas, e 80% dessas estão concentradas no Sul Global (mais de um bilhão de pessoas). Os estigmas que prevalecem sobre as vidas das pessoas com deficiência têm permitido que aquelas sem deficiência naturalizem sua invisibilização, mesmo em face da maior vulnerabilidade e da crescente frequência desses desastres. É comum a mídia mostrar carros com a porta submersa por enchentes, porém não são retratadas pessoas com mobilidade em cadeiras de rodas com a água na altura do pescoço.

A inexistência de piso tátil e audiodescrição, Libras, linguagem simples, comunicação alternativa, elevadores e rampas adequadas impede a participação das pessoas com deficiência nos debates e, também, obstaculiza sua proteção nos desastres. São barreiras naturalizadas, posto ser essa uma população histórica e perenemente subalternizada que tem sido impedida de nascer (no caso das políticas de aborto eugênicos de pessoas com síndrome de Down), de maternar com segurança (considerando o despreparo dos serviços de saúde para o cuidado perinatal inclusivo), de sobreviver (em função da não prioridade ao acesso a recursos de suporte à vida por parte de pessoas com deficiência na pandemia de Covid-19), e tem sua esterilização e institucionalização à revelia, para citar alguns exemplos.

A desconsideração da desigualdade e da vulnerabilidade historicamente constituídas joga luz sobre os limites dos planos de enfretamento majoritariamente apoiados na resiliência individual. Portanto, não são considerados o acesso, a acessibilidade e a interdependência, característica humana naturalizada apenas para a parcela sem deficiência da humanidade. O enfrentamento dos desastres ambientais e a proposta de fortalecimento da resposta do Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) teriam que focar nas ações em nível comunitário, levando em conta condições sociais e materiais mais amplas.

Não haverá um sistema de resposta às mudanças climáticas inclusivo enquanto não se considerar a experiência corporificada das pessoas com deficiência de todas as naturezas. É urgente deslindar as estruturas que encurralam pessoas com deficiência e familiares, deixando-as morrer nos desastres ambientais. Sem a participação plena não será possível entender os mecanismos de marginalização e exclusão, e nem avançar na valorização e na preservação da diversidade humana e de seus princípios mais básicos, como o direito à vida. A necessidade de reparação é evidenciada nos dados de exclusão social das pessoas com deficiência da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (Pnad) de 2022 e pela ausência de informações sobre a vitimização de pessoas com deficiência nos cada vez mais frequentes e devastadores desastres ambientais em solo nacional.

Somente no Brasil, quase 19 milhões de pessoas estão com o seu direito à vida ameaçado. O Estado brasileiro, a comunidade científica e os movimentos em defesa da justiça climática precisam se aproximar da população com deficiência para construir, conjuntamente, alternativas de enfrentamento à crise climática e estratégias para o reconhecimento de sua existência em planos, protocolos e diretrizes sobre o tema.

E a resposta pode estar logo debaixo de nossos pés.

Enterradas no subsolo estão rochas, muitas rochas, e elas são antigas. Para paleontólogos como nós, elas são um vasto arquivo da vida no passado da Terra. Em particular, elas podem nos dizer como a vida na Terra se saiu durante períodos em que o clima esquentou repentinamente. Nosso novo estudo mostrou que as plantas foram gravemente afetadas, e as florestas levaram milhões de anos para se recuperar.

Cerca de 252 milhões de anos atrás mais de 80% das espécies marinhas foram extintas. Esse fenômeno é conhecido como a extinção em massa do final do Permiano, provavelmente a crise climática mais significativa desde o surgimento dos primeiros animais, há mais de 555 milhões de anos. Parece que o principal culpado foi a enorme quantidade de gases de efeito estufa indutores de aquecimento liberados por vulcões em uma região conhecida como os “Trapps Siberianos”, na Rússia.

Marcos Amores

As evidências sugerem que as plantas podem não ter sofrido uma extinção em massa, mas suas comunidades foram fortemente afetadas, se não destruídas completamente. Embora o calor extremo tenha levado plantas e animais a ultrapassar seus limites de tolerância, eles provavelmente também enfrentaram secas mortais, destruição da camada de ozônio, incêndios florestais generalizados e contaminação por metais pesados tóxicos.

Há muitos dados sobre como as plantas se saíram após a extinção do final do Permiano, mas pouco se sabe sobre aquelas localizadas em latitudes mais altas, onde era mais frio. Ecossistemas prósperos existiam em latitudes polares naquela época, auxiliados por uma região polar praticamente sem gelo. No entanto, no evento do final do Permiano, esse ecossistema foi totalmente eliminado.

Nosso trabalho examinou rochas e fósseis da região de Sydney, na Austrália, que estava localizada perto do polo sul por pelo menos 8 milhões de anos após a pior extinção em massa da história da Terra. Esses registros bem preservados e de longo prazo fornecem uma janela para o processo de recuperação das comunidades de plantas mais distantes da fonte do problema.

O longo e instável caminho de recuperação

Os fósseis de plantas nessas rochas australianas mostram que as coníferas, como os pinheiros e ciprestes modernos, foram algumas das primeiras a colonizar a Terra imediatamente após a calamidade. No entanto, a recuperação para voltarem a ser florestas verdejantes não foi tranquila.

Descobrimos que temperaturas ainda mais altas, 2 milhões de anos após o evento do final do período Permiano, causaram o colapso dessas coníferas sobreviventes. Elas, por sua vez, foram substituídas por plantas resistentes e arbustivas que lembram os modernos clubmosses (como Isoetes). Não se sabe o quão quente ficou em Sydney, mas esse período escaldante durou cerca de 700.000 anos e tornou a vida difícil para as árvores e outras plantas grandes.

Amores et al. 2025, GSA Bulletin

Quando as condições finalmente esfriaram, plantas grandes, porém incomuns, que se pareciam com samambaias, mas produziam sementes como as coníferas, floresceram e estabeleceram florestas mais estáveis em Sydney. Essa recuperação levou menos de 100.000 anos para acontecer. Essas plantas acabaram dominando a paisagem por milhões de anos, abrindo caminho para as florestas exuberantes durante a era mesozóica dos dinossauros.

Assim, depois de milhões de anos, os ecossistemas florestais do Mesozoico passaram a se parecer com os ecossistemas de antes do evento do final do Permiano. Mas o mais importante é que as espécies de plantas que compunham as novas florestas eram completamente diferentes.

O termo “recuperação” pode ser enganoso. As florestas acabam se recuperando, mas a extinção de espécies individuais é para sempre.

Ao compreender como os ecossistemas vegetais antigos resistiram a oscilações climáticas extremas, nós, como pesquisadores, esperamos aprender lições valiosas sobre como as plantas e os ecossistemas modernos podem lidar (ou não) com a crise climática atual. Com esse conhecimento, podemos informar os formuladores de políticas sobre o que ainda está por vir e ajudar a orientar uma rota que evite os piores resultados climáticos durante o maior período de tempo possível.

Os registros fósseis, portanto, acrescentam uma perspectiva de longo prazo orientada por dados às escolhas climáticas que fazemos hoje. Ecossistemas dependem de um equilíbrio frágil, sendo as plantas a espinha dorsal das redes alimentares terrestres e reguladoras do clima.

Os fósseis falaram: a perturbação desses sistemas pode ter consequências que duram centenas de milhares de anos. Portanto, proteger os ecossistemas atuais é mais importante do que nunca.",theconversation

Vance : fracture au sein du monde catholique,https://theconversation.com/pape-francois-vs-j-d-vance-fracture-au-sein-du-monde-catholique-251695,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:46:14 GMT","L’actuel vice-président des États-Unis, converti au catholicisme en 2019, promeut une vision profondément conservatrice et identitaire de sa foi, et rejette avec virulence les orientations universalistes du pape François. Ce clivage, accentué par les tensions entre le Vatican et l’administration Trump, est révélateur d’une fracture au sein de la communauté des catholiques, déjà profondément divisée.

Juste avant son hospitalisation mi-février dernier, le pape François (88 ans) a fait parvenir à l’épiscopat états-unien une lettre dénonçant la politique d’expulsions massives de migrants lancée par la nouvelle administration de Washington. Un mouvement d’indignation œcuménique, composé de responsables et d’activistes catholiques, presbytériens, évangéliques, épiscopaliens, a commencé à prendre forme aux États-Unis. Vingt-sept groupes religieux ont également décidé de déposer des plaintes communes contre l’inconstitutionnalité des décrets présidentiels.

Pendant tout ce temps, J. D. Vance, nouveau vice-président des États-Unis, qui fait sans cesse référence à sa foi – il est un converti catholique zélé –, égrenait sa vision du monde dans des prises de parole abruptes, justifiant systématiquement les décisions de Donald Trump en matière de traque des migrants illégaux et de refoulement des réfugiés, saluant également la fin de l’USAID et la « lutte globale pour les droits exclusifs des croyants ».

Appelant à « la guerre finale contre le globalisme libéral et décadent », dont le continent européen serait devenu l’épicentre voire le cloaque, il s’en est aussi pris avec véhémence au président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky… tandis que la secrétairerie d’État du Vatican, elle, prenait fermement position en faveur des droits de l’Ukraine.

Comparaison n’est pas raison. Cependant, en matière de communication et d’image, celle du vieux pape en souffrance en vis-à-vis de l’impitoyable vice-président états-unien est saisissante : elle donne à voir le fossé qui s’est creusé dans les positionnements pastoraux, théologiques, politiques et « internationaux » du catholicisme contemporain.

Deux catholicismes en chiens de faïence

Très diminué par sa pneumonie, François incarne sans le vouloir une autorité pontificale littéralement à bout de souffle. Déjà, sa santé fragile a entraîné par le passé un vide décisionnel à la tête des dicastères (c’est-à-dire l’ensemble des administrations du Vatican), le ralentissement des affaires courantes et l’inachèvement de la réforme destinée à améliorer l’organisation de la cCurie romaine (l’organe central du gouvernement de l’Église catholique).

Sa fin de règne coïncide avec la visibilité de plus en plus forte d’un antimodèle pontifical incarné par J. D. Vance, héraut du national-populisme états-unien, portant sa foi infaillible en bandoulière tout en piétinant la solidarité des démocraties occidentales.

Face à François, une contestation multiforme s’est dressée. Elle a construit sa propre cohérence, précédée historiquement par une querelle jamais éteinte dans les pays occidentaux entre catholiques de conservation et catholiques d’accommodement, les premiers devenant de plus en plus audibles au fur et à mesure de la désaffection sociétale du catholicisme.

Cette contestation s’est également nourrie des dysfonctionnements de l’institution (médiatisation des révélations d’abus sexuels, détournements financiers, compromissions) et des orientations parfois brouillonnes que ce pape a cherché à impulser. En chemin, François a été rendu responsable de la fracture en cours.

Tandis qu’il tentait d’imprimer de grandes lignes, susceptibles sur le plan théologique et pastoral de rassembler l’ensemble des conférences épiscopales et de redonner une identité commune à une communauté de plus en plus disparate, un ensemble réactif et identitaire, mêlant « gardiens du Temple » et idéologues illibéraux, s’est consolidé à grands cris contre lui, et a pris l’ascendant médiatique, numérique et intellectuel.

Un temps, un des combats de cette coalition a été de « juger le pape pour hérésie » (2019). François s’est vu reprocher ses « errements » doctrinaux et pastoraux au profit d’idées « gauchistes » et « anticatholiques ».

Le catholicisme identitaire appelle à revenir aux « fondamentaux » en espérant réécrire l’avenir de l’Église en même temps que l’avenir de l’ordre politique occidental. J. D. Vance incarne pleinement cette frange conquérante, car c’est aux États-Unis (terre de prédilection de l’engagement religieusement inspiré) que ce catholicisme, redéfini par certains de ses théologiens comme « intégraliste », a ressuscité de ses cendres européennes.

Un pontificat brouillon

Ce catholicisme intégraliste a eu d’autant plus l’opportunité de se développer que le pontificat de François s’est exposé aux critiques ; même si, parmi les sujets qui ont écorné la réputation de l’Église catholique, certains ne découlaient pas de sa responsabilité. Ce sont sa gouvernance et sa politique diplomatique qui ont laissé à désirer, provoquant contestations et incompréhensions.

L’articulation et la coordination au sein et entre les différentes « administrations » (dicastères) ont été questionnées, notamment en raison des changements insufflés au sein de la curie par le souverain pontife. De surcroît, le pape a semblé favoriser, dans l’exhortation apostolique Amoris Laetitia (2016), une dynamique centrifuge, en reconnaissant que « tous les débats doctrinaux, moraux ou pastoraux ne devaient pas être tranchés par des interventions magistérielles », c’est-à-dire les siennes.

Comme l’écrit François Mabille, cette approche met en tension le pouvoir doctrinal du pape dans son rapport aux différentes conférences épiscopales et sur le sujet précis de la guerre des valeurs, et elle le dessert indéniablement dans l’exercice de son leadership.

En outre, la cohérence de la diplomatie du Vatican est devenue de plus en plus compliquée à assurer, du fait de la quantité des canaux utilisés, de leur dissonance potentielle (le pape, la secrétairerie d’État et son réseau diplomatique, les ONG internationales accréditées, les réseaux informels, etc.) et de la multiplication des causes défendues.

Diplomates du Saint-Siège et ONG catholiques sont occupés, dans les instances internationales, tantôt par la défense de droits humains spécifiques, droits confondus avec la dignité de la personne selon la doctrine catholique ; tantôt par la cause de la paix entre États ou entre groupes en conflit ; tantôt par les nouvelles causes planétaires à imposer à tous les horizons diplomatiques, comme le respect de l’environnement ou la régulation globale de l’immigration ; tantôt, enfin, par les rencontres œcuméniques ou interreligieuses qui se transforment en diplomatie alternative – tant François pense que la médiatisation du dialogue entre responsables religieux est une méthode « infaillible » pour calmer les populations et dénouer les tensions, en pleine époque d’intolérance mutuelle.

La promotion du dialogue (notamment du dialogue islamo-chrétien qui a connu sous ce pontificat quelques grandes avancées) n’est cependant pas exempte de manipulations étatiques. Avec le début de la guerre en Ukraine et face à Moscou et à l’Église russe orthodoxe, cette approche idéaliste a trouvé un démenti assez cinglant.

Finalement, le souci des bonnes relations avec les États, quels qu’ils soient, même « les plus infréquentables », pour assurer l’existence publique de l’Église catholique et les droits de ses fidèles en toute situation, n’a pas échappé non plus à la critique, brouillant les lignes éthiques, comme le montre l’exemple du rapprochement très contesté de la secrétairerie d’État avec le régime chinois qui n’a, pour l’instant, pas apporté plus de sécurité aux Chinois catholiques.

Concernant son souci de l’humanité, le pape a cherché à « réinventer » des positions de principe avec un tropisme « sudiste » très marqué, c’est-à-dire qu’il a appelé indistinctement les catholiques et la communauté internationale à s’engager en faveur des exclus du monde, écrasés par la misère économique et l’insécurité. Aller aux périphéries, faire preuve de solidarité, dénoncer « la mondialisation de l’indifférence » s’accompagne d’un parti pris pour la justice sociale – expression contemporaine de l’ordo amoris (ordre de charité).

François estime que cette multitude d’êtres humains oubliés, dont le migrant est aujourd’hui l’emblème, mérite une coopération interétatique plus active. Il exprime cette revendication dans l’encyclique Fratelli Tutti sous le nom de « gouvernance mondiale éthique ».

L’impact contrasté de ses propres prises de parole médiatiques, ses échecs de médiation (à part Cuba et la République centrafricaine), ses erreurs de jugement sur la guerre en Ukraine ou la guerre civile syrienne, ses choix de déplacement « non conventionnels » (le dernier en date étant la Corse, quelques jours après la réouverture de Notre-Dame de Paris à laquelle François n’a pas assisté) ont dérouté les observateurs. Seule sa position relative au Proche-Orient, inlassablement attentive au sort des populations libanaise et palestinienne, n’a pas varié.

Un catholicisme états-unien « hors les murs »

Dans les pays occidentaux, des segments de plus en plus importants de croyants catholiques ont manifesté leur rejet à l’égard de chacun des grands enjeux du pontificat de François : le dialogue avec l’islam, la mobilisation pour l’écologie dans l’encyclique Laudato si’ (2015), la défense des migrants et plus récemment l’opposition aux populismes conservateurs et la défense de la démocratie, qui a été assez tardive et peu fréquente.

La grille de lecture Nord-Sud du pape et le caractère globalement anti-occidental de son approche – au sens d’un Occident dominateur, capitaliste et libertaire – n’a pas recoupé l’autre critique anti-occidentale pourtant assez proche, que les catholiques conservateurs ont commencé à développer. Ils dénoncent en effet un Occident gouverné par des élites libérales, sans conscience, préoccupées de futilités comme la lutte contre les discriminations envers la communauté LGBT, à genoux devant les radicaux « woke ’ et les droits des immigrés, « bêlant leur droit-de-l’hommisme au lieu de défendre les intérêts de leurs peuples ».

Toute la droite chrétienne américaine, nourrie en arguments par ces catholiques, s’est construite sur leur opposition à la pastorale inclusive du pape (migrants, pauvres, homosexuels) qui aurait plutôt dû, selon eux, effectuer un rappel intransigeant de la doctrine et des normes. Ils ont contribué à la fronde états-unienne qui a pris l’exact contre-pied des positions du pape et ils ont, à plus de 60 %, voté pour Donald Trump à la présidentielle de 2024.

Après l’investiture de Trump, J. D. Vance n’a pas hésité à dénoncer les errements du pape et de l’épiscopat américain sur la question de l’immigration et à justifier le refoulement des migrants illégaux selon son interprétation théologique de l’ordo amoris. Il n’a pas non plus hésité à accuser les évêques américains de vénalité quand ils ont protesté contre la suspension de l’immunité d’asile des églises dans la traque des clandestins, et contre la suspension des aides fédérales aux associations et diocèses qui assument entièrement la prise en charge des migrants et des réfugiés, ainsi que contre le démantèlement d’USAID.

On le voit : le chemin de la dépolarisation catholique n’est pas près de s’ouvrir. Donald Trump a émis un décret pour éradiquer « les biais antichrétiens » des agences gouvernementales en instaurant une « task force » au sein du département de la justice. Vance a repris cette idée à l’international. Le prochain pape ne pourra pas faire l’impasse sur cette fracture parcourant la mobilisation catholique. Elle risque de se transformer en implosion ecclésiale.",theconversation
https://undark.org,Federal Science Hamstrung by DOGE’s Credit Card Spending Limit,https://undark.org/2025/03/11/federal-science-hamstrung-doge/,"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Last month, President Donald Trump’s administration placed a $1 spending limit on most government-issued credit cards that federal employees use to cover travel and work expenses. The impacts are already widely felt.

At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists aren’t able to order equipment used to repair ships and radars. At the Food and Drug Administration, laboratories are experiencing delays in ordering basic supplies. At the National Park Service, employees are canceling trips to oversee crucial maintenance work. And at the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Aviation Administration, employees worry that mission-critical projects could be stalled. In many cases, employees are already unable to carry out the basic functions of their job.

“The longer this disruption lasts, the more the system will break,” said a USDA official who was granted anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media about the looming crisis.

A researcher at the National Institutes of Health who tests new vaccines and treatments in rodents said he has had to put experiments on hold; his lab is not able to get certain necessary materials, such as antibodies, which are needed to assess immune response. “We have animals here that are aging that will pretty soon be too old to work with,” said the researcher, who requested anonymity as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the agency. Young mice and rats that are 6 to 8 weeks old are typically used for drug and vaccine studies, but some of the animals in their lab have now aged out of that window and may have to be euthanized.

They say NIH workers have been using internal listservs to ask for reagents (chemicals or other substances used in laboratory experiments) and equipment from other buildings or institutions to try to compensate for shortages, but they’re not always able to track down what they need. The NIH is made up of 27 institutes and centers, and its Bethesda, Maryland campus is spread across more than 75 buildings. “Sometimes you need something that’s really niche, and you’re just not going to find it from someone else on campus,” the researcher said.

The change comes as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to hunt for alleged examples of waste across the federal government. Late last month, DOGE announced that it was working to “simplify” the government’s largest credit card program, which issues GSA SmartPay travel and purchase cards for federal employees. On Feb. 26, the agency claimed about 24,000 cards had been deactivated.

The credit card program allows federal workers to bypass the typical procurement process required to buy goods and services. A 2002 report from the Department of Commerce said that, “by avoiding the formal procurement process, GSA estimates the annual savings to be $1.2 billion.” It also enables federal employees to avoid paying sales tax on expenses that the government is exempt from.

At the FDA, labs that analyze samples to ensure that food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics are safe and meet regulatory standards are already facing shortages. “While we are always acutely aware of when Congress’ funding is going to run out, we are able to order supplies to keep things going in the lab. This abrupt ending felt like the rug was being pulled out from under us,” said an employee at the FDA who requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak with the media.

The employee recently placed an order for pipette tips, an essential laboratory supply, but found that order was put on hold. “Now we are running out, asking colleagues at other offices to share what they might not be using,” they told WIRED.

In addition, workers say FDA labs now have to go through a lengthy process to order liquid nitrogen, which is used to keep ultra-cold freezers running. These freezers preserve samples of cells and other biological material that reflect years, and sometimes decades, of research. Delays in getting liquid nitrogen tanks could destroy that material. Previously, new tanks could usually be acquired the same day as putting in a request. Now, it takes a week or so to receive a tank after initiating a request.

“This abrupt ending felt like the rug was being pulled out from under us.”

An employee at the Environmental Protection Agency said her facility is not able to place regular orders of liquid nitrogen at the moment. “We have dozens of these freezers full of important environmental samples that are imminently at risk of being lost because we can no longer get our regular shipments of liquid nitrogen,” said the employee, who requested anonymity. These samples are used as part of research on detection and remediation methods for chemicals such as PFAS, which are found in many products and break down very slowly over time.

“Scientists are being forced to jerry-rig the connection points on these freezers to accept pressures of liquid nitrogen they were not designed to handle,” the employee said. “Divisions are resorting to bartering with each other to obtain needed items.”

The FDA and EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

The credit card freeze also means that federal researchers who were working on scientific manuscripts can’t pay journal fees, meaning they can’t submit their work to certain journals for publication.

An employee at a federal forensics lab told WIRED that spending limits mean the lab is no longer able to pay to ship evidence back to agents, effectively halting its ability to do casework. Before a case goes to trial, defendants have the right to access and review evidence that the prosecution intends to use against them, which includes access to the evidence in their case. Defendants are able to send that evidence to an outside lab for analysis if they choose. “Cases can’t progress until we return the evidence,” said the forensics lab worker, who asked to remain anonymous. “I basically can’t do my job right now.”

NIH employees were told that travel cards could not be used at all for 30 days, forcing scientists to cancel plans to attend a major infectious disease conference next week. USDA employees at the Pest Identification Technology Laboratory have stockpiled reagents used for molecular tests in advance of the spending limits, according to the USDA official.

FAA employees who travel to work on and test aviation systems worry the credit card freeze will prevent them from completing their projects. “We are allowed to use our personal cards in emergencies but none of us trust them to pay us back now,” said one employee.

The impacts have hit the National Park Service as well. One employee was poised to go on a trip to oversee road maintenance at a national monument when the change went into effect on February 20. “Unless I want to pay for it myself, I can’t go. I can’t pay for my hotel, my rental car, fuel for the car. Now I can’t carry out the mission,” the employee said. “Today, instead of focusing on other work, I’m focused on three different contingencies on how to handle this. Do I go? Do I call my engineering team and tell them to reschedule? And if so, when? The project is on an indefinite hold.”

A memo written to staff at the National Park Service specified that “all travel that is NOT related to national security, public safety, or immigration enforcement should be canceled if it begins on Wednesday, February 26, through the end of March 2025.” A long-term decision on the travel policy, it said, will come “at a later date.” Some NPS staffers were able to travel in February despite not getting official clearance. They have now been told no travel will be allowed in March. To date, roughly 75 trips have been canceled or rescheduled, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The National Park Service did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

“Instead of focusing on other work, I’m focused on three different contingencies on how to handle this. Do I go? Do I call my engineering team and tell them to reschedule? And if so, when? The project is on an indefinite hold.”

Some government employees say they were given a warning prior to the change being announced on February 20. “We went out and bought cases and cases of toilet paper the night before,” another current employee at the National Park Service said. “There’s a general acknowledgement that things are going to break.”

That employee works in the Pacific West Region, which manages federal land in California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada, as well as parks in Arizona, Montana, Guam, and American Samoa. While the GSA did allow for the possibility of exceptions to the clamp-down, the employee claims there are only four purchase cards with spending limits above $1 available for the entire region.

Some of these parks pay for services like internet and wireless on purchase cards — leaving staffers wondering if their work devices could soon be cut off. “Before someone can fix a bathroom a work order has to be issued,” the current employee explains. “That happens electronically. Like any business, we rely on email, Teams, and chat to get things done.”

“There’s a general acknowledgement that things are going to break.”

The spending limits reflect Musk’s belief in zero-based budgeting. After he purchased Twitter, he slashed the budget to zero and forced employees to justify every expense. He also froze people’s corporate credit cards.

“With the Twitter pausing of payments, at some point we were in a meeting at 1 a.m. on a Saturday, and it was like, ‘Hey, let’s turn the credit cards off to see what bounces, and what happens,’” explained angel investor Jason Calacanis on the “All In” podcast in February. (Calacanis was part of Musk’s transition team at Twitter.) “And of course, we started getting calls […] The people who come first, they’re probably the ones who are in on the biggest grift.”

Employees see it a different way. “There are so many controls in place to make sure fraud doesn’t happen,” alleges the current NPS staffer. “I honestly believe the only fraud occurring is being committed by Musk, [Russell] Vought, and [Donald] Trump.”
